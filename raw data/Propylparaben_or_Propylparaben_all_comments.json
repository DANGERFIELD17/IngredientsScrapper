    "body": "I've copy/pasted this text multiple times now and decided to just make a separate post about it (and I admit I want to be lazy and just post a link instead of repeatedly copy/pasting a comment). Some of you may recognize a good portion of this, but I've added some points because I'm trying to make this post as comprehensive as possible.\n\nIn order to determine whether a product is water-based or silicone-based, you have to look at the ingredients. -Cone/-methicone, and -siloxane words near the top of the list tend to signal a silicone-based product. Water will be at the top of the list for any liquid product because water makes it liquidy. It doesn't mean that a product is water-based. Without water, the product would not be spreadable/blendable. For example:\n\nMAKE UP FOR EVER HD Microperfecting Primer Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Aqua (Water), **Dimethicone**, **Trisiloxane**, PEG-12 **Dimethicone**, **Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone** Crosspolymer, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Squalane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Lauryl PEG/PPG-18/18 Methicone, Phenoxyethanol, Ceteth-10, Laureth-4, Ethylglycerin, Panthenol, Potassium Sorbate, Polysorbate 60, Parfum (Fragrance), Argania Spinosa Extract (Argania Spinosa Kernel Extract), C12-14 Pareth-12, Hydrolyzed Algin, Dodecene, Sorbitan Isostearate, Isostearyl Alcohol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Tromethamine, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. [CI 19140 (Yellow 5 Lake), CI 75470 (Carmine), CI 77007 (Ultramarines), CI 77288 (Chromium Oxide Greens), CI 77289 (Chromium Hydroxide Green), CI 77491 (Iron Oxides), CI 77492 (Iron Oxides), CI 77499 (Iron Oxides), CI 77742 (Manganese Violet), CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide)].\n\nSee the bold words? Definitely silicone-based! Again, the water keeps it a more liquid-y consistency so it's easily spreadable. It doesn't mean that the product is water-based. Particularly with primers, I can always tell because it has that \"silicone\" feeling. Now let's look at a water-based primer:\n\nLaura Mercier Foundation Primer - Oil Free Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Isodecyl Isononanoate, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, C22-20 Alcohols, Squalane, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Esters, Phenoxyethanol, Boron Nitride, Silica, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Allantoin Tocopherol Acetate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hamaelis Viginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Cucumis sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Retinyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Polyamino Sugar Condesate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Chlorphensin, Benzoic Acid, Polysorbate 60, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Saccharomyces/Xylium Black Tea Ferment, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Potassium Sorbate, Green 5 (CI 61570), Yellow 5 (CI 19140).\n\nSee how there are no -cone/-methicone or -siloxane words near the top of the list? That means that it's water-based. This primer does contain dimethicone, which is a silicone, but it's relatively low on the list, which means that it contains a very small amount of silicone (ingredients are typically listed in order, beginning with what is in there most and ending with what is in there the least). Thus, because this primer contains much more water (and other ingredients) than silicone, it is water-based.\n\nOil-based foundations are exceptionally rare. After much searching, I finally found one: Alexandra de Markoff Countess Isserlyn Cream Makeup (another is NARS Balanced Foundation, which has been discontinued, so I could not find an easily copy/paste-able ingredients list). Let's look at the ingredients:\n\nWater (aqua), **Decyl Oleate**, **Lanolin Oil**, Propylene Glycol, Talc, Isotearic Acid, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetyl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Fragrance (parfum), Emulsifying Wax NF, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Acetylated Lanolin Alcohol, PPG-12-PEG-65 Lanolin Oil, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben. May contain Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI77492, CI 77499, Ultramarines (CI77007)\n\nYes, water is listed as the first ingredient, but that is to keep the product more blendable. The second and third ingredients (in bold) are definitely oils. Phew! You don't know how many ingredients lists I went through to find that! I swear unicorns are easier to find! ANYWAY, they should play well with silicone-based primers. However, this is unlikely to be of concern to you because chances are you're not using an oil-based foundation (if you are using an oil-based foundation, check your closet for a herd of unicorns).\n\nIn general, you want water-based primers with water-based foundations (or tinted moisturizers, BB creams, CC creams, concealer, or any other base products; I'm just going to keep typing \"foundations\" for the sake of brevity), and silicone-based primers with silicone-based foundations. The two different bases (water and silicone) can cause your foundation to pill when layered on top of each other. In particular, using a silicone-based primer with a water-based foundation on top of it often causes the foundation to pill because the primer creates a silicone barrier. When you try to apply a water-based foundation on top of that, the silicone repels the water in the foundation, and the water in the foundation does not absorb properly into your skin, resulting in unevenness.\n\nPlease remember to moisturize well underneath your makeup (and to give your moisturizer time to absorb fully, meaning your skin should no longer have that \"tacky\" feeling that you have right after applying moisturizer). If you use sunscreen (which you should, especially with summer coming up), you need to let that absorb as well. The base of your moisturizer/sunscreen is irrelevant, because if you allow them to absorb completely, they will not affect makeup application at all. If you begin applying primer and foundation before your moisturizer and/or sunscreen has fully absorbed, they can cause your makeup to break up sooner, which is the opposite of what you want.\n\nAlong the same line, your powder is irrelevant to the base of your foundation/primer. There is no such thing as a water-based powder (it then wouldn't be a powder). If your powder isn't working with your foundation/primer and giving you the look that you want, it is not related to the base of your foundation/primer. Also, not everybody needs to use powder on top of their foundation, so if you're not liking the look, you may consider skipping powder altogether.\n\nAdditionally, you only need a small amount of primer for your face (a very thin layer is sufficient... your face should not feel too slippery). Do not apply too much primer. Water-based primers will absorb into your skin better, but silicone-based primers tend to sit on top of it. Using too much will create a slick film that causes your foundation to slide off much sooner. Remember that it is easier to add more (and I recommend that you add more gradually, little by little) than to take primer off of your face. Over time, you'll get used to the amount you need for your face.\n\nWhile pore-filling primers, such as Benefit Porefessional, NYX Pore Filler, and Too Faced Primed and Poreless, are designed specifically to fill in your visible pores, you can also use any primer to do this (though in my experience, they do not do as well at filling in pores as pore-filling primers, and silicone-based primers work best for filling in pores). Just make sure that you tap the primer into your pores rather than rubbing. Tapping gets the product into your pores to fill them in. Rubbing does not do the same (though you can rub afterward to make sure the surface is smoothed out) and will not give you the same pore-filling results.\n\nFinally, please remember that just because you are using two products with the same base, it doesn't necessarily mean that the products will work for you. Not every product works for every person. You may need to experiment to find the right combination for you. I highly recommend asking for samples, as they are a much cheaper (i.e. FREE) method of trying out a product. You can ask for samples of any product that can be sanitized and put in a small sample jar, such as primer and foundation.\n\nI hope this post has been helpful.

    "body": "Du skal bruge en solcreme og der er 445 produkter at vælge imellem, så hvad hulen skal man vælge? Til at løse dette problem har jeg konstrueret et lille program der kan læse ingredienslisterne på Matas hjemmeside og efter lidt manuel oprydning i data er jeg nået frem til en lidt mindre liste og tænkte jeg ville dele mine resultater her.\n\nJeg har været ret striks i mine krav, da jeg er af den opfattelse at solcremer o.l. bør beskytte mod solen og derfor ikke bør indeholde parfume, farve, smag(!?) og lignende skrammel der ikke tilfører nogen værdi.\n\nI alt var der 445 produkter på det tidspunkt jeg hentede data (mindre end 2 uger siden).\n\nAf disse havde 103 ikke opført ingredienser og er derfor ikke med.\n\nAf de resterende havde 135 hormonforstyrende stoffer, mere specifikt er produkter med følgende ingredienser sorteret fra:\n\n* avobenzone\n* octocrylene\n* lavendel\n* benzophenone-3\n* benzyl salicylate\n* bht\n* bha\n* butylparaben\n* methylparaben\n* propylparaben\n* ethylparaben\n* homosalate\n\nAf de resterende 207 produkter havde 73 opført parfume/fragrance/aroma o.l. som vitterligt kan dække over hvad som helst inklusiv skadelige stoffer og er derfor sorteret fra.\n\nAf de resterende 134 produkter havde 2 opført parfume blot under deres kemiske betegnelse, mere specifikt:\n\n* limonene\n* linalool\n* citronellol\n* geraniol\n\nAf de resterende 132 produkter havde 42 opført ingredienser som jeg vil betegne \"problematiske\". Der er ikke helt enighed om de er skadelige eller ej, men jeg valgte at eksludere produkter med:\n\n* sodium lauryl sulfate\n* sodium laureth sulfate\n* methylisothiazoline\n* denatureret alcohol\n* propylene glycol\n* benzyl alcohol\n* benzyl alcohol citral\n* benzyl benzoate\n\nAf de resterende 90 produkter havde 12 farver i. Dvs. enhver ingrediens der starter med CI efterfulgt af et nummer, dog ikke zink og titanium dioxid da de fungerer som solfiltre.\n\nHerefter sorterede jeg alle produkter fra med en SPF værdi mindre end 30 og så er der 66 tilbage fordelt på følgende 4 kategorier sorteret efter billigste pris pr. liter/kg:\n\n**SOLCREMER/OILER:**\n\n|Produkt|Pris pr. liter/kg|Url|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Matas Striber

På denne tid af året bliver jeg nemt solskoldet, resten af året er det for min huds skyld + jeg bruger hudpleje der gør huden endnu mere sensitiv overfor solen (glykolsyre). \n\nDet mest vigtige for mig er at det er behageligt at bruge, hvis det ikke er det så får jeg det ikke taget på... I den forbindelse er jeg glad for Niveas ansigts solcremer bl.a. deres spf 50 face til sensitive hud (dog er den dårlig under makeup) og dem fra Garnier til ansigtet, de har bl.a. en tyndtflydende solcrememælk der tørrer mat på huden. \n\nJeg har prøvet Matas egen solcreme, men jeg kan slet ikke deres konsistenser! \n\nTil kroppen er enten et apoteksmærke, som f.eks. La Roche Posay, Bioderma, Avene osv. gode og ellers så laver Garnier og Nivea hæderlige solcremer til gode priser. \n\nI forhold til din liste af ingredienser du valgte også at ekskludere, synes jeg især det er interessant at sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, denatured alcohol og propylene glycol er inkluderet. De er alle fire totalt almindelige ingredienser i hudpleje (Dog er sodium lauryl sulfate og sodium laureth sulfate mest almindelige i sæber og renseprodukter) og jeg forstår ikke hvorfor du har skåret dem væk? Denatureret sprit fordamper efter applikation (og kan hjælpe med at solcremen tørrer ind) og ja det kan være udtørrende i nogle formularer, men ved hudpleje er det altid vigtigt at tage højde for formularen og ikke de individuelle ingredienser kun. Du kender jo selv at du kan bruge vand, mel, sukker og æg til at lave en del forskellige opskrifter, hvis du varierer metode og forhold... \n\nPropylene glycol i solcreme kan hjælpe solcremen med at sprede sig bedre på huden og hjælper med at opløse andre ingredienser i solcremen, da det er er godt solvent til mere hydrofobe stoffer. Det eneste jeg ved til kan være problematisk ved propylene alcohol er at det kan være irriterende for huden i høje koncentrationer (50% eller mere), men du vil sjældent se det brugt så koncentreret :p\n\nMichelle Wong, som er kosmetisk kemiker og har en PhD i kemi har skrevet på hendes blog om både [propylene glycol](https://labmuffin.com/what-are-propylene-and-butylene-glycol-and-are-they-safe/) og [SLS](https://labmuffin.com/whats-wrong-with-sls/).",

    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

Even though I haven't gone to the dermatologist, I don't think I have rosacea but just really dehydrated skin + sensitivity. I use Pixi toner day and night, it's given me a really nice glow but it might've been too much use. I'm also using HA (unrelated to this post) but I think due to my dehydrated skin, it's becoming even more dehydrated. I will try TO's Mandelic and maybe alternate it with Pixi day to day.  I have just read a blog entry about TO Mandelic vs Stratia Mandelic and found it very informative.

Couple questions though: \n\n1) The PH is usually around 3. Most cleansers leave you around a 5 or so. Can you recommend any cleansers or toners to bring your skin's PH down to the appropriate level before applying HAs? \n\n2) Is there any issue with using two different HAs at the same time? Can I use some stridex pads and then throw some TO Glycolic Acid on top? Or do I want to wait 20 minutes in between each HA?\n\n3) If we are to wait in between HAs, then I wash my skin down to a good Ph to apply my first HA..but then 20 minutes later my Ph is going to be back to a 6. I wouldn't want to wash again, what do I do to repeatedly drag down my Ph??",

    "body": "I know CeraVe in the tub is quite popular here, but I just wanted to provide a quick overview of other CeraVe moisturizers for those who aren't familiar.\n\n**NOTE**: All CeraVe moisturizers contain cetearyl alcohol/cetyl alcohol, which may cause breakouts to those who have a sensitivity to fatty alcohols.\n\n**Cerave Moisturizer Overview**\n\n[**Cerave Moisturizing Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/moisturizing-cream) (also known as Cerave \"in the tub\") is a thick, creamy moisturizer with ceramides, hyaluronic acid and petrolatum.\n\n[**Cerave Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/moisturizing-lotion) comes in a bottle and is a thinner consistency. It also has ceramides and hyaluronic acid but no petrolatum.\n\n[**Cerave AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/am-facial-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a small pump bottle and has a thick, creamy (slightly greasy) texture. It is SPF 30 and contains the following active suncare ingredients: Homosalate (12% - for UVB protection), Octinoxate (7.5% - for UVB protection), Octocrylene (2% - for UVB protection), Zinc Oxide (3.5% - for UVA protection). It also contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/pm-facial-moisturizing-lotion) (my fave) comes in a small pump bottle and is a silky/gel texture. It contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and places more focus on chemical exfoliation. Notable ingredients are mineral oil, ammonium lactate (similar to lactic acid), salicyclic acid, ceramides and a lower concentration of hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-cream) comes in a tub and is a thicker version of the SA lotion and contains similar ingredients with the addition of niacinamide.\n\n[**Cerave Skin Renewing Night Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/skin-renewing-night-cream) comes in a tub and contains shea butter, ceramides, niacinamide, peptides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and contains niacinamide, ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and allantoin (an anti-irritant derived from urea). \n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-cream) comes in a tub and contains glycerin, petrolatum, ceramides and hyaluronic acid. No niacinamide or allantoin in this one.\n\n**Notable Ingredient Overview**\n\n**Ceramides**: Naturally occurring, long chains of skin lipids (fats) that are major structural components of the skin’s outer layers. Skin as a barrier system inhibits water movement via its extracellular matrix, which has a unique composition of 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% free fatty acids. Together, these lipids form what researchers refer to as \"crystalline lamellar structures\". Ceramides are necessary for the skin’s water-retention capacity as well as for barrier repair and cell regulation. Adding ceramides to skin-care products can help to restore the skin’s barrier system.\n\n**Hyaluronic acid**: Component of skin tissue that is used in skin-care products as a good skin-identical ingredient. Hyaluronic acid can boost skin's moisture content, reduce inflammation, have cell-communicating abilities, and help prevent moisture loss.\n\n**Niacinamide**: Also known as vitamin B3 and nicotinic acid, niacinamide is a potent cell-communicating ingredient that offers multiple benefits for aging skin. Assuming skin is being protected from sun exposure, niacinamide can improve skin's elasticity, dramatically enhance its barrier function, help erase discolorations, and revive skin's healthy tone and texture.\n\n**Ammonium Lactate:** Ammonium lactate is a mix of lactic acid and ammonium hydroxide. It is used as a skin moisturizer lotion to treat dry, scaly, itchy skin. Those who are using it should avoid exposure to sunlight or artificial UV rays, such as sunlamps or tanning beds. Ammonium lactate makes skin more sensitive to sunlight. Skin is more likely to sunburn. Use sunblock and wear clothes when exposed to sunlight.\n\n**Salicylic acid**: Referred to as beta hydroxy acid (BHA), it is a multifunctional ingredient that addresses many of the systemic causes of blemishes. For decades dermatologists have been prescribing salicylic acid as an exceedingly effective keratolytic (exfoliant), but it also is an anti-irritant This is because salicylic acid is a derivative of aspirin (both are salicylates—aspirin’s technical name is acetylsalicylic acid), and so it also functions as an anti-inflammatory.\n\n**Shea butter**: A plant lipid extracted from the karite tree that is used as an emollient in cosmetics. Shea butter is a rich source of antioxidants.\n\n**Ingredient Lists**\n\n> **CeraVe Moisturizing Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n>\n> **CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Active Ingredients: Homosalate (12%), Octinoxate (7.5%), Octocrylene (2%), Zinc Oxide (3.5%). \n> Inactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate and Boron Nitride, Dimethicone, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Hyaluronic Acid, Phytosphingosine, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n> \n> **CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Renewing SA Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Mineral Oil, Ammonium Lactate, Salicylic Acid, Trolamine, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG-100 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3 in Corn Oil), Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Dimethicone 360, Methylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Propylparaben, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Renewing SA Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Ammonium Lactate, Salicylic Acid, Triethanolamine, Cetyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, PEG-100 Stearate, Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3 in Corn Oil), Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Methylparaben, Edetate Disodium, Propylparaben, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Glyceryl stearate SE, Stearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Saccharide Isomerate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterols, Ceramide 6 II, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 1, Niacinamide, Hyaluronic  Acid, Caprooyl Tetrapeptide-3, Tripeptide-1, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Behentrimonium Methosulphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Tocopherol, Allantoin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Phytosphingosine, Dextran, Xanthan Gum\n>\n>**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**\n>\n>Purified Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetostearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Emulsifying Wax, Niacinamide, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lauric Acid, Zinc Citrate, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Arginine PCA, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, EDTA, Sodium PCA, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer\n>\n>**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Cream**\n>\n>Purified Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Petrolatum, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Behentrimonium Methosulphate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nHopefully this information will be useful to people interested in trying Cerave.",

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea?

        "body": "My Mom had subtype 3, with thickened skin. She had it really badly her whole life. I have some rosacea but have done my best to try to not wind up like her.  Sadly, I gave up on facial sunscreen a number of times because they irritated me or made my eyes swell shut. I currently use Dermologica which is really spendy and I am not sure it's coverage is that great, but it's the only thing I can use on my whole face so far.\n\n\nTwo things than help me a lot were cutting out black pepper and using more foundation. Environmental irritants wreck me, it seems. I used to wear moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, power, liquid, more powder and then setting spray. Very heavy coverage, but I realized that pretty much sealing my cheeks off from the world made them finally calm down, or maybe it was something in the primer. I kept at it for a long time, but now use lighter coverage. My cheeks are red, but not nearly as bad. Between that and two laser treatments I think of my problem as under control, but can't go out barefaced. And since age is a trigger I could be unknowingly doomed to the burning sensation and painful cysts Mom had, but try to live like that isn't lurking around the corner. \n\n\n\nI've never been able to use anything anti-aging, so the ideal that a retinol might actually help me is very intriguing. All my current doc will prescribe me is metrolotion, which never helped in the slightest. I might go talk to a derm at my own cost and see if that or rhofade might be good for me.",

SIGH. \n\n**WARNING: LONG BUT I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE IT WORTH.**\n\nHey all!\n\nSoooo, years ago, I was a big advocate for the [idea that some people cannot use fatty alcohols](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1y3ql7/simple_tip_for_those_of_us_who_cant_use_fatty/). This was due to my experiences with CeraVe Cream, CeraVe Lotion, Cetaphil Cream, and Cetaphil Lotion, primarily. More, I was using Ziana (.025% tretinoin + clindamycin), which I have a strong suspicion in retrospect was the cause of a form of folliculitis for me (perhaps chemical folliculitis -- there are several types of folliculitis but in this case, acne that is not \"acne,\" but rather born of continuous irritation of the hair follicles). Of course, like *everyone* going through acne, I blamed every skin product I was using except the prescription active that was *designed* to make my acne better. After all, a doctor gave it to me, and a doctor wouldn't give me something that would make me \"sicker.\" \n\nUnfortunately, it turns out that by the time I started to figure this out, it was all way too late. To this day, I have light pitted scarring in places from an 8 month moderate-to-severe zit explosion on my face that never ceased. It has taught me a lot and pressed me to learn a lot about how skin *actually* functions. I was told the entire time I was breaking out that it was just \"purging,\" only to realize what a misnomer \"purging\" kind of is -- implying the skin is holding onto infections waiting to churn out of it's layers rather than comedones -- open or closed -- that are visible, as well as microcomedones that are the beginning of an acne spot but invisible to the naked eye. At the time, purging to me implied that there were acne spots in the deeper layers of my skin waiting to come out. \n\nSo in the process of me flailing, I felt like this class of ingredients that are otherwise harmless were my bane: fatty alcohols. These are stearyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, and cetyl alcohol. After all, they turned up in *everything* that was breaking me out, including the cleansers, so surely it had to be them, right? \n\nFor example, at one point, I was using Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser + CeraVe Cream. What do these products have in common?\n\n**Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser**\n&amp;gt; Water, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, **Stearyl Alcohol**, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben.\n\n**CeraVe Cream**\n&amp;gt;Purified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20 And **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauryl Lactylate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n\n---\n\nSo being the ingredient hound I am, I connected the dots to \"must be fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives.\" After all, everything else I used had had these ingredients too.\n\n**CeraVe Lotion**\n&amp;gt; Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceteareth-20 and** Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\n**Cetaphil Cream**\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Petrolatum, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, PEG-30 Stearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Propylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n**Cetaphil Lotion** *note - I believe this used to have macadamia nut oil in it when I used it and has since been reformulated. \n\n&amp;gt; Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ceteareth-20, **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Dimethicone, Sodium Levulinate, Sodium Anisate,Caprylyl Glycol, Benzyl Alcohol, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Citric Acid, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer\n\nHappy, I thought, \"This must be it! I solved it!\" So I cut out fatty alcohol products (which, as I am sure many of you know, is a *massive* pain in the ass) and [tried to facilitate others in doing the same](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1ufvym/megalisting_products_without_cetylcetearylstearyl/). In fact, I feel like I was the primary champion of \"it might be fatty alcohols!\" back when this sub was only 25k people, and being as we were all learning from eachother and trusted eachother, many people trusted me in that assumption. After all, I had the proof (supposedly) to back it up.\n\nSo I used the lightest products, such as EltaMD PM (which is a wonderful product, don't get me wrong!). Unfortunately, my skin was parched *all of the time.* It was just sick. It kept breaking out for years after, bottle after bottle of EltaMD PM. Life happened, I was removed from the mod group for inactivity, and I just kept on with it - disappearing from this sub for a long-ass time.\n\nAnd then I started thinking... *what did I use before my skin started down this road?*\n\nBefore I knew jack-all about skin, I used Olay pretty religiously. Olay Regenerist, in the pot, with the fragrance. Yep. This stuff:\n\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Isohexadecane, Niacinamide, Isopropyl Isostearate, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Nylon-12, Dimethicone, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Sodium Peg-7 Olive Oil Carboxylate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ceratonia Siliqua (Carob) Fruit Extract, ** Stearyl Alcohol**, Polyethylene, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Benzyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Dimethiconol, Polyacrylamide, Fragrance, Peg-100 Stearate, Propylparaben, Cetearyl Glucoside, **Cetearyl Alcohol,** C13-14 Isoparaffin, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, C12-13 Pareth-3, Laureth-7, Sodium Hydroxide, Mica.\n\n*\"[Wait a fucking minute](https://media.giphy.com/media/iAYupOdWXQy5a4nVGk/giphy.gif),\"* she thought. \"That shit has cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol and coconut derivatives all the shit I am avoiding. How the fuck did my face not explode then?\"\n\nSo I did something insane: I tried a cream with fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives that was being recommended on this sub at the time (lol). Some of you may recognize this:\n\n**Cheryl Lee MD Ceramide+**\n&amp;gt;Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Coconut), Petrolatum, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Polyglyceryl -10 Pentastearate, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Isostearyl Isostearate, Cetyl Alcohol, 1,3 Propanediol (from Corn), C10-30 Cholesterol/Lanosterol Esters, Ceramide 3, Phytosphingosine, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Niacinamide, Glycyrrhetinic Acid (Licorice Root), 1,2 -Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Gluconolactone.\n\nAnd you want to know something?\n\n90% of my acne healed in a week. 90% of the acne that had been causing me scars and *ruining my fucking life for years* healed in a fucking **week**. I looked back at all the ingredients for all the products that I had avoided and all the ones I had just been able to use fine as a teenager and by fucking god, what did I miss? **Ceteareth-fucking-20** (sans the cleansers -- I still don't know why my skin hated Cetaphil Gentle, but it turns out that it has broken out with every creamy, non-sudsy cleanser ever, so I've resigned myself to using gentle SLES cleansers for life).\n\nI felt like such a massive asshole. \n\nSo that brings me to now, when I decided on a train on a vacation in NYC to start a skin blog. I had spent those years researching my ass off about skin not to even see what a massive fuckup I had made. I had been able to help my BF bring his eczema 80% into control with bleach bath washes and solve my mom's chronically dry skin and my friend's weird case of eczema on his ring finger, but not my own skin. \n\nI came back to this sub after ~5 fucking years (4 of them AFK) and I still see a lot of people avoiding *all fatty alcohols*. I'm making this post to tell you that it might not be all fatty alcohols. It may be cet-20, like me, or it may be those fatty alcohols in combination with other ingredients (combinations of some ingredients can change molecular sizes, some manufacturers use different sources or molecular sized products, like larger or smaller hyaluronic acid, for example). There's so much complexity with skincare, skin, and ingredients that it usually isn't *one whole class of ingredients*. In short: **your mileage may vary**. This is why spot testing is important, one product isn't for everyone, and while ingredient labels are important for weeding out culprits, you also need to do a bit of research on how ingredients work with others to change how they interact on the skin. \n\nSince then, I've spot tested many of the products I flat-out ruled out and 1. it turns out everything with cet-20 does explode my face, 2. it turns out macadamia nut oil also explodes my face (in the cet lotion), and 3. turns out I can use 50% of the things I thought I couldn't (like jojoba oil!).\n\nI'm so happy that many of you have found this sub educational, but **please** consider what you've used in the past (skincare for face, makeup, EVERYTHING) and don't neglect those products when cross-identifying culprits. It changed my life and it might change yours.\n\nSome takeaways, with bullet points because I love bullet points:\n\n* Don't rule out entire classes of ingredients. Skin is super individual and it may be one stupid ingredient.\n* Don't take all of your skincare advice from the Internet, and if you do, try to diversify. Reddit, acne.org, MakeupAlley, medical journals -- get in there and become your own advocate.\n* Sometimes, skin is just an asshole and you won't be able to figure out what it hates. Example: My skin has issues with CeraVe healing ointment and foaming wash, despite them lacking cet-20. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n* Sometimes, what is considered \"good\" or \"best\" for skin isn't good or best for your skin. Example for me: creamy cleansers. They're definitely recommended *everywhere* for *every* skin condition, esp rosacea (which I have), but my skin fucking loathes them all. No idea why, and that's okay.\n* Just because an ingredient is \"good\" for skin doesn't mean it is good for your skin. Example: Me and high % niacinamide = zits. Me and low % niacinamide = k.\n* Just because it's a prescription doesn't mean it can't fuck you up, fam. I thought prescription = good, no problems here, won't cause issues. I have literal scars to prove me wrong. Instead of assuming all is well, **TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR IF SHIT IS UP AND IF YOUR DOCTOR IS LIKE HEY SHIT IS FINE BUT YOU STILL THINK SHIT IS FUCKED, GO TO ANOTHER DOCTOR**. I wish I had done this. Instead, my doc kept urging me to use it every single night. Went to a new doc and he was like, \"Oh no, your skin is very sensitive, that is wayyyy too harsh.\" Listen to your gut.\n* Almost alll skin rules are more like guidelines (except the baking soda, lemon juice, harsh harsh scrubs stuff - that's all still true since they can all throw your skin very out of whack). Example: I do better with light physical exfoliation once a week than AHA any day.\n\nThanks, and I'm sorry for being such a massive, incorrect asshole. I'm doing my best to correct my errors now (and hopefully go to esthetics school though BF is pushing me to do dermatology).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n",

        "body": "Please do dermatology.... or fuck it both!! There needs to be someone on the medical side who can vouch for us not being complete loons about our skin. \n\nYes I have to agree with the sentiment of your post.... over the last few years my skin has been freaking out over every little thing. Too hot, too cold, aha, bha, B3, HA, phenoxyethanol the list goes on. \n\nFor 7months I used Tretinoin 0.025% and built up slowly (I thought), the purge happened. Traumatic. Then just unhappy skin.... but it is gold standard for my issues right? My face said no. \n\nAfter becoming ill last year, severely for 6+ months, all skincare and Tret use went down the drain. Just SS once a day, used as moisturiser. Rarely even washed my face in the evening I was too exhausted. \n\nWhat this did, apart from giving me Cc's and what have you. Was a chance for my skin to repair my moisture barrier on my face. Since medication has helped with the symptoms of my illness,  I have been able to use 1 product in my routine with phenoxyethanol as the main preservative, without it giving me painful pustles and nodules everywhere I experienced before. \n\nI have realised that the rash of whiteheads where ever I use a product with HA in and determined was the HA also happens with high levels of BG. So now planning to test a large molecular weight HA serum to see if I have the same issue without the BG. PG is fine... Propanidol is great. \n\nB3 🤔 causes flushing in my skin. And I'm not really interested in trying again.... \n\nBHA, again let me try again at some point. But method of application might be the issue here. \n\nSo vitamin c seemed out of the lexicon for my skin. I now have a silicone based C vit lined up to trial. \n\nFragerance/ essential oils can still mess me up doh. \n\nMoral of this story for me? Concentrate on keeping healthy skin barrier. The rest comes after.... so cleanse (favourite step), treat (calming, hydrating, emollient and then the acne/PIH target), protect. This approach has been working for me so far.",

    "body": "For the purposes of this review of multiple products, I’ll be *categorizing items by routine placement* rather than when it was introduced.  These items are very much YMMV but I thought it may be helpful for some who are newer to AB (seen with the large influx of newbie questions I’ve seen in the DHT) or even those wondering about products generally.  Also **this isn’t a particular look at my routine(s)** or how my routine has transformed as I’ve learned more about my skin; rather, this review is of products used to target particular concerns.  This mega-review really came about after a response comment from /u/theCuriousAmerican (whom I thank for keeping me and much of the board in the loop regarding newer products/ lesser known brands in Korea).  I am over 30 but I haven’t started picking out my coffin lining just yet (rose gold silk, plz) so be aware this isn’t really an anti-aging post as I don’t consider myself having “mature” skin (whatever that means).  As I go through reviews, I’ll also include my rational as to why I purchased a product if it wasn’t impulse and link any relevant posts from the sub that informed my purchase. \n\nI've decided to break up this review and present categories like a series.  This post will be centered around 1st cleansers, hydrating toners, and serums.  The second post will be centered around oils, moisturizers/occlusives, and masks. *Also, I will only discuss AB/ sub-related products*. While I went through a smattering of samples, they will not be discussed. All products discussed were used for at least 2-3 months, if not longer. \n\nAbout my skin prior to developing a skincare routine: \n\n- extremely oily\n\n- flaky under makeup (my makeup would separate in hours and have dry patches)\n\n- riddled with closed comedones (whiteheads)\n\n- bumpy skin texture (under the skin pimples)\n\n- uneven skin tone, hyperpigmentation (PIH)\n\n- icepick scars\n\n\n**1st Cleanser**:\n\n\n*Heimish All Clean Balm*\n\n- Ingredients: [Posted from CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2186231803.html) so take with a grain of salt as anyone can add or delete ingredients. \n\n\nI've been using this balm since February. My initial impression was satisfaction. It melted well (not as well as Clinique's Take The Day Off), a slight herbal/citrus smell which didn't bother me, and a lower price point than TTDO. The price is really the main positive of this product. I don't find it cleans as well as TTDO so I have to use more product to make sure everything is eliminated. Nowadays I don't even wear a full face or any makeup at all really except Heroine waterproof mascara and Beauty People Lip Tattoo. I usually let this balm sit on my face for a minute or two before going at it and it does remove most of these products. Into May, I'm still satisfied with this product. Sometimes I only use this cleanser at night if I wasn't wearing anything but sunscreen since it does the job and I've worn a full face and it does remove base makeup well enough (even though I need to use more of it). It'll also last a bit longer, I'm thinking 2-3 more months, so at least 6 months of use for me. I also like that this comes in travel size (I got a few from a Ohlolly.com promo).\n\n\nRepurchase? I'd likely repurchase TTDO if choosing between the two, yes TTDO is more expensive but I liked that it removed makeup easier, it melted better as well. \n\n\nFor my next 1st cleanser, I'll likely repurchase TTDO or make my own cleanser as a way to dupe Tatcha's oil cleanser (beautiful cleanser, only had a sample but loved the feeling). \n\n\n**Hydrating Toners**\n\n\n*Kikusamusane High Moist Lotion* (30 mL decant)\n\n- Ingredients: [From CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_5173202878.html)\n\n\nRemember mid-2016 when kikumasamune was on everyone's lips? I purchased a decant of this hydrator partially on the [buzz](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3tgula/a_letter_to_kikumasamune_high_moist_lotion/?st=j2jobol7&sh=17239e4e) created by the sub and other blogs.  This product seemed like a good way to target PIH and increase hydration for my dehydrated skin.  It took me about 2 months to get through my decant. I'm not gonna go through my use of this product because it's been discussed by this sub so much (do a google search). \n\n\nRather, I'll discuss why I ended up not purchasing a full size of this product. I ended up not purchasing a full size because by then I felt my skin didn't need what the Kiku was offering. I didn't get any significant lightening of PIH, brightening yes but I felt I could get brightening from other products. I could get hydration from other products as well.  And I suppose I just wasn't *impressed* enough to want to purchase it. This was also when I realized I get bored of products and the thought of purchasing a 500 ml product seemed so daunting to finish. LOL. \n\n\n*Hada Labo Albutin Lotion Moist*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Arbutin, Disodium Succinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Methylparaben, PPG-10 Methyl Glucose Ether, Sodium Hyaluronate, Styrene/VP Copolymer, Succinic Acid, Tremella Fuciformis Polysaccharide (from hadalabousa)\n\n\nI recently finished this product (mid-April) and I'm so happy I never have to use this product again. LOL. I purchased this product in December on ABX. I primarily purchased it because of its ingredient list and was interested in using a product with MAP and Arbutin to see if it could attack my PIH in anyway. Also, I felt it would be another good addition for my skin that leans perma-dehydrated. Little to no smell, watery texture, and economical. \n\n**Performance**: Overall, I was significantly disappointed by this product and the longer my time away from this product the more I'm able to realize why I'm disappointed.  It just didn't do anything. It felt like I was throwing cloudy water on my face most of the time. Cloudy water that wasn't even showing a difference in my skin. I would take days off from using this product and saw no difference in brightness to my face. I also saw no lightening of PIH. I expect my toners to hydrate *at least* and it seemingly failed on this front as well. I added another toner to back up this one but I don't like wasting product so I finished it. I found it as a good way to give myself lotion masks and to hydrate my legs. Essentially, this may be the most boring product I've ever tried. \n\n\n*Meishoku Extra Moisturizing Lotion Moist* \n\n- Ingredients: [From cosdna](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_f35b176780.html)\n\n\nI purchased this toner around December from the r/abx with the Hada Labo moist.  I didn’t know what to expect purchasing this product but I did based on the ingredients. I was searching for a product that had ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids. I should also add that I was searching for a product that had the 3-1-1 ratio because my face does best with a pretty constant use of acids and I needed something that would deliver on the moisture front. \n\n\n**Performance**: I can't actually say much about this product which I don't know if that's good or bad. It's slightly thicker than the HL moist, it's more moisturizing than HL and I feel like it does more than HL ever did. I still enjoy using it after all this time and I may even repurchase. It absorbs quickly, has no discernible smell, and is pretty economical for the amount you receive vs how long it lasts. If the product ingredient listing is correct and I understand how each ingredient fits, this product may have the 3-1-1 ratio (plz, correct me if I'm wrong as I'd love to know for sure!).\n\n\n*PyunKyang Yul Essence Toner*\n\n- Ingredients: Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\nMy newest toner purchase.  I’ve been using this toner for about 3 weeks so I can only give a first impression.  My main interest in this toner was sparked by [Gothamista’s YT review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9_mJoK4gr4) of this product when she covered the 7 skin layer method.  I was interested in finding another hydrating toner to try out the method as I felt that HL was too thin and really felt more like I was patting ‘cloudy water’ on my face every day. \n\n\nAbout the PKY line: The PKY line was developed by the Pyunkang Oriental Medicine Clinic (info provided by Ohlolly.com).  It boasts a list of ingredients commonly found in these types of products but I was especially interested in milk vecht root extract, which is an extract that I haven’t come across much in products. (NOTE: I've been searching high and low for any clue of what this ingredient does topically, can't find anything.) I’m a bit of a lover for simpler aesthetics.  I like it when bottles are plainly labeled and look like they belong in an apothecary.  In this sense, PKY hits all my wants; sleek and simplistic design, electric blue bottle (hard plastic), and **no** dropper. \n\n\n**Performance**: What I expected from this product was hydration and I can say this toner delivered.  The liquid is slightly thicker than HL lotion moist but not too much.  I live in a high humidity area and we’re going into summer but I don’t expect to rotate this toner out of my routine.  I tend to only need 2-3 layers for the skin method when I’m using this toner. I’ve tried doing up to 7 but my skin calls it quits in absorption around layer 5. But I'm also wondering if this product just isn't as easily absorbed as meishoku. I think this product would be a great skin soother, since it comes across as so ...mild and inoffensive (if that makes sense). \n\n\nHave I seen a discernible difference in my skin using this product?  I don’t think so. I would notice more if my skin didn’t get the proper hydration it needed from this product but I haven’t seen that. \n\n\nMISC: There is no discernible smell but I’m not sensitive to smells.  The bottle is 6.7 oz which is a lot of product and likely this bottle will last me at least 8 months, making the price ($19) very economical. \n\n\nIf I didn’t think I’d have another toner waiting to be purchased, I’d say I’d repurchase this but I already have my sights set on toners by kyotosilk and swanicoco.  \n\n\n**Serums**\n\n\n*OST20*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Ascorbic Acid, Alcohol, Sodium Lactate, Butylene Glycol, Glucose, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Xanthan Gum, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Flower Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Glycerin, Zinc PCA, Panthenol, Niacinamide, t-Butyl Alcohol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ubiquinone, Diisopropyl Adipate (from Wishtrend)\n\n\nI'm going to be honest, I won't say much about this product because this sub seems to have a love+hate relationship with it. But I feel like a complete *sucker* for using this product when Timeless's Vit C formula exists. Reviews by [Holysnails](http://www.holysnails.com/2015/03/a-rant-on-osts-c20-and-c215-serums-and.html) and [Fiddy](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2017/01/04/vitamin-c-serum-101-timeless-vitamin-c-serum-review/) and [sub reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4edywb/timeless_vitamin_c_e_ferulic_serum_review_with/?st=j2joba2v&sh=f554f12e) should have had me clicking to Timeless's site. \n\n\nBut no, I tried OST20 first (at least I don't have to wonder) came away disappointed (easily oxidized, serum-like feeling, faint smell, and a bit tacky on the skin). If I regretted purchases this would likely be the ONE I regret most, especially after using Timeless (water-like feel to the skin, subtle scent, stabilized with vit E and ferulic acid, great pricing). NOTE: Please purchase from Timeless's site, while offered on Amazon I can't say for sure that is Timeless's vendor. \n\n\n*Stratia Rewind*\n\n- Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Ethoxydiglycol, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, 2-Dimethylamino Ethanol (DMAE), Panthenol, Hydrolized Rice Protein, N-Acetyl Glucosamine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Tamarindus Indica (Tamarind) Seed Extract, Hydrocotyl (Centella Asiatica) Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA\n\n\nAgain, this is another product that is known enough in the sub that I don't really feel like I need to say much. I purchased this product based on the ingredients. I wanted something with niacinamide + nag and licorice. Also, I wanted to support an independent maker who I know was knowledgeable about skincare. I was really interested to see what this product would do for my skin. NOTE: I purchased before stratia dropped the use of biokelp ferment so I've never tried the newest formulation. \n\n\nFor skin feel, this product was slightly oily but sank in well enough. I found it slightly hydrating/moisturizing but not heavy. It really did help with providing a boost of moisture to my skin while being soothing. \n\n\n**Performance**: Overall, I didn't see any significant change in my skin except for moisture/hydration. My PIH was not lightened and I didn't see significant brightening and really that's what I wanted. \n\n\n*Hungarian Water Essence*/*Mizon Hyaluronic 100 Serum*\n\n- Ingredients (BELIF): Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Officinalis(Sage) Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Peucedanum Graveolens (Dill) Extract, Alchemilla Vulgaris Extract, Rose Extract, Poncirus Trifoliata Fruit Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, *Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, *Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, *Nepeta Cataria Extract, *Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Leaf Extract, *Baptisia Tinctoria Root Extract, *Stellaria Media (Chickweed) Extract, +Alchemilla Vulgaris Leaf Extract, **Equisetum Arvense Leaf Extract, **Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Leaf Extract, **Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Triethylhexanoin, Tromethamine, Sclerotium Gum, Ammonium Acryloyldimethltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Trisodium EDTA, ***Fragrance, Citronnellol, Limonene. *Napiers Original Formula. **Napiers Aqua Formula. ***Fragrances of Natural Origin.\n\n- Ingredients (MIZON): Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Copper Tripeptide-1, Butylene Glycol, Sclerotium Gum, 1,2-octanediol, Ethylhexyl-glycerin, Tropolone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Carppyl/capric Triglyceride,Hydrogenated Lecithin, Stearic Acid, C12-c20alkyl Glucoside, C13-22 Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Cholesteryl Hydroxystearate, Cholesterol, Ceramid 3, Triethanolamine, Carbomer, Betula Platpyhlla Japonica Juice, Portaluca Oleracea Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, Amica Montana Flower Extract, Artemisia Absinthium Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Gentiana Lutea Root Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Rasberry) Fruit Extract, Beta-Glucan, Adenosine, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA\n\n\n**Performance**: I'm putting these two together because I felt like they acted as similar products. Very inoffensive serums with little to no scent. I couldn't pinpoint to their overall effect but I will say that when I started mixing them together before application I saw a def increase in the ...bouncy-ness of my skin. I can't explain it and I'm little miffed that separately they didn't perform but together I loved the effect. I refuse to purchase extract water as I got a deluxe sample size from Sephora (Belif got me on the moisturizer train already) and Mizon did very little for my skin alone so both were a dud in my opinion. \n\n\n******\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nI suppose I should discuss my skin now. Overall, I'm pretty happy with where my skin is although I think I'm gonna need laser work for some PIH or start on tret. I don't get flakes even in the face of all the actives I through at my skin. I barely purge (except for retinol) and I don't break out really. When I do breakout, it's usually from products/ environmental, not hormonal. I guess I have a semi-glow, although IRL I just look semi-sweaty or really shiny with makeup on. I'm not as oily and I usually don't get oily until about 4PM now and my makeup no longer separates. \n\n\nI think what's made the largest difference is introducing a hydrating toner. Before this I cleansed and moisturized but hydration was a key element that I wasn't getting. Adding hydration was such a wonderful step towards aiding my skin and I really think that in those who are new to AB, learning the importance of hydration is critical in understanding your skin. ",

I wrote this months ago; just have a courage to post it now lol.\n\nEverything I wrote is based from my experience, knowledge from fellow redditors on r/AsianBeauty, r/SkincareAddiction, and A LOT of research. Always remember - **YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)** - what worked for others might not work for you and vice-versa. There's no universal treatment in acne or other skin concerns. Skincare is a process of trial and error. Take this post with a grain of salt. \n\nAlso, this is a lengthy post so if you don't have any patience to read this wall of text, shoo! (Ay ang hard haha). Seriously, this post is mostly composed of studies, anecdotes, and other references to support my claims. AYAW NATIN NG FAKE NEWS 'DI BA? \n\nFor clarification, I'm far from that Korean, dewy skin. I have suffered from acne vulgaris for years, but I'm confident that my face improved a lot. But this post wouldn't focus with my acne journey. I want this to be a general skincare guide. There may be some personal thoughts here and there but that would be it. \n\nLastly, I apologize if along the way I may have bent the rules of grammar. I'm just accustomed to explaining things in English. I might repeatedly edit this post if I could bring myself to thoroughly proofread this.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhile I know and appreciate that dermatologists know what products or practices are best for us especially our skin, I'm one of those enthusiasts who believe that it is much better if you know your OWN skin. For example, over my skincare journey I found out that my skin can't handle SLS but I can tolerate SLES, products with malunggay/ben oil break me out, etc. And these are findings a dermatologist can't just provide to me.\n\nYou'll probably get fed up with my skincare one liner - YMMV (Your Mileage May vary) - but this is crucial concept to be familiarized with. Everyone's skin is different. In a simple context - we have different sensitivity to cosmetic ingredients. YMMV but the components of our skin are all the same, just varies on how much you have vs how much they have.\n\nLet me provide you with some science. I'll try to explain this simply (as the saying goes, know and befriend your enemy), tho of course jargon can't be avoided. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**A LITTLE SCIENCE ON HOW OUR SKIN WORKS**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOur skin is composed of three layers - dermis, hypodermis, and epidermis. The most important of the three is the **epidermis** - the outer layer of the skin. Epidermis consists of 15-20 layers of cells which is mostly 95% of **keratinocytes**. They create proteins, with *Keratin* being the most major protein. They are made in the basal (deepest) layer of the epidermis - *Stratum basale/stratum germinativum*. Keratinoctyes present here undergo division and differentiation, half of it will remain in this basal layer, while the other half will further go upward into the upper layers until they reached the outermost layer of the epidermis - the **stratum corneum (SC)**. Keratinocytes in the SC are now keratinized or cornified, this is why they are also called Corneocytes. These keratinocytes in the SC or **corneocytes** are now dead skin cells, which regularly slough away (also called desquamation) and again replaced by Keratinocytes from the deeper layers. They are tightly bound together, forming the SC barrier (sometimes called epidermal barrier, moisture barrier), which plays an important role for a healthy skin.^[1,2]\n\nThis entire process of keratinization takes up to 4 weeks or approximately 28 days. \n\nOther cells present in the epidermis are:^[1,3]\n\n- Melanocytes - they protect our skin from harmful uv rays through their pigment called *melanin*. This pigment is black in nature, that's why when our skin is excessively exposed to sun, such cells produce more melanin. More melanin = darker spot. Heh! Don't blame melanocytes; blame yourself for not applying sunscreen. :P\n- Langerhans’ Cells - they uptake the antigens in our skin and carry them to the nearest lymph node. Specialized in fighting germs.\n- Merkel Cells - enables us to sense pressure because of their sensory function. \n\n&nbsp; \n\nNotice how I focused with the Epidermis 'cause this is where skin diseases usually arise. I hope I haven't lost you yet. Skin actually involves complicated processes; the one I mentioned above is just a simplified version.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGoing back to stratum corneum (SC). SC is the most superficial layer of epidermis. It is also called 'horny layer' because *stratum corneum* is a latin term which literally translates to horny layer. \n\nAnd now the SC barrier. SC barrier is usually described through the *Bricks and Mortar* model. Construction of SC barrier resembles a wall in which layered *corneocytes* stand for *bricks*. Desmosomes keep them intact. Intercellular lipids are the cement which stand for *mortar*.^[2,4]\n\n[Visualization](http://www.ajicjournal.org/cms/attachment/2006299184/2028507809/gr3.jpg)\n \nThese bricks main job is the SC's hydration. This is because of the presence of **natural moisturizing factors** (NMFs). NMFs provide moisture retention because of its humectant property. Humectant bonds with water molecules to increase water content in the skin. Some \ncompounds also have the ability to attract moisture from the environment. NMFs are comprised of amino acids, carboxylic pyrrolidone acid, lactic acid, urea, glucose, and mineral ions.^[5-7]\n\nThe mortar, intercellular lipids, are mostly **ceramides** or sphingolipids (50%), remaining would be 25% of **cholesterol**, and 15% of **free fatty acids**. Together, they strengthen the permeability barrier, warding off external irritants; help in water retention and flux.^[8]\n\n\nAlso notice how important hydration (i.e. water content) in our epidermis, specifically in stratum corneum. \n\nHold on, I'm not trying to sound r/imverysmart here. I assure you such information are significant in skincare. As we delve in further, you'll understand why.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo how do you measure skin barrier function? It is through **transepidermal water loss (TEWL)** and water content of the stratum corneum, and **skin surface pH**. TEWL and water content are evidently inversely proportional - increased TEWL lowers water content; decreased TEWL more water content. TEWL is the total amount of water vapor loss through skin when there is no sweat gland activity. TEWL is measured by ServoMed Evaporimeter (VERY EXPENSIVE!).^[9-12]\n\nImpaired barrier function has been known to lead in skin conditions and diseases such as xerosis (dryness), rosacea, atopic dermatitis (eczema), and acne vulgaris.^[10,13-15] It has been observed that patients with acne vulgaris have low amount of ceramides due to the diminished water barrier content, measured by TEWL. AV patients have higher sebum production and greater TEWL.^[16]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Oh, okay. Eh 'di ikaw na maraming alam, OP. Bakit hindi mo na lang kami diretsuhin sa acne treatments?!*\n\nAba aba, easyhan mo lang. This is one of my pet peeves. We want to have a healthy skin but we don't really educate ourselves with how our skin works, how  a specific product works - how it really impacts our skin. We just slather a random product on our skin and just hope for the best. Well, that 'best' doesn't come easily. We tend to follow unsolicited advice from people who are blessed with good genes and have a healthy skin to begin with. \n\nAnd if ever there's someone here, reading, who has a clear skin to die for, please stop giving UNSOLICITED advice. You're just bringing more attention to the person that they have problematic skin. Of course they know it, but rubbing it to them that they need to treat it isn't actually helpful at all.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n'Kay, going back. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet me state my side why when someone asks advice from me, I don't advise them to see dermatologist ASAP. Emphasis on ASAP. I don't want to sound like I'm discouraging people to visit dermatologist. \n\n*Insert situation where a patient went to dermatologist because of acne vulgaris*\n\nA dermatologist would surely prescribe acne treatments. These can be topical or oral antibiotics;  oral Vitamin A derivative like Accutane; topical Vitamin A derivatives (also known as retinoids) like Tretinoin, Epiduo, Differin (Adapelene); benzoyl peroxide; salycilic acid; azelaic acid; and many more. ~~(YOU SEE, THERE ARE MANY TREATMENTS AVAILABLE AND YET WE STILL SUFFER FROM AV)~~. They would also insist you to use their products or prescribe OTC products, having a basic routine to support a treatment they chose for you.\n\nBy then, the patient already have a simple routine of cleanser, (toner), moisturizer, (and sunscreen) + maybe a topical treatment like Epiduo. The dermatologist advised the patient to use all of these consistently. \n\nProblems? MANY. First, there's no guarantee that the basic routine of cleanser, moisturizer, etc will work for your skin. Why? You can be sensitive to certain ingredient/s present on them, thus leading to *acne cosmetica* (breakouts from cosmetic products). Second, how the hell will you know if it's the cleanser, the toner, or the moisturizer that's causing the problem if you introduced them all at once? Third, treatments like Epiduo encourage faster skin cells turnover rate which can lead to *purging* (surfacing clogged pores A.K.A. it's gonna get worse before it gets better), how will you know if those added acne are due to purging and not acne cosmetica?\n\n\nFourth, these treatments can compromise our skin barrier. Benzoyl peroxide (BP) can cause irritant dermatitis and can result to TEWL.^[17] Topical retinoids can also cause dermatitis. In fact, there's a term called retinoid dermatitis - erythema (redness), scaling (dryness), and desquamation. ^[18] In short, no matter how powerful these treatments are, they can also worsen your skin concerns.\n\n\nQuoting:\n\n> In addition, certain medications used to treat AV can cause alterations in SC integrity and function, either via the active ingredient, the vehicle, or both, which can result in signs and symptoms of cutaneous irritation. . Providing specific skin care recommendations, including product selection and proper use, is an important part of the management of AV and may adjunctively augment the efficacy of topical medications in reducing acne lesions.^[19]\n\nYes, the patient's derma is right in providing a skin care products to help a treatment. But he's wrong for suggesting to use them all at once.\n\nWe have to keep in mind that a problematic skin has an impaired barrier function present to different conditions as what stated above.^[10,13-15] So damaging the skin barrier further would just worsen everything. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**SO what do you need to do, then? BABY your skin! Moisturize it. Strengthen your SC barrier.** \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut how? By having a dedicated skincare routine! This is what I like with r/AsianBeauty. ABers focus on strengthening their skin barrier rather than treating any skin conditions right away. Try posting once on their daily help thread. \"Hi! I'm new to skincare and I need suggestions to treat my acne.\" They wouldn't say \"Hello! Acids like chemical exfoliants are effective on treating acne, try...\" Their answers would probably be, \"What's your current routine? I suggest having a basic routine first before proceeding with powerful treatments.\"\n\nBecause it makes sense! Having a dedicated skincare routine without treatment is as powerful as focusing on treatment itself.^[20,21]\n\nFun fact: Even a proper skincare routine has been known to be effective in aiding the skin barrier function of infants.^[22,23] ~~I can now foresee what would be the first product I would buy for my son/daughter - a moisturizer! Haha, kidding.~~ \n\nBelieve me, when I started having a routine of cleanser + moisturizer + sunscreen every day, the number of my acne reduced significantly. But of course I reached the plateau where I needed to incorporate treatments on my routine, because having a solid routine + a powerful treatment would lead you far!^[24-26]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA simple skincare routine shall compose of a gentle cleanser, a moisturizer, a broad-spectrum sunscreen.\n\nBefore we go further to skincare routine let me just provide additional notes to consider.\n\n**YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)**, duh. I know I mentioned this numerous times and will still do. It is important to instill this concept. You shouldn't be surprised that a certain, popular product didn't work for you. Or a product in which some told you to stay away from, worked for you. That's one of the mysteries of this world, Babe. ~~When they said we are created in God's image and likeness, they meant different gods~~. \n\nWe have different sensitivities to ingredients present in a specific product. \n\n>\"People can even be allergic to commonly used products. It’s not that ingredients in these are unsafe – it’s the way the body reacts to them can differ from person to person.\"\nDr Chris Flower, Director-General of CTPA and a Chartered Biologist & Toxicologist^[27]\n\nWhen a product says *hypoallergenic* doesn't guarantee one won't have reaction to it. After all, *hypo* means *less than* so just lesser chance of allergic reaction. \n\nSame goes with *non-comedogenic* (won't clog your pores). This is just one of those marketing strategies to make you buy that product. Okay, I might have gone overboard. That is still a useful guideline 'cause they could mean that the manufacturers tested their products and consider them good fit for people with oily, acne-prone skin. Don't get so worked up with this when you buy products tho. *\"Okay, this one doesn't say non-comedogenic so I might get acne here*\". No, not that mindset. Remember what I said? YMMV. You won't know until you test it out yourself.\n\n[FDA has a list of common claims and labels used in cosmetics](https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/Labeling/default.htm). \n\nThese are:\n\n- \"Alcohol Free\"\n- “Cosmeceutical”\n- \"Cruelty Free\"/\"Not Tested on Animals\"\n- Hypoallergenic\n- Organic\n\nAs you can see, non-comedogenic is not recognized by FDA.\n\nOne reason is the comedogenicity of some ingredients were tested on rabbit ears. NOT ON HUMANS. \n\n[Related reading](https://www.prettycat.uk/single-post/2017/09/12/Comedogenicity-testing--The-Rabbit-Ear-Test)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFrom time to time, I'm gonna use cosdna.com as a reference to products' ingredients. It's a helpful site for identifying if a specific ingredient is highly comedogenic or an irritant. It does sound contradicting to my previous statement but even [CosDNA said that](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/help/ingredients_qna.php)\n\n> Our data source include[sic] international experts, institutions and publications. If any the three column is blank, this meas[sic] there is no data (not indicate[sic] [whether] the ingredient is safe or unsafe). We want to remind our user, the effect of cosmetics depends on concentration, quality, process and mutual influence of ingredients. The skin condition of each person are[sic] different (even constantly changing).\n\nNevertheless, it still a good site to track ingredients of a particular product. If for example two products broke you out or gave you adverse reactions, you can look and compare the ingredients present on these products, and pinpoint what could be the culprit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThat being said, **Don't hesitate to stop using a product that is not working for you.** If it's making things worse, that just means it's not meant for you. \n\n*Ahh maybe this product is just drawing these pimples out.* No, that is *skin purging* and purging, only happens when you're using exfoliants (BHA, AHA,etc), acids, and/or vitamin A topical derivatives which increase skin's cells turnover rate like retinoids. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**SKINCARE IS GENDER-NEUTRAL**\n\nThis is intended specifically to men. Taking care of your skin doesn't make you less masculine. Using at least three facial products won't hurt your manliness. Please stop that ongoing machismo. \n\nThose products labeled *for men* are just marketing bullshits. \n\nI'm not saying that there's no skin difference between men and women. In fact, males have been reported to have larger pore size and higher sebum production.^[28] Even the skin's pH (which will be tackled later) of females are lower compared to males.^[29] Males also have greater skin thickness than females.^[30]. Males also experience more intense pigmentation after sun exposure and retain it for a longer time than females.^[31]. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet's have an example.\n\n*Nivea for men deep cleansing face wash*\n\n[Ingredients](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_e1ce27538.html)\n\n> Aqua, **Cocamidopropyl Betaine**, **Sodium myreth sulfate**, **Decyl Glucoside**, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, **Alcohol Denat**, PEG-90 GLYCERYL ISOSTEARATE, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, Sodium Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyquaternium-10, Laureth-2, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Benzophenone-4, Parfum\n\nIngredients in bold are surfactants and an alcohol. What I have observed from cleansers that are marketed for men is its supposedly \"deep cleansing\" characteristic. This can be seen from these surfactants. I included alcohol because aside from these sulfates, this is also the culprit why it feel like such products *really cleanses* your face. When in reality, it just leaves your face squeaky clean and DRY. \n\nWhat I also observed is the presence of Benzophenone-4, why the hell would you put a sunscreen ingredient in a facial wash?? \n\nNow, knowing that men's skin has larger pores and tends to be more oily, do these ingredients really help with a male skin? Does science view surfactants as ingredients for men? \n\nDon't get me started with the other one - *Sikreto ng mga Gwapo*. ~~Sikreto pero binunyag, h'wag ako~~. Okay, I'm not saying avoid this product and the like. If it works for you, then okay. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnother example:\n\n*Pond's Men Energy Charge All-in-One Moisturizer*\n\nWow what's with these \"men\" products that use \"Energy\" \"Fresh\" \"Sport\", \"Cool\"? To make them more *masculine*? lol\n\n[Ingredients](https://www.ponds.com/ph/men/products/collection/energy-charge/moisturizer.html)\n\n> Water, Dimethicone, Alcohol Denat, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Caprylic/Capri Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Perfume, DMDM Hydantoin, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Propylene Glycol, Stearic Acid, BHT, Menthol, Sodium PCA, Triethanolamine, Niacinamide, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract\n\nAnother thing I observed is that these manufacturers of supposedly \"for men\" products might be inclined to the idea that men prefer putting products that absorb easily, almost feel like nothing has been applied to the skin, have a cooling effect. \n\nThese are evident with *Alcohol Denat* high up in the ingredients list. Alcohol, an astringent, makes the product absorb easily and can be irritating to some. The presence of Menthol, which is another astringent, is just for added fragrance and cooling sensation. And how can these be beneficial to male's skin? \n\nIt's not that this particular moisturizer is not beneficial. Key ingredients such as *Niacinamide* - for skin brightening and sebum regulation, *Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract* - for anti aging and photoaged skin, are also present. The thing is these ingredients are way below the list. Perfume even listed ahead of them, in which sensitive skin peeps should be wary of. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nOkay let me stop criticizing these products. The takeaway is - skincare is not sexist! The *for men* label is just a marketing ploy, tricking you into thinking that their products are specially formulated for men. \n\n\n---\n\n\n### A skincare routine that doesn't compromise our SC barrier\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**ON CLEANSERS / FACIAL WASHES**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you're going to visit r/AsianBeauty you might stumbled with the pH level of the cleanser they are using. Apparently, pH level is significant in choosing a cleanser to have a healthy skin barrier. \n\n**The pH (Potential of Hydrogen / Power of Hydrogen)** is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of an aqueous solution.\n\n[For reference](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1fChGF6M8a4/Vxcq2iOIf_I/AAAAAAAAEv8/tqT54xF5wMcwSVVaqHBe8YROCx7wP6EVgCLcB/s1600/640px-216_pH_Scale-01.jpg]). The pH scale ranges from 0-14. The pH of distilled water is 7, this is neutral. Any solution with a pH below 7 is an acid and any solution with a pH above 7 is an alkali (or base).\n\nThe skin itself does not really have a pH. When they talk about the pH of the skin, they are referring to the pH of a very thin, naturally secreted, moist layer caused by normal secretions from sweat glands (sudoriferous glands), sebaceous glands (which secrete an oily substance called sebum), and the breakdown of fatty acids on the skin by good bacteria that live on our skin. Together these secretions create the **Acid Mantle**.\n\nYes, remember that I mentioned that skin's pH surface is one of the measures of skin barrier function?^[12] Well, it's gonna be relevant here!\n\nSkin's surface pH is said to be ranging from 4 to 6. Some papers say anywhere from 4 to 7 pH level. Having an average of 4.7, 5.5.^[32,33] The consensus is that our skin's pH is acidic to slightly/mildly acidic. This pH level helps maintain the strength and cohesiveness of the skin.^[34]\n\nWhy is it important to maintain this level of acidity tho? The formation of barrier lipids is observed to be delayed when the pH level is 7.4 or alkaline in nature.^[35] Hope you still remember the SC barrier's mortar.^[8] Lipid formation and metabolism require an acidic pH; alterations contribute to the SC barrier's integrity which may lead to different skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (Eczema), irritant contact dermatitis, ichthyosis, acne vulgaris, and Candida albicans infection.^[36]\n\nAlso, maintaining the skin's acidity doesn't disrupt the bacterial flora's (good bacteria) colonization, present on our skin. Whereas, reaching an alkaline pH promotes the dispersal of these bacteria.^[37] One example is the growth of  Propionibacterium acnes (P Acnes), a commensal bacterium found naturally on our skin, which is also one of the causes of acne vulgaris. P Acnes grow much better in an acidic environment, reaching alkaline pH can increase the number of P Acnes.^[38] Aside from these, alkaline pH skin can show severe irritation to ingredients such as sodium lauryl sulfate (a harsh detergent that we will talk about later).^[39]\n\nIt has also been observed that patients with acne vulgaris tend to have a higher skin pH in comparison to those who a normal skin. Majority of acne occurences are related to high skin pH. Further increase of this pH mirrors a state of SC instability.^[40]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nWhat increases our skin's pH? There are certain factors for that. Endogenous factors include: Skin moisture, sweat, sebum, anatomic site, genetic predisposition, race, age, atopic skin disease. Exogenous factors include: Soaps, detergents, cosmetic products, occlusive dressings, skin irritants, and topical antibiotics.^[41] We'll focus on the latter, with cleansers being the most significant. \n\nThe use of high pH cleansers can disrupt the acid mantle by increasing its acidic pH.^[37,40] A study showed that using an acidic cleanser reduced the number of acne and caused little irritation to acne-prone patients, as oppose to the group who used a soap bar (with a relatively high pH) - number of acne increased.^[42] \n\nIdeally, cleansers should have a pH of around 5.5.^[43] Avoid using soap bars, not only because almost all of them are alkaline (high pH)^[44] , they are also harsh and bring greatest changes to the barrier. Opt for liquid facial cleansers instead.^[45] \n\nEver wondered why some of feminine washes are formulated with acidic pH? (i.e. pH Care). ;)\n\nHow about the recently hyped Aztec Healing Clay Mask? Why is it combined with Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV)? Aztec's main ingredient is calcium bentonite clay which has a whooping pH level of 8 to 9.7! ACV has a pH level 3 to 5 - a perfect pH-neutralizer to bring down the bentonite clay's pH to an optimum skin pH level. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**You might want to avoid cleansers with SLS**\n\nProbably the most common surfuctant is *sodium lauryl sulfate* (SLS) also known as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). It is one of the cheap foaming agents commonly found on soaps, shampoos, toothpaste, etc. It is responsible for the foam or the rich lather you notice when you use such products.^[46]\n\nSurfuctants can penetrate into skin and compromise SC barrier function.^[47] SLS, among other surfuctants, can increase the SC's TEWL and can cause inflammation.^[48,49] Ceramides, one of the skin's lipids^[8], has been observed to decrease when skin is in contact with SLS.^[50] \n\nIt is also listed by [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/ebc959348.html), having a comedogenic rating of 5. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo TL;DR just choose a cleanser that is low pH and doesn't contain SLS then? NOT REALLY but IDEALLY yes. What I meant is there's a reason why some have nice skin despite using cleansers with high pH.  It's just that if you can avoid the drawbacks, then why not? But then again YMMV.\n\nBUT if semantics aside, what you really need to consider is to make sure you're using a **GENTLE** cleanser. Your skin shouldn't feel tight after cleansing. Not drying. Not that \"squeaky clean\" feeling as what others coin.  Just because you're oily, you're gonna tolerate that. No. Remember that I mentioned that sebum is one of the components of acid mantle? That squeaky clean feeling is removing this fatty layer which is important part of skin's natural protection, and stripping natural oils instead of excess oils.\n\nAvoid overwashing, too. Cleanse for a maximum of two times only. Some even like to just splash plain water in the morning. I know it's tempting to wash your face, especially for oily skin, but that's just a temporary fix. After a few minutes, you'll notice that oils will start to build up again. You might even get *acne detergicans* from overwashing. If it bothers you that much, I recommend having an oil face blotter instead which only removes excess oils. [Like this one from Clean & Clear](https://www.cleanandclear.com/blotting-papers/clean-clear-oil-absorbing-sheets)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm gonna list some IDEAL facial washes you can choose from. If I missed other ones, especially LOCAL cleansers or easily available, please do comment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Human Heart Nature] Facial Washes**\n\n[Months ago, I asked Human Heart Nature through their page the pH levels of their various cleansers](https://imgur.com/a/DPcKZ). They were pretty responsive. Listing them down.\n\n- [Nourishing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/nourishing-facial-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.50 to 5.2\n- [Hydrating Creamy Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/hydrating-creamy-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.0 to 6.0\n- [Balancing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/balancing-facial-wash.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 6.0\n- [Acne Defense Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/acne-defense-facial-wash-100ml.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 5.0\n\nPersonally,I prefer the Nourishing Facial Wash. It does what a cleanser should do - gentle cleansing. You might ask why not the Acne Defense Facial Wash since I have oily acne-prone skin type? My understanding is cleanser should only cleanse not treat your acne with acne-fighting ingredients. It's because cleanser is not meant to stay on our skin for a few minutes, thus such ingredients would not really contribute to acne. But if it works for some, go! If you want to try these facial washes, each of these has a small variant for a cheap price. Perfect for testing before committing to full sized bottles. \n\nKeep in mind that the surfuctants on these cleansers are not strong and little to no emulsifier present, thus you *might* not notice a rich foam or lather but that doesn't mean it's not doing it's job. Don't use a huge blob just to force a lather. These are also not fragrance-free. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Celeteque Dermoscience] Hydration Facial Wash](https://www.unilab.com.ph/products/celeteque-dermoscience-hydration-facial-wash/)**\n\nQuoting the product's description:\n> It has mild cleansing agents and a special combination of moisturizers that gently yet effectively clean without drying your skin.\n\nAnd according to one redditor who used digital pH meter to test the pH level of different cleansers, this one has a pH of 5.5! [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/63jk7a/psa_ph_levels_of_various_cleansers/)\n\nHas SLES - a milder version of SLS. I do like this one tho even my mom and my lil sis. Fragrance-free.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Sebamed] Facial Cleansers**\n\nHas two variants: \n\n- [for oily and combination skin](http://www.sebamed.com/products/product-page/?tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bproduct%5D=124&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Baction%5D=show&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bcontroller%5D=Product&cHash=33d05c27ea2ee6871e84e36fdd0a39e4)\n> Soap-free facial cleanser with the pH value of 5.5 of healthy skin to remove excess sebum and aid the skin achieving lipid balance of oily and combination skin\n\n- [for normal to dry skin](http://www.sebamed.com/products/product-page/?tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bproduct%5D=125&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Baction%5D=show&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bcontroller%5D=Product&cHash=62e9f9649f6166184bb8da0635908ac3)\n> Soap-free facial cleanser with the pH value of 5.5 of healthy skin to support and maintain the moisture and lipid balance of normal to dry skin\n\nThe cleansers look promising. I haven't tried them out tho.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Belo Essentials] Facial Washes](http://beloessentials.ph/product)**\n\n- *Pore Minimizing Facial Wash*\n\n> For smooth and radiant complexion, start with Belo Essentials Pore Minimizing Face Wash that tightens pores and whitens your skin in just 7 days! This soap-free, gentle cleanser contains Glutathione, Kojic Acid, and Gigawhite to whiten and skin vitamins to moisturize, revitalizing your skin with a radiant glow. Expertly formulated for oily skin.\n\nIt has a pH level of 5.3.\n\n- *Skin Hydrating Facial Wash*\n\n> Your first step to whiter skin, Belo Essentials Skin Hydrating Face Wash deeply cleanses without over-drying and whitens your skin in just 7 days! This soap-free, nourishing cleanser is infused with Glutathione, Kojic Acid, and Gigawhite to whiten and skin vitamins to moisturize, revealing clearer and whiter skin. Expertly formulated for normal to dry skin.\n\nIt has a pH level of 5.4.\n\nPersonal thoughts: The \"whitens your skin in just 7 days\" seems bogus. You can't just \"whiten\" your skin for that span. And expecting that from a cleanser? Nah. Anyway, if you're looking for a cleanser that's no-frills, these are not for you. They have tons of ingredients present.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**[[Safeguard] Derma Sense Facial Cleanser Sensitive Variant](http://www.sampleroom.ph/safeguard-derma-sense-gently-cleanses-facial-cleanser-acne-prone-skin)**\n\n> gently cleanses easily irritable skin with its mild, unscented formula. It removes dirt, impurities and excess oil, while maintaining your skin's natural layer. Dermatologically tested, DERMA SENSE brings professional care right to you\n\nAlso pH-balanced. I freaking want to try this one because it's well loved by fellow redditors here, but it's always out of stock! Yes, if a product is labeled for sensitive skin, I always prefer it because of their clean ingredients list (no fragrance, additives,etc), so less chance of breaking me out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Himalaya] Purifying Neem Face Wash](http://www.himalayaherbals.com/products/skincare/Purifying-Neem-Face-Wash.htm)**\n\n> Specially formulated to give you clear, problem free skin, a soap-free, daily use face wash gel that cleanses your skin by removing excess oil and impurities without over-drying. Neem, well-known for its purifying and antibacterial properties, kills problem-causing bacteria. Combined with Turmeric, it helps control acne and pimples leaving your skin soft, clear, refreshed and problem-free.\n\nAccording to some redditors it has a pH level of 5.5.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Cetaphil] Gentle Skin Cleanser](https://www.cetaphil.com/gentle-skin-cleanser)**\n\n> a mild, non-irritating formulation that soothes skin as it cleans. In fact, it's gentle enough for a baby's delicate skin. Designed specifically to work for all skin types, it is a simple, yet highly effective way to care for your skin.\n\nThis one has SLS. But my best friend uses this one and she really likes it! She said it's like putting a lotion on her face. Unfortunately, this broke me out. I can't handle SLS. It is also popular on r/AB and r/SCA. \n\n[Ingredients](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_7019242376.html)\n\nIf you can tolerate SLS, this is a perfect cleanser for you. Very short ingredients list. But I've read somewhere this has a pH of around 6.7. Not alkaline so it's kinda good nevertheless.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**ON MOISTURIZERS**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is probably the most vital part of skincare. Moisturizers can help with our SC barrier function if proper ingredients are used. From TEWL reduction, skin lipids' restoration, and other skin rejuvenation benefits.^[51]\n\nAll skin types need moisturizer. Yes, that is contrary to the popular belief that oily skin doesn't need moisturizer. You just need to find a moisturizer that will suit your needs. I presume you already know what your skin type is. If still not, I suggest reading this **[informative post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4kufkk/skin_basics_181_skin_types_setting_standards/)** \n\n**Skin types** vary in different measures but the most common would be: Normal (please step out, jk), Oily, Dry, Combination, and Sensitive. ([Paula's Choice recognizes that everyone has sensitive skin](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/basic-skin-care-tips/what-is-my-skin-type.html)).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere are different types/components/classes/properties of moisturizers. These are humectants, emolients, occlusives, and constituents of natural moisturizing factor/essential proteins.^[52,53] \n\n**Humectants**, as mentioned earlier,^[6] attract water from two sources - from the dermis into the epidermis and in humid conditions from the environment. In short, they are responsible for hydration! However, humectants are a double-edged sword. They increase TEWL too by enhancing water absorption from the dermis into the epidermis where it is easily lost to the environment.^[53] In simplest words, because humectans increased the water content, the skin now have enough water so the rest just evaporates! For this reason, humectants are best combined with occlusives.\n\n**[Some ingredients that act as a humectant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4885180/table/T3/)**:^[54,55]\n\n- *Glycerol/Glycerin*\n\nThis is the most common humectant. In fact, it is the second most frequently used cosmetic ingredient, next to water, documented through the FDA’s Voluntary Cosmetic Reporting Program.^[56] Glycerin is a skin-replenishing and restoring ingredient, meaning it is a substance found naturally in skin, helping to establish normal balance and hydration.^[57] \n\n- *Hyaluronic Acid (HA) or hyaluronan/Sodium Hyaluronate*\n\nThey are not actually the same. Sodium Hyaluronate is derived from Hyaluronic Acid but they still function the same.^[58] It is also present on our body and most abundant in our skin, which accounts for 50% of our body’s total HA level.^[59,60] It can hold 1000 times its water weight!^[61] This makes it a superstar ingredient in skin's hydration and even in skin aging.^[62-64]\n\n- *Propylene Glycol(PG) and Butylene Glycol (BG)*\n\nI've been seeing these ingredients mostly from sheet masks, which is pretty logical. PG and BG, not only a humectant, but can also act as an enhancer. They help active ingredients penetrate the skin.^[65,66] So from a few minutes a sheet mask stayed from your face, the ingredients present penetrated better on your skin; thus faster result (i.e. brightening). There are also studies concerning that PG is skin-sentisizing (can cause adverse reactions from repeated exposure).^[67-69] But the consensus seemed to be PG is safe to use in cosmetics.^[65] If anything, PG should be used in low concentrations^[69] just like other humectants.^[55]\n\n- *Panthenol (Vitamin B5)*\n\nPanthenol, in long-term use, significantly improved the moisture level and decreased TEWL of the skin.^[70,71] It is incredibly useful in wound healing, too.^[72]\n\n- *Urea*\n\n*Insert biased praises in this ingredient.* I just recently discovered this ingredient and I'm already in love. Urea? EWW. Don't worry it's a different urea when used in cosmetics. We are talking about hydroxyethyl urea. As you've read earlier, Urea is one of the natural moisturizing factors present in our skin.^[7]\n\nApparently, Urea is a well-known ingredient in treating xerosis (dry skin).^[73-75] As it turns out, it can also be beneficial to other skin types! Who said only dry skin needs that hydration?\nUrea, like other humectants, can increase the hydration and water-binding capacity of the horny layer.^[76,77] It reduces TEWL and the irritant reactions when skin is exposed to SLS.^[78,79] \n\nThis sexy ingredient has also been observed to have a keratolytic property!^[80,81] **Keratolytic** means the agent that assists keratolysis - \"the softening and shedding of the horny outer layer of the skin\".^[82] In other words, it helps with the desquamation of keratinocytes in the SC or corneocytes; or in more simpler term: *exfoliation*. Fear not, it gently exfoliates compare to active chemical exfoliants. The fun doesn't stop as Urea can also enhance the penetration of other topical ingredients.^[81,83,84]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Occlusives** sit on the skin, creating a physical barrier, blocking the TEWL in the SC. This is the reason why humectants are paired with occlusives. The former draws water onto the skin, while the latter traps this water. The most popular occlusive ingredient is **petrolatum** or petroleum jelly. At a minimum concentration of 5%, it can reduce TEWL by more than 98%!^^[54] \n\nBut you all know how greasy a petroleum jelly is, right? Petroleum Jelly (Vaseline), was previously labeled as highly comedogenic after testing on rabbit's ear. But this has been busted by a study that tested it on acne-prone patients. They concluded that greasiness doesn't equate with comedogenicity! \"The admonition for acne patients to seek \"oil-free\" skin care products has no scientific merit with regard to comedogenicity.\"^^[85] If a product is making you oily because of its nature, doesn't make it highly comedogenic.  But of course -.  There was also an issue that occlusives futher impair barrier function but it has been proven that occlusives, like petrolatum, even accelerated barrier recovery.^[86] I can attest to that. Petroleum jelly really helped when I overexfoliated my skin.\n\nBecause of aesthetic reasons, lighter occlusives came into picture like **lanolin, mineral oil**, and **silicones** which only reduce TEWL by 20–30%.^[54]\n\nJust look at how our fellow redditors are fond of occlusives A.K.A. **S L U G  L I F E**\n\n[I didn't choose the Slug life, the Slug life chose me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/73t814/humor_i_didnt_choose_the_slug_life_the_slug_life/.)\n\n[To all the slugs out there, you win](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/7xe07s/personal_to_all_the_slugs_out_there_you_win/)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Emolients** fill the gap between the layered corneocytes, smoothing the skin. This is the sticky feeling you notice on your moisturizer. \n\n\n---\n\n**[References used:](https://docdro.id/0zJ9xzb.)**\n\nEdit: I have to divide this into parts cause of characters restriction.",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea?

    "body": "I have **combination skin with an oily T-zone and dry acne prone cheeks laden with PIH**, an aftermath of 2020 and some wrong skincare choices. Since I am acne prone, I try to avoid perfume/fragrance, alcohol and essential oils in my products. \n\n*Processing img thx4k3izjnf61...*\n\nI have tried a bunch of sunscreens and these are the **best ones** I have settled on after a long 2 years of trial and error and time/money/effort invested. I have tried to include the swatches of all the four sunscreens and the white cast whereever it was possible (suncros) for the camera to capture. Lets begin.\n\nProduct Name: **Suncros Soft Matte Finish Gel, SPF 50, PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rave\n\nAvailability in India: Easily Available in India, offline and online.\n\nIngredient list: Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n\nSunscreen type: Physical / Mineral \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3zgtf9w6knf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0796b78286edcc7126df7421f34ae34c3ae1c7c8\n\nExperience & opinion: I have been using this sunscreen since almost one year. I used to use UV Doux before this for as long as I can remember, but had to stop using it as my skin got really sensitive and I had damaged my skin barrier. \n\nYou definitely cannot use the recommended two fingers of sunscreen with this one as it gets really heavy and suffocating. I tried layering it in small amounts (maybe just one fingertip at a time), let that settle and then apply another fingertip. I could only do two fingertips with this one. It did work for my extremely sensitive skin at that time and miraculously it was even calming and healing for my active acne and the PIH post acne was really minimal. The texture is in between a cream and a gel as can be seen in the picture. I totally understand why people detest it so much, the heavy suffocating feeling is a put off. I am not going to lie, it is heavy, feels like a suffocating layer on your face and is uncomfortable but you get used to the feeling once you see that its actually working for your extremely sensitive skin when nothing else does. You have to properly blend it in, take a minute or two to actually spread it on the skin. I have tried to photograph the white cast this one gives immediately post application. but once it settles in 30 minutes or so, the white cast is almost negligible and gives a primer finish (I am NC 43-45 for reference). I don't use makeup so I don't know how it would perform under makeup. The reapplication is difficult. I blot my face a lil before I apply this and again it takes a while to settle which is irritating if you are out and about. I could never reapply this more than once. It is sweat proof, tested it in peak of summer. This is the only zinc oxide based sunscreen that did not dry out my cheeks. \n\nAll said and done, I can't seem to make it work as my stand alone sunscreen as two fingertip amount is just not going to cut it when you are on all sorts of actives. Hence, since I have healed my skin barrier now and can use chemical sunscreens again, I use it over my cheeks (an area where my PIH is the worst) layered over my chemical sunscreen, after it completely dries. It's the perfect sweet spot for me and helps with PIH.\n\nRepurchase Status: Holy Grail (HG). Already repurchased twice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **Bello Photostable Emugel Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rave ❤\n\nAvailability in India: Easily available offline and online.\n\nIngredient list:\n\nKey Ingredients: Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol, Ethylhexyltriazone Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyltriazine, Diethyl amino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate.\n\nOther ingredients: Purified water, Dimethicone and Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicetyl phosphate, Ceteth-10 phosphate, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Myristyl Myristate, Octyldodecanol, Caprylic Triglyceride, Pentaerythirtyl distearate, Phenyl trimethicone, Vitamin E acetate, Carbomer copolymer, Disodium Edetate, Trolamine, Sodium polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Methyparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben, Isobutylparaben\n\nSunscreen type: Chemical\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dr24pvoaknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f726d323339bee404855990ab043e2a3b051acc2\n\nExperience & opinion: I have been using it everyday since approximately 4 months. The texture is creamy and you have to work it in for like 2 minutes into the skin. Immediately post-application, the sunscreen feels greasy to touch and looks oily but it gets absorbed into the skin in about 10 minutes and leaves a dewy finish which never goes away. I really like the dewy healthy glow it gives me. I can actually use 2 finger amount of sunscreen and it doesn't leave a white cast on my dark skin tone. If it gets into your eyes, it does sting. I can assume that dry skinned people would loooooove this in the winters. If you are combination or oily, I feel you can completely skip the moisturiser step when using this in summers. Would be perfect for inclusion in a minimal routine in the AM. On reapplication, it does leave a little bit of white cast on the sides of the face where we tend to have the peach-fuzz which will go away with a little bit of rubbing. Overall, this is the best budget sunscreen easily available in India which doesn't make us look like we have dressed up for a meme.\n\nRepurchase Status: HG, WRP. Already repurchased thrice. I will be trying out Photostable Gold SPF 55 in the summer, maybe it will replace this one. If not, I will always come back to this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **Biore UV Smooth Kids Milk Spf 50 PA++++**\n\nReview Type: Rave ❤\n\nAvailability in India: Availability is a serious issue. Used to get it from Dokodemo pre-pandemic. Haven't been able to source since.\n\nIngredient list: Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Glyceryl Behenate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Sorbitan Distearate, Sodium Acrylate/​Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Paraffin, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Ceresin, Isohexadecane, Arginine, Lauryl Methacrylate/​Sodium Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polysorbate 80, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Dextrin Palmitate, Agar, Petrolatum, Succinic Acid, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Methylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, BHT.\n\nSunscreen type: Chemical\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gjsnx8acknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e3e74e3ba70e6471b63c4d83bd3d41c2e876eab\n\nExperience & opinion: I had been using it everyday in dry summer days. Where I live is not very humid and that's why I think this one works so well for me. The texture is very aptly described as milk since it feels like a thick emulsion and spreads into nothingness into the skin. I can use the recommended amount of sunscreen with this one and it doesn't leave a white cast at all. It gets absorbed into the skin within 2 minutes and leaves behind a comfortable breathable layer of moisture on your skin. It does not dry down matte. It doesn't irritate my eyes. Its just so perfect for my combination skin even on my oily T-zone in peak summer days.  Reapplication is such a breeze. I have reapplied it in a taxi, in my office, before a meeting without any downtime. I just absolutely love everything about this sunscreen except that I think it has been discontinued and I am crying over the loss of my only true HG sunscreen. If anyone from Biore is reading this, please accept my plea and bring this back into production!!!!!\n\nRepurchase Status: HG forever. Although on the look out yet again for something that would match this one's status!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **The Blessing Tree Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50 PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rant\n\nAvailability in India: Available on Amazon.\n\nIngredient list: \n\nKey Ingredients: Octyl Methoxy Cinnamate, Oxybenzone, Titanium Dioxide, Octocrylene, Avobenzone, Zinc Oxide.\n\nOther ingredients: Aqua, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Diisopropyl Adipate, 1, 3, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Acrylates /​ C10-30 Alkyl Acrylare Cross Polymer, Propanediol, Diethylhexyl Sryngylidene Melonate, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Xylitylglucoside (and) Anhydroxylitol (and) Xylitol, Niacinamide, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexyl Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Perfume.  That was a task to type!!!!!\n\nSunscreen type: Hybrid\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/52ec0gwdknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8dd848f71d4a3939aa1b3ea6f13df4428170a9b\n\nExperience & opinion: I have had this for around 1 1/2 years now. But I never had the courage to put it on my face due to the infamous \"perfume\" in the inci list as I had a compromised barrier and could tolerate only physical sunscreens. All said and done, this has served well as an excellent body sunscreen which doesn't break the bank and provides me excellent protection. It is non-greasy unlike the other body sunscreens on the market. The white cast disappears within 5-10 minutes and you are good to get dressed and head out of the house. I apply it on all the exposed areas of my body - neck, upper shoulders, arms, hands (I don't feel guilty reapplying it even with the frequent hand washing as its relatively affordable + acts as a moisturiser for me) and feet. \n\nHowever for the sake of this review, I mustered all the courage I had to try it on the face but alas it did not suit me and caused me CC's by evening. It spreads well, leaves a white cast on skin which disappears in about 5-10 minutes, although the white residue along the hairline just doesn't disappear. I had to rub it excessively, almost rubbed it out to get it out of my peach fuzz! The finish on this sunscreen is not ultra matte and nor is it dewy to touch, its almost in between which is comfortable for combination and oily skin types. I was worried that this might get drying on my cheeks as the day progressed due to the zinc oxide content but it did not get dried at all. While I was typing the inci list, I realised it has Niacinamide in it!!! Yet another amazing ingredient to be present in this sunscreen. All in all, I would say if you don't have sensitive/sensitized skin and are okay with the \"O\" sunscreen filters, this is an excellent sunscreen.  \n\nRepurchase Status: Might repurchase for body. Not suitable for my face.\n\nThis review took me almost a month to write and photograph, but I am ultimately happy with the final write-up. I sincerely hope you enjoy reading this! I have tried to include everything based on the rules of this sub, but still if you have any questions, do hit me up.\n\nI will make another post of the sunscreens which didn't work for me and would include the likes of Cipla Rivela tint sunscreen, Hada Labo UV Perfect Gel, Skin Aqua UV Moisture Gel, Photostable Insta,  Aroma Magic Mineral Sunscreen and The Mom's Co. Mineral Based Sunscreen.",

I’ve always been both a science nerd (currently working myself through a Masters program to be a physician assistant) and a product junkie, and those two things have gloriously collided over the last few months to the benefit of my skin! The AB side bar has an excellent list of blogs, one of which I fell way down deep into is The Acid Queen. Alli, who runs the blog, is a seriously impressive DIY’er, which allowed me to get involved in her guinea pig pool for testing product formulations she was currently tinkering with. I’ve spent the last five weeks testing her moisture barrier repair moisturizer, Liquid Gold, and here are my thoughts! The formatting of these sections is shamelessly ripped from bloggers whose reviewing formats I admire: Fiddy Snails, Skin & Tonics, Fan-B, Snow, and of course, Her Majesty The Acid Queen Herself ;)\n\n**What it’s supposed to do:** Liquid Gold is a moisture barrier repair moisturizer/emulsion. (For more info on what a moisture barrier is, see Skin & Tonics excellent moisture barrier post linked in the sources.) Liquid Gold takes your thinned out, red, overexfoliated, stinging, weakened skin and makes it supple, bouncy, strong, and able to tolerate some serious heavy-lifting from acids and actives. It accomplishes all this with the magic of CERAMIDES *oooh ahhhh*\n\n**How to use it:** We’ve got two recommended options here. The first is a thin layer all over your face as the first occlusive step of…well, however many of those you have. The second is a thicker layer as a deeper moisturizing sleeping pack of sorts. I’ve been going with option 1, twice a day every day, AM and PM. Its consistency is slightly thicker than a serum, but not as thick as a gel cream or oily despite the ingredients list (more on that in a moment). It’s BRIGHT yellow-orange from the sea buckthorn, but spreads pretty easily and only leaves the tiiiiniest yellow cast after I’ve spread it in. However, my paleness makes Casper the ghost look like a tanning bed addict, so I imagine on most other skin tones it wouldn’t be visible at all. One of the things I love about this product is how quickly it dries down. I’m (gleefully) looking down the barrel at 15+ steps in my PM routine, so anywhere I don’t have to wait for dry time, I’m a happy camper. I don’t wear makeup often, but I’ve brought it out a number of days to see how Liquid Gold plays under makeup. I’m pleased to say it holds up just fine, without makeup settling into fine lines, caking, or otherwise disintegrating throughout the day.\n\n[**Here's some photos of it in action!**](http://imgur.com/a/knjp4)\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (Aqua), Propylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Niacinamide, Polyglyceryl-3 Methyglucose Distearate, Rosa Mosqueta (Rose) Hip Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Seed Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Fruit Oil, Panthenol, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Squalane (olive-derived), Cetyl Alcohol, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Ceramide NP, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA.\n\n**Notable Ingredients:** Oh, man…all of them?! This ingredients list is STRAIGHT FIRE if we are talking moisture barrier repair. Let’s break that down, shall we? I’m going to limit my highlights because otherwise I will literally never finish this review.\n\n**Ceramide Complex** (Ceramide NP, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP; Phytosphingosine; Cholesterol): The Beauty Brains, another fabulous “science of skincare” blog, has a great discussion of ceramides (see sources for link) and describes them so: “Ceramides form a kind of water-proofing barrier in the upper layers of skin. They’re not only critical for helping skin retain water but they also help repair the skin’s natural barrier and regulate cells. Ceramide production dwindles with age which can result in dry skin, wrinkles and even some types of dermatitis.” The other important thing to know about ceramides is that they are team players. Ceramides without fatty acids and cholesterol won’t get you very far. Specifically, ceramides penetrate best with a mixture of 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% fatty acids. So maybe you’ll find a product with ceramide floating around in the ingredient list, but good luck finding one with all three players…and if you do, cross your fingers they’re in the optimal ratio. Except that’s exactly what we have in Liquid Gold. Hell yes.\n\n**Niacinamide:** Why hello, my old friend! I’ll let the Queen herself explain the wonders for niacinamide: “One of the most studied skincare ingredients, niacinamide does everything: smooths fine lines and wrinkles, increases ceramide and fatty acid synthesis, regulates skin cell turnover, fades hyperpigmentation, evens skin tone, and has powerful anti-inflammatory properties.” Naturally then, it seems like niaciamide is in errything these days, but who knows how much is in there? Niacinamide is most effective at 3-5%, so unless the percentage is disclosed, we’re left stacking niacinmide products to reach that threshhold. Liquid Gold has 4%, which happens to be the same amount you’d get if this ingredient was included in a Curology prescription. Jackpot.\n\n**Sea Buckthorn:** Again, from The Beauty Brains: “[Sea buckthorn is] known for being rich in a number of bioactive compounds, including the following: vitamins A, B1, B2, C, D, K, and P; omega 3, 6, 7, and 9; 43 lipids, organic acids, amino acids, folic acids, tocopherols, flavonoids, phenols, terpenes, tannins, [and] 20 mineral elements.” Okay…but what does all that do for your skin? Well, we’ve got some studies that show all that goodness adds up to improved wound healing, protection from UV damage, and increased collagen production (see sources for link).\n\n**Rose Hip Oil:** High in oleic and linoleic acids, both of which are polyunsaturated fatty acids important for the integrity and regeneration of skin cell membranes. More moisture barrier magic going on here, my friends.\n\n**Okay, but seriously…**everything in this ingredients list is AMAZING. And rightly so, that’s the whole idea behind DIY in the first place: if you make it yourself, you know everything is there for a reason without any fluff or fillers.\n\n**How it worked:** And here’s where the other part of the title of this post comes into play. I have a long and glorious history of overexfolating my skin because…well, basically because that’s what I thought I was supposed to do. Physical exfoliants, all sorts of acids, inappropriately high strength retinoids…I would throw them all at my face at once every single day until literally my whole top layer of skin peeled off in sheets in the shower and I was shiny and red as a cherry. Even normally gentle products would sting like the devil, and I never questioned it because I honestly thought that’s how it was supposed to work. I’d fry the life out of my skin until I couldn’t handle it (so like 3-4 straight days of all this), then take a break for a week, maybe less, and then I’d start all over again. It was a roller coaster, let me tell you, and I did this for years. \n\nThen I found this post on FutureDerm that totally blew my mind about setting a schedule for building tolerance to retinoids (see sources for link). So I mapped out my schedule for all 24 weeks and promised myself I would be patient. I went without actives for over a month, then took another crack at one night with lower strength Tazorac, my drug of choice. Disappointingly, I still peeled like a snake for the next three days, despite babying my skin before and after the Tazorac. The next week, the same thing. I was beginning to doubt the wisdom of the retinoid tolerance schedule.\n\nEnter Liquid Gold.\n\nI got on Alli’s testing list and got a bottle in the mail soon after. I am not exaggerating when I say this is literally the most amazing shit I have ever put on my face in my life. Redness starting receding within days. A night with retinoids was no longer followed with peeling, pain, redness, or stinging — all of my hallmarks of a compromised moisture barrier. I tentatively and slowly moved through increasing the frequency of the retinoid. Once, twice, three times, four times a week, two interminable week periods per increase. So far, so good. I can feel fairly confident that Liquid Gold is the responsible party here since the rest of my non-actives routine stayed stable while I was tinkering with how to reintroduce them after my hiatus. Gradually, I added all my actives back in so that now, here’s what I’ve got going on my face: 1) Tazorac 0.05% gel 4x/week; 2) Curology 0.009% tretinoin, 9% azelaic acid, 1% clindamycin every night; 3) Paula’s Choice Resist 2% BHA morning and night; 4) Timeless 20% Vitamin C+E Ferulic Acid serum (AM only).\n\nEvery time I wash my face, I think today will be the day I finally overdo it and start feeling my barrier damaged again. BUT NO. My skin feels strong, bouncy, resilient, and looks glowing. My husband pokes me in the face, nods knowingly, and declares, “Chok chok.” He’s right. Now, I’ve been throw actives at my face like there’s no tomorrow and my face takes it like a champ. Eventually, I’m hoping to add in an AHA and up my Tazorac to 0.1%, but my schedule says I’m not allowed to do that for another few months. I’m glowing like the goddamn North Star thanks to all those actives, and I can keep coming back for more thanks to the almost surreal talents of Liquid Gold.\n\nI started to panic a bit the closer I got to the end of my bottle since this was a DIY formula since I absolutely had neither time time nor inclination to whip up a batch myself and didn’t know what I would do when I ran out. The day before I was about to email Alli and beg her to keep making me some forever in exchange for my first born child, SHE OPENED HER OWN SHOP ONLINE!!! This is the best news my skin has ever had. I immediately purchased a 60 mL glass pump bottle of Liquid Gold for $24 from Stratia, The Acid Queen’s shop website. After having such a fabulous experience with this, you better believe I threw Rewind, her DMAE serum, into my cart with a quickness. \n\n**Conclusion:** This shit is my life now. It let’s me go active-crazy without unduly compromising my moisture barrier and makes my skin feel stronger than it has in my entire life. It’s affordable, pleasant to use day and/or night, well-formulated, conscientiously packaged, and made in-house by a fellow skincare junkie on the other side of the country. I couldn’t be happier to love this product and have the opportunity to support her shop.\n\n[Stratia Skin, Liquid Gold, $24](https://www.stratiaskin.com/collections/skincare/products/liquid-gold)\n\n*Disclosure: I was asked to write a review of this product that was originally intended only for Alli to read for formulation feedback and my experience with the product. I only decided to write it for public consumption when I realized she was opening the shop and other people could get this product. I did not accept the product with an agreement to review it positively, nor have I received any monetary compensation for doing so. All opinions expressed above are my own.*\t\n\n**Sources**\n[The Beauty Brains: Is sea buckthorn oil good for skin?](http://thebeautybrains.com/2014/07/is-sea-buckthorn-oil-good-for-skin/)\n[The Beauty Brains: Is rose hip oil good for anti-aging?](http://thebeautybrains.com/2015/01/is-rose-hip-oil-good-for-anti-aging/)\n[The Beauty Brains: Are ceramides good anti-aging ingredients?](http://thebeautybrains.com/2015/04/are-ceramides-good-anti-aging-ingredients-episode-77/)\n[Stratia Skin: Liquid Gold](https://stratiaskin.com/products/liquid-gold)\n[Skin & Tonics: The Importance of Fatty Acids, pH & the Moisture Barrier: How I Eliminated my Acne & Decreased my Skin Sensitivity](http://skinandtonics.com/the-importance-of-fatty-acids-ph-moisture-barrier-how-i-eliminated-my-acne-decreased-my-skin-sensitivity/)\n[The Acid Queen: Fun with DIY: Beginners Recipe Shopping List](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/02/16/fun-with-diy-beginners-recipe-shopping-list/)\n[The Acid Queen: Fun with DIY: Moisture Barrier Serum](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2015/11/03/fun-with-diy-moisture-barrier-serum/)\n[FutureDerm: 11 Things You Never Knew about Retinol and Retinoids Until Now](https://www.futurederm.com/11-things-you-never-knew-about-retinol-and-retinoids-until-now/)",

I tested Liquid Gold on half my face for two weeks and it didn't cause any visible changes. No increase in acne, no miraculous redness reduction. I find it very minimally moisturizing. My skin still feels dry and tight after letting it sink in (which I agree happens quickly) and I have to follow it with a heavier moisturizer (or three.) There is just a tiny amount of stickiness and little to no slip after it dries/absorbs.\n\nI, too, have been trying to find a way to use actives without over-exfoliating. Daily use of a mild BHA and AHA has proven too harsh in the past, so I've been increasing in frequency very  slowly and now I'm up to every other day with no discomfort or peeling, even when combining BHA and AHA and using my stronger products.\n\nI'm really happy with Liquid Gold and see myself using it indefinitely. The price and ingredients speak for themselves, and the packaging is really nice too.

Kennedy Jr. (RFK Jr.), calling it the “Louisiana MAHA bill”—a reference to his own “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) agenda that aims to crack down on food colorants, food additives, and seed oils.\nPer Senate Bill 14, beginning in 2028, Louisiana public schools and nonpublic school receiving state funds will be prohibited from serving in school breakfasts, lunches, and aftercare meals any foods containing one of 15 ingredients:\n\n- Blue dye 1\n- Blue dye 2\n- Green dye 3\n- Red dye 3\n- Red dye 40\n- Yellow dye 5\n- Yellow dye 6\n- Azodicarbonamide (ADA)\n- Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)\n- Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)\n- Potassium bromate\n- Propylparaben\n- Acesulfame potassium\n- Aspartame\n- Sucralose\n\n\nThe prohibition does not apply to foods sold in vending machines or at concession stands.\nSenate Bill 14 also contains a provision for the disclosure of “harmful ingredients,” which requires labeling of food products to disclose when they contain one of 40+ ingredients, beginning in 2028. The bill also requires foodservice establishments to display disclaimers on their menus or in a visible location when they prepare foods with seed oils (i.e., canola/rapeseed, corn, cottonseed, grapeseed, rice bran, safflower, soybean, and sunflower oils).\n\nRegarding the ingredient disclosure provision, manufacturers must label foods containing any of 40+ ingredients with a QR code directing consumers to a webpage that displays the following disclaimer: “NOTICE: This product contains [ingredient]. For more information about this ingredient, including FDA approvals, click HERE.” The disclaimer must link to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) webpage on food chemical safety. The 40+ ingredients covered by this provision are:\n\n- Acesulfame potassium\n- Acetylated esters of mono- and diglycerides (acetic acid ester)\n- Anisole\n- Aspartame\n- ADA\n- BHA\n- BHT\n- Bleached flour\n- Bromated flour\n- Calcium bromate\n- Canthaxanthin\n- Diacetyl\n- Dimethylamylamine (DMAA)\n- Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DSS)\n- Interesterified palm oil\n- Interesterified soybean oil\n- Lactylated fatty acid esters of glycerol and propylene glycol\n- Lye\n- Morpholine\n- Olestra\n- Partially hydrogenated oil (PHO)\n- Propylparaben\n- Sodium aluminum sulfate\n- Sodium lauryl sulfate\n- Sodium stearyl fumarate\n- Stearyl tartrate\n- Sucralose\n- Synthetic trans fatty acid\n- Thiodipropionic acid\n- Toluene\n- Potassium aluminum sulfate\n- Potassium bromate\n- Potassium iodate\n- Propylene oxide\n- Canthaxanthin\n- Blue dye 1\n- Blue dye 2\n- Citrus red dye 2\n- Green dye 3\n- Red dye 3\n- Red dye 40\n- Yellow dye 5\n- Yellow dye 6\n- Certified food colors by FDA\n\nAlthough several states have passed bills inspired by MAHA in recent months—such as Oklahoma, Texas, and West Virginia—the movement is controversial. Some stakeholders have disputed MAHA claims, calling them “an oversimplification without a clear understanding of the myriad complexities facing the production of safe and nutritious foods” that “ignores current food and animal food regulatory systems designed to promote public and animal health.”",

I read your earlier post on Top 10-20 Cleansing Oils & Gels also. \n\nI'm looking to introduce a new cleanser to my daily routine and was playing with the idea of an oil cleanser.  So much choice, but this should make it easier.  Ideally, I'm looking for something without propylene glycol. butylene glycol, essential oils or added fragrance.  And no parabens - was shocked to see Phytomer still incorporating these!  The ATrue Black Tea Cleanser in your previous post looked interesting; simple list of ingredients, although ironically green tea is the first ingredient in the list, rather than black tea!  Aromatica Orange Cleansing Sherbet looks interesting, as does Clinique - so simple but effective.  Have you any idea what Kakadu (reference Sidmool) means??\n\nWhich do you use incidentally?

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

    "body": "So we all know there are conspiracies that range from the illuminati, to lizards taking over the world, to mole people living underground making french fries for an upcoming Earth Party. I have a conspiracy that i recently dug into, and im not sure how much of it is actually impactful on our bodies or lives, but ill put on my tin foil hat and share the information ive found so a discussion can be started. \n\n**note to all: im not saying anything about anything, i just went through a few links i found interesting and came up with a crazy conclusion. i am not a doctor and im sure i got some information wrong.**\n\nFirstly, is there a powerful group of people who try to control the general population? probably, but maybe not. if there was though, they definitely would be trying to alter and shape us in multiple ways, for multiple reasons. **what if one of these ways is through giving us excess estrogen?**\n\n**Estrogen is possibly being put into our bodies via everyday items containing xenoestrogen.**\n\nfirst, a little background info. \n\nwhat is estrogen? how does it effect the human body?\n\n>Estrogen, or oestrogen, is a category of sex hormone responsible for the development and regulation of the female reproductive system and secondary sex characteristics. \n\n\n\n**It is basically the hormone that makes women, women**. \n\n\n\nokay, now regarding the conspiracy, recently **i came across the rabbit hole of xenoestrogen https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenoestrogen . its basically a synthetic compound imitating estrogen**. it can be found in common products that we use everyday. **this is apparently everywhere. literally. xenoestrogen is found in BPA, phthalates, parabens, zeranol, insecticides, pesticides, and even the most widely used herbicide in the U.S.**\nwhy is this important? we'll get back to that later.\n\nwell first, **what is BPA**? \nsinply put, BPA is used to make certain types of plastics. plastics we use every day.\n\n> \"BPA-based plastic is clear and tough, and is made into a variety of common consumer goods, **such as plastic bottles including water bottles, food storage containers (commonly called \"Tupperware\"), baby bottles,[3] sports equipment, CDs, and DVDs.\"**\n\n>Epoxy resins derived from BPA are used to **line water pipes, as coatings on the inside of many food and beverage cans, and in making thermal paper such as that used in sales receipts.[4] In 2015, an estimated 4 million tonnes of BPA-derived chemical were produced, making it one of the highest volume of chemicals produced worldwide**.[5]\n\n>**BPA is a xenoestrogen, exhibiting estrogen-mimicking, hormone-like properties.**[6] Although the effect is very weak, the pervasiveness of BPA-containing materials raises concerns. **Since 2008, several governments have investigated its safety,** which prompted some retailers to withdraw polycarbonate products. Since then, BPA-free plastics have been manufactured using alternative bisphenols such as bisphenol S and bisphenol F, but there is controversy around whether these are actually safer.[7]\n\n\n**BPA Health Effects**\n\n**>BPA's ability to mimic the effects of natural estrogen** derive from the similarity of phenol groups on both BPA and estradiol, which enable this synthetic molecule to trigger estrogenic pathways in the body.[23] Typically phenol-containing molecules similar to **BPA are known to exert weak estrogenic activities, thus it is also considered an endocrine disruptor** (ED) and estrogenic chemical.[24] **Xenoestrogens is another category the chemical BPA fits under because of its capability to interrupt the network that regulates the signals which control the reproductive development in humans and animals.**[25]\n\n>BPA has been found to bind to both of the nuclear estrogen receptors (ERs), ERα and ERβ. It is 1000- to 2000-fold less potent than estradiol. **BPA can both mimic the action of estrogen and antagonize estrogen**, indicating that it is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) or partial agonist of the ER. At high concentrations, BPA also binds to and acts as an antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR).\n\n**In 1997, adverse effects of low-dose BPA exposure in laboratory animals were first proposed.[26] Modern studies began finding possible connections to health issues caused by exposure to BPA during pregnancy and during development**. As of 2014, research and debates are ongoing as to whether BPA should be banned or not.\n\n\nAccording to the European Food Safety Authority \"BPA poses no health risk to consumers of any age group (including unborn children, infants and adolescents) at current exposure levels\".[29] **But in 2017 the European Chemicals Agency concluded that BPA should be listed as a substance of very high concern due to its properties as an endocrine disruptor.[30]**\n\nIn 2012, the United States' Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the use of BPA in baby bottles.[31]\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also holds the position that BPA is not a health concern. In 2011, Andrew Wadge, the chief scientist of the United Kingdom's Food Standards Agency, commented on a **2011 U.S. study on dietary exposure of adult humans to BPA,[32] saying, \"This corroborates other independent studies and adds to the evidence that BPA is rapidly absorbed, detoxified, and eliminated from humans – therefore is not a health concern.\"[33]**\n\n**The Endocrine Society said in 2015 that the results of ongoing laboratory research gave grounds for concern about the potential hazards of endocrine-disrupting chemicals – including BPA – in the environment, and that on the basis of the precautionary principle these substances should continue to be assessed and tightly regulated**.[34] A 2016 review of the literature said that the potential harms caused by BPA were a topic of scientific debate and that further investigation was a priority because of the **association between BPA exposure and adverse human health effects including reproductive and developmental effects and metabolic disease**.[35]\n\nIn **July 2019,** the European Union upheld a decision by the European Chemicals Agency to **list BPA as a substance of very high concern, the first step in the procedure for restrictions of its use. The decision is based on concerns about BPA's toxicity for human reproduction.**[36]\n\n\nwhat are **phthalates**?\n\n>They are mainly used as plasticizers, i.e., substances added to plastics to increase their flexibility, transparency, durability, and longevity.\n>**Phthalates are used in a large variety of products**, from enteric coatings of pharmaceutical pills and nutritional supplements to viscosity control agents, gelling agents, film formers, stabilizers, dispersants, lubricants, binders, emulsifying agents, and suspending agents. End-applications include adhesives and glues, agricultural adjuvants, building materials, personal-care products, medical devices, detergents and surfactants, packaging, children's toys, modelling clay, waxes, paints, printing inks and coatings, pharmaceuticals, food products, and textiles. Phthalates are also frequently used in soft plastic fishing lures, caulk, paint pigments, and sex toys made of so-called \"jelly rubber\". Phthalates are used in a variety of household applications such as shower curtains, vinyl upholstery, adhesives, floor tiles, food wrap film, and cleaning materials. Personal-care items containing phthalates include perfume, eye shadow, moisturizer, nail polish, liquid soap, and hair spray.[11] \"\n\n\nwhat are **parabens**?\n\n**>Parabens are a class of widely used preservatives in cosmetic and pharmaceutical products.** Chemically, they are a series of parahydroxybenzoates or esters of parahydroxybenzoic acid (also known as 4-hydroxybenzoic acid). Parabens are effective preservatives in many types of formulas. These compounds, and their salts, are used primarily for their bactericidal and fungicidal properties. They are found in shampoos, commercial moisturizers, shaving gels, personal lubricants, topical/parenteral pharmaceuticals, suntan products, makeup,[1] and toothpaste. They are also used as food preservatives.\n\n\n**health effects**\n\n>Most of the available paraben toxicity data are from single-exposure studies, meaning one type of paraben in one type of product. According to paraben research this is relatively safe, posing only a negligible risk to the endocrine system. **However, since many types of parabens in many types of products are used commonly, further assessment of the additive and cumulative risk of multiple paraben exposure from daily use of multiple cosmetic and/or personal care products is needed.[8] FDA states that they have no information that use of parabens in cosmetics has any effect on health. They continue to consider certain questions and evaluate data about parabens' possible health effects.**[9]\n\n\n\n**estrogen effects**\n\n>**Animal experiments have shown that parabens have weak estrogenic activity, acting as xenoestrogens**.[13]The estrogenic activity of parabens increases with the length of the alkyl group. It is believed that propylparaben is estrogenic to a certain degree as well,[15] though this is expected to be less than butylparaben by virtue of its less lipophilic nature. Since it can be concluded that the estrogenic activity of butylparaben is negligible under normal use, the same should be concluded for shorter analogs due to estrogenic activity of parabens increasing with the length of the alkyl group.\n\n\n\nbut like they stated earlier in the article, >**However, since many types of parabens in many types of products are used commonly, further assessment of the additive and cumulative risk of multiple paraben exposure from daily use of multiple cosmetic and/or personal care products is needed**\n\nwhat is **Zeranol**?\n\n>**Zeranol is currently used as an anabolic growth promoter for livestock in the US[76] and Canada**.[77] It has been banned in the EU since 1985,[78] but is still present as a contaminant in food through meat products that were exposed to it.[12]\n\n\n\nwhat is **Altrazine**?\n\n>**Atrazine is widely used as an herbicide **to control broad-leaf weed species that grow in crops such as corn, sugarcane, hay and winter wheat. Atrazine is also applied to Christmas trees, residential lawns, golf courses, and other recreational areas. Atrazine is the second largest selling pesticide in the world and **estimated to be the most heavily used herbicide in the United States**.[12]\n\n\nthere are other sources of xenoestrogen in our every day lives, but this is getting a little long. basically though, a bunch of now banned/restricted pesticides had it. sources confirm that there are still large **traces of all of these compounds in the soil, air, and water, due to their inability to degrade easy.**\n\ntldr; \n\neven though xenoestrogen is apparently \"less potent\" than for example, estradiol, a steroid hormone, we arent only being affected from one source. **we are being bombarded from everywhere. with so many different sources of xenoestrogen in things we use every single day, multiple times per day, and with no/few studies being done on how all of these combine and how they effect our bodies, i find it hard to believe that we are not being affected. what do you think?**\n\n\n\nsources\n1. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen\n2. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenoestrogen\n3. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_A\n4. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phthalates\n5. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraben",

My condition means that my body over produces estrogen.  Among other awful symptoms including daily chronic pain.  I learned that by reducing many foods and staying away from things like bpa esspecially.  I got better control of my condition and not as affected as I used to be.  Ive opted for more natural means including switching to paraban free shampoo/condition.  \n\nBy eliminating all the things that triggered my body, basically eating restrictive and natural.  It became like night and day for my health.  Many foods affect our hormones regularly, im just someone who cannot tolerate it as much as some.

In this study, the different effects of BPA on ovarian and testis development in goldfish (Carassius auratus) and the different mechanisms underlying these effects were investigated. The gonadosomatic index (GSI) and gonadal histology demonstrated that BPA diminished ovarian maturation in goldfish, which recovered after BPA treatment withdrawal. In males, BPA disrupted testis maturation, but this disruption could not be recovered after BPA treatment withdrawal. The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad (HPG) axis-related genes sgnrh, fshβ and lhβ were significantly decreased in BPA-treated female fish, while no changes in sex steroid hormone levels and no TUNEL and PCNA staining were found in the ovary, suggesting that BPA may reduce ovarian maturation through the HPG axis. In male fish, TUNEL staining was found in 1 μg L-1 BPA-exposed germ cells and 50 and 500 μg L-1 BPA-exposed Leydig cells. Decreases in 11-KT levels were also found in 50 and 500 μg L-1 BPA-exposed fish, but BPA did not affect genes associated with the HPG axes. **This result shows that BPA disrupts testis maturation through apoptosis of germ cells and Leydig cells, thus inducing decreases in 11-KT levels that disrupt spermatogenesis.** Collectively, our findings provide insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying BPA disturbance of goldfish reproduction.",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

    "body": "It is a solid argument for not wanting to get the jab. In all honest though, does the FDA stamp really mean anything when there are chemicals used in our foods today that are banned in other countries? Here is a list of some FDA approved chemicals that they have approved in the name of \"profits\" for big companies and why you shouldn't trust something just cause it has a stamp of approval...\n\n\nBanned Ingredients #1 — **Dough Conditioners**\nDough conditioners, such as potassium bromate and azodicarbonamide are chemicals used to improve the strength and texture of bread dough. Dough conditioners are often found in white breads, rolls, and “egg breads.” However, they are possible human carcinogens (potassium bromate is classified as a category 2B carcinogen). And exposure to them is known to cause respiratory sensitivity, such as asthma or other breathing difficulty. As such, potassium bromate is banned in China, India, Brazil, the European Union, and Canada. And azodicarbonamide is banned in Australia and Europe.\n\nBanned Ingredients #2 — **Brominated Vegetable Oil (BVO)**\nBrominated vegetable oil (BVO) was originally patented by chemical companies as a flame retardant. But now, BVO can be found in certain colorful sports drinks and citrus-flavored sodas as an emulsifier. Studies have shown that BVO isn’t harmless. It actually accumulates in human tissue, as well as breast milk, and can cause memory loss over time. Bromine toxicity can lead to skin rashes, appetite loss, and heart problems, as well as major organ damage and birth defects. Bromine also competes with iodine for receptor sites in the body, which can increase risk for iodine deficiency, autoimmune disease, and even certain cancers. And although BVO has been banned in countries like Japan, it’s been used in food and beverages in American since 1977 when it was approved by the FDA.\n\nBanned Ingredients #3 — **Propylparaben**\nIn the United States, propylparaben is used as a preservative in tortillas, muffins, trail mix, pies, sausage rolls, and more. Research has found that it can affect sex hormones and sperm counts in young rats. Cornell University research had also indicated that exposure to parabens may be linked to breast cancer. Environmental Working Group senior scientist Johanna Congleton, Ph.D., tells us, “It is of great concern to us that the use of an endocrine-disrupting chemical in our food is considered safe by our own government… Studies show that chemicals that disrupt hormone signaling can lead to developmental and reproductive problems.” Propylparaben is totally legal in the U.S., but in 2006 the European Food Safety Authority banned the use of propylparaben in food. And in 2015, the EU went further – also banning propylparaben from cosmetic products.\n\nBanned Ingredients #4 — **BHA and BHT**\nBHA and BHT are popular man-made antioxidants used in dry mixes, cereals, and dehydrated potato products to preserve them and increase shelf life. They’re also found in product packaging. These are possible carcinogens and endocrine disruptors — meaning that they can alter the normal function of your hormones and lead to disease. BHA and BHT are banned for use in food and beverages by the United Kingdom, European Union, Japan, and other countries.\n\nBanned Ingredients #5 — **Synthetic Food Dye**\nFood manufacturers use synthetic food dyes, such as blue 2, yellow 5, and red 40, to enhance the coloring of certain foods and ingredients to make them more appealing to consumers. Some foods that contain food dyes include beverages (like juices, sports drinks, and sodas), candy, and glazes used in baked goods and sweets. They’re even used in silly things like making mustard more yellow, salmon more pink, and jarred pickles the perfect shade of yellow-green. And don’t even get me started on maraschino cherries!\n\nResearch has linked consumption of synthetic dyes to an increased risk for numerous conditions, like tumors and hyperactivity in children. What’s even more infuriating is that the U.S. used to use natural food dyes until the mid-19th century. But then, food manufacturers realized it was much cheaper to use chemicals, which turned food even brighter colors.\n\nSynthetic food dyes are banned in Europe and Australia, where more natural coloring compounds are used. For example, in most of the world, Fanta contains actual fruit juice and is dyed naturally. But Americans enjoy Fanta colored with petroleum-derived artificial dyes like red 40 and yellow 6.\n\nBanned Ingredients #6 — **GMOs**\nGenetically modified organisms (GMOs) have been around since the 1980s. But they have become a controversial topic — and for good reason. While they’re widespread in the U.S. — with most U.S. soy, sugar beets, corn, canola, cotton, and alfalfa being GMO crops — many European countries have banned or regulated them due to public safety concerns.\n\nOne common genetic manipulation involves altering DNA in certain crops to make them resistant to herbicides. One of the most common herbicides used in conjunction with these GMOs is glyphosate, the primary active ingredient in the weedkiller Roundup. Glyphosate consumption is linked to cancer. In fact, several people have won cases that allege glyphosate caused their cancer. Bayer, the manufacturer of Roundup, is currently fighting cancer lawsuits that involve over 13,000 people. As of June 2019, there were bans or major restrictions on use of glyphosate in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Czech Republic, Denmark, El Salvador, France, Germany, Greece, India, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Scotland, Slovenia, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. \n\nBanned Ingredients #7 — **Roxarsone**\nThe arsenic-based drug roxarsone, was routinely used in chicken in the U.S. until July 2011, when Pfizer decided to stop selling it. However, there is no actual ban on the use of arsenic in the raising of chickens for food. Roxarsone was used to increase the pink coloring of raw chicken meat, to speed the growth of the birds before slaughter, and to prevent parasites in the chicken’s stomach. Research shows chronic exposure to arsenic can lead to anemia, skin lesions, kidney damage. It can also increase the risk for certain cancers, miscarriage, and birth defects. The European Union banned the use of arsenic-based drugs, while many chicken products in the U.S. still contain it.\n\nBanned Ingredients #8 — **Ractopamine**\nIn the U.S., ractopamine is a muscle enhancer for pigs, cows, and turkeys. And, like other harmful substances used during the raising of animals, it doesn’t just go away when the animal is slaughtered. Some of it is still left in the meat you buy. Ractopamine is banned in 122 countries including Russia, mainland China, Taiwan, and many countries across Europe. This is because it’s been linked to reproductive and cardiovascular damage in humans, as well as chromosomal and behavioral changes.\n\nBanned Ingredients #9 — **Herbicides, Insecticides, Fungicides**\nHerbicides, insecticides, and fungicides are widely used on crops in the U.S. food system to keep them free of bugs and diseases. Meanwhile, other countries see (and act on) the danger they pose to humans. Of the 374 active ingredients authorized for agricultural use in the U.S. in 2016, the European Union banned 72 of them. Wow.\n\nBanned Ingredients #10 — **Olestra**\nOlestra, or Olean, is a cholesterol-free fat substitute created by Procter & Gamble. The FDA approved it for use in foods in the 1990s and it’s still used in certain potato chips and french fries. But Olestra may cause extremely unpleasant digestive reactions, like diarrhea and leaky bowels. Consuming a lot of it can also lead to deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, K, as well as carotenoids. Both Canada and the United Kingdom have banned the ingredient.\n\nBanned Ingredients #11 — **Synthetic Hormones**\nSynthetic hormones, such as rBGH and rBST, are widely used in the U.S. dairy industry. The primary reason for this is to increase milk production in dairy cows. However, rBGH increases IGF-1 levels in humans and may increase the risk of developing cancer. Additionally, cows treated with rBGH are more likely to develop mastitis, an udder infection, requiring treatment with antibiotics. Canada, the EU, and other countries have banned these compounds.",

They approve of alcohol, which aside from the thousands of drunk driving accidents, they also cause severe issues if used for too long or in too much quantity at once. Look at fast food, packed full of preservative chemicals and other crap that all leads to health problems as well. All of the cheap processed foods and stuff as well. My point being is that just because the FDA approves something doesn’t necessarily mean it’s good for you. Look at the anthrax vaccine that was pumped into soldiers for years which now are known to have adverse reactions once you’re older. The covid vaccine itself seems to have higher than average reactions and even deaths that if this was any other vaccine would be stopped immediately.",

Apart from some Neutrogena products and No7 Beautiful Skin Blemish Defence Serum, they contain \"alcohol denat.\", which is a dealbreaker for me as I try to avoid drying alcohols as much as I can. \n\nBHAs are few and very far in between, in addition to not being labelled as such and most probably without the percentage of salicylic acid contained or whether it's in the right pH to be effective. \n\nI haven't done a price comparison, and since I found them in Boots I've used the online site's price point. Prices are only as a guide, they may be cheaper/more expensive elsewhere. Ingredients are highlighted to point out the position of salicylic acid, as well as presence of drying alcohols and parfum for those irritated by them. \n\nAdditional suggestions, opinions and reviews are very welcome!\n\n* PRODUCT: Boots Skin Clear Deep Blackhead Cleansing Lotion\n\nPRICE: £2.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua (Water), **Alcohol denat.**, **Salicylic acid**, PPG-1-PEG-9 lauryl glycol ether, Butylene glycol, Potassium hydroxide, Ammonium glycyrrhizate, **Parfum (Fragrance)**, Dipropylene glycol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Deep Cleansing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.29 for 65 exfoliating pads\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat., Salicylic Acid,** Isoceteth-20, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Hydroxide, Triethanolamine, Allantoin, **Parfum**, **Menthol**, Benzyl Salicylate, Disodium EDTA, Limonene, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Pads\n\nPRICE: 5.39 for 65 pads\n\nINGREDIENTS:Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, **Salicylic Acid**, Hydrogen Peroxide, **Parfum**, Sodium Hydroxide, Dextrin, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben.\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Superfruits Refreshing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.07\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, Glycerin, **Salicylic Acid**, **Parfum**, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Sodium Hydroxide, Propylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Citric Acid, Limonene, Citronellol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Hexyl Cinnamal, Rubus Idaeus Juice, Trideceth-9, Vaccinium Macrocarpon Fruit Juice, Geraniol, Bisabolol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Garnier Pure Active line (various)\n\nPRICE: from £4.99 to £7.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: I can't find an ingredients list anywhere, which is frustrating but as a guide, I remember putting all the Garnier products down because they contain \"Alcohol Denat.\" The packaging lists 2% salicylic acid.

    "body": "Tl;dr: I'm concerned that my fancy new hairdresser is a waste of time and money. \n\nLast summer, I bleached my naturally dark brown hair yellow and then dyed it ginger. \n\nThen dyed it pink. \n\nThen dyed it red. \n\nThen dyed it black. \n\nAs a result of all that, I had to reduce the length of it from bra wire to shoulder - a necessary evil but my goal is now to leave it to grow out naturally and get my nice long natural hair back. Even longer, preferably. \n\nI found a hairdresser in my city who specialises in long hair. His entire schtick is long hair: growing it, maintaining it, etc. He was trained by this late great world renowned long hair specialist called George Michael. It all sounded perfect.\n\nThe cut was fine, but he said something that made me sceptical: \n\n*Hair should all be one length with no shorter fringe or layers because otherwise it 'focuses' on trying to even out the different lengths.* \n\nIs this true? It sounds like nonsense to me. \n\nThe second thing that made me doubtful was the shampoo he recommended I use contains sodium laureth sulfate. \n\nI shelled out for this three step set of products (George Michael brand) that he insists on his clients using. It wasn't cheap at around £70 for the set, so I expected them to be full of good things and stupidly didn't bother checking what was in them until a few weeks later when I noticed my hair was feeling dry - in my defence, his website claimed the shampoo was 'free of detergents' so I assumed there wouldn't be any SLS! \n\nThe ingredients are as follows:\n\n*Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, PEG 80 Sorbitan Laurate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Disodium Lauroampodiacetate, PEG 150 Distearate, Sodium Laureth 13 Carboxylate, Citric Acid, Gylcol Stearate (and other ingredients), Propylparaben, Diazolidinyl Urea, Mathylparaben, Propylene Glycol, Color (FD&C Red#33 & D&C Orange #4) and Fragrance*\n\nI thought SLS was meant to be a big no no for maintaining healthy hair, especially if it's wavy which mine is. \n\nAs for the rest of the ingredients, I have no idea whether they're bad or good. Sodium trideceth sulfate sounds like it could be similarly drying but I wouldn't know. \n\nThis whole thing has left me doubtful of his advice. I'm meant to be going back to see him at the end of the month but I currently feel like he's taking me for a ride with these expensive products. He has loads of good testimonials so I feel stupid for doubting him. What do you guys think? \n\n(P.S. Sorry for the essay!)",

Also only apply shampoo on the roots and nowhere else.\n\n>Hair should all be one length with no shorter fringe or layers because otherwise it 'focuses' on trying to even out the different lengths.\n\nSince its harder to always cut layered hair equally much I'd say thats decent advise. It's easier to maintain healthy hair when it's all one length as you can easily always cut a tiny bit off the ends  meanwhile with layers it's hard to get every piece. Also long hair will thin out at the ends by default so no reason to make it worse with layers. Weird wording though.\n\n\nOverall I believe fancy hairdressers are a waste of money and so is a lot of the fancy hair products. You can literally use any shampoo and it will be alright, the only actual difference is conditioners as professional ones (which you can buy for cheap on amazon) are higher concentrated. Hairdressers will always charge you extra for products and will try to sell a certain line of products. Personally I'd recommend to just buy L'Oréal professionals or redken from amazon, you can get a saloon grade shampoo and conditioner for $30 and it will legit last for ages.\nOtherwise, if you want to grow your hair long, ANY hairdresser can cut your ends from time to time, and that's all you need.\nNo hair product can change the speed at which hair grows, or how well it does, the only thing you can do is use lots of conditioner and get regular trims to keep the ends healthy and with no breakage. And you know, don't use heat and use a tangle teaser brush.",

It is so very rigid in the ideals, which just match the founders personal ideals for women's hair.\n\nI think the George Michael affiliated salons or stylists are loved because they will generally not over-trim hair beyond the minimum and time is meant to be spent on snipping off individual splits throughout the hair. They are also gentle in their drying technique etc to accommodate extreme length. \n\nHowever, I think the one size fits all approach massively lets them down. If you don't get on with the products, their ramge doesn't have alternatives for you and those ingredients look more stripping than I'd expect from a company built on the idea of handling hair like fine silk!\n\nI think what your hair needs is too different to what George Michael's system is willing to provide.",

If not that's okay too as long as your scalp is healthy \n\nAnd most importantly!: get a baby trim every 2 to 3 months to avoid split ends.\n\nFor someone with previously bleached hair I would suggest trying a biotin supplement at over 10,000 mgs a day, which is often twice the suggested dose for actual results. \n\nYou want to have a nice haircut while growing it out and you can absolutely have pretty and long hair that is layered and or has bangs \n\nThis guy's sounds like I would pass on him and his philosophy",

Secondly you need to ask him to explain. It is important to build a relationship with your hairdresser/stylist, where you can feel comfortable to ask him questions about your hair or what he is teaching you. \n\nSLS is not necessarily bad, it is bad to people who have an allergy or irritation. It is one of the ingredients that can really cleanse the hair. Some SLS free products are not effective cleansers or may dry the hair more than an SLS shampoo does. The whole composition of the shampoo is important as there are ingredients that in low dosages can do tremendous work. So using SLS is not a no-no to maintain healthy hair, this is something some people came up with because a lot of SLS shampoos happen to be drying, or they are using the wrong one for their hair.\n\nThe shampoo you shared has nothing special to cost $70 though. Since this stylist seems to have this own routine or methods to grow hair, it could be the reason why he pushes this technique. After all, if you do not use what he suggests he might not be able to get the results he wants or expects for your hair. Know that whenever you go to a branded store, like Paul Mitchelle Salon, Wella Salon, Deva Curl salon etc...all these type of salons have their products and will most likely suggest you products in their product line. It is easier to not get that only if you go to a salon that isn't affiliated with a single hair care brand.",

In addition it sounds like you put your hair through a absolute torture series with the chemicals so it might still be thinner on the ends. If your density on the ends isn't as thick as it should be keeping it all one length would infact help it look longer and fuller. However.... the shampoo and conditioner ect. making your hair feel dry should not happen. SLS is not the devil depending on what other ingredients are involved however it is a cheaper and harsher surfactant. If your hair is not reacting well to the product and considering the ingredients, it is probably not the correct products for you. If you haven't used much of it I would see if the salon has a return or exchange policy for products ( some salons do considering amount of usage). Kevin Murphy or Davines or Aveda are amazing wonderful brands that I've seen envoke wonderful improvements to hair, you might check some of those brands out. It seems like this hairdresser has gotten sucked into a product/ brand culture which I've seen happen a lot in the industry ( kinda cult like ). I doubt the stylist is purposely trying to divert you from your goal, but you should find someone who makes you feel comfortable, understood and informed. ( sorry for the novel ) *hairdresser*",

It can be a good thing to use every once in a while to remove product and hard water buildup, especially if you use products with silicones. I use a SLS-free chelating shampoo to remove hard water buildup. I think the best thing you can do to grow your hair long is reduce physical stress on your hair from styling and to get to know ingredients. It takes time and some scientific literacy definitely helps but in the end, it’s worth it. Finding the right balance of moisture and protein in products will help to keep your hair manageable while it grows.\n\nI use to obsess about keeping my hair long and wanted to only use “natural products.” I have fine, porous, low density hair that’s a mix of 2a - 2c textures. I used apple cider vinegar and baking soda to wash for almost 10 years, brushed with a boar bristle brush and applied straight jojoba to the ends daily. It was a mess and didn’t grow at all due to the breakage that I had no idea I was causing. Now I use a variety of products based off their ingredients and my hair is the healthiest it’s ever been. It grows at least 1/2” a month which is pretty common. Different things work for everyone so I’m not gonna say that you should or shouldn’t use specific products based off my own experience but learning ingredients will help you avoid wasting time and money.\n\nThe only universal hair truth I believe in is don’t buy hair care products from Amazon and Ebay. There’s just too much counterfeit product out there and their quality control is nonexistent.",

But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/​Vinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This is an anti-dandruff shampoo and the best I've used so far.\n\nOther than the usual supermarket brands I've used Bioderma Node Ds (Excellent but pricey. Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles. Bottle looks super tiny and the plastic waste bothers me.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Re'equil Anti-Hairfall Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:   [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-c14-16-olefin-sulfonate), [Cocamidopropyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-hydroxysultaine), [Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-cocoyl-isethionate), [Decyl Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/decyl-glucoside), [Coco-Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/coco-glucoside), [Dexpanthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Glyceryl Oleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-oleate), [Biotin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/biotin), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Nasturtium Officinale Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/nasturtium-officinale-extract), [Tropaeolum Majus Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tropaeolum-majus-extract), [Polyquaternium-22](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-22), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Glycol Monostearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycol-stearate), [Disodium EDTA](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Methylchloroisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylchloroisothiazolinone), [Methylisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylisothiazolinone), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Ci 45100](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-45100), [Ci 42090](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-42090)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.450 for 250 ml.

Normal shampoo consistency\n\nUsage:  I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: Oh my god, you guys. Best find of this year. This gives super shiny, sleek looking hair. I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember. I used up the entire bottle. I think 9ish months?? or more.\n\nConsistency: Normal shampoo consistency, HEAVILY fragranced. It's marketed towards Men, I think, so it smells of Men's aftershave.\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above.

I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

I'm not sure why this works since leaving hair in water isn't good, but it does. Between just straight up applying it and doing this, this works better. I leave it on for 5 minutes and then rinse it off.\n\nReview: This is a cult favourite  around here and for very good reason. I use this in the place of a conditioner. This conditions. I get nice, shiny frizz free hair. The cost - benefit was insane and this was HG. Not going to say anything else, because it's not available and it's pointless.  I paid higher than MRP to get my hands on a tub, when I realised it was going to be rEfORmuLAted and I've had no regrets so far.

Straight up applying and mixing it with water, both works equally well. You might use up more if straight up applying it.\n\nReview: This is brilliant protein conditioner. If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

    "body": "Nitong nakaraang mga araw may isang Tiktok content creator ang inulan ng comments sa kanyang Tiktok page dahil diumano sa hindi magandang paraan o istilo ng pagrereview ng sunscreen na ito. Dahil dito , naisipan kong bilhin at subukan itong sunscreen na ito. \n\nUna sa lahat, binili ko itong sunscreen na ito sa tingin kong official store nitong Worada sunscreen na ito. Ito yung store na may Worada din sa pangalan. Dito din sa store na ito binili nung content creator na binanggit ko kanina. Yung B1T1 na yung binili ko, yung isa sa usage test, yung isa naman e sa gagawin kong test sa lab. May kasama din pala itong freebie na Whitening Antiperspirant and Deodorant Cream (isusunod ko itong i-review). \n\nSimulan ko muna sa packaging. Yung packaging nito ay 50 g Cosmetic Pouch with spout. Ito ay gawa sa BOPP/VMPET/LLDPE/Aluminum Foil na sinadya para maprotektahan ng husto ang laman na sunscreen. Ito yung isa sa mga usual na material na ginagamit sa paggawa ng mga cosmetic pouch. Makikita din sa packaging na gawa pala ang Worada Sunscreen sa China. \n\nHindi ko nakita sa packaging ng sunscreen na ito yung mandatory warning para sa mga sunscreen na dapat present sa mga sunscreen products na binebenta sa ASEAN: Do not stay too long under the sun, even when using a cosmetic product. \n\nSa paggamit naman. Pagkabukas ko pa lang ng sachet nitong Worada sunscreen, naamoy ko na agad yung fragrance nito. Amoy milky floral ang fragrance na ginamit dito. Ang laman na sunscreen ay isang cream na off-white na may hint ng dilaw ang kulay (mas maputi ng kaunti sa evap na gatas). Kapag inilagay na sa daliri, nagbe-break na agad ang emulsion at nagiging matubig o runny, kagaya nung sa video review. Noong ipinahid ko ang 2-finger lengths nitong sunscreen, una kong napansin e masyadong maputi yung sunscreen para sa skin tone ko. Tinagalan ko na ang pagbe-blend nito sa buong mukha at leeg ko, pero sa huli halata pa din ang whitecast. Nasabihan pa nga ako ng kasama ko sa lab na nagsusumigaw yung sunscreen ko sa mukha. \n\nNgayon sa ingredients naman. Ito ang ingredients nitong Worada sunscreen:\n\nMilk, Aqua, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Titanium Dioxide, Glycereth-26, Potassium Laurel Phosphate, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Isohexadecane, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polysorbate-80, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Niacinamide, Trehalose, Tocopheryl Acetate, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA, Parfum\n\nUnahin na natin ang UV-Filters. May tatlo na UV-Filters ang Worada Sunscreen:\n\n* Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (UVB) \n\n* Ethylhexyl Salicylate (UVB) \n\n* Titanium Dioxide (UVB) \n\nBabalikan ko ito mamaya para mai-relate sa product claim nitong sunscreen. \n\nAng pinakaunang ingredient sa IL nito ay Milk. Maling entry na naman. Lac (Milk) ang tamang INCI name kung naglagay ng gatas as ingredient. \n\nRelated naman ang gatas sa susunod kong punto. Gumamit ng Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, at Propylparaben itong sunscreen na ito bilang preservative system. Angkop itong preservative system na ito, dahil ang taas ng ginamit na Milk sa formulation na ito. Nararapat lang na broad spectrum preservative system ang gamitin. \n\nPreservative Efficacy:\n\nParabens: Yeast and molds; Gram(+) bacteria\n\nPhenoxyethanol: Yeast and molds; Gram(-) bacteria\n\nRegarding sa safety ng parabens (methyl, propyl), approved for use pa yan ng regulatory bodies ng ASEAN at EU, basta masunod lang ang maximum allowed concentration. Pakitingnan na lang sa pic yung statement ng SCCS, ang committee na inaatasan ng EU na magsagawa ng safety assessments ng mga ingredients kagaya ng parabens. Pero kung isa ka sa mga nakakaranas ng contact dermatitis dahil sa pagiging sensitive ng iyong balat sa parabens, mabuting iwasan na lang ang mga produktong gumagamit nitong mga preservatives na ito. \n\nSunod, may laman naman itong mga ingredients na moisturizing sa balat: \n\n* Glycerin (humectant) \n\n* Trehalose (humectant) \n\nPara naman sa whitening:\n* Milk\n\n* Niacinamide\n\nMay antioxidant din: Tocopheryl Acetate\n\nSunod nating tingnan ang product claims ng Worada sunscreen:\n\n* SPF 60 PA+++ UVA-UVB Protection\n\n* Invisible\n\n* Waterproof\n\n* Sweat Resistant\n\n* Lsolate Skin (nasa harap, di ko naintindihan kung anuman ito) \n\n* Whitening\n\n* Moisturizing\n\nSa SPF claim, hindi ko mawari kung papaano nasabi ng brand na ito na may UVA protection ito, samantalang yung tatlong UV-filter nito e puro UVB protection ang kayang ibigay. Dagdag pa, wala pa akong nakikitang SPF test report para sa Worada sunscreen na ipinakita ng brand owner sa kanilang soc med accounts. Kung meron man, makikicomment na lang sa baba. \n\nSa claim na invisible, hindi naman invisible e. Kitang kitanang white cast e. \n\nSa water proof claim, hindi pwede ang water proof claim. Water resistance ang tamang ilagay jan. At kailangang may patunay na tinest ito, kesyo ito ay 40 min or 80 min water resistance. Ganoon din sa sweat resistance. May test din para jan, either 40 min o 80 min, kagaya ng water resistance. \n\nYung Lsolate Skin na claim na nasa harapan, malay ko jan. Kailangang i-clarify ng brand owner yan. \n\nSa claim na moisturizing at whitening, meron namang ingredients na laman ang sunscreen para masabi kahit papano na pasok ang claim nila. Ang concern ko lang e yung paggamit ng Milk. Matumal ang mga studies kung sa nakakapagpaputi ang gatas. Tapos, takaw-mikrobyo pa yan. Mabuti na nga lang, ginamitan ng broad spectrum preservative system. Pero kung mahina ang preservative system nito, madaling masisira ang product na ito. \n\nFinal words:\n\nMarami akong concerns na nakita sa product na ito. Una na jan yung kung SPF-tested ba talaga ito. Pangalawa yung claim na may UVA protection, pero malabo base sa mga UV filters na ginamit. Ikatlo, yung mga unallowed (water proof) at unsupported (water resistant at sweat resistant) claims. Yang tatlo na yan, major red flags na agad dahil hindi tama na magki-claim para sa product na hindi pa naman nagtetest. Palaging tandaan, sa mga product claims, laging dapat may kaakibat yan na substantiation. Kasi napakadali gumawa ng product claims, ang mahirap e patunayan kung tunay ba talaga yan. Performance-wise, hindi para sa akin itong sunscreen na ito, dahil ayoko ng whitecast. \n\nAbangan ang Part 2 para sa mga isasagawa kong mga test sa lab. \n\nAyun lang. Salamat sa pagbasa. \n",

Since bihira lang ako makakita ng Filipino chemists online, I usually just end up watching people like Lab Muffin. Kaya ang saya na may mga katulad niyo na nagpo-pop up lately! \n\nThanks for the detailed info—honestly, nakakainis yung mga locals online na nagkakalat ng misinformation or kulang sa research, so seeing someone credible like you is really refreshing. I hope you consider uploading videos on TikTok or any video platform, too! Would love to see your reviews, tests, and opinions reach a larger audience. That’s all.

Sorry the image isn't super aesthetic but I wanted to write the post asap!\n\n**About me:** 24F\n\n**Climate:** Between 35-39 degrees this summer, slightly humid but really dry most times.\n\n**Skin type:** My body's skin is dehydrated and always needs to be moisturised; however, even slightly heavy lotions make me sweat.\n\n**Texture of this lotion:** Looks like any regular lotion, bFraut when rubbed in it literally disappears into my skin in a good way. It spreads like a serum/water lotion.\n\n**Fragrance:** Light but pleasant scent, very similar to other Vaseline lotions. \n\n**Cost:** MRP 300\n\n**WRP/WNRP:** WRP\n\nIngredients list: Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Glutathione, Sodium Hyaluronate, Retinyl Palmitate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Glycine, Cystine, Sodium PCA, Petrolatum, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Perfume, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Styrene/​Acrylates Copolymer, Disodium EDTA, Coco-Glucoside, BHT, Benzoic Acid, Citric Acid, Potassium Hydroxide\n\n*Moisturisers I've already tried and mini reviews (note:* ***reviews are only for summers, otherwise I love all of these lotions and they work perfectly during winter***\\*):\\*\n\n* *Vaseline Aloe lotion* \\- Too light and not moisturising enough.\n* *Vaseline Restoring variant in the yellow bottle* \\- Makes me sweat in summer.\n* *Parachute Blue Bottle* \\- heavy and makes me sweat in summer.\n* *Vaseline Aloe Gel tube* \\- I really like this one for summer, gets absorbed super fast and gives a cooling feeling. However, I don't know if it helped with my dehydrated skin.\n* *Vaseline Daily Bright & Calming Body Serum -* I love this one. Though it's slightly less moisturising it's actually good for really hot and humid days.\n* I've also used the *Neutrogena hydro-boost gel* and *Cosrx All-in-one cream*s on my body because my face skin reacted badly to them - I honestly loved these for my body during summers because of how light but hydrating they are but obviously they're too expensive to be purchased to use on the body.\n* Lastly, I've tried to dilute every regular lotion with some water; *Minimalist 5% Niacinamide Lotion*, *Vaseline advanced repair* and one of the *Nivea dark blue bottle*s (all my HGs for winter). All of them still made me sweat after the water dried down.\n\nI have tried the *Vaseline Gluta-hya Serum-in-lotion* for about 1 week now and love it already!\n\nThis one looked like any other lotion but when applied, it literally turns into a watery serum consistency and gets absorbed by my skin within minutes. It doesn't feel heavy at all but moisturises very well for quite a few hours.\n\nI had to reapply on some really dry parts of my body within 4 hours but I'd take that any day over the sweaty feeling I get from using regular lotions in summer.\n\nIts scent is very similar to the Yellow Vaseline lotion however, it's slightly different and it's quite pleasant.\n\nIf anyone of you had used the Vaseline spray-on lotion/serum thing, this Gluta-hya thing is a more moisturising version of that product which is great because I also like the spray lotion despite it being slightly less moisturising.\n\nI don't know if it's really new in the market or if I've just found it but it's a good find!\n\nAlso, at the back of the tube, it says that this specific variant has *'Dual UV Filters'* i.e. UVA and UVB filters but obviously, I doubt if it's good enough protection, so I won't stop using my body sunscreen yet.\n\nThey also have another variant called [Dewy Radiance Serum-in-Lotion](https://www.myntra.com/body-lotion/vaseline/vaseline-non-sticky-gluta-hya-dewy-radiance-serum-in-lotion---200-ml/22580648/buy?gclid=Cj0KCQjwi46iBhDyARIsAE3nVrZg5uLe88lcJQxcHA5kivV2zWTXKHmiQ3ZT1v1Twhhmqj53tFr9twIaAu3lEALw_wcB) if anyone's interested!\n\nApologies if my format/writing isn't that great!",

It's a suspected carcinogen that's banned for human consumption in Europe, China and India, but not in the United States.\n\nIn the U.S., the chemical compound is used by some food makers, usually in the form of fine crystals or powder, to strengthen dough. It is estimated to be present in more than 100 products.\n\n\"There is evidence that it may be toxic to human consumers, that it may even either initiate or promote the development of tumors,\" professor Erik Millstone, an expert on food additives at England's University of Sussex, told CBS News. He said European regulators take a much more cautious approach to food safety than their U.S. counterparts.\n\nAsked if it can be said with certainty that differences in regulations mean people in the U.S. have developed cancers that they would not have developed if they'd been eating exclusively in Europe, Millstone said that was \"almost certainly the conclusion that we could reach.\"\n\nIt's not just potassium bromate. A range of other chemicals and substances banned in Europe over health concerns are also permitted in the U.S., including Titanium dioxide (also known as E171); Brominated vegetable oil (BVO) (E443); Potassium bromate (E924); Azodicarbonamide (E927a) and Propylparaben (E217).\n\n**Read more:** https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-food-additives-banned-europe-making-americans-sick-expert-says/",

    "body": "**[Lush Ultrabland](http://www.lushusa.com/Ultrabland/02749,en_US,pd.html), $29.95 for 3.5 oz available in Lush stores and online**\n\nThe packaging describes it as an \"ultra effective, ultra gentle face cleanser,\"  which is a fair assessment.  It's a balm cleanser primarily composed of emulsified sweet almond oil and rose water with beeswax and honey added for additional moisturizing power (but mostly, bells and whistles).\n\nI bought this on a whim in early December to use as a morning cleanse and wound up liking it so much that I haven’t used another cleanser since. A little goes a long way - I *just* rebought, meaning I got 4 - 4.5 months of twice daily use out of one jar.  I apply one or two pea-sized dabs to dry skin and massage it all over my face before removing it with a hot damp cloth.   At night I take a little more time with it and occasionally get grits.  Ultrabland goes on smooth and creamy with an inoffensive, very faint, honey-smell that doesn’t linger.   It effectively removes makeup and sunscreen and leaves my skin soft and cleansed, but with no “tight” feeling.\n\nAs much as I love this product, I have to describe it as being for everyone and no one at the same time.  On the one hand, it is gentle and non-stripping in a way that makes it effective for oily skins and dry skins alike.  But - it’s not inexpensive.  It’s *basically* sweet almond oil, and one could get the benefit of Ultrabland using OCM.  I don’t like the texture of oil on my face as a regular everyday thing and it feels messy to me.  Ultrabland doesn’t feel like oil and it doesn’t run, which also makes it convenient for travel, if you share my fear of liquids opening up in an overnight bag.  If the *idea* of OCM appeals to you, but the vicissitudes of selecting an oil and getting that liquidy goodness all of your face does not, Ultrabland may be an ideal product for you.  It *does* contain parabens and essential oils for fragrance (Iris extract and Rose Absolute), so if you’re avoiding parabens and fragrance, this is not for you.\n\nIn all likelihood, I will buy it again.  Out of curiosity, I’d like to investigate the Banila balms, but with shipping I’d be back at the per ounce of Ultrabland, which I like a lot in the first place, so for the foreseeable, Ultrabland will be my cleanser of choice.\n\nConclusion: Ultrabland.  Does what it says on the tin.\n\n*Ingredients: Almond Oil (Prunus dulcis) , Rose Water (Rosa centifolia) , Beeswax (Cera alba) [rated 0-2 for acne and irritant on Cosdna], Honey (Mel) , Fresh Iris Extract (Iris florentina) , Glycerine , Rose Absolute (Rosa damascena) , Tincture of Benzoin (Styrax benzoin) , Methylparaben , Propylparaben*\n",

    "body": "Hi all!  \n\n\nI am back with another skin conditions post. This one is on perioral dermatitis.   \n\n\nAdmittedly, when I began researching this, I knew zilch about PD except that it was acne-like breakouts around the mouth,  and as I began to research it, it seems that there isn't a whole lot that is known about it. Fortunately, it is a highly treatable condition that seems to overlap to a degree with rosacea (earning it the earlier name  of \"steroid rosacea\") and even seborrheic dermatitis.  \n\n\n**As always, please feel free to correct or inform me of anything wrong, and also feel free to post/discuss what helps your PD.**\n\n# What is Perioral Dermatitis\n\nPerioral dermatitis (PD) is a chronic, recurrant inflammatory disease that most commonly occurs in the perioral region of the face (the area around the mouth). It can also affect the area around the nose, and in roughly 20&#37; of cases, it can manifest around the eyes (though it goes by another name if around the eyes: peri-orificial dermatitis).   \n\n\nIt afflicts around 1&#37; of the population of the United States, particularly those with fair skin, and predominately occurs in women between 18-45, with 20s and 30s having peak incidence.   \n\n\nIt presents as small, red, tender, sometimes itchy bumps that can flake and burn. While commonly mistaken for acne, it is distinct from acne in that it only presents in specific locations, spares the small area around the lips, and lacks pustules (whiteheads).\n\n# Causes of Perioral Dermatitis\n\nThe causes of perioral dermatitis are unclear. It is a relatively \"young\" disease that was only first described as a distinct condition in 1964. It is first and foremost an inflammatory condition, and is aggravated by ingredients and habits that can create inflammation either in the skin or in the body. \n\nWhile I was researching PD, the one constant that showed up again and again is that it is aggravated by corticosteroid use -- both topical and inhaled. To specify, that means not just creams like kenalog, triamcinolone, and over-the-counter hydrocortisone, but also asthma inhalers (including Advair, Flovent, and ProAir aka Albuterol) and nasal allergy mists like Beconase, Flonase, Nasonex, Omnaris, and Veramyst. \n\nLess commonly, but still a factor to consider are hormones, where monthly shifts can put the condition into overdrive. More frustrating is that oral contraceptives can worsen PD in some. \n\nOther causes can be fluoridated toothpaste, high SPF value sunscreens¹, sunscreens with the filters zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, the ingredient \"isopropyl myristate,\" improperly removing makeup or sleeping in makeup, occlusive ointments (Vaseline, Aquaphor, and oils, for example), heavy creams with occlusive ingredients, and cold creams (wipe-off cleansing creams that leave a residue, like Pond's). In one case, a woman's favorite lip balm (containing the ingredient propyl gallate) caused her PD.⁶\n\n# Treatment\n\nPD can look like many other conditions, such as acne, angular cheilitis, rosacea, or seborrheic dermatitis, and requires treatment of a professional due to the inflammatory nature of the condition. \n\nThe most important thing for anyone suffering from PD is to discontinue steroid use - whether cold-turkey or weened off with the management of a healthcare professional. While topical steroids can seem to improve the condition, they frequently create a rebound effect, which can make the condition worse. \n\nOnce steroids are removed, the skin will get worse before getting better. This is the toughest part of PD for most people. Topical antibiotics or topical immunosuppresants (such as Pimecrolimus or Elidel) are frequently prescribed due to their tremendously  helpful anti-inflammatory effects on PD, and azelaic acid can prove useful in some cases. In very severe cases, oral antibiotics can be prescribed in addition to topicals. \n\nWhile healing from PD, the skin should not be cleansed with any cleanser, and makeup and skincare products should be avoided completely until the condition resolves. And no matter how tempting, PD should never be scrubbed, as this worsens the inflammation. \n\nOnce treated, it is encouraged to use liquid or gel sunscreens as well as soap-free cleansers that do not dry out the skin, as TEWL (trans-epidermal water loss) is significant in people who suffer from PD.\n\n# Long-Term Care\n\nSome people have PD once in their lives, while others may combat it on and off for several years. If you fall into the latter, it is important to try to avoid triggers that can cause the condition to reoccur (particularly steroid use). That means cleansing your skin each day with gentle cleansers, always removing makeup (removing it with a wipe does *NOT* count - you need to cleanse it away thoroughly with an oil cleanser that rinses cleanly), and using light products, particularly around the areas typically affected. \n\nPrescriptions like azelaic acid and over-the-counter .1&#37; adapalene (Differin)² may  also help to manage the condition in the long-term. \n\nI've put together a list below of some cleansers and moisturizers that are recommended for people suffering from PD. Again, like with my rosacea list, this is not a be-all-end-all list. None of the products listed contain isopropyl myristate or heavy occlusive ingredients.\n\n## Recommended Products\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser** \n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Stearyl Alcohol and Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Face Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate​,​ Polysorbate 60​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Panthenol​,​ T-Butyl Alcohol,​ Tocopherol​.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Wate/Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryl Glycol/Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**Avene Extremely Gentle Cleanser Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (avene Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Serine, Cetrimonium Bromide, Coco-Glucoside, Dipotassium Phosphate, Disodium Edta, Disodium Phosphate, O-Phenylphenol, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Water (Aqua).*\n\n**Spectro Jel Cleanser for Blemish-Prone Skin - Fragrance Free**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Hydroxypropyl Methocellulose, Polysorbate 20, Cetyl Alcohol (moisturizer), Hydrated Silica, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Diazolidinyl Urea, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Sorbitan Oleate.*\n\n## Foaming Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Terastearate, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric, Glycerides, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Sodium Chloride, Phytosphingosine, Citric Acid, Edetate Disodium, Dihydrate, Sodium, Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Olay Foaming Face Wash Sensitive**\n\n>*Ingredients: Water/Eau, Glycerin, Sodium Myristoyl Sarcosinate, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Polyquaternium-10, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA, Laureth-10, Disodium Lauroamphodiacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, DMDM Hydantoin.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate​,​ PEG-120 Methyl Glucoside Dioleate,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Hydroxide​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Capryloyl Glycine​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Citric Acid​,​ Acrylates Copolymer​.*\n\n## Makeup Removers\n\n**Clinique Take the Day Off Cleansing Balm**\n\n>*Ingredients: Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Polyethylene, PEG-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Water / Aqua / Eau, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol.*\n\n**Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Mineral Oil, PEG-8 Glyceryl Isostearate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclomethicone, Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Isostearic Acid, Glycerin, Phenoexyethanol.*\n\n## Moisturizers\n\n**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Ceteareth-20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Dipotassium Phosphate, Potassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben.*\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3-Diisosterate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide 1, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium phosphate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 20, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Active - Dimethicone, 1\\%.

        "body": "I’ve been diagnosed with Peri-orbital Dermatitis by my dermatologist. I’ve had it for at least 10 years. Peri-orbital means it presents around my eyes, nose and mouth. My worst flare ups cover all three areas, my most frequent flare ups present just around my nostrils. \n\nYes, you’re correct that causes are basically unknown. Successful treatments can vary wildly. \n\n(personally, I’m convinced it has a fungal element, specially related to candida imbalance. That’s just my opinion. I have used OTC topicalS and been prescribed anti-fungal topicals and pills, none of that worked. I believe it is related to gut microbiome health. Our skin is a direct reflection of what’s going on intrinsically in our bodies) \n\nI want chime in here about Zinc Oxide. You mention it as a possible cause. I want others out here to know that high concentration Zinc Oxide Cream is the ONLY thing that stops my flare ups. So if you have PD, I recommend patch testing a high ZO cream on one or two of the papules and see if it helps you. Incidentally, I’ve found recently that micronized ZO particles actually work faster for my than larger particles. So I stopped using Desitin Max strength and started using Neutrogena Sheer Zinc for face with 22% ZO. It stops my flare ups completely in a matter of a day or so, versus 4+ days with the Desitin. \n\nI’ll list below everything I’ve tried in case it’s helpful. The other product I find helpful is daily probiotic pills containing Lactobacillus Acidophilus. I get less flare ups when I take daily probiotics. \n\nDIDN’T WORK: \nAntibacterial Rx creams, I believe I had both Erythromycin and Dapsone. OTC antifungal creams, clotrimazole, miconazole and terbinafine. I also had an oral Rx for Lamisil, it was generic and I can’t recall the generic name. OTC topical steroids, hydrocortisone. Violet extract. Cutting out SLS from from my toothpaste and hair products. (I never cleansed with SLS, always either soap or oil) Changing my diet to an acne safe diet. Getting sun. Staying out of sun. Sulphur washes. Leaving it alone.",

I had no idea what perioral dermatitis was and assumed all this redness was broken capillaries from a Clarisonic. \n\nIt wasn’t until I went to a dermatologist and asked her about it that she said it looked like perioral dermatitis. I was prescribed Finacea and in one month the results have been astounding. Redness has significantly reduced and no closed comedones or inflamed pimples anywhere. Again mine wasn’t severe but for anyone who has it I think azelaic acid is a great choice. \n\nI should point out I never use steroids, I’m 30F and I think this was due to over moisturizing after over exfoliating. I also think the occlusive nature of aquaphor made it much worse. My routine now consists of nothing but cleanser, moisturizer and Finacea. Drastic change from what I was doing before. \n\nThank you for taking the time to post this very informative breakdown of perioral dermatitis.",

I hope I've followed all the rules!\n\nHere is the deal:\n\nSo, I have been on the hunt for a daily mist that does more than just \"this makes my skin so hydrated throughout the day!\" That's nice and all, however the reality is: It **should be** hydrating as I'm literally spraying my face and saturating it with liquid. In most of the more famous \"thermal water\" mists, its literally just water and pressure.\n\n\n**a note** I'm not bashing water mists, I own one! I think they are great for what their purpose is, pure hydration. I just find it easier to put some bottles water in a fine mist spray bottle, tbh.\n\n\n**So, what are you getting at here?**\n\nI have skin that (like many of us here) isn't flawless, spotless perfection. So I have been on the hunt for a mist that does more than simply hydrate, be cause we all deserve a mist that can help us with skin problems too, right? I think that some of the issue is, when looking for a mist, we all just assume that **hydration is all we are supposed to get from a mist** & that just didn't sit right with me. I feel like we should at least get a little bit more. Whitening/brightening effects, acne control, sebum control, pore minimizer, etc. I wan't all a mist has to offer!\n\n\n**You said you were on a hunt, did you find anything? Or are you just smack talking?**\n\nThis is why I'm here. I found a few mists that I would like to share and hope to get some recommendations for more! I hope to compile some type of list, so any and all suggestions are welcome. I would especially love some mists from brands that we may not see that often because I'd love to broaden my horizons!\n\n\n**Here are the mists I found so far and their ingredients:** (I hope anyone can add to this)\n\n\n**BENTON Honest TT Mist**\n\nIngredients: Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tee Tree) Leaf Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Extract, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycerin, Altharea Roea Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Poly Glutamic Acid, Aspalathus Linearis Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Psidium Guajava Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract\n\n\n**ELENSILIA Escargot Botanic Garden Bee Venom Lavender Mist**\n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Sodium Citrate, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil,Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Chloride, Chlorphenesin, Adenosine, Magnesium Sulfate, Citric Acid, Glycosaminoglycans, Bee Venom, Honey Extract, Royal Jelly Extract, Propolis Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Polygonum Multiflorum Root Extract, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Extract, Phellinus, Linteus Extract, Angelica Gigas Root Extract, Morus Alba Bark Extract, Paeonia Lactiflora Root Extract, Sophora Angustifolia Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Galactomyces, Ferment Filtrate, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil\n\n\n**Snail White SYN-AKE Mist**\n\nIngredients: Snail secretion filtrate,deionized water, SYN-AKE (dipeptide diaminobutyroyl benzalymide diacetate) Alpha arbutin, dipotassium glycyrrhizate, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Morus nigra fruit extract, rubus idaeus (raspberry extract) Prunus Avium (sweet cherry extract) fragaria vesca (strawberry fruit extract\n\nHonorable mention: I have **TFS Bamboo Water, sebum control mist.** I like it, it controls some oil, hydrates and doesn't have a strong scent.

    "body": "Kaniadto, basta panahon sa Kwaresma, magkagulilang ang mga mananambal diri sa amoa. Ganado kaayo ang mga espiritu sa ilang kanya-kanyang tahas. Feeling nako, mura ni sila’g ga-annual renewal sa ilang pagkamananambal—license to heal, gamit ang tig-tres nga kandila.\n\nAmong silingan, mag-solo glamping sa simbahan sugod Biyernes Santo hangtod Sabado Santo. Dili lang ni basta simba—magdala siyag banig, moskitero, ug thermos. Magsugod alas tres sa kadlawon, mahuman alas tres pud sa sunod nga kadlawon. Walay day-off.\n\nAko ra ning nadunggan, pero ang uban daw mokulob sa kwarto. Magdagkot og kandila, magsige og yawyaw og orasyon nga murag tongue twister: “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.”\n\nNaa puy uban moadto sa lasang pagkabuntag sa Lunes Santo. Mangolekta og ingredients aron himuon og lana: sesamum indicum seed oil, PEG-40 sorbitan peroleate, propylparaben, BHT, Isopropyl myristate. Di pud ko sure kung mao ba gyud ni. Gi-kopya ra nako ni sa likod sa akong Neutrogena Body Oil.\n\nPero naa koy nakita gyud. Gihilantan akong manghud, pero giingnan lang sa mananambal nga “Giinitan ra na. Hilanat nis sulod.” Kuyaw. Gilawayan lang og krus sa tiyan ug gi-orasyonan. Nakatawa ko ato. Pero naayo siya pagka-ugma. Ang resita? Ambot mga dahon-dahon man to nga gilapwa. \n\nUsa sa akong pinakadugay nga pangutana: nganong Holy Week man gyud ni ginabuhat? Ngano dili Pasko? Kung ang pagkatawo ni Kristo mao ang sinugdanan sa paglaum, ngano man sa iyang kamatayon magsugod ang spiritual journey sa mga mananambal?\n\n“Kay kung patay si Kristo, abri ang langit,” tubag sa akong lola.\n\nAmbot unsay meaning ani. Vague. Basin metaphysical. Basin instinct lang, sama sa pila ka kutsara nga asukar ang ibutang sa binignit inig Biyernes Santo.\n\nGi-explain pud niya: kung bugto ang tulay sa langit ug yuta, mao’y pinakasayon nga panahon makigsabot sa espiritu. Murag off-duty ang Ginoo. Maka-walk-in ang uban. No queue. No judgment.\n\nAng Kwaresma sa amoa kaniadto, dili lang kabanhawan ni Kristo. Kabanhawan pud sa tambal, mga tinuohan, ug mga katingalahan nga, tuohan man nato o dili, mopadayon lang gihapon. Ang mga orasyon, bisag wala ni follow sa Elements of Style nila Strunk ug White, makaayo gihapon sa ubo, sip-on, hilanat, ug heartbreak.\n\nKaron, halos tanan naay Bluetooth, QR code, ug wellness vlogger. Wa na koy nadungog nga mananambal nga nag-ampo sa lasang. Murag napulihan na.\n\nAng maong lana sa una, giluto sa kalaha, gi-ampoan, gihalad. Karon, makapalit na sa Shopee. Free shipping pa kung P499 and up. Sa una, ang espiritu gitawag pinaagi sa kandila ug kamot nga gipatong sa agtang. Karon, guided meditation with ambient sound. Ad-free pa kung naka-premium.\n\nAng atong henerasyon—Millennials ug Gen Zs—ni-shift og interest: from orasyon to astrology, from lana to skincare routine.\n\nNi-evolve ba ta, o ni-backslide?\n\nWala koy tubag. Pero kabalo ko, wala nay naulian sa sip-on tungod sa orasyon. Paracetamol na ron.\n\nAyaw lang gyud mo pasamad ron. Kay di na ra ba na maulian. \n\nOrasyon di kipot, halaba halipot.",

The \"[Safe Cosmetics and Personal Care Products Act of 2018](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6903/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+6903%22%5D%7D&r=1)\" (HR 6903) would amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. It comprises ingredient safety, registration fees, resources for small businesses, labeling regulation and more.\n\nIf passed, the act would initially prohibit use of the following:\n\n* Oxybenzone, Octinoxate, and Octocrylene (sunscreen filters)\n* Butylated Hydroxyanisole (BHA) and Butylated Hydroxyoluen (BHT) (antioxidant and preservative boosters)\n* Coal tar dyes (p-Phenylenediamine) (color additive and medicine, found in shampoos for scalp treatments and hair dyes for dark colors)\n* Cocamide Diethanolamine (surfactant/emulsifying agent)\n* Dibutyl Phthalate (Phthalates DBP), Bis(2-ethylhexyl) Phthalate (DEHP) (fragrances)\n* Toluene (fragrance)\n* Styrene, Styrene Acrylates (polymers, film formers)\n* Formaldehydes (methylene glycol/methandeiol/formaldehyde) and Formaldehyde-releasing preservatives (DMDM hydantoin, diazolidinyl urea, imidazolidinyl urea, methenamine, quaternium-15, and sodium hydroxymethylglycinate) (AKA our favorite preservative, Germall Plus)\n* Tricolsan (antibacterial/antifungal agent, found in antibacterial soaps and hand sanitizes)\n* Lead acetate and other lead compounds (color additive in hair dye products)\n* Parabens (iso­pro­p­yl­paraben, iso­bu­t­yl­pa­ra­ben, phenylpa­raben, ben­zyl­­pa­ra­ben, pentylpa­raben, propylparaben and butylpar­aben) (AKA the most effective preservatives)\n\nListed ingredients have the potential to be removed if they are later deemed \"safe\", under the act's definitions. Manufacturers would have one year to reformulate their products to eliminate aforementioned banned ingredients.\n\nAn additional list would be created of at least 300 ingredients to be assessed, to which 100 further ingredients would be added annually until all ingredients that are used in the formulation or manufacture of cosmetics have been added for review.\n\n>“Most Americans would be shocked to realize that cosmetics are one of the least regulated consumer products on the market. Yet the average American uses about ten of them every day. That translates to being exposed to about 126 unique chemicals from your personal care products. This includes countless products families use on their babies and children.  \n>  \n>That’s why today I’m introducing the Safe Cosmetics and Personal Care Products Act of 2018. This bill not only calls for full disclosure of the many chemicals in our products but would ban toxic ingredients, including carcinogens, in them. This bill takes a step that should have already been taken – consumers, families, and workers have been at risk for far too long. We need to ban toxic beauty and personal care products and give the Food and Drug Administration the resources it needs to keep Americans safe, including recall ability.” said Schakowsky in a [statement](https://schakowsky.house.gov/press-releases/schakowsky-introduces-bill-banning-toxic-ingredients-from-personal-care-products/).\n\n&#x200B;",

California is already dealing with this as a result of Proposition 65. There's warning labels everywhere, no one even reads them anymore. Why on earth would they want to take this joke of a policy nationwide? Can't they learn from California's mistakes?\n\nAs far as banning preservatives - in some ways, wouldn't it be good for cosmetics companies if cosmetics had a shorter shelf life across the board?

The EU has a quite stringent approach that, in the absence of direct human studies, will often not conclude the ingredient as safe while other governments might use historical exposure to make a judgement. An example of this is on your list Vegetable Carbon, a very common by product of cooking which is limited in use as an additive because it is possible that in production as an additive a residue can persist that is moderately carcinogenic (in doses far higher than could possibly be ingested). The safety studies that exist concentrate primarily on the inhalation of the additive as dust.\n\nSo while there are some minor restrictions in the EU, e.g. it shouldn't be used in sherbet (or other foods that are dust...cant think of another) E153 can be used in foods and isn't something that should concern lay people in foods.

Can you imagine NZ having a well funded public anything? lmao\n\nAlso, why the hell would they ban amaranth? I'm assuming it's some kind of extract for colouring or something, but amaranth is just a grain. I have a jar of it in my pantry.",

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nI wanted to create a space to discuss the new reformulation of Stratia's Interface moisturizer, and how it compares to Drunk Elephant's Protini. The new Stratia formula seems quite similar to Protini, at a much lower price point. It launched last week, so I imagine most people haven't been able to try it out yet, but if you have - please share your experiences as well! There's a lot of good info about the new formula on Stratia's Instagram but I'll recap some of it here.\n\n**Ingredient lists (Peptides/Growth Factors are in bold):**\n\n* Stratia Interface (Old Formula): Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Squalane, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Panthenol, Ethoxydiglycol, Propylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Rosa Mosqueta (Rose) Hip Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, **Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-27, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide-78, Palmitoyl Octapeptide-24, Copper Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-14, Heptapeptide-15 Palmitate**, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Lactic Acid/​Glycolic Acid Copolymer, Disodium EDTA, Polyacrylamide, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Tocopherol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Laureth-7, Diazolidinyl Urea, Xanthan Gum\n* Stratia Interface (New Formula): Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Squalane, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Panthenol, Ethoxydiglycol, Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Dimethicone, Rosa Mosqueta (Rose) Hip Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lecithin, Acetyl Glutamine, **Sh-Oligopeptide-1, Sh-Oligopeptide-2, Sh-Polypeptide-1, Sh-Polypeptide-9, Sh-Polypeptide-11, Copper Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-14, Heptapeptide-15 Palmitate**, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Allantoin, Bacillus/Folic Acid Ferment Filtrate Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lactic Acid/Glycolic Acid Copolymer, Disodium EDTA, Polyacrylamide, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Tocopherol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Laureth-7, Diazolidinyl Urea, Xanthan Gum\n* Drunk Elephant Protini: Water/Aqua/Eau, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Bacillus/ Folic Acid Ferment Filtrate Extract, Nymphaea Alba Root Extract, **sh-Oligopeptide-1, sh-Oligopeptide-2, sh-Polypeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-9, sh-Polypeptide-11, Copper Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-14, Heptapeptide-15 Palmitate, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Alanine, Arginine, Glycine, Histidine, Isoleucine, Phenylalanine, Proline, Serine, Threonine, Valine, Acetyl Glutamine, Coconut Alkanes, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Aspartic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Sodium Lactate, Sodium PCA, PCA, Sorbitan Isostearate, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, Polysorbate 60, Lactic Acid/Glycolic Acid Copolymer, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Isomalt, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Chlorphenesin, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, Sodium Benzoate, Phenylpropanol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Symphytum Officinale Callus Culture Extract.\n\n**General info + thoughts I have on comparisons between the two:**\n\n* Stratia reformulated Interface because some of the peptides in the old formulation were discontinued. According to their IG, they used this as an opportunity to upgrade the formula and have now incorporated a different mix of peptides and have also added growth factors (the ingredients that start with Sh-). This makes the formula quite similar to Protini, at a lower price point.\n* Comparisons:\n   * The two formulas now contain the same mix of growth factors, as well as Copper Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-14 and Heptapeptide-15 Palmitate. The main difference now between the two formulas is that Protini contains Matrixyl 3000 (Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1 and Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7), while Interface doesn't. Protini also has a diverse mix of amino acids in their formula (alanine, arginine, glycine, etc), while Interface does not.\n   * Stratia mentions that their peptides are \"encapsulated,\" which allows the Interface formula to be used alongside other actives (like Vit C, retinoids, acids, etc). Traditionally, from what I've read, peptides are finicky and work best on their own while not being used with other actives. Stratia says that their encapsulation technology allows Interface to be used at any time, and with any active. Protini does not claim any sort of encapsulation (to my knowledge).\n* I haven't tried the new Interface formula, but I have tried the old Interface formula as well as Protini. On IG, Stratia said that the new Interface formula texture should feel exactly like the old one, just with improved long-term benefits. Formula-wise, the old Interface feels a bit more lightweight than Protini. Neither are heavy-duty moisturizers and if you have dry skin, you may need to layer an oil or something heavier duty on top at night. In terms of differences in my skin - peptides/growth factors are more of a long-game, and in my experience, don't produce quick improvements in my skin that I can notice (like with AHAs or retinoids, for example). I use peptides because of their long-term benefits for the skin.\n\n**Questions I have:**\n\n* I'm wondering how much of an impact the \"encapsulation\" technology in Interface will truly make a difference in terms of it being able to be used with other actives - I'm not a product formulator so I'm not sure about the science behind this. At the moment, I avoid using peptides with any other active (I use them on nights when I'm taking a break from tret or acids). If the peptides in Interface truly are protected and can be used with actives (as Stratia claims on its website), then it truly is a game changer in terms of simplifying ones routine. Does anyone have more insight about encapsulation? Can peptides truly be \"protected\" from other actives?\n* Does the addition of amino acids in the Protini formula make a difference for anti-aging benefits?\n* Does anyone have experiences with the new Interface formula? Please share! :)\n\nFeel free to add any thoughts / info about these two products! Thanks everyone!",

I have hooded lids (full Korean).\n\n**Fragrance is not a deal-breaker for me in wash-off products, although I am wearier of essential oils than I am of synthetic fragrance. Will be bolding main fragrance ingredients.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kzfesai0y6251.jpg?width=425&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df6aa8bee3c981d106a4ee4e3d071a26002ea80a\n\n**Cost:** 8 oz - $24 (Ulta)\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Coco-Glucoside, Coconut Alcohol, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Glycerin, Carbomer, Isopropyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Citric Acid, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, **Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil,** Propylparaben, Triethanolamine, **Amyris Balsamifera (Amyris) Bark Oil, Bulnesia Sarmientoi Wood (Vera Wood) Oil, Cymbopogon Martini (Palmarosa) Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens (Sweet Scented Geranium) Flower Oil, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Oil, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil, Mimosa Tenuiflora Bark Extract, Ormenis Multicaulis (Wild Moroccon Chamomile) Oil, Piper Nigrum (Pepper) Fruit Oil, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Oil,** Fd&C Yellow No. 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n**Texture:** A pale yellow, milky, lightly foaming cleanser of medium thickness.\n\n**Efficacy:** Acceptable as a one-step travel cleanser. Pretty good at removing sunscreen and makeup if you take the time to massage it in. Felt like a godsend before being completely spoiled by AB first cleansers. That was when I thought a little bit of waterproof mascara being left over giving me slight raccoon eyes when I woke up in the morning was \"acceptable\" and \"as good as it's gonna get\".\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** No. Has gentle surfactants but **it also has TWELVE different essential oils.** One of which is endangered and need active conservation according to Wikipedia, which I personally don't feel comfortable using:\n\n>*Bulnesia sarmientoi* was listed as [endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species) in the 2018 publication of the [IUCN Red List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List), due to the [deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation) of [Gran Chaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Chaco#Conservation_issues) and a strong global demand for its wood, extracts, and [essential oils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil) since 2001.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulnesia_sarmientoi#cite_note-IUCN-1) IUCN estimates indicate that over three generations the global population will decline by around 50%.\n\nRequires much more massaging to remove waterproof makeup which may be harsh on sensitive skin and cause more redness.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy. Not too strong.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No, it's a 2-in-1. However, it does not always get rid of everything on the first try, so another cleanse may be necessary.\n\n**Repurchase?** No. It did not bother my sensitive skin too much, but I'm cutting out all essential oils from my skincare + not effective enough as a first cleanser.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Naive Botanical Olive Cleansing Oil 230mL / 7.8 oz\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ovky561y6251.png?width=207&format=png&auto=webp&s=fecf9195af66872bce90dabfe904de2a500678a5\n\nI found out about this [here, ranked #4](https://my-best.net/15468). I wanted something with the highest cleansing power that washed off cleanly & is affordable.\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $14 on eBay before pandemic started. A little less than $7 in Japan. Even at double the price for me in the US, I have had this since **July 2019** (June 2020 now) and I am only *halfway through* it because of how incredibly effective it is with small amounts. I would run out of other cleansing oils relatively fast because of how much it takes to remove all my layers of waterproof makeup. Am shocked tbh.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, ethylhexyl palmitate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, glyceryl tri (caprylic acid / capric acid), PEG-8 glyceryl isostearate, sorbeth tetraisostearate-30, olive leaf extract, olive fruit oil, squalane, BG Water, cyclohexane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid bisethoxy diglycol, **perfume.**\n\n**Texture:** A cleansing oil of medium thickness, not overly greasy. Smooth, spreads very easily. Not super thin like something like Kose Softymo Speedy.\n\n**Efficacy:** Not drying at all on my very dry skin. SUPER effective at removing waterproof sunscreen and makeup. Takes absolutely NO TIME AT ALL, which is very different from other cleansing oils that required me to massage it in for a while. Color me beyond impressed. This is honestly the best first cleanser I've used so far. ZERO residue of any trace of makeup after removal.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes and no. It did not bother me personally but it does contain fragrance. I'm unsure if the current ingredient list is accurate as the Japanese ranking site states it contains essential oils but the list from Yesstyle does not.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy, woodsy. Not so strong that it is super bothersome.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Absolutely. As soon as it becomes affordable again when the pandemic dies down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Moistage W Cold Cream 270g / 9.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tcxvpzp1y6251.jpg?width=249&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0996cc355ecab1a721c0c6316ef76089e89c8b6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q416df74y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd8cd5a3d8cf58c3c0822eb9da142611c5826bc\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $16 on eBay. Currently about $19 on [Yesstyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/kracie-moistage-w-cold-cream-270g/info.html/pid.1069419619). Very cost-effective bc of its huge size.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, water, polysorbate 65, microcrystalline wax, glycerin, DPG, glyceryl stearate, dimethicone, stearoyl glutamate Na, stearic acid, polysorbate 80, beeswax, xanthan gum, olive oil, squalane, hydrogenated castor oil hydroxystearate, silk extract , Ethanol, hydrolyzed collagen, cetearyl alcohol, EDTA2Na, methyl paraben, ethyl paraben\\*\\*, perfume.\\*\\*\n\n**Texture:** A rich, thick white cream.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a huge NO from me, dawg. This is terrible. It barely removes anything waterproof and leaves a heavy residue. However, if you're the type of person who doesn't mind using a more stripping cleanser afterward to wash this off, or using a washcloth, I guess I can see it as being, um. Acceptable?\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** It is gentle but slightly fragranced. No reaction from my skin other than disgust at being left in a thick film after wash off.\n\n**Scent:** Very light floral.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** YES.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter 76g / 2.7 Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/znms9m83y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45f6d28d2958c8133b26a2ab363b88bcf71d065e\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $13.65 on Amazon. Currently [$14.85 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F165210/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea  (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, **Parfum, Aqua, Linalool, Limonene,** Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Citric Acid.\n\n**Texture:** A thick, opaque white balm, not overly greasy or waxy.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a good first cleanser. Quite travel friendly but I have not traveled with it in weather that would melt it so I don't know if it would leak through. It removes everything quite well, no complaints here. It still is not as good as the Kracie botanical olive one, takes longer to break down sunscreen and makeup, and may leave behind a slight amount of waterproof mascara if you aren't thorough enough with massaging/letting it sit on the skin long enough to melt everything.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Has not bothered mine, but fragrance is pretty strong. \n\n**Scent:** Strong floral. Although not strong enough to CHOKE on like some Korean products - those of intimate with Korean skincare - you know what I'm talking about. /sideyes my mom's side of the skincare in the bathroom\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** No, I don't like the scent and the packaging. It's hard to close properly on first try. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# (Not A First Cleanser But) [Equate Eye Makeup Remover](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Beauty-Oil-Free-Eye-Makeup-Remover-5-5-oz/39139097) 5.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfnqtmh5y6251.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05638b521fa8a76a4fe2673625e2b750241a492f\n\n**Cost:** $4 \n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Chloride, Dipropylene Glycol, Poloxamer 182, Allantion, Tetrasodium Edta, Benzalkonium Chloride, Glycerin, Cucumber (Cucumis Sativus), Fruit Extract, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium Phosphate. \n\n**Texture:** You gotta shake it before use. Watery but has silicone slip and thickness. \n\n**Efficacy:** I've used this as a first cleanser with a cotton pad in a pinch on extra lazy nights. It pretty works well to remove things pretty well although it WILL leave a residue obviously that you have to wash off. Honestly can't really tell the difference between this and the Neutrogena one and it's cheaper so. I use it to remove eyelash glue and waterproof mascara that I put on them. \n\nIt doesn't magically whisk away a mess of water-resistant lash glue residue + waterproof mascara on top of THAT (i don't really think anything can) but it's adequate, cheap, fragrance-free, oil-free and prolongs the wear on my beloved Miche Bloomin falsies (Girly Flair is the most popular bc of Pony Makeup but that style is horrible for me - it's SUPER fragile and breaks so easily compared to the other styles) by 10x. \n\nI just pour some in my palm and poke the lashes in a little puddle of it for a bit till the mascara comes off and then remove the glue with my fingers afterward. I don't wash them off afterward and whatever residue it leaves behind does not interfere at all with the next coat of mascara I put on them lashes.\n\n(Gonna write a separate review, but FYI - I prefer [DUO quick drying lash glue](https://www.ulta.com/duo-quick-set-lash-adhesive-clear?productId=pimprod2003529) in the purple label more than the super famous Japanese [D-Up Eyelash Fix](https://www.amazon.co.jp/D-UP-%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A2%E3%83%83%E3%83%97-4946324013622-D-U-P-%E3%82%A2%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC/dp/B0012VQTO2/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=d-up&qid=1590969259&sr=8-5) that's touted as #1 globally. I find that it's SOOO much quicker drying than D-Up and makes the lashes stick BETTER, longer, and stands stronger to tears. Plus it's latex-free too, for sensitive eyes. And way cheaper! I regret getting extra back ups of the D-Up thinking it'll be the best thing ever. There are still some cons that D-Up has an upperhand on, but I'll talk about that in that review post.)\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell yeah. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMini-Review on the **Garnier Skin Active Micellar Cleansing Water (Pink Cap):** This was just a sample so I ran out of it pretty fast but I remember being surprised that it actually was pretty effective at removing waterproof makeup. Scent-free, I quite liked it I think. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water, For Waterproof Makeup (Blue Cap), 13.5 Fl Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4fb7kb6y6251.jpg?width=556&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b56036478b358bd5043af8f80652b63a71cb7f9f\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $6.59 on Amazon. \n\n**Ingredients:** AQUA/WATER, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, ISOHEXADECANE, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DECYL GLUCOSIDE, POLYAMINOPROPYL BIGUANIDE. F.I.L.# D178190/1 \n\n**Texture:** Watery, greasy. I hate this. I got it mainly to remove waterproof sunscreen from my neck and chest at the end of the day without taking a whole damn shower. Leave a very unpleasant, greasy residue that I cannot stand on my skin. No. \n\n**Efficacy:** I only tried removing my makeup with this several times and it was okay I think. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Definitely. \n\n**Repurchase?** No. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Sensibio H2O 500 ml / 16.7 fl oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3q1ucyc8y6251.jpg?width=443&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ffe3ed17780adf84d930a94d27ae29416decdc52\n\n**Cost:** $15 on Amazon.com\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (aqua), Peg-6 Caprylic/capric Glycerides, Cucumis Sativus (cucumber) Fruit Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Propylene Glycol, Disodium Edta, Cetrimonium Bromide. \n\n**Texture:** Watery, very light! Refreshing. Doesn't leave a greasy gross residue like above. I still splash water on top of the skin before toweling off and I still can feel a slight film. Ideally, I would like to wash it all off bc Lab Muffin says it's still not the best to leave surfactants on the skin, but most nights I can't be bothered and it shouldn't be *that* bad if people in places with harsh water just leave it on the skin, right? \n\nI guess a way to deal with that would be to wipe away using a toner/water/spray with a cotton pad or something but idk, that's more unnecessary garbage I feel. And more rubbing sensitive skin. \n\n**Efficacy:** This is fairly new. Got it for the same reason as the Garnier blue cap. It removes my waterproof sunscreen from my neck just fine with a baby wipe or cotton pad. But for everyday, I much prefer a cleansing oil to reduce the amount of tugging and rubbing on my skin as well as disposable wipes or pads. I tried it for removing waterproof mascara from my falsies like the Equate one, but it was okay, similar, but not as good and not as \"conditioning\" on my falsies to keep them soft. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** For me, yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** Yes! \n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext on my Wish List!!:\n\n\\- Muji Sensitive Cleansing Oil 400 ml\n\n\\- Muji Mild Cleansing Oil 400 ml \n\n\\- Muji Mild Milky Cleansing 200 ml \n\n\\- More cleansing gels (first cleansers NOT second cleansers) (I've tried Kikumasamune one before and I really liked that one for heavy, non-waterproof makeup days! Also Innisfree Jeju Bija cleansing gel - but this dried my skin out a bit when used as a LONE first cleanser but for some odd reason was fine when followed up with an actual second cleanser! So strange. That was years ago tho. Much earlier than Kiku.)\n\n\\- DHC Deep Cleansing Oil\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------\n\nHope that helps! \n\n(Ugh I have so many review posts and other posts I wanna write and I can't get them off my mind but I gotta wait for the big sunscreen & ceramide/pseudo-ceramide/urea creams review posts bc I'm so damn extra and gotta wait til I can take more Before & After photos months apart and compare winter vs summer performances. /eyeroll \n\nBUT I WANNA TALK ABOUT MORE SKINCARE RIGHT NOOOWWW SDKFJSD32kfd#@! But don't want to make claims or claim favs without *absolute* thorough testing either.. Sigh, the struggle!!!)",

Biore has a strong alcoholic scent (and stings my eyes) while the alcohol content in LRP is not noticeable.\n\nColor\n\n* CeraVe and LRP have a light yellow tint while Biore has more of a cream color.\n\nConsistency:\n\n* Biore has a gel-like texture. LRP feels like a cream moisturiser that is similar to La Mer soft cream. CeraVe is a paste.\n\nSpreadability:\n\n* Biore and LRP are easily spreadable. CeraVe is difficult to spread, forms lumps and cannot be spread evenly.\n\nFinish:\n\n* CeraVe sits on the skin and remains a pile of cream-colored gunk no matter how long I leave it on. It pills upon application of any makeup above it.\n\n* Biore settles into the skin within 3-5 minutes. White cast is present but barely noticeable. It is non-drying and finishes slightly dewy afterwards. Foundation friendly, can replace primer. When I don't put on make-up I find it necessary to apply loose powder over it so that it looks matte.\n\n* LRP takes 5-8 minutes to settle into the skin. A barely noticeable white cast is present and it has a nice even texture. It is non-drying and finishes slightly more dewy than Biore. Foundation-friendly and can replace primer.\n\nRemoval:\n\n* All three sunscreens can be removed by Cetaphil cleanser, but CeraVe requires more rubbing than the other two sunscreens. You should be able to wash off all three with a regular body wash.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\n* I don't know why I still haven't thrown away the CeraVe AM. I should have done so earlier.\n\n* Both LRP and Biore are nice sunscreens. Although there are many Japanese sunscreens that have comparable or better performance, Biore should be one of the best choice within this price range.\n\n* LRP is known to have a wide range of sunscreens with different consistencies and added functions. They are also well known for making high PPD sunscreens (good UVA protection). Uvidea Aqua Fresh Gel is indeed a very good sunscreen. Being a Japanese-based line under La Roche Posay, it is very well balanced between good UVA protection typical of an European sunscreen and user-friendly consistency of a Japanese sunscreen, but I am expecting more from it with its high price.",

I'm a male and I accidentally bought the tinted one which felt weird because it looked like makeup, but tried it anyway and it was excellent.

When you are poor, the investment is often too much to come up with, even though many products will last you a really long time. I have excellent skin to begin with, though it is very sensitive. I get hormonal acne when I ovulate and during my period, but mostly my skin has always been clear. I have created a guide for products that I've used and have seen work well but are low cost and not harsh on my sensitive skin. Obviously I'm not a dermatologist, so your results may vary.\n\n**Spot Treatment**\n\n**$1** [Acne Cream](http://www.dollartree.com/Acne-Cream-1-5-oz-Tubes/p346503/index.pro) as it is simply titled has worked great for me. It disappears and I add moisturizer over it and have never had any drying. It only costs a dollar and is available online at that link or at most Dollar Tree stores. \n\n^*Ingredients* ^Salicylic ^Acid ^(.5%), ^carbomer, ^cetyl ^alcohol, ^dimethicone, ^glycerin, ^glycol ^stearate, ^methylparaben, ^propylen ^glycol, ^propylparaben, ^squalane, ^triethanolamine, ^water\n\n**Cleanser**\n\n**$1** [Acne Wipes](http://www.dollartree.com/Premoistened-Acne-Face-Wipes-30-ct-Packs/p321467/index.pro) which are also simply titled are something I use once every other day. Also available from the link and Dollar Tree stores. \n\n^*Ingredients* ^Salicylic ^Acid ^(.5%), ^water, ^cetearyl ^Isononanoate, ^ceteareth-20, ^fragrance, ^cetearyl ^alcohol, ^glyceryl ^stearate, ^glycerin, ^ceteareth-12, ^cetyl ^palmitate, ^propylene ^glycol, ^methylparaben, ^disodium ^EDTA, ^propylparaben, ^2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1, ^3-diol\n\n**1$** [Acne Cleanser Pads](http://i.imgur.com/6s6Nyaq.jpg) weren't listed on the website for Dollar Tree, but that is where I have purchased them. They are a bit stronger than the wipes and I use them when I have breakouts, still every other day, and when I'm in a rush.\n\n^*Ingredients* ^Salicylic ^Acid ^(1.0%), ^alcohol, ^aloe ^barbadensis ^leaf ^juice, ^fragrance, ^polysorbate ^20, ^sodium ^chloride, ^tocopheryl ^acetate, ^water\n\n**$6.47** [Equate Gentle Skin Cleanser](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Gentle-Formula-Skin-Cleanser-16-Fl-Oz/10417272) is used before either of the other two products, as neither are true cleansers. This is a generic version of the much raved Cetaphil product and is much cheaper and very effective. It also has the option of leaving it on your skin and not requiring a rinse. It's slightly expensive at $6.47 for 16 fluid ounces.\n\n^*[Ingerdients](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Gentle-Formula-Skin-Cleanser-16-Fl-Oz/10417272#Ingredients)*\n\n**Exfoliation**\n\n**$2.97** [Equate Blackhead Clearing Scrub](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Acne-Medication-Blackhead-Clearing-Scrub-5-oz/10403006) is a product for under three dollars that works very well, including clearing up sebaceous filaments. It is a little harsh, and I can only use it every other day to every two days, but it works immediately and the effects last. It is a physical exfoliant and a lot of people don't like that, but I like this product. \n\nThe ingredients are in the link.\n\n**Moisturizing**\n\n**$6.47** [Equate Moisturizing Lotion](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Fragrance-Free-Sensitive-Skin-Moisturizing-Lotion-16-fl-oz/10403103) is another product comparable to Cetaphil. When I first bought this, I hated it. It took me a while to learn that only a very small amount should be used, otherwise my skin was greasy and it was causing breakouts. Like it's cleansing cousin, it's a bit more expensive at about $6.50 for 16 fluid ounces. \n\nIngredients are in the link.\n\n**$6.27** [Equate Oil-Free Ultra-Gentle Facial Moisturizer](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Oil-Free-Ultra-Gentle-Facial-Moisturizer-4-fl-oz/37233433) is a smaller bottle for about the same money, but never left my face greasy no matter how much I used. It's a 4 fluid ounce bottle at about $6.25. \n\nIngredients are in the link.\n\n**Sunscreen**\n\n**$1-$5** I generally just buy what doesn't eat my face from either Five Below or Dollar Tree. I used trial and error to find one for me, and it's baby sunblock. \n\n~\n\nWith the products that I use, I spend about $3.50 a month on skincare. I used poor lotion until I could swing the good stuff and it never really hurt me, other than learning that I'm allergic to Jergens but I only used it for three days. Dollar Tree carries moisturizer, but I've never tried it. If anyone has, please offer input. I built as I needed to, not everything at once. I hope this helps even one person to be able to take care of their skin on a budget.",

    "body": "**Age-** 27 y/o Female\n\n**Skin type**\\- Combination. T zone is extremely oily during humid weather. Cheeks are dry/normal. Wheatish skin.\n\nClimate- Continental. Currently hot and humid.\n\n**Reviews-**\n\nHello everyone. I have been planning on doing this comparative review for a really long time but was too lazy to write it all. Finally got the mental energy to sit and write it down.\n\nPlease do note that I tested these sunscreens in different seasons. I have used all of them for more than a month, though for some, the use has not been very regular because of the lockdown. Kindly factor that in however you may want to.**The review is strictly based on my personal experience- so ymmv, will differ for different people. Please do take it with a pinch of salt.**\n\n**1. Neutrogena Ultra sheer dry touch sunblock SPF 50**\\- This is the sunscreen I have used the longest amount of time for. Very budget friendly. Provides adequate protection. However earlier when I was not aware of the three finger rule, I would use the same quantity as I would with a moisturiser- it suited me and gave me a matte finish. However, when I began using the required amount, it dried my skin. Every time.  I no longer use it now. The consistency is a like a cream but it blends okay.Also since it is a chemical sunscreen, I have not faced any white cast issue with this.\n\nIngredients-[Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Homosalate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/homosalate), [Benzophenone-3](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/benzophenone-3), [Ethylhexyl Salicylate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-salicylate), [Octocrylene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/octocrylene), [Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyl-methoxydibenzoylmethane), [Silica](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/silica), [Styrene/​Acrylates Copolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/styrene-acrylates-copolymer), [Potassium Cetyl Phosphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-cetyl-phosphate), [Beeswax](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cera-alba), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Dimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone), [Caprylyl Methicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylyl-methicone), [Cetyl Dimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-dimethicone), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Sodium Polyacrylate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-polyacrylate), [Behenyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behenyl-alcohol), [Xanthan Gum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/xanthan-gum), [Chlorphenesin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/chlorphenesin), [Acrylates/​C12-22 Alkyl Methacrylate Copolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-c12-22-alkyl-methacrylate-copolymer), [Dimethicone/​PEG-10/​15 Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone-peg-10-15-crosspolymer), [Ethylhexyl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-stearate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Disodium EDTA](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [BHT](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Chlorhexidine Digluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/chlorhexidine-digluconate), [Ethylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylparaben), [Trideceth-6](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/trideceth-6), [Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/diethylhexyl-2-6-naphthalate)\n\n**Price and Availability**\\- Rs 650 for 88ml. easily available on e commerce sites like Nykaa, Amazon etc.\n\n**2. Innisfree Daily Mild Sunscreen SPF 50 PA ++++-** I got this last year during lockdown because this is the only budget friendly Korean sunscreen I knew of then. Really light lotion like texture and sits well on the face without piling. Gives a semi-dewy finish. However felt a little greasy on my face during humid season. Did it protect me adequately? I actually do not know because I wore it outside only a few times. I did not tan but the exposure to sun was not a lot so cannot be sure. Has a nice fragrance but when has that protected us from…anything. It has atleast three sunscreen filters and percentage is mentioned. But I am not sure if they are sufficient? No white cast with this either. I enjoyed using it except for the greasiness (which is not much but can still be felt).\n\n**Ingredients**\\-Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate 3.5%, Ethylhexyl Triazone 3.0%, Methylpropanediol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine 2.5%, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, Cetearyl Alcohol, C20-22 Alcohols, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Behenyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Tromethamine, Fragrance, Carbomer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polyisobutene, Saccharide Hydrolysate, Fructooligosaccharides, Ethylhexylglycerin, Pullulan, Caprylyl/​Capryl Glucoside, Sorbitan Oleate, Tocopherol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, C14-22 Alcohols, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Cetearyl Glucoside, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract\n\n**Price and availability**\\- Rs 700 for 50ml. Usually on discount so can be bought for around Rs 500 too. Can be purchased from Nykaa, Boddess, Amazon etc.\n\n**3. The Blessing Tree Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++-** Currently my HG. I have worn it a lot. Provides adequate protection. Has a lotion like texture but is thicker than the Innisfree one. Provides a demi matte finish. Does not feel greasy to me. Has a weird smell but that’s okay. It does not bother me much. Since it is a hybrid sunscreen, it does give a tiny amount, almost negligible white cast which settles down fast too. **WRP.**\n\n**Ingredients-** Octyl Methoxycinnamate, Oxybenzone, Titanium Dioxide, Octocrylene, Avobenzone, Zinc Oxide Lotion\n\nInactive Ingredients: Aqua, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Diisopropyl Adipate, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Propanediol, Diethylhexyl Syringylidenemalonate, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Niacinamide, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Perfume\n\n**Price and Availability**\\- Rs 249 for 100ml on Amazon.\n\n**4. Lóreal Paris Aqua Essence UV Perfect Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++-**  Can't speak enough about its amazing consistency and texture. So light and absorbs easily. Haven’t had the opportunity to wear it often since I bought it this year. The first time I wore it, it stung my eyes. The next time it did not sting my eyes but felt greasy because the weather was humid. I dont think the sunscreen is to be blamed for that. It’s major con (and everyone knows that) is the quantity for the price it is sold. No white cast. Might think of repurchasing but not sure about it.\n\nIngredients- Aqua, Alcohol Denat, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Isopropyl Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Propylene Glycol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Styrene/​Acrylates Copolymer, Glycerin, Drometrizole Trisiloxane, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Tocophérol Acétate, Phenoxyethanol, Stearic Acid, Adenosine, PEG-8 Laurate, Palmitic Acid, Ammonium Polyacryldimethyltauramide/​Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Limonene, Linalool, Benzyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Acrylates C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Geraniol, Disodium EDTA, Ceteth-10, Potassium Hydroxide, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Parfum/​Fragrance (F.I.L. C161957/​2)\n\n**Price and Availability-** Rs 515 for 30ml. Usually available on a discounted price of 400 something on Nykaa.\n\nVerdict- I will continue purchasing The Blessing Tree sunscreen. This sub introduced me to this budget friendly option and I am so grateful! The other sunscreens mentioned here are also good, never broke me out (my skin is not sensitive so maybe that’s why) so it totally depends on what you are looking for. I am anticipating queries about Oxybenzone and Co ‘s safety- please do read up on it. They are safe. The only issue with older chemical sunscreen filters is their instability. The newer ones are more stable so I’d definitely explore some of the newer filters in the future. **Other than that- it is more important to wear sunscreen, even if it offers very basic protection than to not wear sunscreen at all.** I hope this review will be helpful! Please ask away anything you would like to in the comments. I will try my best to answer them. (I will also post this under the sunscreen thread).",

    "body": "**Product Review for Stratia Rewind 5% Niacinamide and 2.5% DMAE serum**\n\n**Price:** $16 USD for 1 fl oz.\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Ethoxydiglycol, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, 2-Dimethylamino Ethanol (DMAE), Panthenol, Hydrolized Rice Protein, N-Acetyl Glucosamine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Tamarindus Indica (Tamarind) Seed Extract, Hydrocotyl (Centella Asiatica) Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA\n\n**Claims:** “In scientific studies, DMAE has been shown to reduce the appearance of lines and fine wrinkles and improve the overall appearance of aging skin. Niacinamide can regulate cell turnover, fade hyperpigmentation, reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and strengthen your skin barrier. A few key plant extracts - licorice root, Centella asiatica, and tamarind seed - run the gamut of anti-aging powers, from fading dark spots to powerful antioxidant abilities.\n\nEvery ingredient in Rewind is there for a reason, and that reason is giving you smooth, plump, radiant skin. It’s light yet hydrating enough to be used by all skin types. Use it before your usual moisturizer to give your skin a blast to the past.\n\nLike all Stratia products, Rewind is unfragranced, gimmick-free, and formulated based on hard science.”\n\n**Review:** Alright, here we go, if you’d like a shortened version, there will be a summary at the end. Otherwise, buckle in for this ride.\n\nI purchased this on the 18th of May, received it on the 22nd and have since been using it twice a day every single day. My skin is usually dry and dehydrated but is now normal and hydrated af, more on that later. My skin concerns are hormonal acne, clogged pores and texture. I purchased this instead of the TO Niacinamide 10% + Zinc since I wasn’t sure how the zinc would affect my dry skin and I was worried about the potential irritation from such a high concentration of niacinamide. Plus, the addition of DMAE in this formula seemed promising.\n\nMy first impression was that the serum had an odd texture. It isn’t unpleasant at all, but it feels different than any other hydrator I’ve ever applied to my skin. It has more body to it. I originally mixed it with my The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid serum because it felt a bit weird to layer one on and then the other since this serum had a thicker consistency. It feels kind of tacky on the skin but it goes away pretty quickly and there’s zero smell whatsoever.\n\nY’all, my skin is the best that it’s ever been. The only product that changed in my routine was this (anything I removed was removed after seeing the improvements caused by this product).  The rough, bumpy texture of my skin has completely minimized to the degree that it’s practically disappeared. My skin used to suck up all the hydration I gave it but never held on to it. Regardless of the moisturizer I used or how many layers of hydrating products, within an hour or two it would go back to feeling dry, and rough. Now my skin is soft and hydrated all day. My skin no longer appears dull, I can even see the light bouncing off of my skin. I don’t even *need* to use a thick cream moisturizer anymore like I used to. I can get away with a simple gel, an emulsion or the thinnest layer of cream and my skin is completely fine. I can moisturize my face just once in the day and that dry, and the tight feeling never returns.\n\nI stopped using a vitamin c serum and this was just as effective at fading marks of hyperpigmentation. This has also helped in keeping my pores from clogging as much since I no longer need heavy products. I ran out of my HA serum less than halfway into using this and have seen more improvements in my skin using this as my sole hydrator. I’m only halfway through the bottle but I’ve already ordered a backup because this has become a permanent product in my routine. If I’d known that my skin would have flourished like this, I would have bought this months ago and saved myself so much money on trial and error.\n\n**My routine prior to adding this:**\n\n***AM***\n\n1. Water Rinse\n2. The Inkey List HA serum\n3. TO Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA (I dropped this recently because it’s been clogging the fuck out of my pores and now I have two giant pimples on my forehead and whiteheads everywhere) or Stratia Liquid Gold (won’t be repurchasing simply because I no longer need it, but this was a nice product. I still have less than an ounce of this left).\n4. Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence or Black Girl Sunscreen\n\n***PM***\n\n1. Cleanse with Dr. Loretta’s Gentle Hydrating Cleanser or Paula’s Choice Defense Gel-to-Cream cleanser\n2. Matsuyama Hadauru Balancing toner (I just stopped using this since Rewind seems to be making the actual difference in my hydration)\n3. The Inkey List Retinol / TO Lactic Acid 10% (this is like once a week once every 2 weeks) / TO Salicylic Acid 2% (only when needed)\n4. The Inkey List HA serum (ran out of this, won’t repurchase)\n5. Etude House SoonJung 2x Barrier Intensive Cream\n\n**My Current Routine:**\n\n***AM***\n\n1. Water Rinse\n2. Stratia Rewind\n3. Etude House SoonJung Emulsion or Barrier Intensive Cream or skip straight to sunscreen\n\n***PM***\n\n1. Same cleansers\n2. Stratia Rewind\n3. Same actives\n4. Etude House SoonJung Emulsion or Barrier Intensive Cream\n\n**Summary**: I feel like this is bottled up angel tears and holy water. It’s left my skin firm, plump, and hydrated and has normalized my skin, faded my hyperpigmentation, and softened my texture. It's replaced my HA serums and my hydrating toners.  This is the one product I've tried where I felt it achieved all it claimed to do.",

    "body": "Hawaiian Tropic Silk Hydration Weightless Face Sunscreen SPF 30\n\nOne of the cues that I picked up on pretty early in my K-Beauty skincare expiration is that…”US sunscreens/brands are simply not on par with their European and Asian counterparts.”.\n\nAnd while that may be true when talking about the effectiveness of more modern UV filters...there is something to be said about the occasional diamond in the rough.\n\nThe Hawaiian Tropic Silk Hydration Weightless Face Sunscreen SPF 30 is one example of a major/well known US sunscreen brand really knocking it out of the park.\n\nThis chemical sunscreen is built around a super lightweight/nearly watery lotion that feels very comfortable on the skin. It’s the closest product I’ve used from a US brand that offers a similar “breathability” to my favorites from Klairs and Krave Beauty.\n\nSkincare-centric ingredients aren’t quite as robust though with Silk Amino Acids, Papaya Fruit Extract, Mango Fruit Extract, Plumeria Flower Extract, and Guava Fruit Extract showing up towards the bottom of the list.\n\nStill, the mild hydration I noticed from this product was surprisingly long lasting (especially with multiple applications throughout the day). And while there is a slight shine to this product right after application...it dissipates into a more soft/satin finish in a minute or so. \n\nAll this combined with a total lack of white cast and a pleasant tropical scent made this a quick favorite to my routine. \n\nI really wish/hope that Hawaiian Tropic releases an SPF 50 of this same formulation. I would feel more comfortable taking this out with me on adventures or applying before light exercise if the protection factor was a bit higher.\n\nBut, for an around the house product or to run a quick errand...the Silk Hydration Weightless Face Sunscreen SPF 30 is a surprise win that holds up well against more “sophisticated” sunscreens.\n\nComing in at less than $10.00 USD and available at most supermarkets/drug stores...it’s one that I will keep in mind when my stash gets low!\n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nActive ingredients\n\nAvobenzone (2.0%) Homosalate (5.5%) Octisalate (4.5%) Octocrylene (4.0%)\n\nInactive ingredients\n\nInactive Ingredients: Water, Isohexadecane, Diisopropyl Adipate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Cetearyl Alcohol, Acrylates/C12-22 Alkyl Methacrylate Copolymer, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Methylparaben, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Fragrance, Propylparaben, Polysorbate 60, Disodium Edta, Xanthan Gum, Aminomethyl Propanol, Mica, Tocopheryl Acetate, Titanium Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Silk Amino Acids, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Antiquorum Root Extract, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Fruit Extract, Passiflora Incarnata Fruit Extract, Plumeria Acutifolia Flower Extract, Psidium Guajava Fruit Extract, Iron Oxides.\n\nWhere To Buy (Target $8.99 USD): [https://www.target.com/p/hawaiian-tropic-silk-hydration-weightless-face-sunscreen-spf-30-1-7oz/-/A-51164217](https://www.target.com/p/hawaiian-tropic-silk-hydration-weightless-face-sunscreen-spf-30-1-7oz/-/A-51164217) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0lgi3s2z1ug51.jpg?width=3915&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74d316f0ce361efbdfa32a834ed23bd046664f1a",

Aldi replaced it with Formic Acid for which CosDNA has no irritant/acne score, but did replace Laureth-10 with Laureth-4 which is worse according to CosDNA (but it’s very low on the ingredients list). \n\nAldi foaming wash has added Lactic Acid lower down on the list (Moisturising in low concentrations).\n\nBoth kinds of Aldi wash have added Glycerin.\n\nAt first glance, Aldi improved their face wash while Simple made theirs possibly slightly worse. \n\nAll product images here https://imgur.com/a/Y2qE1LZ",

It could also be because its notoriously difficult to find ingredients list for Lotus products - they are not mentioned on any retailer & even Lotus' own website. They are printed on the products, but unless you see them in store/in person you wouldn't know. \n\n3. Lotus likes to harp on about natural ingredients as hero ingredient which are often not a majority constituent of their product. That along with hard to find inci list puts it into Biotique adjacent category for many people. Natural isn't trendy anymore, science is. Lotus isn't catering to the growing skincare conscious demographic anymore. \n\n4. Lack of proper reviews of current products leads people to not check out the brand & there continues the vicious cycle, so Lotus keeps getting written off. \n\nBut aside from that from what I've observed people like shitting on the brand as a whole without trying much from it. In my very subjective opinion, people hate legacy brands because ghar ki murgi dal barabar (tl : the chicken at home is considered equal to Dal ; ie familiarity breeds contempt). You'll see the trend across Lakmé, Lotus, Lacto Calamine, Nature's Essence etc. Most people either hate them or write them off as relics of yesteryears. \n\nMany people feel victimised by how mass market Indian brands championed fair skin with white beauty etc type names, so they've grown averse to such brands as a whole.\n\nFor some reason this doesn't apply to massy brands of foreign origin that are guilty of same things like Ponds. I guess subconsciously ppl put foreign fmcg brands on a pedestal. Anyway I'm digressing, that's neither here nor there.",

Butylene Glycol, Haematococcus Pluvialis Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Laminaria extract, Carnitine, Ubiquinone, Collagen, Sodium acetylhyaluronate, Rose Hip Oil, Glyceryl Tricaprylate-caprate, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sodium Hydroxide, Octanediol*\n\n**Product smell, texture & finish:** Lightly scented, viscous fluid that finishes dewy and a bit sticky.\n\n**Product effects compared to claims:** I can't speak for any anti aging clams, since that was not one of my goals, but for hydration it does okay. I haven't noticed any significant changes in my skin since starting to use it. No significant plumping, and hydration wise, I've also noticed minimal effect.\n\n**Where it fits in the routine & how it behaves with other products:** It's a hydrating lotion, so for me it comes right after double cleansing. It does not help with the absorption of other products, it does however make sticky products even stickier since it itself is a viscous, almost slimy feeling fluid. It absorbs much slower than some other lotions I've used in the past.\n\n**How long it has been used for:** Approx. 4 weeks\n\n**Has it been/will it be repurchased:** No, I will be trying other products.\n\n**Concluding remarks:** Overall, it filled a step in my routine as I was waiting for another lotion to come, but I feel that it does not deliver any particular effect in regards to plumping and even hydration. It was just... okay.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Review no.2*\n\n**Full Product Name:** Meishoku Ceracolla Super Moist Lotion\n\n**Skin Type/Skin Tone/Current Climate:** Combo/Fair Olive/Hot & Humid\n\n**Reason for Use:**Hydration & plumping\n\n**Product Size & Price:** [180ml/11,12€](https://www.amazon.de/Ceracolla-Skin-Lotion-180ml-Super/dp/B00IJSWSBE/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1499675589&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=meishoku+ceracolla)\n\n**Packaging:** Drip bottle, very precise. You can easily measure out droplets to evade wasting product.\n\n**Ingredients:** (according to Cosdna)\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Dipropylene glycol, Methyl gluceth-10, PEG-75, Ceramide, Ceramide 3, CERAMIDE 6 II, Hydrolyzed collagen, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Glycosyl Trehalose, Hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, Propylene Glycol, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium chloride, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Propylparaben*\n\n**Product smell, texture & finish:** Scented fluid, ever-so-slightly viscous. Smells like a baby-oriented product, I find it very pleasant.\n\n**Product effects compared to claims:** Quite nice, I've noticed a few changes in hydration levels since starting its use. My skin also appears slightly plumper.\n\n**Where it fits in the routine & how it behaves with other products:** Another hydration lotion which comes right after double cleansing. It's a thin liquid that absorbs fairly easily and does not leave my skin feeling sticky unless I use it for the 3/7 skin method. \n\n**How long it has been used for:** 1 month\n\n**Has it been/will it be repurchased:** Yes, most likely, although I will continue searching for better products. This will work nicely as a secondary hydrating lotion (yes, I'm a product hoarder).\n\n**Concluding remarks:** Very pleasant and affordable. I particularly enjoy the fact that the liquid is not *too* viscous - it stands somewhere in the golden middle, which leaves my skin feeling nice and supple. Its effects have been no where near remarkable, but it is a reliable product for bringing in that extra hydration.\n\n\n\n*Note: I've also posted this in the review section in r/abdiscussion for the audience there. :)*\n",

All ingredient data comes from Amazon.com or Makeup Alley, so it might be imperfect.\n\n*My questions for you:* Are any of these ingredients especially noteworthy? Do you think there are any functional differences between the masks?\n\n*Observations:* The top 5 ingredients in all of the masks are nearly identical, although they appear in different orders on the list, indicating that there may be more or less of them in different masks. They are: **Purified water, Glycerin(e), 1,3-Butylene Glycol, Propylene Glycol, Aloe Barbadensis Gel/Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice/Aloe Extract.** (Not sure of the differences between the aloe ingredients, I'm counting them as one item for the purposes of this comparison.)\n\nA few masks had a unique item in their top 5 ingredients.

They started in 2003, but they have only released masks so far. There have been many other brands that have made it in and out of Taiwan since then, like Naruko for those looking for targeted treatments and White Essence with lotions more advanced than Hada Labo. \n\nThere are many other sheet masks ranges in Taiwan, and they have to be good enough to retain market share against market leader MBD. I haven't looked at any of them.

    "body": "I have short wavy to curly hair that generally gets very frizzy. It is dry, with normal scalp. I have a lot (A LOT) of really thick hair. It is high porosity and takes hours to dry, even when chin lenght as it is now. The texture is very mixed, with some slightly wavy strands all the way up to kinky curly ones. I'd say most of it falls in category 2B.\n\n\nI have been wearing my hair curly and was getting fantastic results with a product by Rene Furterer, the Veloute Perfecteur de Boucles. It was a light, non greasy cream and I could use a fair amount of it without any adverse effects. Something in it really helps with curl formation, and all I had to do was put it into still rather wet hair, and let it dry. Perfect, consistent results every time. The hair was curly, light, perfectly hydrated.\n\n\nHere is the ingredient list:\n\n\n*Water, ethyhexyl palmitate, cetearyl alcohol, acanthus mollis leaf extract, amodimethicone, BHT, butylparaben, cetearyl glucoside, cetrimonium chloride, disodium EDTA, ethylparaben, fragrance (parfum), inulin lauryl carbamate, isobutylparaben, maltodextrin, methylparaben, persea gratissima (avocado) oil (persea gratissima oil), phenoxyethanol, polyquaternium-37, polyquaternium-68, propylparaben, trideceth-12.*\n\n\nA few months ago, they changed the line. Now the cream feels sticky and heavy, and although it still does promote curl formation (could be the acanthe extract, that is what the brand claims in their marketing), it makes my hair greasy and stringy and really just not nice. So, cue in another product hunt. Lots of money already into it, I'm not getting there... I now need a leave in, a defining curl cream and a gel to get lesser results, and I have to be so careful not to touch my hair under penalty of turning into a frizz ball.\n\n\nHere are the ingredients of the new, totally not improved product:\n\n\n*Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behenamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Acanthus Mollis Leaf Extract, Alpha Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, BHT, Butylphenyl, Methylpropional, Ceteareth-33, Citronellol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance (Parfum), Glycerin, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Hexyl Cinnamal, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Lactic Acid, Limonene, Linalool, Maltodextrin, Oenothera Biennis, (Evening Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Phenoxyethanol, Polyquaternium-68, Salicylic Acid, Sorbic Acid, Tocopherol, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Dissucinate.*\n\n\n**Is there anyone who is knowledgeable enough to take a look at the differences between old and new and maybe shed some light on how I can find another perfect product? My wallet and I thank you in advance.**",

An inch or two shorter than classic length (Aka mid butt length hair), High Porosity\n* **Hair concerns:** Split ends, normal amount of hairfall, prone to frizz, can look dry and damaged if I don't take care of it.\n* **Scalp type:** Normal, I think. Gets oily 2nd day night or 3rd day morning after hairwash\n* **Scalp concerns:** I don't use any product on my scalp but I feel like it's prone to build up and if I don't use an anti-dandruff shampoo every few washes, I get CCs on my forehead. Whatever causes my CCs are particularly invisible but my then derm insisted it was dandruff and following her regimen did get rid of the CCs without any skincare topical or prescription.\n* **Age/age range** \\- 25 to 35\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Current Haircare routine:**\n\n1. Pre Shampoo - Some homemade oil concoction (I add a lot of tiny oil bottles, I needed to empty, so I just mixed them all together.) or Plum Avocado Hair Mask\n2. Anti dandruff - Scalpe pro (I got L'oreal pure clay a while ago, to see if that will work instead of this, but haven't fully tested it out yet)\n3. Scalp shampoo - Alpecin Double Effect\n4. Length of the hair - Dove hydrating shampoo for curly hair (early days, haven't formed any impression yet.)\n5. Protein conditioner - Plum Olive and Macadamia Hair Mask (as and when necessary)\n6. Conditioner - Garnier Hair Food Papaya variant or Banana variant ( I like Papaya way better than banana, but neither of them are worth full price and Im still mourning the discontinuation of Matrix biolage purple cap)\n\nI've reviewed quite a few of the products I use, including Alpecin [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/vqot48/my_current_haircare_routine_reviews_reequil/), but Alpecin deserves its own review.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Climatic conditions under which the product was tested:** All. Summer, What passes for winter in the south, Monsoon.\n* **Usage timeline:** 1.5 years atleast. Almost done with my second bottle. And I've purchased it in Mid-September, this bottle has lasted me 8 months.\n* **Ingredient List:** [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n* **Price:** MRP 699 for 200 ml. Never seen this on discount. :(\n* **Texture, Consistency details:** Normal shampoo consistency, A blueish grey colour, so definitely added colour. You can see a hit of the colour and consistency [here](https://imgur.com/CVTsVhO.jpg)\n* **Fragrance:** HEAVILY fragranced. It's marketed towards Men, I think, so it smells of Men's aftershave.\n* **Usage:** I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply **on scalp only (Never below nape)**. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp. If I've oiled twice, I shampoo twice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Effect on hair issues and result of using the product:** Shiny frizz free hair, but definite loss of volume. If I had to use 1 word to describe it \"sleek\".\n* **Experience and thoughts in detail:**\n\n***Old Review, copied from my previous post and slightly edited***\n\nThis shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation.\n\nAlpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (obvious conflict of interests. I remember reading the study but can only find the [abstract](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17396054/) now) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit this for it. Maybe it'll work for others but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Updated Review***\n\nBarely anything to update if I'm honest. I stand by everything I said above, and they still hold true.\n\nAbout hairfall, I definitely don't think it helps. SO still thinks it helps, but acknowledges that he likes the user experience of it so much that he may be biased. Don't trust him.\n\nIn 2018, the UK Advertising Standards Authority ruled that caffeine shampoo Alpecin must no longer advertise that it can \"help to reduce hair loss\" as there was no adequate evidence to support the claim.  ***I definitely don't recommend buying this hoping it'll cure your hairfall issues.***\n\nThe main reason, I wanted to re-review this, is to post [this video](https://imgur.com/pt98TCe)\n\nI took these too [Pic 1](https://imgur.com/Sb7u13B.jpg), [Pic 2](https://imgur.com/fZMkSHb.jpg), but even though they are from back cam, quality is super bad. The video is a decent representation of what it looks like.  I'll update this post with better pics when I'm able to take them.\n\n**Other things to add**\n\n* The whole time I used Alpecin, I also used Scalpe pro. ie I used scalpe pro every few washes most of the year, but peak summer and winter or if I see signs of CCs, I used it every single wash and followed it up with Alpecin.  So every wash I used Alpecin but every few washes I used Scalpe pro + Alpecin.\n* u/santa96 has commented below that it didn't work for them, so I was running over possibilities. And one theory is the AD shampoo was actually stripping than I thought (I have used it alone, only for experimenting / testing purposes.  I originally thought it wasn't as stripping as most other AD shampoos but still drying compared to regular shampoos. Which is why I followed it up with Alpecin. But it could be that continued usage, caused dryness and the protein in the Alpecin was immediate damage control and THAT's why I love it so much.\n* This is just a hypothesis and is of now, untested. But my scalpe pro is almost over and I should know in a couple of months if I right.\n* Anyone for now, I obviously need to test it out under more conditions. This review is moot.

In fact except for a couple of months in the middle where I damaged my hair in beach vacations, my hair is way way way more healthier now than it was before.\n\nb) If I use it with a garden variety clarifying shampoo instead of a stripping anti-dandruff shampoo, will I still rave about it.\n\nAnswer: Yes.

I also felt that it did not clean my scalp enough. I felt cleaner with even sulphate free options. And the smell was not something I enjoyed. To top it up it was 700 Rs!\nWith this post in picture I realized I had bought the other variant, the blue bottle Alpecin Caffeine Hair Growth & Hair Fall Control Shampoo and not this red one.

    "body": "Hello fellow kiwis. I'm sure I'm not the only one who has been on this subreddit for a while, exasperated and disheartened at the lack of products we have access to. I'm going to share a bit of information about the products I have found available in supermarkets and nationwide stores, due to my obsession with poring through skincare aisles.\n\n**BHAs:**\n\n[Clean & Clear Advantage Fast Clearing Spot Gel 10g](http://www.thewarehouse.co.nz/red/catalog/product/Clean-%26-Clear-Advantage-Fast-Clearing-Spot-Gel-10g?SKU=1336248): Available at the Warehouse for $10.99. Countdown doesn't carry this on its own, it sells the combined pack of 4 kit with a cleanser + whatever else. 10g seems small but it has lasted me ages! I used it as a nightly or twice daily spot treatment, and I put it on my T zone where my SFs are. It doesn't burn or anything.\n\nIngredients\n\nActive ingredient: **salicylic acid** 2%-acne medication. Inactive ingredients: alcohol, ammonium hydroxide, benzalkonium chloride, butylene glycol, c12-15 alkyl lactate, c13-14 isoparaffin, capryloyl glycine, cedrus atlantica bark extract, cetyl lactate, cinnamomum zeylanicum bark extract, cocamidopropyl pg-dimonium chloride phosphate, cyclopentasiloxane, dehydroxanthan gum, denatonium benzoate, fragrance, glycerin, hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel)\n\nClearasil Ultra - Rapid Action Pads. 65 Pads.\nThese are available at countdown. I can't remember the exact price but they're around $12-15. A few downsides - there is a lot of liquid in this pot and it leaked when I was travelling, so I had to keep it in a plastic bag. It does mean though that you could probably use half a pad, and use any excess liquid in the bottom with cotton pads. This kind of stings when it goes on, and the pads are textured for some reason so it's best to pat your face with them. \n\nIngredients\n\nActive Ingredients: **Salicylic Acid** (2%) (Purpose: Acne medication) Inactive Ingredients: Water, Alcohol Denatured, Isoceteth 20, Hydrogen Peroxide, Fragrance, Sodium Hydroxide, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Propylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Dipropylene Glycol, Methylparaben, EDTA (Ethylenediamine-Tetra-Acetic Acid), Potassium Sorbate, Butylparaben, Ethylparaben, Propylparaben\n\nThese both have denatured alcohol in them, so might not be ideal for those are sensitive to that.\n\n**AHA**\n\nThis is the reason I made this post! This is the first thing I have found with an AHA in it. I really want to try the St Ives pads but ordering them online is a mission. The only AHA I can get my hands on is lactic acid in the form of milk and yoghurt, but I'm not keen on putting those on my face every night. I found these today:\n\n[Skinfood Facial Cleansing Wipes](http://www.skinfood.co.nz/skin-care/all-products/facial-cleansing-wipes.html) - $10.19 online, or I found them in countdown for approximately the same, or $8.90 on special with onecard today anyway. Bloody good ingredient list if I don't say so myself. I tried one tonight and they are very soft, and big. 25 in a pack. I am not sure whether this contains a good concentration of AHA, but it is an option.\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Glycerine Cocoglucoside, Aloe Vera Extract Chamomile Extract, **Lactic Acid**, Methylisothiazolinone, Methylchloroisothiazolinone.\n\n**Clay Mask**\n\n[Freeman Avocado & Oatmeal Facial Clay Mask](http://www.freemanbeauty.com/product/avocado-oatmeal-facial-clay-mask)\n\nDon't get excited about the price on that website - I found this in farmers and if I remember correctly it was about $20 - but definitely worth it. They have different kinds of masks, I think I remember seeing the Pomegranate Facial Revealing Peel-Off Mask and one other one, and they also have them all in sample packets for about $2. This one comes out green, smells lovely, and dries really quickly. \n\n**Things that I use, and other info**\n\nBenzac AC in a white tube is probably the cheapest **benzoyl peroxide** product - the 5% one I've seen in Countdown and Pak'n'Save, but Pharmacies have it in 2.5% and 10% as well. I got the 5% one and I use it very very sparingly as a spot treatment on my hormonal acne when it flares up, and it does a good job of clearing it, although I wish I had found the 2.5% first. It is about $20 in Countdown. Use too much though and you'll risk flakiness and redness like I got. I would recommend not making this a habit, only a spot treatment if necessary. Clearasil also does a benzoyl peroxide cream as well, which I have seen in countdown.\n\nI also use Cetaphil Gentle Skin **Cleanser** which is in countdown and farmers, it doesn't dry my skin out or give it a tight feeling. I got the biggest size bottle and it will last me AGES. Cetaphil moisturiser isn't my favourite though - it leaves quite a waxy feeling on my skin.\n\nI use Aveeno SPF 30 **moisturiser** which is in all supermarkets, which is a chemical sunscreen. This stings my face when I have irritated my skin too much though, and sometimes pills on my sin. I have a tonne of Neutrogena SPF 50/70/80/100 chemical sunscreens that I use on my face as well, which are good, albeit make me very shiny. \n\nI found jojoba **oil** in Farmers - there are two sizes, and both are fairly expensive - I think I bought the 30ml one for around $30? The pumps squirt out the oil really inefficiently. I'm not sure if I'll buy it again. They have some argan oil there as well - only one brand though and it is expensive. If you really want to buy oils, I recommend checking out Iherb, linked to further down in the post.\n\nI bought the Olay Regenerist vibrating brush face cleanser thing from the warehouse for $35.99. I've used it about three times cautiously. I have been told by someone on this sub that it causes microtears in the skin due to the way it vibrates. When using it on my face I do notice that it kind of moves my skin in different directions, so I can see how it might be a bit rough and cause abrasions. I'm not sure I want to risk microtears so I might not use it on my face any more.\n\nI bought [DermaLab Super Hydrating Moisturiser](http://www.dermalab.co.nz/moisturiser/) from farmers and love it.\n\nThe Warehouse has huge bulk packs of cotton pads and balls for like $3. \n\nYou can find CeraVE on Amazon, but I haven't given that a try yet. Some places don't ship to NZ, PM me/leave a comment if you want to order some and I will find my bookmark of the ones that ship to NZ.\n\n\n**Websites that ship to NZ:**\n\n[Paula's Choice no longer has a NZ site, but does ship to NZ for a flat rate of $15US, arriving in about 8 days](http://www.paulaschoice.com). They regularly have specials and discounts. PM me if you are a new purchaser who would like $10 off your first purchase. PC usually has discount codes that give 20% off - PRPAULA20 currently works as of May 2014.\n\n[Garden of Wisdom](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/mandelicacids.html) ships to NZ, as well as [Silk Naturals](http://host.silknaturals.com/creb/toners-c-107_122.html). Iherb has a [LOT](http://www.iherb.com/search?kw=aha&x=0&y=0#p=1), like that [Aztec Clay](http://www.iherb.com/Aztec-Secret-Indian-Healing-Clay-1-lb-454-g/29363#p=1&oos=1&disc=0&lc=en-US&w=st%20ives&rc=22&sr=null&ic=2) and even raw ACV, but is lacking certain brands like St Ives. Not sure about shipping costs or times for any of these sites. It's not as ideal as buying things instore, but it's there if you want certain things.\n\nI have used [Iherb](http://www.iherb.com/) twice now and it is great. Use the search bar for recommendations as to what to buy from there. Choose the $8 shipping and it will arrive in about a week. This is where you should go if you are looking for **cheap AHAs** - look for the Alpha Hydrox brand. It also has a tonne of cheap ELF products, as well as Raw Apple Cider Vinegar, Aquaphor, Aztec Clay Mask, Mint Julep Mask, Coconut oil, etc.\n\nPLEASE add your own products that you use! I want to have a good idea of what works for people and what we have in NZ. \n",

    "body": "**Liquid Gold Review, or: How I learned overexfoliation is a bad thing**\n\n**TL;DR:** If your moisture barrier is damaged, this stuff will seriously change your life. Support an up-and-coming indie shop and repair your moisture barrier, all without breaking your wallet.\n\n**Background:** I recently upped my skincare game considerably through the infinite wisdom and patience of r/SkincareAddiction and r/AsianBeauty. I’ve always been both a science nerd (currently working myself through a Masters program to be a physician assistant) and a product junkie, and those two things have gloriously collided over the last few months to the benefit of my skin! The AB side bar has an excellent list of blogs, one of which I fell way down deep into is The Acid Queen. Alli, who runs the blog, is a seriously impressive DIY’er, which allowed me to get involved in her guinea pig pool for testing product formulations she was currently tinkering with. I’ve spent the last five weeks testing her moisture barrier repair moisturizer, Liquid Gold, and here are my thoughts! The formatting of these sections is shamelessly ripped from bloggers whose reviewing formats I admire: Fiddy Snails, Skin & Tonics, Fan-B, Snow, and of course, Her Majesty The Acid Queen Herself ;)\n\n**What it’s supposed to do:** Liquid Gold is a moisture barrier repair moisturizer/emulsion. (For more info on what a moisture barrier is, see Skin & Tonics excellent moisture barrier post linked in the sources.) Liquid Gold takes your thinned out, red, overexfoliated, stinging, weakened skin and makes it supple, bouncy, strong, and able to tolerate some serious heavy-lifting from acids and actives. It accomplishes all this with the magic of CERAMIDES *oooh ahhhh*\n\n**How to use it:** We’ve got two recommended options here. The first is a thin layer all over your face as the first occlusive step of…well, however many of those you have. The second is a thicker layer as a deeper moisturizing sleeping pack of sorts. I’ve been going with option 1, twice a day every day, AM and PM. Its consistency is slightly thicker than a serum, but not as thick as a gel cream or oily despite the ingredients list (more on that in a moment). It’s BRIGHT yellow-orange from the sea buckthorn, but spreads pretty easily and only leaves the tiiiiniest yellow cast after I’ve spread it in. However, my paleness makes Casper the ghost look like a tanning bed addict, so I imagine on most other skin tones it wouldn’t be visible at all. One of the things I love about this product is how quickly it dries down. I’m (gleefully) looking down the barrel at 15+ steps in my PM routine, so anywhere I don’t have to wait for dry time, I’m a happy camper. I don’t wear makeup often, but I’ve brought it out a number of days to see how Liquid Gold plays under makeup. I’m pleased to say it holds up just fine, without makeup settling into fine lines, caking, or otherwise disintegrating throughout the day.\n\n[**Here's some photos of it in action!**](http://imgur.com/a/knjp4)\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (Aqua), Propylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Niacinamide, Polyglyceryl-3 Methyglucose Distearate, Rosa Mosqueta (Rose) Hip Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Seed Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Fruit Oil, Panthenol, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Squalane (olive-derived), Cetyl Alcohol, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Ceramide NP, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA.\n\n**Notable Ingredients:** Oh, man…all of them?! This ingredients list is STRAIGHT FIRE if we are talking moisture barrier repair. Let’s break that down, shall we? I’m going to limit my highlights because otherwise I will literally never finish this review.\n\n**Ceramide Complex** (Ceramide NP, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP; Phytosphingosine; Cholesterol): The Beauty Brains, another fabulous “science of skincare” blog, has a great discussion of ceramides (see sources for link) and describes them so: “Ceramides form a kind of water-proofing barrier in the upper layers of skin. They’re not only critical for helping skin retain water but they also help repair the skin’s natural barrier and regulate cells. Ceramide production dwindles with age which can result in dry skin, wrinkles and even some types of dermatitis.” The other important thing to know about ceramides is that they are team players. Ceramides without fatty acids and cholesterol won’t get you very far. Specifically, ceramides penetrate best with a mixture of 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% fatty acids. So maybe you’ll find a product with ceramide floating around in the ingredient list, but good luck finding one with all three players…and if you do, cross your fingers they’re in the optimal ratio. Except that’s exactly what we have in Liquid Gold. Hell yes.\n\n**Niacinamide:** Why hello, my old friend! I’ll let the Queen herself explain the wonders for niacinamide: “One of the most studied skincare ingredients, niacinamide does everything: smooths fine lines and wrinkles, increases ceramide and fatty acid synthesis, regulates skin cell turnover, fades hyperpigmentation, evens skin tone, and has powerful anti-inflammatory properties.” Naturally then, it seems like niaciamide is in errything these days, but who knows how much is in there? Niacinamide is most effective at 3-5%, so unless the percentage is disclosed, we’re left stacking niacinmide products to reach that threshhold. Liquid Gold has 4%, which happens to be the same amount you’d get if this ingredient was included in a Curology prescription. Jackpot.\n\n**Sea Buckthorn:** Again, from The Beauty Brains: “[Sea buckthorn is] known for being rich in a number of bioactive compounds, including the following: vitamins A, B1, B2, C, D, K, and P; omega 3, 6, 7, and 9; 43 lipids, organic acids, amino acids, folic acids, tocopherols, flavonoids, phenols, terpenes, tannins, [and] 20 mineral elements.” Okay…but what does all that do for your skin? Well, we’ve got some studies that show all that goodness adds up to improved wound healing, protection from UV damage, and increased collagen production (see sources for link).\n\n**Rose Hip Oil:** High in oleic and linoleic acids, both of which are polyunsaturated fatty acids important for the integrity and regeneration of skin cell membranes. More moisture barrier magic going on here, my friends.\n\n**Okay, but seriously…**everything in this ingredients list is AMAZING. And rightly so, that’s the whole idea behind DIY in the first place: if you make it yourself, you know everything is there for a reason without any fluff or fillers.\n\n**How it worked:** And here’s where the other part of the title of this post comes into play. I have a long and glorious history of overexfolating my skin because…well, basically because that’s what I thought I was supposed to do. Physical exfoliants, all sorts of acids, inappropriately high strength retinoids…I would throw them all at my face at once every single day until literally my whole top layer of skin peeled off in sheets in the shower and I was shiny and red as a cherry. Even normally gentle products would sting like the devil, and I never questioned it because I honestly thought that’s how it was supposed to work. I’d fry the life out of my skin until I couldn’t handle it (so like 3-4 straight days of all this), then take a break for a week, maybe less, and then I’d start all over again. It was a roller coaster, let me tell you, and I did this for years. \n\nThen I found this post on FutureDerm that totally blew my mind about setting a schedule for building tolerance to retinoids (see sources for link). So I mapped out my schedule for all 24 weeks and promised myself I would be patient. I went without actives for over a month, then took another crack at one night with lower strength Tazorac, my drug of choice. Disappointingly, I still peeled like a snake for the next three days, despite babying my skin before and after the Tazorac. The next week, the same thing. I was beginning to doubt the wisdom of the retinoid tolerance schedule.\n\nEnter Liquid Gold.\n\nI got on Alli’s testing list and got a bottle in the mail soon after. I am not exaggerating when I say this is literally the most amazing shit I have ever put on my face in my life. Redness starting receding within days. A night with retinoids was no longer followed with peeling, pain, redness, or stinging — all of my hallmarks of a compromised moisture barrier. I tentatively and slowly moved through increasing the frequency of the retinoid. Once, twice, three times, four times a week, two interminable week periods per increase. So far, so good. I can feel fairly confident that Liquid Gold is the responsible party here since the rest of my non-actives routine stayed stable while I was tinkering with how to reintroduce them after my hiatus. Gradually, I added all my actives back in so that now, here’s what I’ve got going on my face: 1) Tazorac 0.05% gel 4x/week; 2) Curology 0.009% tretinoin, 9% azelaic acid, 1% clindamycin every night; 3) Paula’s Choice Resist 2% BHA morning and night; 4) Timeless 20% Vitamin C+E Ferulic Acid serum (AM only).\n\nEvery time I wash my face, I think today will be the day I finally overdo it and start feeling my barrier damaged again. BUT NO. My skin feels strong, bouncy, resilient, and looks glowing. My husband pokes me in the face, nods knowingly, and declares, “Chok chok.” He’s right. Now, I’ve been throw actives at my face like there’s no tomorrow and my face takes it like a champ. Eventually, I’m hoping to add in an AHA and up my Tazorac to 0.1%, but my schedule says I’m not allowed to do that for another few months. I’m glowing like the goddamn North Star thanks to all those actives, and I can keep coming back for more thanks to the almost surreal talents of Liquid Gold.\n\nI started to panic a bit the closer I got to the end of my bottle since this was a DIY formula since I absolutely had neither time time nor inclination to whip up a batch myself and didn’t know what I would do when I ran out. The day before I was about to email Alli and beg her to keep making me some forever in exchange for my first born child, SHE OPENED HER OWN SHOP ONLINE!!! This is the best news my skin has ever had. I immediately purchased a 60 mL glass pump bottle of Liquid Gold for $24 from Stratia, The Acid Queen’s shop website. After having such a fabulous experience with this, you better believe I threw Rewind, her DMAE serum, into my cart with a quickness. \n\n**Conclusion:** This shit is my life now. It let’s me go active-crazy without unduly compromising my moisture barrier and makes my skin feel stronger than it has in my entire life. It’s affordable, pleasant to use day and/or night, well-formulated, conscientiously packaged, and made in-house by a fellow skincare junkie on the other side of the country. I couldn’t be happier to love this product and have the opportunity to support her shop.\n\n[Stratia Skin, Liquid Gold, $24](https://www.stratiaskin.com/collections/skincare/products/liquid-gold)\n\n*Disclosure: I was asked to write a review of this product that was originally intended only for Alli to read for formulation feedback and my experience with the product. I only decided to write it for public consumption when I realized she was opening the shop and other people could get this product. I did not accept the product with an agreement to review it positively, nor have I received any monetary compensation for doing so.

the only seal is a tinfoil seal over the product (there wasnt any plastic seal over the outside). mine came intact, and i had to peel it away from the rim of the tub so i know it wasnt tampered with.\n\nnow in comparison to [solimo's body butter](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ovszld/product_review_solimo_green_tea_body_butter/) which i used before opening this. solimo feels waxier (see how the light reflects differently in the pics of the product in their containers?) and slightly more occlusive than joy. the latter is easier to spread and is more creamy/soft and greasy, so it doesnt dry down the same way solimo does.\n\ni think i prefer solimo on my hips bec the contact/friction from my clothing blots out the joy cream a little more. it does a good job though.. i might be nitpicking, i think i just need to add some petroleum jelly and i'll be good to go.\n\nsolimo was a pain in the ass to use on my legs and arms, even when layered over lotion-ed skin. probably because the emollient ingredients got absorbed first and the waxy/occlusive ingredients needed a little more work to spread. i think it has it's place though. it worked well on my elbows, knees, upper arms, the dry patches i mentioned, etc.\n\njoy worked really nicely after a shave. spreads easily on my arms and legs. not as labour intensive as solimo lol. and it leaves my skin really soft\n\nas many people as it excludes with the way it smells, it's a pretty decent product and i was pleasantly surprised (that being said maybe dont do what i did and buy the smaller tub first) at how well it performed. it's inexpensive too for how much you get.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8fjzd6vz91j71.jpg?width=1707&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fcbf0cb911d0dad49b2facb2e1adabe38cb77cc\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[texture shot. the product is spread out on the lower half of my fist.](https://preview.redd.it/hdj7yv2fa1j71.jpg?width=1707&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5dc0b23924de1b763c3cb2b9c0b77f381ae1151)\n\n**status** : it'll be a while before i think of repurchasing it but i actually think i might...\n\nWRP (think i'll try out their other cream too)",

    "body": "Hi, \n\nI'm trying to create a 1% Metformin Gel, that has been used successfully to treat and regenerate periodontal tissue in people with periodontitis. If we go to a dentist or periodontist the only options they usually give you are invasive treatments that involve taking a piece of tissue from the roof of your mouth. But In the last 8 years or so it's been shown that Metformin Gel can actually regenerate lost bone and periodontal tissue when applied topically, without any need for invasive surgeries. A few examples:\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22509750/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22509750/)\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29981205/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29981205/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Metformin Gel can be produced quite easily from a pharmacy but the dentist has to order it. My dentist won't even read the medical literature describing the success rate of these treatments, so I'm going to reproduce this gel as close as possible because the items used are pretty safe.\n\nI have a couple of questions I need some help with if anyone has time to look at them:\n\n* **1** \\- This table shows the protocol used to create the metformin gel. From what I understand this is for a 5% metformin gel, and if I wanted to create a 1% metformin gel I would just decrease the amount of metformin and adjust the amount of water. Is this correct?[https://www.asiapharmaceutics.info/index.php/ajp/article/view/207/280](https://www.asiapharmaceutics.info/index.php/ajp/article/view/207/280)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8pgmxs3vp3g61.jpg?width=1601&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d25b64a69af03775a04a20ae745133c618c0b77\n\n* **2 -** The second question is about Citric acid, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, and Sodium citrate. I think I won't use them because they are ingredients that could actually be unsafe if used in the wrong dosages. I don't intend to store the gel for more than a few days so if these items are mainly to be used as conservatives, or taste adjustment, maybe it's not that important. What do you think?\n\nI'm going to weigh all the ingredients correctly and use a magnetic mixer with a hot plate, like it's described in the article. Ok let me know what you think if you have time, thank you",

    "body": "Holy Snails - Double Shark Serum\n\nPart or writing this review meant going back to January 2019 and re-reading my review of a very similar product, from the same brand, and with the same name...well...let me back up LOL!\n\nIf you are not familiar with Holy Snails...you need to be. Check out my previous review about one of their offerings for an in-depth description. But in essence, they are a US based (but K-Beauty inspired) e-retailer out of Alabama.\n\nThe owner/founder (Chel) is herself a K-Beauty blogger and K-Pop nerd. She alongside three other K-Beauty queens host a podcast called The Snailcast. They cover all things Korean/Asian beauty from skincare to makeup...and don’t hold punches when it comes to calling trends/brands out. \n\nI’ve been so informed and guided by their content in the past two years or so of diving into K-Beauty (okay...back to the review at hand). \n\nThe first product from Holy Snails to hit my routine was the Shark Sauce: Sauce Du Mois Hanbang Edition. That product is a spin-off of their original Shark Sauce Serum that features Niacinamide and Sea Kelp Bioferment. \n\nAdding Ginseng Root, Ginger Root, and Goji Berry Root Extracts to the special edition formula created something I absolutely fell in love with. The brightening and hydrating power of the product (even with its slight sticky residue) made me a believer in all things Shark Sauce and Holy Snails.\n\nCut to a year and a half later and I have another spin-off of the original Shark Sauce in my hands. This time...it's the Double Shark.\n\nRather than adding wonderful Hnabang-style ingredients to the original formula, only one thing is changed...double the Niacinamide! Double Shark brings the concentration of Niacinamide to 10% vs 5% found in the original. \n\nNeedless to say, I was curious to see how this product performed against the Hanbang version since that one also contains just 5% Niacinamide.\n\nAside from the formulation...there were some clear differences between the two products. I found Double Shark to be a little more fluid/watery. Also, while the Hanbang Shark had a slightly sweet/honey scent...Double Shark has no real scent that I noticed. \n\nBut, the biggest initial difference was in feel and application. My one complaint with Hanbang Shark was the slightly sticky/tacky residue left behind after applying the product. My workaround for this was mixing it into my moisturizer (which worked nicely and resolved the issue).\n\nBut, Double Shark...she (or he, or neither/both) does not play like that. I LOVED the way this serum absorbed into my skin without any trace of sticky-ness. I found myself applying a couple of thin layers to amp up the benefits. It also worked fine mixed in with my moisturizer. \n\nThe consistency and result after application made Double Shark a bit more versatile and approachable when compared to Hanbang Shark.\n\nOutside of that...I found both products to perform similarly. Both offer a great amount of brightening, skin tone balancing, and hydrating power. It’s been over a year since I used the Hanbang Shark but my review of the two products would read pretty much the same.\n\nIn practice, I don’t think I noticed anything major that the Hanbang-style ingredients did that Double Shark missed. Nor did I notice the increase of Niacinamide having a major difference on my skin as compared to the 5% in the Hanbang Shark or original Shark Sauce. \n\nAll in all..it was pretty much a tie for me. If I was particularly mad at the sticky residue of the Hanbang Shark (which I wasn’t) I’d go for the Double Shark. If I really missed that sweet/honey scent of the Hanbang Shark...that’s where I would land. \n\nEither way, the Shark Sauce line from Holy Snails seems to be a knockout product no matter which iteration you select.\n\nI look forward to exploring the other Sauce Du Mois options to see what ingredients take Shark Sauce to the next level. It’s nice to know that regardless...each bottle will help to brighten, hydrate, and bring that K-Beauty glow to my skin that I have come to love.\n\nFull Ingredients List: Distilled Water, Lactobacillus/Nereocystis Luetkeana Ferment Filtrate (Sea Kelp Bioferment), Niacinamide, Licorice Root Extract, N-Acetylglucosamine, Sodium Lactate, Panthenol, Hyaluronic Acid, Green Tea Extract, Propylene Glycol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA\n\nWhere To Buy (Holy Snails $34.00 USD): [https://www.holysnails.com/products/double-shark](https://www.holysnails.com/products/double-shark) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nilnzfhjbeh51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3af6c1fe6f47dd3c6144cc033a97b775897dcd29",

I love using this as a pre-poo because I love the minty-tingly feeling. It's a very conditioning product imo but the surfactants help rinse it out easy. In my dupe I wanted to make this a little more conditioning with BTMS-50 instead of their weird cetearyl alcohol and SLS emulsifier. Instead of SLS, I opted for SCI and CMPB to make this product lather and rinse out easier. I also added some centramonium chloride which the original product used to contain (it no longer does) to add to the conditioning feeling. The bulk of my version is cetyl alcohol because the OG product is very slippy and when I rinse it out it can easily detangle the length of my hair. \n\nThe original ingredients: Fresh Mint Infusion (Mentha Piperita) (Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract) , Water (Aqua) , Cetearyl Alcohol and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate , Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate , Citric Acid , Propylene Glycol , Honey , Peppermint Oil (Mentha piperita) , Sweet Orange Oil (Citrus sinensis) , Spearmint Oil (Mentha spicata) , Grapefruit Oil (Citrus paradisi) , Nettle Absolute (Urtica urens) , Neroli Oil (Citrus Aurantium amara) , Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Olea europaea) , *Limonene , *Linalool , *Citral , Fragrance , Methylparaben , Propylparaben .\n\nMy version: \n\nSURFACTANT PHASE | PHASE A \n\nSCI 10%\n\nCMPB 7% \n\nCentramonium chloride 4%\n\nWATER PHASE| PHSSE B \n\n Distilled Water 57.5%\n\nHoneyquat 3%\n\nOIL PHASE| PHASE C\n\nCetyl alcohol 6%\n\nBTMS 50 4%\n\nOlive Oil 4%\n\nMenthol crystals 2%\n\nCOOLDOWN PHASE | PHASE D \n\nPeppermint EO 1%\n\nSpearmint EO 1%\n\nLiquid Germall Plus 0.5%\n\nHeated phase A, B, and C in a water bath until everything was heated thoroughly then added the water phase to the oil phase, blended for about 30 seconds and added in my surfactant phase. It'll be quite runny until it cools. Add your Cooldown phase and it's pretty much ready to use. \n\nI apply this to my scalp 15 minutes before washing. When I get into the shower to rinse it, my scalp feels very moisturized. It still lathers a tiny bit upon rinsing it out, but I feel like my version is a bit more slippy than the original which I love. I would appreciate any thoughts and feedback! \n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/TcKHhkE",

        "body": "If it does stay emulsified, I'd be concerned that some of your ingredients are not what they should be, or the surfactants didn't end up in the final product at all. Or, because I've been wrong before and I'm feeling cynical today, you are a master chemist here to troll or pwn or flex or dab or whatever and yes I'm an old and should go shout at the clouds.\n\nTrying to be funny so that I don't sound like a total killjoy. I'm not trying to be a jerk, but your formula doesn't make sense to me.\n\nYou put an anionic surfactant in a cationic emulsion. In my experience, that's going to become gritty and chunky and separate. If it is in that tub, do poke through to the bottom to make sure that it hasn't separated before using it each time.\n\nSCI is chemically incompatible with BTMS and CETAC. SCI can be used at about that concentration with a true non-ionic surfactant based emulsifying wax to make a cream product, but when I've done it the result has been very thick and not pleasant for using on hair. (Yes, I know that people use BTMS with SCI in shampoo bars, but it isn't an aqueous solution or emulsion so the incompatible charges aren't an issue.)\n\n10% SCI won't stay fluid for long in any case. 7% CAPB isn't typically enough to keep it as a paste, not for me anyway, and it won't keep it suspended in an emulsion. It'll crystalize and fall out like the uncooperative spiteful princess of an ingredient that it is.\n\nI have mixed CETAC into CAPB as part of a liquid shampoo, because I wanted to see this unusual chemistry quirk for myself. It is noted in a patent for a shampoo. It can, but there's no real point to it. Now we have cationic polymers that are designed to work in anionic surfactant products.\n\nIf you remove the SCI and CAPB, you've got a conditioner. If you want to leave it on your head for any period of time, you should reduce or probably leave the CETAC out of future versions. It's much weaker than BTMS and you probably wouldn't notice the difference.\n\nThe original has less than 1% olive oil. It can go rancid quickly and doesn't add anything beyond being oily. Coconut oil would be better, as it has a much longer life and might have real benefits to hair. Babassu oil would be even better because it has the good characteristics of coconut oil while being silkier.\n\nAlso, that's rather a lot of essential oils and menthol. Twice as much as I would consider a safe maximum. It doesn't have to burn to work, I promise.\n\nIf you want to make a close dupe, use anionic surfactants. Cetearyl Alcohol and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is an anionic emulsfying wax (trade names include Crodex A and Lanette W). They add some Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, probably for rinsibility. At best this product has a pH of 6.5, but possibly up to 8. If I were going to attempt this I would use glyceryl stearate SE and DLS.\n\nIf it ever contained CETAC, it was more than 5 years ago from what I could find in old ingredients lists for Lush Roots. But without a zwitterion like CAPB to do the magic, it could never have contained it in any useful amount. CAPB by itself is likely to destabilize an anionic emulsion, but CETAC would make one fail.\n\nA way to make a less close but more similar than a conditioner dupe, and the one I would suggest, would be to use a non-ionic emulsifying wax. A lotion with 5% emulsifying wax (either polysorbate 60 or ceteareth 20, the latter being more silky), a cationic polymer, and no more than 10% oils & oil soluble ingredients, makes for a surprisingly good pre-wash conditioner.",

    "body": "Hello, new to this community. I recently messed up my skin barrier and was developing some fungal acne. My skin had lots of redness, itching, rough bumpy texture, and a dry yet oily/waxy feeling. These products helped me out a bit. I searched the ingredients through sezia and found 2 of the products where completely safe. The rest contained 1 “possible” trigger. Posted this here in case someone was looking for other options/safe products. Of course, skincare is individual, and not one size fits all. But, hopefully this helps someone. \n\n1. Briotech Topical skin spray (100% safe)- $14. It’s a hypochlorous acid spray. Hypochlorous acid is electrolyzed water. It smells slightly of chlorine while wet/liquid, once dry it turns to salt water. Non-toxic, or irritating. It’s what’s added to tap water to make sure it’s safe for drinking. It’s a good disinfectant on surfaces. As well as being skin safe and eye safe. It’s prescribed to treat certain eye conditions such as pink eye, helps heal styes, and eliminate eyelash mites. It’s also great for eczema and psoriasis prone skin, because it helps kill irritating skin mites. Helps promote wound healing etc...All in all a great gentle product for helping keep bacteria at bay on the skin, without further compromising your skins moisture barrier. I like to mist it on my face throughout the day, and on my face mask to kill bacteria. Doesn’t sting or burn. \n\n2. Prosacea rosacea gel-$10 (100% safe). Ingredients: 10% sulfur, Acrylates, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Diazolidinyl Urea, Lactose, Methylparaben, Propylene Glycol, Propylparaben, Tetrasodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, Water. *Nice sulfur option in a gentle base. \n\n3. La roche posay effaclar gel cleanser $14- it’s a zinc pca based face wash that’s a less drying alternative to zinc shampoos and nizoral. Formulated with a 5.5 ph for the face. Sezia flagged 1 ingredient for being a possible trigger, while folliculitisscout said it was safe. I’ve always had luck with this wash helping my skin recover from fungal acne. They flagged the peg-120 which is a surfactant and emulsifier. *Ingredients: AQUA / WATER / EAU, SODIUM LAURETH SULFATE, PEG-8, COCO-BETAINE, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, SODIUM CHLORIDE, PEG-120 METHYL GLUCOSE DIOLEATE, ZINC PCA, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, CITRIC ACID, SODIUM BENZOATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, PARFUM / FRAGRANCE\n\n4. Zapzyt acne wash $5- 2% salicylic acid cleanser. This feels so gentle and soothing compared to other acne cleansers. *Ingredients: Purified Water, Disodium EDTA, Chamomile Extract, Aloe Vera Gel, Bioterge AS-40, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glucamate DOE-120, Glydate, Sodium Chloride. Folliculitisscout says it’s safe, while sezia flagged 1 ingredient: glutamate doe-120, which is a plant derived thickener, and helps reduce irritation from certain surfactants. \n\n5. Clinique dramatically different moisturizing gel- lightweight moisturizer, more hydrating than sebamed gel. I like to add some squalane when I need a bit more moisture. The glycerin was flagged.*Ingredients: Water, Dimethicone, Isododecane, Butylene Glycol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Glycerin, Laminaria Saccharina Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Saccharomyces Lysate Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Hordeum Vulgare (Barley) Extract/Extrait D'Orge, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seedcake, Caffeine, Trehalose, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria), Polysilicone-11, Silica, Propylene Glycol Dicaprate, Oleth-10, Lactobacillus Ferment, Laureth-23, Laureth-4, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Carbomer, Caprylyl Glycol, Hexylene Glycol, Tromethamine, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Yellow 5 (Ci 19140), Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 6 (Ci 15985) Lotion.",

    "body": "I know a lot of you have brought this up in the past as a concern regarding \"sketchy\" brand owners not disclosing their ingredients listings on their labels in a manner that some people find concerning.  As you should.  You should always ALWAYS be able to trust brand owners, or you shouldn't buy from them.  Absolutely. \n\nI would like to touch on this a bit more.\n\n[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1wq66s/how_do_you_know_products_are_safe_when_ordering) is a post where concerns were brought up regarding not putting EXACT ingredients into our ingredients labels making us bad and sketchy brand owners.  Using the phrase \"May Contain\" is NOT a cop out...and as a consumer of products in general, not just indie products...is something that you are going to have to get used to seeing from us more and more.\n\nLet me give you a few examples.  Someone using the niche of natural ingredients to sell their product (which is something I do), is perfectly acceptable, and very favored among many consumers.  However...Listing say... \"Organic apple juice, aloe vera gel, vitamin c, etc\" LEGALLY should look like this: Pyrus Malus, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Ascorbic acid.  It doesn't look as fun and natural anymore does it?  But, by law..if you want to be taken seriously as the great brand owner you should be by the FDA and other scary monsters...that is how you LEGALLY need to list your wonderful natural ingredients.\n\nNow...as for eyeshadows.  And I know a few of you feel that if they are not listed EXACT what you put in them...they are a sketchy brand owner.\n\nI want to list a few major brand examples to you all, just for reference purposes.\n\n**Urban Decay Primer Potion:**\n\nIngredients\nORIGINAL / SIN:\nIsododecane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Polyethylene, Trihydroxystearin, Triethylhexanoin, Isopropyl Lanolate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Dimethicone, PEG-40 Stearate, Propylene Carbonate, Phenoxyethanol, Synthetic Beeswax, Propylparaben, Methylparaben, Butylparaben, Ethylparaben, Isobutylparaben.\nMay Contain:\nMica, CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide), CI 77491/ CI 77499 (Iron Oxides), CI 77163 (Bismuth Oxychloride).\n\nEDEN:\nIsododecane,Cyclopentasiloxane,Trimethylsiloxysilicate,Disteardimonium Hectorite,Polyethylene,Triethylhexanoin,Trihydroxystearin,Isopropyl Lanolate,Sorbitan Sesquioleate,VP/Eicosene Copolymer,Talc, Dimethicone,PEG-40 Stearate,Phenoxyethanol,Synthetic Beeswax,Propylene Carbonate.\n\nGREED:\nIsododecane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Polyethylene, Trihydroxystearin, Triethylhexanoin, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Isopropyl Lanolate, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Dimethicone, PEG-40 Stearate, Phenoxyethanol, Propylene Carbonate, Synthetic Beeswax. May contain: Mica, CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide), CI 77491/77499 (Iron Oxides).\n**May Contain:**\nCI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide), CI 77491/77492/77499 (Iron Oxides). \n\nThe list goes on and on and on with MAC, however...\n\nMAC Bronzing Powder:\nTalc, Nylon-12, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Octyldoecyl Stearoyl Stearate, Isostearyl Neopentanoate, Zinc Stearate, Hordeum Vulgare (Barley) Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Squalane, Magnesium Myristrate, Mathylparaben, Propylparaben\n\n**Bronzing Powder may contain:**\nMica, Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxides, Bismuth Oxychloride, Carmine, Chromium Hydroxide Green, Ferric Ferrocyanide, Manganese Violet, Ultramarines, Blue 1 Lake, Red 6, Red 7, Yellow 5 Lake\n\n\nI'm not even going to start with the shadows.  So according to the FDA this is how it's legally written...it's not a sketchy business practice...it's actually a RESPONSIBLE business practice.\n\n\nWhen brand owners don't do this you have to assume they know what they're doing...but what if they made a typo?  Or what if they just don't know what they're doing and write it that way?  You have to think about the legality of us keeping our shops open, and trust the good ones know what they are doing.  \n\nPersonally, seeing wax listed as the first ingredient after mica in a list of ingredients for eye shadow is more concerning. I'm not making candles.  The possible pigments contained in a colored mica that was made by someone else as an ingredient, then delivered to me deserves a \"May contain\" section on my label.\n\nI'm not writing this to be mean or rude...I just want you all to be more aware of the changing world and rules that go along with that.  Just because we're indie, doesn't mean we are above, or omitted from the same rules and regulations as big brands.  If anything people who follow the letter should be commended that it CAN be done, and held to a higher standard. \n",

        "body": "This is a really interesting post, thanks for writing it! I have a few random thoughts...\n\n* Incomplete, inaccurate, or completely missing ingredients listings scare the crap out of me. For one, I have bad allergies, and it's critically important for me to know what's in the products I'm using. For another, US brands that don't list ingredients show a lack of respect not only for their customers but also for US law, which requires full ingredients listings for every product. Alternatively, it may show a terrifying lack of research on the part of the brand owner - if they don't know they are legally required to list ingredients, what other important, widely available information have they also missed?\n\n* I've read an explanation of the \"May contain...\" lists and I'm curious to know everyone's thoughts on this. I've read that batches don't always come out exactly alike, so the \"May contain\" list usually has ingredients that might be added at the end of batch creation to tweak it to meet the overall standard for the product. For example, if one particular batch came out a little less red than usual, they have the option of adding carmine or another red pigment, but they won't necessarily do that for every single batch so the ingredient isn't necessarily present in every single batch. Has anyone else heard this? Does anyone know if it's a myth or an actual explanation? \n\nAnd you're absolutely right - we should definitely commend the brands who do this well, because it's super important! I'm not always good at only buying from brands that follow the law in disclosing their ingredients, but I really want to resolve to do so from now on.",

I think my skin may be dehydrated, but I'm not totally sure. \n\nI am 24f, and in winter my skin seems very dry (dry climate), while in summer I *think* have an oily t-zone, but not sure if this is due to actual oiliness or overproduction of oil to compensate because my skin is actually dehydrated.\n\n**Issues I have with my skin:** I seem to have either a lot of blackheads or sebacious filaments on my nose and upper cheeks - the pores look big and clogged and I don't like them!

I did not realise until yesterday this was also a cleanser - I am ditching the gel and trying just this as a cleanser, as it's very creamy and feels hydrating and not tight (it's more of a cream not really a liquid toner), but I still need a more wallet-friendly replacement. \n\n**Exfoliation:** Only twice a week, and I think it's largely a physical exfoliant. I don't have a link but it's RVB One Care Face Regenerating Scrub. Ingredients: Aqua, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetarpyl Ethylehexanoate, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Propylene Glycol, Oryza Sativa (Rice) hull powder, fetyl alcohol, microcrystalline wax, polysorbate 60, potassium ceryl phosphate, hydeogenated jojoba oil, triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, Carbomber, Disodium EDTA, acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl acrylate crossplymer, methylparaben, BHA, parfum, ethylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben, isobutylparaben.\n\n**Moisturiser:** **[Ahava Time to Hydrate Essential Day Moisturiser normal to dry skin](http://www.ahava.com/face/time-to-hydrate/essential-day-moisturizer-normal-to-dry)**. I really like this, but it has no suncreen in it and is expensive. \n\n***What I'd like to try instead:***\n\nI narrowed down 2 brands I'd like to try after studying this sub's info last night, and then the lady at the pharmacy insisted this other brand was much better, so I have a choice of 3. Which do you think would be best? Should I use a combination of things from different brands? I am a total noob, so everything I picked here was based on what I took from the beginner's routine. I was looking for: a lack of SLS/SLES in my **cleansers** and for them to be gentle and hydrating; probably Salicylic acid in my **exfoliation** (chemical for daily use); mainly hyaluronic acid, petrolatum, dimethicone, glycerol and glycol in my **moisturiser**.\n\n***Brand 1 - Eucerin [(pics of the products I chose)](http://i.imgur.com/xe7RkpK.jpg):***\n\n**Cleanser:** **[Eucerin DermatoCLEAN Mild Cleansing Milk.](http://www.eucerin.com/product-finder/cleansing/1/\n)** I wanted a very gentle cleanser and I wanted to avoid SLS/SLES due to the drying properties - will the Sodium Cetaeryl Sulfate in it be a problem? Could it dry my skin? Would the **Eucerin DermatoCLEAN 3 in 1 Micellar Cleansing Fluid** be a better choice?\n\n**Exoliation:** **[Eucerin DermoPURIFYER Scrub.](http://www.eucerin.com/dermopurifyer/eucerinR-dermopurifyer/scrub/)** This is an AHA. I do not (as far as I know) have eczema/rosacea, so I am leaning more towards salicylic acid, but this was the only Eucerin exfoliation I could find in the store. Could I use a different brand for exfoliation even if I used Eucerin cleanser and moisturiser?\n\n**Moisturiser:** **[Eucerin Hyaluron-Filler Day Cream.](http://www.eucerin.com/product-finder/anti-age/1/)** This has an SPF of 15 and UVA protection. I like that it had hyaluronic acid and dimethicone. Do I need a night cream? If so, I would just use this day cream's night equivalent. \n\n***Brand 2 - Neutrogena [(pics of the products I chose)](http://i.imgur.com/F2pcsUP.jpg):***\n\n**Cleanser:** **[Neutrogena Visibly Clear Foaming Cleanser.](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/visibly+even-+foaming+cleanser.do?sortby=ourPicks)** I liked this one because it does not have SLS/SLES (I think?). \n\n**Exfoliation:** **[Neutrogena Deep Clean Long-Last Shine Control Daily Scrub.](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/deep+clean+long-last+shine+control+daily+scrub.do?sortby=ourPicks)** I went for this because it didn't seem to have physical beads in it and it has Salicylic Acid, plus the words \"daily\" - is this a chemical-only exfoliator that is ok to use every day? I picked this over the Pink Grapefruit one because this one does not have SLS (but it does have Sodium Benzotriazolyl Butylphenol **Sulfonate**, is that still a drying sulfate SLS/SLES type thing?).\n\n**Moisturiser:** **[Neutrogena Visibly Even Daily Moisturiser 30 SPF.](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/visibly+even-+daily+moisturizer+broad+spectrum+spf+30.do?sortby=ourPicks)** I liked this one because it has a higher SPF, but it does not say UVA protection - does that mean that is missing? This does not have hyaluronic acid, but dimethicone is higher up on the ingredients list - does that mean there is more of it? [Here is the night cream - **Neutrogena Light Night Cream**](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/light+night+cream.do?sortby=ourPicks) - this looked interesting because it has Petrolatum, which the Eucerin night cream did not (although the Eucerin one has hyaluronic acid): which is more important/a better bet? (Both have Dimethicone.) I read somewhere on here that humectant moisturisers can sometimes suck water out of your skin in a very dry climate, which I am in in winter, but maybe it would be ok for summer? Perhaps Eucerin is my summer cream and Neutrogena my winter one? Is that a thing?\n\n***Brand 3 - BioNike [(pics of the products the pharmacy lady suggested)](http://i.imgur.com/U0FmDUg.jpg):***\n\nI am very sceptical about this brand purely because of the hard-sell the pharmacy lady tried to give me. She also went on about the presence of nickel in all other products and how bad it supposedly is. I have never heard anything about that and haven't come across it on this sub yet (I am new, but I did do a search). I'm not alergic to nickel, so what gives? Is the presence of nickel an actual issue? I didn't see \"nickel\" listed in any of them. Are these products below worth using? I mentioned that I liked the hyaluronic acid in the Eucerin and she said \"hm, yeah, in training they mentioned *something* about hydra.. hyra.. hyaluronic acid...\" which did not inspire much confidence from me. Anyway, the products:\n\n**Cleanser:** **[BioNike Defence Gentle Milk Cleanser.](http://www.bionike.it/defence/face/cleansers/111021_en_0_1_114.html#dettinci)** I don't know much about these ingredients, but I was happy with the lack of SLS.\n\n**Exfoliation:** **[BioNike Defence Micro-Exfoliating Scrub.](http://www.bionike.it/defence/face/cleansers/11166_en_0_1_126.html#dettinci)** I don't know if this is an AHA or a BHA - I don't see Lactic or Salicylic acid - could anyone clarify what this would be good for?\n\n**Moisturiser:** **[BioNike Defence Hydra5 Radiance.](http://www.bionike.it/defence/face/hydration/protection/11147_en_0_1_563.html#dettinci)** SPF 15 and UVA protection. Has hyaluronic acid but doesn't seem to have dimethicone. What do you think?\n\n**Any help anyone can give would be greatly appreciated, thanks for reading! :)**",

        "body": "WOW! This is a great post. Thank you for taking the time to make it!\n\nFirst off the BioNike Defence Micro-Exfoliating Scrub is not a chemical exfoliator. Meaning, it is neither an AHA or a BHA. It's a physical exfoliant. I personally use physical exfoliators maybe once a week while I use chemical exfoliators every day. I would suggest only using a physical exfoliator once a week MAX.\n\nSecondly, nickel is not usually found in skincare products so your gut feelings about the pharmacy lady being a hard-sell and not very knowledgeable is correct. I've seen copper (for cellulite) and I've seen silver (antimicrobial) but never nickel. Doesn't mean that it doesn't exist but I've worked with a lot of creams and due to the large amount of people with nickel allergies nickel isn't even on our radar. \n\nThirdly, both the Eucerin and Neutrogena brands are recommended by dermatologists but that doesn't mean they are the best for your face. One of our mods posted a pH list of lotions a long time ago and one of the Eucerin lotions was quite high. Urea is a great keratolytic emollient but not so great for the face. All of the products you took a picture of are fine for facial use but you have to be careful!\n\nOK - so enough with the lecturing - **let's git it on!**:\n\nYour face looks like a pretty dehydrated face. Meaning - you are stripping the natural oils from your face. Large pore size is normally associated with oilier faces and the fact that you have so much dry skin would seem counter-intuitive but it's not after reading your current skincare program. I think you would be a perfect candidate for the Oil Cleansing Method (or OCM as we call it here) followed by a wash with a light cleanser. I actually think you would do great with a plain mineral oil wash (meaning you slightly wet your face and then take mineral oil and rub it all around your face for about 2-3 mins) with a follow-up cleanser. If you like Neutrogena they make a cleanser called [Ultra Gentle Daily Cleanser](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/ultra+gentle+daily+cleanser.do) which is on-par with our suggestions in the side-bar. THAT'S IT for cleansing. Since you don't seem to get a lot of acne I would actually suggest you follow-up with an AHA chemical exfoliator over a BHA. Meaning lactic acid or glycolic acid would be a better fit over salicylic acid. Both the Amazon US and UK sites ship to South Africa so I would suggest ordering the [St. Ives Exfoliating Pads](http://www.amazon.com/St-Ives-Exfoliating-Pads-Count/dp/B006TUS9LC) as a daily exfoliator. \n\nIn terms of night lotion, look for things with ceramides or hyaluronic acid but don't slather SPF on your face. You really want a rich lotion at night. \n\nLotions with SPF are total crap in terms of the SPF they allocate and we recommend that you use a separate sunscreen. To get the full effects you need to apply two milligrams of sunscreen per square centimeter of skin which works out to 30mL of lotion. That's a lot! Putting 30mL of lotion on your face would make it weird and oily. You're better off putting a separate sunscreen on and then your lotion. I personally started using Argan Oil as my lotion and haven't been happier.\n\nI hope this answered most of your questions. \n\nTL;DR: Physical exfoliation should be AT MOST once a week. Chemical exfoliation daily. Lots of oils and rich lotions. Gentle cleanser. Separate sunscreen.",

I dont think I need to introduce what a hair gloss is or anyone in this sub so i'll go straight to the point. \n\nI am using a semi-permanent hair colour (no ammonia or peroxide) and this particular one gives me INSANE amount of glossiness that lasts ~3 washes. \n\nThis is the hair colour: https://www.livecolour.com/our-products/ultra-brights-or-pastel/095-electric-blue\n\nand the ingredients:\n\n Aqua · Cetearyl Alcohol · Coconut Alcohol · Ceteareth-20 · Disodium Cocoamphodipropionate · Methylparaben · HC Blue No. 16 · Parfum · Polyquaternium-6 · Propylparaben · Ethanolamine · Etidronic Acid · Basic Red 51\n\nThe list seems pretty simple to me but I am shit with non-skincare cosmetic ingredients and didnt find anything that would be at least somewhat conclusive.

    "body": "I’m going to be honest; I never quite used sunscreen on my lips until a month ago. At the beginning of last year, I learned to religiously apply sunscreen in the morning and reapply after two hours in the sun. I gently smoothed it over my face, and rubbed it on my arms, legs, and the back of my hands. I was the subject of judgmental stares during swim season as I would be the only dude who applied sunscreen on his whole body, rather than just his face and shoulders. I made sure every part of my body that would see UV light was coated in a liberal layer of protection. Every part except my lips.\n\nGranted, my lips were always on the dry side, so I applied some SPF 15 Chapstick every now and then. But it was not broad spectrum. \n\nDo not neglect your lips! Skin cancer on the lips is not impossible (http://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/lip-cancer-not-uncommon). Furthermore, UV rays will certainly thin the skin on the lips and accelerate aging. And, worst of all, while 94% of 299 beachgoers were cognizant of the risks of UV damage, only 69% demonstrated an awareness of the risk of lip cancer.\n\nThe best part about protecting lips is that it’s so fast, easy, and cheap. A few glides of a $3 balm, a quick smushing of the lips, and they’re protected. However, *reapplication should be much more frequent*, because the sunscreen can be rubbed off when eating and drinking.  \n\nHere are some recommendations to get started. These are some of my favorites, but there are certainly many more options:\n\n* **Banana Boat Sport SPF 50 Sunscreen Lip Balm** [I recommend buying from Target for ~$3 a stick]: It has a pretty standard, Chapstick-esque texture, but I find it’s more moisturizing. The lip balm’s also water-resistant for 80 minutes, which is pretty freaking awesome. Broad-spectrum protection is assured from avobenzone stabilized with octocrylene. There’s also the added benefit of the antioxidants vitamins E, C, and A (in the forms of tocopherol acetate, ascorbic acid, and retinyl palmitate). It’s entirely fragrance free, and it’s slightly sweetened for all you compulsive lip-lickers (though one probably shouldn’t bite chunks off the balm!) \n\n\t*Ingredients*: Active: Avobenzone (2%), Octocrylene (10%), Oxybenzone (6%), Other: Petrolatum, Polyethylene, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Trimethylsiloxyphenyl Dimethicone, Microcrystalline Wax, Isopropyl Myristate, Cocoa Seed Butter, PEG-8, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ascorbic Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Silica, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Saccharin, Propylparaben, Butylparaben\n\n* **NIVEA a Kiss of Smoothness Hydrating Lip Care SPF 15** [I recommend buying from Target for $2.99 a stick]: This is much more emollient than Banana Boat’s balm, and definitely feels very rich on the lips. UVA protection is assured from avobenzone stabilized with octocrylene. Antioxidant properties make only a small presence from a sprinkling of shea butter in the formula. The product is ever so lightly fragranced.\n\n\t*Ingredients*: Active: Avobenzone (2.5%), Octinoxate (6.0%), Octocrylene (1.8%) Inactive: Octyldodecanol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Microcrystalline Wax, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Cetyl Palmitate, Myristyl Myristate, Polyglyceryl-3 Dilsostearate, Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Simmondsia Chinenesis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, C20-40 Alkyl Stearate, Beeswax, Fragrance.\n\n* **Shiseido Sun Protection Lip Treatment SPF 35** [$22.00 from Shiseido.com; uncertain how expensive it is at the department store]: $22 is definitely a major splurge for a lip product, especially when other great lip balms are much cheaper, but if one wishes to splurge, this is a good option! This features a combination of octinoxate and titanium dioxide for broad-spectrum protection. It provides a moderate amount of hydration, and leaves a faint (and I do mean faint, but definitely noticeable upon closer inspection) white cast, which can be a good and a bad thing. For those who wish to lighten and brighten their lips a little, this is a quick way to do it while getting sun protection. IMO, it looks particularly good on Asians (which is probably why Shiseido, a Japanese brand, created this!) However, if applied on chapped lips, minerals can collect in flaky parts and create white splotches. I recommend using a lip scrub and applying a thin layer of an emollient lip balm underneath if this is a problem. This product is moderately fragranced with the same scent Shiseido uses in their other sunscreens. This used to be labeled as SPF 36 and PA++, but I'm quite certain the formula didn't change.\n\n\t*Ingredients*: Active: Octinoxate (7.4%), Titanium Dioxide (5%), Other: Trioctanoin, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Triisostearin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Polyethylene, PEG/PPG-36/41 Dimethyl Ether, Microcrystalline Wax, Stearyl Glycyrrhetinate, Glutathione, Zinc Myristate, Thiotaurine, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Diisostearyl Malate, Sodium Magnesium Silicate, Glycerin, BHT, Fragrance\n\n\nAs a final note, I've used lip balms with SPF as a sunscreen stick for other parts of my body (like the back of my hands) in a pinch. It works pretty well, but it feels pretty gross cause it's been all over the mouth haha.\n\n**Good luck and godspeed with all sunscreen-related endeavors!**\n",

I use three pumps (2 on the face, 1 on the neck) AM and PM. As its consistency is more lotion and watery-like than that of a heavy cream, the bottle is tiny at 88 mL and runs out quickly. I've used up 2 bottles of this in 4-5 months or so (so a bottle per 2 months, and its pricey at that too!). It doesn't break me out, applies like silk and actually gives me lasting moisture. I think it's more because of its hydroxy urea moreso than the HA, tbh, because my Hada Labo premium outperforms TO's HA serum also; and it contains the same urea ingredient. BUT due to the price, I'm not sure if I will buy again... in the event no other moisturizers in the future work as well though then I will resort to this lol\n\nRating: 9/10 (-1 Price)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2) The Ordinary - Natural Moisturizing Factors w/ Hyaluronic Acid**\n\nIngredients: Aqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Stearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Arginine, Aspartic Acid, Glycine, Alanine, Serine, Valine, Isoleucine, Proline, Threonine, Histidine, Phenylalanine, Glucose, Maltose, Fructose, Trehalose, Sodium PCA, PCA, Sodium Lactate, Urea, Allantoin, Linoleic Acid, Oleic Acid, Phytosteryl Canola Glycerides, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Lecithin, Triolein, Tocopherol, Carbomer, Isoceteth-20, Polysorbate 60, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Pentylene Glycol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.\n\nI really wanted to love this, I really do, because I've been attempting to put out an all-DECIEM based routine to save up on my budget and support a Canadian company at the same time. But this moisturizer, given its universal praise isn't cutting it! Lack of silicones in it usually end up with me contracting eczema at the end of the day. Also, heads up - I can't tolerate oils at all because I'm prone to sebborhea, eczema AND acne (I can only use jojoba oil and squalane) - so I really feel the oiliness of this product, despite being oil-free. I think it's because of the oleic and linoleic acids in the product which is basically what oils are comprised of.  To add, it feels tacky on my skin, and the packaging format isn't too nice as i have to squeeze hard for the product to come out. The price is great though, so I didn't waste my money on it. I don't think it breaks me out particularly so I'll still try to use up the entire 100mL of it :p\n\nRating: 7/10 (-1 tacky feeling, -1 oily feeling, -1 no silicones)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3) CeraVe AM Lotion w/ SPF30**\n\nMed. Ingredients: Homosalate 10.00%, Menthyl Anthranilate (Meradimate) 5.00%, Octinoxate (Ethylhexyl, Methoxycinnamate) 5.00%, Octocrylene 2.00%, Zinc Oxide 6.3%.Other Ingredients: Water, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Behentrimonium Methosulphate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Ceramide AP , Ceramide NP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Disodium EDTA, Glycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Methylparaben, Niacinamide, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Xanthan Gum\n\nOkay this sucks big time. It clogged ALL my pores, literally and I had to take a week course doxycycline to clear it up a bit. It also left my face a greasy mess. But it does moisturize well so I'm planning on using it up on my neck and hands, lol 😂 Also, there was a very informed post of ceramides in CeraVe not really doing anything so there's that too. Will definitely NOT be buying again.\n\nRating: 4/10 (-5 100% pore-clogging, -1 greasy face)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4) CeraVe PM Lotion**\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Ceramide NP, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Disodium EDTA, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n\nThis one sucks too, but it doesn't clog my pores as much as the AM variant. I've been using this on and off because I just hate the greasy feeling it leaves my skin, and I'm not really sure if its the main culprit clogging my pores yet (I just started using it last month on and off). I also kind of itch a bit after using it. It's definitely not a silky smooth application feeling as I had when I used the Cetaphil moisturizer. Will not be buying again.\n\nRating: 6/10 (-3 may be pore clogging , -1 greasy face)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo in short, I still did not find my HG Moisturizer, unfortunately. I'll be looking into the following products now:\n\n**5) Eucerin Replenishing Face Cream w/ 5% Urea** \\- Due to my success with products containing the hydroxy derivative, and its wonderful reviews I'm dying to try this. I just ordered a tube off of [well.ca](https://well.ca), and hope it works out. I'll be using this after I use up the CeraVe PM or discontinue it lol. I have very high expectations of this, and hope this will end my quest to find my perfect moisturizer  😭\n\n**6) CeraVe SPF 30 Ultra Light Moisturizer** \\- Despite my bad track record with CeraVe, I've heard great things about this version of their sunscreen+moisturizer hybrid, and I still am looking for my HG sunscreen.\n\n**7) Hada Labo Perfect Gel** \\- This thing has squalane, hydroxy urea AND HA. Seems too good to be true, but the Premium Lotion already is a HG for my skin. The problem is, it's an Asian product so I need to buy in bulk online for that free shipping or risk getting a counterfeit product off of Amazon (and I don't like buying off of Amazon due to its treatment of its workers anyways).\n\n**8) Neutrogena Extra Dry Hydro Boost Moisturizer** \\- I'm not sure about this one because HA is the 4th last ingredient, and is listed well after the phenoxyethanol (which is 1% I believe) meaning that the HA % of this is less than 1%. Butttt enough ppl are raving about it for me to notice it  😅 so I'll give this a shot if the other ones don't end up being my HG.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd that's that! If anyone has any experiences regarding the products above (especially the ones I want to try in the future) please let me know :)!",

If anything I’m sensitive or allergic to rubs on my skin and I happen to touch it, I’m breaking out in instant hives that last for days. Pure hell. \n\nI’ve been to the doctor and I’m working on repairing the barrier and have been instructed to use unscented lotion multiple times per day (I’ve also been given an RX steroid cream for the hives and it’s working well, and we switched my allergy meds — all good).\n\nI’ve been using Lubriderm Unscented Lotion for Normal to Dry Skin. I used it years ago and remembered it was good. It’s been perfect. \n\nI used up the first bottle and repurchased. I didn’t notice right away, but the second bottle was slightly different and I noticed the consistency was thicker. I was also having skin issues on the first day after I used the new bottle. Well, I compared the ingredients and the new bottle is different, namely the addition of shea butter. I checked Lubriderm’s website, and they’ve updated the formula to include shea butter.\n\nI cannot use shea butter. My skin doesn’t absorb it and it just sits on top and doesn’t allow my skin to breathe, which causes other allergy and medical issues. \n\nI need help finding a lotion that is pretty much the same as the old Lubriderm formula.\n\nHere’s my issue though — I don’t mind lotion, but I am super picky and it cannot leave a greasy feel. Like at all. And it needs to absorb quickly otherwise stuff sticks to my skin and causes the hives. I struggle finding lotions I like, because most lotions for sensitive skin which are fragrance free are too heavy and almost always have shea butter in them. \n\nAny suggestions? \n\nEDIT - adding ingredients for formulas. Didn’t realize I couldn’t post pics here. \n\nOLD / PREFERRED FORMULA: \n\nINGREDIENTS: Water (eau), Mineral Oil (huile minérale), Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Stearic Acid, Cetyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Ceteary!

It ends up in a lot of hair products that sit in a moist environment for long periods. \n\nParabens fall into the class of endocrine disrupters. There are a lot of different Parabens and some seem to impact health more than others. Butylparaben has restricted use in Europe. Endocrine disrupters as a chemical class seem to have a heavy impact that is still being heavily researched. What probably impacts our health the most is that we get exposed to these chemicals in all facets of life. \n\nCosmetic chemists will tell you that they are safe. And probably if you used one product with them and had no other exposure then you most certainly would not detect a health impact. However it is nearly impossible to detect how many endocrine disrupters we are exposed to in a day. \n\nIf you love those products and they are rinse off then maybe you don’t worry as much? All about personal risk assessment \n\nSo.... haha yeah. Hope that was helpful",

Has anyone else notice the change? I know cerave in the tub is more popular here but anyone use the pm moisturizer? Have you noticed a difference? I somewhat noticed it felt a little oily and took just a tiny bit longer to dry, but it dried down matte. Just from what I can see it seems the ingredients are a bit cheaper. Why oh why L'oreal.",

If anything I’m sensitive or allergic to rubs on my skin and I happen to touch it, I’m breaking out in instant hives that last for days. Pure hell. \n\nI’ve been to the doctor and I’m working on repairing the barrier and have been instructed to use unscented lotion multiple times per day (I’ve also been given an RX steroid cream for the hives and it’s working well, and we switched my allergy meds — all good).\n\nI’ve been using Lubriderm Unscented Lotion for Normal to Dry Skin. I used it years ago and remembered it was good. It’s been perfect. \n\nI used up the first bottle and repurchased. I didn’t notice right away, but the second bottle was slightly different and I noticed the consistency was thicker. I was also having skin issues on the first day after I used the new bottle. Well, I compared the ingredients and the new bottle is different, namely the addition of shea butter. I checked Lubriderm’s website, and they’ve updated the formula to include shea butter.\n\nI cannot use shea butter. My skin doesn’t absorb it and it just sits on top and doesn’t allow my skin to breathe, which causes other allergy/skin and medical issues. \n\nI need help finding a lotion that is pretty much the same as the old Lubriderm formula.\n\nHere’s my issue though — I don’t mind lotion, but I am super picky and it cannot leave a greasy feel. Like at all. And it needs to absorb quickly otherwise stuff sticks to my skin and causes the hives. I struggle finding lotions I like, because most lotions for sensitive skin which are fragrance free are too heavy and almost always have shea butter in them. \n\nAny suggestions? I also posted in r/Allergies but I can’t cross post to here so I am double posting. \n\nOLD / PREFERRED FORMULA: \n\nINGREDIENTS: Water (eau), Mineral Oil (huile minérale), Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Stearic Acid, Cetyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Ceteary!

    "body": "Hi there! I've been lurking this sub for a long time and I've never posted. I hope this thread is ok (I did read the FAQ and believe this is more suitable for a thread instead of the simple questions, but mods, please let me know if I am wrong).\n\nWhile researching moisture barrier repair moisturizer recipes, I recently came across this DIY recipe from the all around awesome Alli from stratia skin care (I love how much SCIENCE she puts in her recipes and all the background she gives in her posts for total newbs like me!) https://theacidqueenblog.com/2015/11/03/fun-with-diy-moisture-barrier-serum/. \n\nI am really excited because I know Liquid Gold, which seems to be the successor of this DIY recipe, is super famous over a r/skincareaddiction and has gotten really rave reviews for doing exactly what I need it to do - repair the moisture barrier of my incredibly dry skin. Of course this is for personal use and education! \n\nThe recipe that is on Alli's blog looks fairly advanced but I am up for the challenge and have most of the equipment and even some of the ingredients. I have a couple of questions and I'd love input from this lovely sub. Basically, I'd love to use the original recipe as a base as much as possible but to also add ingredients that aren't in the original recipe but made it in the final formula that I know my skin would like.\n\nHere's the current formula recipe I put in my spreadsheet template with some notes questions I explain below [link to spreadsheet screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/OfcGGxC)\n\n1) I looked over at the liquid gold ingredients and there are a couple of new additions that aren't in the original recipe. These are: Sea buckthorn seed oil (in addition to the seed buckthorn berry oil), rosehip oil (probably replaced the primrose oil), Panthenol, Glycerin and Dimethicone. These are all rockstar ingredients I'd love to add to the modified recipe. Here is what I am thinking and I wonder if you agree\n\na) For the sea buckthorn oil, split the amount in half between the seed and berry oil so that I use 1% each but I am concerned the oil profile for these two are different and may mess with the golden ratio \n\nb) replace primrose with rosehip (especially want to do this since I already have rosehip oil on hand)\n\nc) Reduce distilled water to add panthenol and glycerin. I am thinking 2% each\n\nd) Dimethicone - I have no idea where to add this and what to reduce in the oil phase. I am also not sure how this will affect the emulsifier amount. I might just have to skip it even though I love what dimethicone does to lotions I've used/made.\n\ne) The LG recipe also doesn't use jojoba oil which is in the original recipe and has squalene but I actually have jojoba oil on hand so I'll be using that but let me know if you have any concerns with that plan?\n\nf) The LG recipe also has cranberry seed oil which I'd like to add to my recipe as well - how much would you add and what would you reduce given the golden ratio that seems to make this such a potent and effective recipe?\n\n2) The OG recipe uses N-Acetyl Glucosamine which Alli explains works synergistically with niacinamide to increase cell turnover, fade PIH, and increase epidermal thickness. To my understanding and reading of the LG ingredient list, it doesn't include N-Acetyl Glucosamine. Do you have any guesses as to why and advice on whether to include or omit? \n\n3) Is Optiphen enough to replace the preservatives found in the commercial LG formula (Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA)?\n\n4) The original recipe uses honey, the final LG recipe does not. Honey in other products generally agrees with my skin so I am thinking of leaving it, but what are your thoughts on that? Is it a superstar ingredient to leave in given this has an extensive list of other superstars? It would be nice to omit if you don't think it's a huge deal so I have fewer ingredients to shop for. \n\nWhew, I know this is a lot to ask. Would be grateful for any and all help you can offer!\n\nEDIT: Formatting",

        "body": "This may be late, but I hope it will help since I'm considering trying to make it too.\n\n1) I think she actually replaced the evening primrose oil with the sea buckthorn seed oil l, in fact she mentions in the comment section of the blog that \"I’ve been contemplating replacing the evening primrose oil with sea buckthorn seed oil\". \n--a&b) Rather than split the seabuckthorn seed oil with the sea buckthorn berry oil i would replace half the evening primrose oil with sea buckthorn seed oil and the other half with the rosehip oil. This is because having 1% of each sea buckthorn oil seems kind of small in comparison to the rosehip? Then again from a price point your idea seems better. Rosehip also has a pretty decent level of linoleic acid not as high as evening primrose oil. In fact these oil changes do not seem to be based on acid profiles :/. So you could whatever you want with that?\n\n--c) this sounds like a good idea. The propylene glycol is both a humectant and a solvent (also a mild/somewhat decent penetrattoon enhancer). It's definitely helpful with the niacinamide added. Glycerin is also a humectant and panthenol is a humectant and moisturizer and etc (it's amaziballs). I love having different humectants in things so I don't think anything is wrong. If this causes an issues you can consider lowering the propylene glycol by a percent or two. But by my limited experience this looks okay.\n\nD) dimethicone is great at improving the feel of the lotion so i would love to add that. I would reduce the oil face and add it at like 1% since it's an oil soluble ingredient? Maybe reduce the evening primrose oil. Or you can add it in but then you would have to figure out the emulsifier. It's pretty simple if you've got something like polawx or e-wax but I have no what to do with he one listed. Never used it. Ever. In fact j planned on modifying the recipe to use an emulsifier i am familiar with.\n\nF) i would just stick with the jojoba oil. I wouldn't stress over it if you don't have squalane. Plus remember you are modifying the og recipe. I'd keep many similar things as you can. You can also play around with this and th other oils if you want.\n\n2)i would definitely include n acetyl glucosamine since this is based on the og and it works synergistically with niacinamide. I don't know why this was taken out. You eant to start as close to the og recipe as possible if you aren't familiar and branch your way out. If you don't have n-acetyl glucosamine don't stress. You can actual replace it with panthenol. While they are definitely not the same they can provide similar skin soothing benefits.\n\n3) Otiphen is good enough. Don't stress. I personally plan on using liquid germall plus since that's what I have on hand at .5%. Adding to the water phase.\n\n4) Honey has a tendency to be sticky in high amounts and may cause issues in preservation integrity because of the sugar. She probably didn't see a need for it. I plan on keeping it since it's for home use anyway. I may lower it? Depends.\n\nAs always start with small batches. Leave out the really expensive actives. If any, and add them in your next batch if satisfied. :P \n\nThese are just my very inexperienced suggestions. No idea if this is right. I'm still learning.",

I did a search on ScA and I didn't get any hits so I thought maybe it hasn't been talked about before!\n\nIt's called \"Udderly Smooth Udder Cream.\" It's basically a water-based moisturizer (or occlusive? I don't really know the difference...) I never use it but it's actually quite a nice feeling cream. It's kind of feels like a combo between the very thick nivea cream and a thinner cream like cerave (if you can actually called cerave \"thin\"). It seems to absorb into my skin really well. I used it underneath my makeup today and it worked really well! My skin has felt moisturized all day and my makeup hasn't looked too flaky today - not more than usual anyway. \n\nAnd the best part is it's fatty alcohol free! Here's the whole ingredient list (I hope the rest of the ingredients are ok?!):\n\nDeionized water, stearic acid, Peg-2 Stearate, propylene glycol, isopropyl myristate, dimethicone, lanolin oil, mineral oil, triethanolamine, allantoin, methylparaben, propylparaben, fragrance\n\nIt also does come in a fragrance free version!\n\nI've listed the website below if you'd like to check it out. I have seen it in places like Shopper's Drug Mart in Canada. Not sure where else you can find it :)\n\nhttp://www.udderlysmooth.com/dry-skin-udderly-smooth-udder-cream.shtml",

There are some 2M views for that reel.\nIn comments, the mom(not sure if she's the mom) says that she is using eyetex supreme kajal for the baby. Just out of curiosity I googled the ingredients in eyetex supreme kajal. Here is it:\n\nINGREDIENTS. Composition : Ricinus communis (Castor) Seed oil, Copernicia cerifera (Carnauba) Wax,polyethylene, Ozokerite, Bis- Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, PPG-3 Benzyl Ether Myristate, Aloe barbadensis leaf Extract & Canola Oil, Propylparaben, Methylparaben, May contain CI 77266, CI 77268:1.\n\nJust saw that the last two ingredients ie: Carbon black, the long term exposure can cause accumulation in lungs, leading to lung diseases.\nShould we appreciate applying kajal on babies, even though it is socially popular in Kerala? My personal opinion is no, I dont support irritating their gentle skin and eyes with such artificial compounds.\nHow much we try to get babies to have beautiful brows and eyelashes using these, it is all genetics in the end.\nPlease tell your opinion, apart from warding off evil eyes(this is what I have heard), is there any significance to this?",

Also parabens (both the types that you have listed) are really bad. A lot of cosmetics have them, and they are linked with many health issues including cancer. Even if you are using the homemade kajal without all these preservatives, it still might cause mild irritation to the baby’s eyes. At the cost of what benefits? Nothing.

Or if you really need kajal for infants then make it from scratch at home. It’s doable. And never use any foreign things (organic or otherwise) in the eye of an infant.

More specifically, Hexomedine, a topical acne medication, and Ialuset, a hyaluronic acid cream.\n\nMy skin loves hyaluronic acid. I've gone through numerous bottles of Hada Labo Lotion, which despite it's name, is a watery hyaluronic acid-based serum. Despite this, I'm always looking to try new things, especially things that have cult followings.\n\n**First Impressions**\n\nI purchased Ialuset in store at New London Pharmacy for $34.00 USD. The ingredients were not listed on the box in English, so I went off of some cursory Googling on efficacy to make my decision. Here is the ingredient list I have found online:\n\n>Sodium hyaluronate, surfactant, oleic acid decyl ester, emulsifying wax, humectant, glycerol, methylparaben, propylparaben, dehydroacetate, acidifier, fragrance, water.\n\nIt comes in two forms: Cream in a metal tube and pressurized bottle. I purchased the cream version.\n\nIaluset is an opaque, white cream that has a very slight fragrance that I can't quite put my finger on. In fact, when I first used it, I thought it had no fragrance because it just smells like a non-fragranced cream.\n\nIt feels extremely emollient when applied. It spreads easily, but needs worked into the skin a little before it settles in completely. This texture makes it feel fairly luxurious and moisturizing right off of the bat.\n\nOnce worked in, it dries down to a kind of dry, waxy feeling. Skin feels plumper and moisturized immediately.\n\nThe first time I used Ialuset, I didn't give it a fair chance. My skin was a bit irritated from breaking out, travel, and some aggressive BHA and Finacea usage. Upon application over my topical actives, my skin lit up, turning red, hot, and uncomfortable.\n\nI immediately suspected the fragrance listed in the ingredients and felt discouraged that I had found yet another product that my skin didn't get along with. Instead of washing it off of my face, I applied some ice and waited to see how my skin felt in the morning (anything for science, right?).\n\nSurprisingly though, it looked and felt plump and happy in the morning, despite the previous evening's snafu. So I decided to try again once my skin was less irritated.\n\nDays later, I applied the Ialuset once more, fresh out of the shower, while my skin was still damp.\n\nAnd I waited... and waited...\n\nMy skin looked and felt great. It was not irritated at all, nor was it red. My rosacea didn't flare or get bumpy. Everything was just fine.\n\nOver the next couple of days, I used it in place of my Hada Labo Lotion, skipping the days when I was using topical actives like my Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid or my Finacea.\n\n**Consensus**\n\nIaluset has great reviews on Avibon's site, and I understand why. It is considered one of the few pure hyaluronic acid products on the market, and it delivers in making skin feel and look more hydrated than it would with a moisturizer alone.\n\nIt is not a replacement for your moisturizer, and I would not recommend treating it as such. Based on my experience, I'd also be cautious about using it with your actives (AHAs, BHAs, topical prescriptions) or when your skin is irritated.\n\nWill it replace my Hada Labo Lotion though? Probably not. It feels luxurious and emollient for sure, but my Hada Labo is a tried-and-true, inexpensive addition to my routine that just works.\n\n[You can purchase Ialuset for $34.00 USD on New London Pharmacy's website](https://www.newlondonpharmacy.com/products/hyaluronic-acid-cream-ialuset?variant=18053595651).\n\n**Note: Ialuset is available on Amazon.com as well, but I did not recommend it here because I have received fake products from Amazon, such as fake Embryolisse that smelled very strongly of perfume. If you decide to purchase from Amazon, proceed with caution and only purchase from sellers you know and trust.**\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "*Needleusesman says*… This site has recipes for DIY mascara. Not sure if this sounds hygienic and may be risk of getting eye infection?\n\n**The Beauty Brains respond:**\n\nListen up kiddies because the message of this post is as close as we get to a public service announcement: Do not use home made mascara!\n\n**DIY Danger**\n\nBeautylish, the site referenced by Needle, recommends making your own mascara by mixing aloe vera gel with powdered charcoal. Supposedly the benefit of this approach is that you avoid preservatives and “excess chemicals.” Unfortunately, whoever wrote this post is not very well informed about cosmetic science and is actually advocating something that is MORE dangerous, not less. Here is what I would say to the writer of that post:\n\n**Aloe Vera gel is not preservative free**\n\nFirst, if your goal is to creates safer product by avoiding preservatives, then you’ve failed from the start because aloe vera gel HAS preservatives in it. Depending on the manufacturer, aloe vera gel can be preserved by a combination of sodium benzoate, sodium sulphate, potassium sorbate, and ascorbic acid. But wait it gets worse: not only are you using preservatives but you’re using the WRONG ones. I couldn’t find any mascaras that use these as preservatives. You should use preservatives which have been tested and shown to safe for use around the eye such as Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, and Phenoxyethanol. You’re creating a formula that may grow dangerous bacteria.\n\n**Colorants for eyes need to be tested**\n\nSecond, the activated charcoal you’re using is not approved as a colorant for use around the eye. The FDA requires that each batch of colorants used around the eye are certified that they comply with safety regulations. A jar of activated charcoal won’t have that safety assurance. Who knows what kind of contaminants it may contain?\n\n**The Beauty Brains bottom line**\n\nIn conclusion let me ask which you think is safer: Purchasing a professionally formulated product with ingredients that have been shown to be safe for use around the eye and that have been tested to ensure it won’t support growth of bacteria that could potentially lead to dangerous eye infection, OR mixing two ingredients, one of which is not properly preserved and the other which is not designed to be used close to your eyes? (Whew, pardon the run on sentence!)\n\nI’m sorry, but you couldn’t pay me enough to risk an eye infection by “protecting” myself from excess chemicals.\n\nSource: [The Beauty Brains - Is DIY Mascara Safe?](http://thebeautybrains.com/2013/01/15/is-diy-mascara-safe/)",

I'd like to do something like Cerave PM, since that's getting harder to source in the UK. \n\nIngredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n\nI don't really need an *exact* dupe, but I'd like something with a good ceramide/fatty acid/cholesterol ratio, niacinamide at around 5%, and I'd like it to be quite light like Cerave PM as I wear it in the AM under sunscreen and makeup.

    "body": "Just to put into perspective, I'm 32F and started tretinoin a few months ago, which has caused my skin needs to change. My skin is combo/leaning towards dry (used to be combo/oily) and more sensitive (I can NOT tolerate niacinamide). \n\nLike many others, my skin did *not* like the new Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser formula and I've been struggling to find something ever since. The Differin Gentle Cleanser is listed a lot, but it appears that this facial cleanser has also been discontinued.\n\nThe ingredients aren't completely the same, however on my quest to find a cleanser that is both gentle, doesn't sting, doesn't cause redness, and doesn't dry out my skin, I came across the [Japanese Curel Foaming Face Wash](https://kao-h.assetsadobe3.com/is/image/content/dam/sites/kaousa/www-curel-com/curel-japan/master/global/curel-foaming-facial-wash-front.jpg?fmt=jpeg&qlt=85&wid=588). For those that double cleanse, they make a Make-Up Cleansing Gel as well (I can't vouch for it, but I did see that it exists).\n\n\n#**INGREDIENTS**\n**Japanese Curel:** Water/Aqua, Glycerin, Maltitol, Propylene Glycol, PEG-150, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Lauroyl Aspartate, Lauryl Hydroxysultaine, Polysorbate 60, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium EDTA, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Potassium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben.\n\n**Old Cetaphil Formula:** Water, Cetyl Alcohol, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Stearyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben\n\n\n\n\n**Since I've become aware of the formula change, here are other face cleansers that I've tried and my skin did not like:**\n\n* **Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser** -  not gentle enough/stripped my skin. Did NOT cause redness.\n* **Aveeno Calm+ Restore Cleanser Gentle Nourishing Oat Face Cleanser** - First night was fine, after that my face got itchy, tight, and red.\n* **Belif Aqua Bomb Jelly Cleanser** - I had this lying around from a sample pack I had. It was fine to bridge me between cleansers for a day or two, but would not work as an every day cleanser.\n* **Olay Regenerist Collagen Peptide 24 Cream Cleanser** - I had this one lying around in my graveyard of face washes. It didn't dry out my skin, but my face was super red (niacinamide). \n* **The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser** - I genuinely don't know if you can use this as just a one-step cleanser. I don't really wear heavy make-up, so I don't need to double cleanse. Either way, sometimes my skin liked this, sometimes my skin ended up drier. Caused redness.\n* **ETUDE SoonJung pH 6.5 Whip Facial Cleanser** - Gentle, but my skin still felt dry after. I think this would work better for combo/leaning towards oily skin. \n* BONUS: Garnier Micellar Water Rose Water/Vitamin C - Both feel the same to my face and I'll admit I have no idea what I'm doing with micellar water. I started using this to take off sunscreen/eye make-up before cleansing my skin or to clean the shell of my ears on a non hair-wash day. \n\n\n*Side note, I'm in the market for a chemical sunscreen without niacinamide. Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun : Rice + Probiotics feels amazing but causes redness like no other. I currently use Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch, which is fine.* \n\nApologies if the formatting is atrocious.",

    "body": "My hands always get dry in the winter, but this year I am taking a medication that acts as a vasoconstrictor and my already terrible circulation is struggling to get any liquid out to my extremities. Less tissue perfusion=drier skin. Even things that were reliable stand-bys while I was on Accutane (Eucerin, lanolin, keeping lotion within reach at all times) are no match for my winter Adderal hand dryness. So I have resorted to hand masking. It’s expensive IMO, even buying the cheaper hand masks and giving some side eye to $9 Sephora masks. But I’m desperate! I couldn't find many reviews for hand masks, so I thought I'd start offering mine. Here are little reviews of the four I have tried so far, from the most to least hydrating.    \nHere’s the TL; DR summary: the Absolute are the most moisturizing and the only one that isn’t scented like cheap grandma perfume, but the Smart Hand Milky Moisture are a bargain at half the price and the only ones with a built in adhesive tab to adjust them to your wrists. Tip: for ones without a built in sticky tab, you can use a hair tie around your wrist more easily than scotch taping once you are gloved.\n\n\n**Absolute New York Repair and Care Hand Mask in Tangerine**    \n**Purchased:** Hmart on sale for $3, regular price $4    \n**Ingredients:** Tangerine Water, Glycerin, PEG-8, Mineral Oil, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Sodium Hyaluronate, PEG-40 Stearate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Stearic Acid, Arbutin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Paraffin, Methylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Triethanolamine, Tangerine Extract, Olive Fruit Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Lycium Chinese Fruit Extract, Thuja Orientalis Seed Extract, Soybean Seed Extract, Swertia Japonica Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Carbomer, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA Hand Mask – Rose Water, Glycerin, PEG-8, Mineral Oil, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Sodium Hyaluronate, PEG-40 Stearate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Stearic Acid, Arbutin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Paraffin, Methylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Triethanolamine, Rose Extract, Olive Fruit Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Lycium Chinese Fruit Extract, Thuja Orientalis Seed Extract, Soybean Seed Extract, Swertia Japonica Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Carbomer, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA    \n**Thoughts:** This one has a strong tangerine scent, no surprise. I was worried the tangerine would be irritating, but it seemed fine. This mask was so effective at moisturizing my sad parched hand that it convinced me to try the others. My Hmart only had this version, but it comes in rose, green tea, and black pearl, all identical formulas except for the main extract and fragrance.\n\n**Repiel Smart Hand Mask Milky Moisture**     \n**Purchase:** Amazon, box of 10 for $20, even cheaper on ebay    \nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Urea, Glyceryl Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Propylene Glycol, PEG-100 Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1.2-Hexanediol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Illicium Verum(Anise)Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Fragrance, Carbomer, Arginine, Milk Protein Extract, Goat Milk Extract, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Allantoin, Adenosine, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hyaluronate    \nThoughts: The standard scent for hand masks appears to be cheap grandma perfume: powdery, soapy floral smell. Except for the first tangerine one, these all smell like grandma in varying degrees. These ones have a medium strength scent that blessedly doesn’t linger. The essence in these is not quite as moisturizing as the Absolute ones, but it’s still good. Annoyingly, it’s not well distributed, at least in the box I got--it’s concentrated in the fingers but the thumb of the gloves doesn’t ever seem to have any, so I have to squish it down into the hand part and then squish my hand around in them for a minute to get the essence properly distributed. What I do like about these is that they have a built in adhesive tab at the wrist. So, after you get them on, you can easily tape them closed tight at the wrist to seal in that moisture goodness. At about half the price of the Absolute, it’s pretty easy to forgive the failings.\n\n**Skin Food Shea Butter Hand Mask**    \n**Purchased:** Ebay for around $3.50    \n**Ingredients:** Water, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter Extract, Dimethicone, Butylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Glycerin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Cyclopentasiloxane, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Honey Extract, Milk Protein Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Arginine, Disodium Edta, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance    \n**Experience:** I was sooo disappointed that these smelled like grandma, because I expected a pleasant shea butter smell. They don’t smell like shea butter at all, and the moistuzing power is so-so. They also have alcohol pretty high in the ingredients list, which doesn’t impress me in skincare, and even less in something meant to moisturize. \n\n\n**The Face Shop Rich Hand V Special Care**    \n**Purchased:** Ebay for around $3.50    \n**Ingredients:** Water, dimethicone, butylene glycol, glycerin, caprylic/capric triglyceride, citrus paradis (grapefruit) extract, glyceryl sterate, peg-100 sterate, urea, cetearyl alcohol, alcohol, sorbitan sesquioleate, cyclopentasiloxane, sodium polyacrylate, acrylates/C10-20 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, hydrogenated polydecene, potassium hydroxide, dimethiconol, adenosine, trideceth-6, disodium edta, phenoxyethanol, fragrance    \n**Experience:** These have a much milder grandma scent than the others, further mitigated with a pleasant base note of shea or cocoa butter smell, which is weird since they don’t contain either. They were the juiciest feeling hand mask I tried, and I had high hopes for them. Unfortunately, they did virtually nothing. I was honestly amazed at how ineffectual these were for moisturizing, and I can only guess the difference between this and the other masks I tried is due to the dimethicone so high in the ingredients list and lack of more effective moisturizing oil, at least for my skin. \n",

I got super excited but got let down quite quickly. \nI compared the ingredient lists of Cerave in the tub and PM with their new european counterparts and there are differences. \nThe bulk of the ingredients is the same but the order differs and some ingredients are missing. \nFor example there are no parabens in the Eu version of Cerave in the tub, but the Ceramide complex and cholesterol are significantly lower down in the list, the phenoxyethanol higher up and tocopherol is added. \nFor the PM version, the niacinimide is missing in the Eu version... \n\nHere are the ingredients: \nCerave moisturising cream US version: \nPurified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\nCerave cream Eu version: \nAQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETYL ALCOHOL, CETEARETH-20, PETROLATUM, DIMETHICONE, PHENOXYETHANOL, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, SODIUM HYALURONATE, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP\n\n\nIt might be perfectly fine but I wanted to post anyway because some of us might want to patch test the new version first. \n\nEdit: There is niacinamide indeed in the Eu version!! But the problem with the ceramides is the same: way down the ingredient list. ",

Finishing Powder** | **MAC Prep + Prime Transparent Finishing Powder** |\n|:-----------|------------:|:------------:|\n|  **Size**   |   7.5g  |    9g\n|  **Price**   |   $13.95 / $1.86 per gram |   $42 / $4.66 per gram\n|  **Packaging**   |   2/5  |    4/5\n|  Notes: |   While sturdy, there is a slight 'cheap' feeling, the screw top lid is poorly designed and very fiddly/hard to close neatly once the powder is opened and settled into the ridges. I do also find the hot pink metallic labelling a little cheesy/tween for my liking. |    Also very sturdy overall, but feels much nicer and of a higher quality plastic. I don't have any issues with the screw top lid like with the Australis this closes smoothly. Very neatly labelled, although a smaller 'fatter' jar design. I prefer the diameter of the Australis, the larger surface area is easier to swirl a large powder brush in.\n|  **Oil Control** |   3/5  |    4/5\n|  Notes:  |   Mattifying for 4/4.5 Hours on average after application. |    Mattifying for 5-6 hours + on average after application.\n|  **Formula**  |   3/5  |    5/5\n|  Notes: |   Very finely milled. The powder is also very lightweight. Can still feel a little grainy to the touch. |    Also finely milled, but perhaps not quite as fine as the Australis. It has a little more weight to the powder itself probably due to the difference in ingredients used. Side by side comparison, this feel much smoother.\n|  **Application**  |   2/5  |    4/5\n|  Notes:  |   Applies nicely but a little difficult to work with. It flies out in a huge cloud of powder even with simply opening the jar lid, letalone swirling a brush in it. It can also give me a very slight white cast and doesn't always blend out evenly (it can cling). |    Applies and blends very well. I also still experience a little of the clouding but nowhere near as much as with the Australis. I have not yet noticed a white cast with this powder.\n|  **Ingredients**  |   Silica, Tocopheryl Acetate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben |    Zea Mays (Corn) Starch, Silica, Mica, Zinc Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**My overall final thoughts**\n\nAfter having been a long-time user and lover of the Australis powder I never really bothered to look elsewhere at other brands offerings. I have very oily skin, and cannot use just a regular pressed powder as their oil control Is not enough. I must top them with a transparent setting powder as well, to last through an average work day.\nMonths ago, I was gifted the pressed version of the MAC setting powder, and quite enjoy it as my on-the-go touch up powder but I prefer a loose version for initial morning applications.\nI was under the (silly) impression that the majority of these setting powders were essentially the same thing/formula and therefore was more than happy with the Australis based on price.\nAfter looking a little further into it, the MAC in particular has a strikingly different formula, only sharing Silica as an ingredient.\n\n\nI've been wearing the MAC for over a week now, and can tell an improvement in oil control (especially considering we're coming into the warmer months!), application and increased wear time of my foundation. I apply my makeup on average around 7-7:30am most days and don’t get home from work until 6pm. Without a setting powder, I’m lucky to get a couple of hours in before the oil begins to show. With the Australis Powder, I usually have to touch up before lunch (around 11-12) and again right after lunch – if not again later in the afternoon. With the MAC, so far I can easily last until lunchtime before any shine starts to show through, and lately have only felt the need to touch up once in the afternoon after lunch or so. While I wish that by some miracle a powder out there exists that would keep my face matte all day every day, I don’t think it does. \n\n\nThe Australis still has excellent bang for buck and is a great product, but I feel like the MAC's performance and application already leave it for dead on my skin, and despite the price it is a worthwhile investment for me. A jar of the Australis typically lasts me around 4 months give or take and I hope I get about the same out of the MAC.\nIf you've used any other loose translucent style powders out there on the market, I would love to hear your thoughts or suggestions.\n\n\nI am still working on my liquid lipstick showdown/review - I know a few of you are waiting patiently; it's still in the works! How do you feel about this table or something similar for the liquid lipsticks?\n\nI hope some of you found this small review useful – cheers!\n",

A lot of the good stuff that I loved for the skin benefits has been moved down the list considerably. I've always loved this bb cream because the #13 shade fits my skin pretty perfectly, and I'm generally demanding of my makeup in that I want it to be making me look better in the long run as well as the short run. Missha's ingredient list seemed to have some pretty great additions to do just that; It had a decent Pa protection rating and some ingredients I valued such as arbutin, squalane, adenosine, and ceramide.  Now... I think I might start looking for a new daily bb cream. Something with a similar shade, equal or better sun protection, but more potent anti-aging and completion-improving ingredients. If anyone has suggestions, I'd love to hear them! \n\nFor the curious - I've included the ingredient lists for comparison. While the old list can be found on various old reviews (such as one I grabbed from [here](http://nouveaucheap.blogspot.com/2012/09/review-missha-perfect-cover-bb-cream.html), the latest rendition on [missha's site](http://www.misshaus.com/m-perfect-cover-bb-cream-spf-42-pa.html) has some considerable changes, at least IMHO.

EWG is difficult to navigate (IE-only - what year is this?), and tends to look overly-favorably towards physical/mineral-only sunscreens. The Wirecutter and Consumer Reports are more focused on price and SPF than ingredient health risks (not unreasonable given prior results from studies) and feel on your skin (less reasonable - what good is sunscreen that you never want to use?).\n\nFor the record, I was \\~90% of the way through my own research before I found this subreddit =)\n\nDisclaimer¹: I am neither a doctor nor a scientist, nor do I have any affiliation with any of the companies or brands mentioned.  I’m just in search of a straightforward recommendation on which sunscreen to buy.\n\nOnce I’d fallen deep down the rabbit hole, I wanted to share what I found with others in case others might find it helpful.  Here’s what I’ve learned thus far:\n\n## Lesson 1: Sunscreen is definitely [worth the (comparably low) risk!](https://blog.skincancer.org/2018/06/06/sunscreen-safety/)\n\nDaily sunscreen use reduces cancer rates by 40-50% - a demonstrable benefit that exponentially outweighs the scarce in vivo or even in vitro experiments showing a link between various ingredients and potential health risks (usually at high concentrations).\n\n## Lesson 2: Different regions have different regulations and [ratings](https://theklog.co/spf-meaning/)\n\n* The Boots ★ rating is proprietary, and relative to the SPF. So ★★★★★ on SPF 15 may not be as good as ★★★ on SPF 50.\n* PPD is akin to SPF but for UVA rays.  A PPD of 10 indicates that it takes 10 times longer to darken than unprotected skin.\n* The U.S. has a “broad spectrum” test, but the ratio of UVA to UVB isn’t explicit\n* Some newer ingredients that show promise (Tinosorb S, Tinosorb M, Mexoryl SX Mexoryl XL, & Uvinul A Plus) are still pending safety studies for U.S. approval\n* Outside the U.S., not all companies are obliged to show the % of their active ingredients in the sunscreen formulas.\n\n## Lesson 3: Some ingredients may be better than others.\n\n* Oxybenzone & Octinoxate may be [endocrine disruptors](https://www.ewg.org/sunscreen/report/the-trouble-with-sunscreen-chemicals/)\n* Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide are better, but alone [aren’t effective enough](https://www.consumerreports.org/sunscreens/shining-a-light-on-natural-sunscreen/).\n* Some studies linked inactive ingredients with other risks:\n   * \\[Vitamin A (Retinyl Palmitate)\\]([https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/705545/RETINYL\\_PALMITATE\\_(VITAMIN\\_A\\_PALMITATE)/](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/705545/RETINYL_PALMITATE_(VITAMIN_A_PALMITATE)/))\n   * [BHT (Butylated hydroxytoluene)](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/700741/BHT/)\n   * [Unregulated Fragrances/Perfumes](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/702512/FRAGRANCE/)\n   * [Aluminum compounds](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/700326/ALUMINUM_STARCH_OCTENYLSUCCINATE/)\n   * [DMDM Hydantoin](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/702196/DMDM_HYDANTOIN_(FORMALDEHYDE_RELEASER)/)\n   * [PABA (Para-Aminobenzoic Acid)](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/704390/PABA/)  \\- Soon to be banned by the FDA\n   * [Parabens](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/search.php?query=paraben), [Propyl-paraben](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/705335/PROPYLPARABEN/) & [Butyl-paraben](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/700868/BUTYLPARABEN/)\n   * [PEG/PEO](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/704983/POLYETHYLENE_GLYCOL/)/PPG/PPO (Macrogol, Polyethylene glycol, Polyethylene Oxide, Polyoxyethylene, Polypropylene glycol or polypropylene oxide)\n   * [Silicones](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/701277/CETYL_PEG%3B%3B_PPG-10%3B%3B_1_DIMETHICONE/)\n   * [SLES (Sodium Laureth Sulfate)](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/706089/SODIUM_LAURETH_SULFATE/)\n   * [Trolamine Salicylate ](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/706476/TEA_SALICYLATE/) \\- Soon to be banned by the FDA\n   * [Phthalates](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/719992/ISOPROPYLPHTHALIMIDE/)\n   * certain [preservatives](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/703935/METHYLISOTHIAZOLINONE/)\n* Other safe ingredients can feel unpleasant on skin (especially for us oily types):\n   * Allergens (gluten, nut oil, certain emulsifiers)\n   * Simple (aka short-chain) alcohols can dry out skin\n      * Alcohol Denat (Denatured Alcohol)\n      * Aminomethyl Propanol\n      * Benzyl alcohol\n      * Ethanol alcohol\n      * Ethyl alcohol\n      * Isopropyl alcohol\n      * Phenethyl\n      * Phenoxyethanol\n      * Propanol alcohol\n      * T-Butyl Alcohol\n   * certain Oils\n   * certain Emulsifiers\n   * Silicone & Acrylate polymers make sunscreen “waterproof” but can leave [tacky / greasy film](https://www.sharecare.com/health/sunburn-prevention/why-sun-protection-products-greasy) on your skin. Good for swimming, not for daily use.\n* Finally, a combination of Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and Ferulic Acid may further protect skin from damage.\n\n## Lesson 4: SPF ratings aren’t as high in real life as they are in labs\n\nSunscreen’s ability to block UVA/UVB rays depends on the thickness applied to the skin.  In tests for SPF rating, they assume a thickness of 2mg/cm², which few people apply in real life (where it’s generally closer to .5 - 1mg/cm²).  That’s one of the reasons it’s better to use SPF 30+, because you’re likely only getting a fraction of the protection anyway.\n\n## Lesson 5: Protect your skin - with SCIENCE!\n\nThe coolest thing I found was that BASF (a major chemical manufacturer in the U.S.) has [a free tool](https://www.sunscreensimulator.basf.com/) that lets you plug in a sunscreen formulation and estimate its effectiveness, along with what it’s theoretical SPF, Boots ★ Rating, PA+ rating, and U.S. Broad Spectrum test results - you can even test at a lower amount like what people would realistically apply on their skin.\n\nSo what I did was search the internet for sunscreens that didn’t use Oxybenzone / Octinoxate, (which largely left Avobenzone - aka Methoxydibenzoylmethane - as the main UVA blocker), and compared their results.\n\nDisclaimer²: My understanding is that while we aren’t 100% confident in which chemicals are completely safe, we have previously found more risks from some chemicals than others.  This is part of why the FDA seeks more research on all sun blocking chemicals.\n\n## The Best\n\n**Legend:** Real - effective rating for 1mg/cm²; CR - Consumer Reports Ranking;\tNC - Non-comedogenic (doesn't block pores);\tPb - contains Parabens;\tA - contains short-chain alcohols; \tF - contains unspecified Fragrances; Scroll right for $/oz., $/UVA, $/UVB.\n\n|**TYPE**|**BRAND**|**NAME**|**SPF**|**REAL**|**UVA**|**★**|**PA**|**PPD**|**NC**|**Pb**|**A**|**F**|**GREASY?**|**$/Oz.**|**$/SPF**|**$/UVA**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Stick|Ombrelle|[Face Stick SPF 60 with Mexoryl XL](https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/ombrelle-face-stick-spf-60/6000016946893)|60|15|7.3|3|PA+++|7.2|Y|N|N|N|Water Resistant, Company claims it's \"non-greasy\"|$53.33|$3.56|$7.31|\n|Spray|Rocky Mountain|[Quart Spray SPF 50 KIDS Mist](https://www.rmsunscreen.com/sprayquart50kids-single.aspx)|50|10|6|3|PA++|5.7|Y|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Company claims it's \"non-greasy formula\"|$1.33|$0.13|$0.22|\n|Spray|Rocky Mountain|[6-oz Spray SPF 50](https://www.rmsunscreen.com/6ozsprayspf50sunscreen.aspx)|50|10|6|3|PA++|5.7|Y|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Company claims it's \"greaseless\"|$1.67|$0.17|$0.28|\n|Spray|Altruist Dermatologist|[Sunspray SPF 50](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0794VX8R1)|50|10|5.9||||?|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Reviews claim it's \"non greasy\"|$1.92|$0.19|$0.33|\n|Lotion|La Roche-Posay|[Anthelios Xl Ultra-Light Fluid](https://www.shopgator.com/product/la-roche-posay-anthelios-xl-spf-50-ultra-light-fluid/)|50+|10|**14**|5|PA+++|9.3|Y|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Company claims it's \"non-greasy\"|$12.13|$1.21|$0.87|\n|Lotion|Sun Bum|[Original 30 SPF\\*](https://www.amazon.com/Sun-Bum-Sunscreen-SPF-30/dp/B00GO9QER4/)|30|10|6.2|3|PA++|5.6|Y|N|N|**Y**|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Reviews claim it's \"non-greasy\"|$1.88|$0.19|$0.30|\n|Lotion|Sun Bum|[Orignal 50 SPF](https://www.amazon.com/Original-Moisturizing-Sunscreen-Protection-Hypoallergenic/dp/B004XGPM32/)|50|10|6.1|3|PA++|5.7|Y|N|N|**Y**|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Reviews claim it's \"non-greasy\"|$1.88|$0.19|$0.31|\n|Lotion|Sun Bum|[Original 50 Face Lotion](https://www.amazon.com/Sun-Bum-Lotion-Spectrum-Protection/dp/B07B685MFG/)|50|10|6.1|3|PA++|5.7|Y|N|N|**Y**|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Reviews claim it's \"non-greasy\"|$4.33|$0.43|$0.71|\n|Lotion|Avene|[Ultra-Light Hydrating Sunscreen Lotion](https://www.pharmaca.com/avene-ultra-light-hydrating-sunscreen-lotion-spf-50-1-3oz-1)|50+|10|6|3|PA++|5.7|Y|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Reviews claim it's \"not greasy\"|$14.12|$1.41|$2.35|\n|Lotion|La Roche Posay|[Anthelios Clear Skin Oil Free](https://www.amazon.com/Roche-Posay-Anthelios-Clear-Skin-Sunscreen/dp/B01A0NT3D6)|60|10|5.9|3|PA++|5.2|Y|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Reviews claim it's \"doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy\"|$11.83|$1.18|$2.01|\n|Lotion|Altruist Dermatologist|[Sunscreen SPF50†](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Altruist-Dermatologist-Sunscreen-SPF-50/dp/B06X6LZWRC)|50|\\~10?|\\~5.9?||||?|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Reviews claim it's \"non greasy\"|$1.45|$0.14|$0.25|\n|Lotion|Bioderma|[Photoderm MAX Lait SPF 50+†](https://www.rakuten.com/shop/perfume-worldwide/product/U-SC-3311/?sku=U-SC-3311)|50+|10|5.9||||Y|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Reviews claim it's \"leaves skin a bit shiny\"|$7.88|$0.79|$1.34|\n|Lotion|Eucerin|[Sun Fluid Sensitive Protect SPF 50+†](https://store.sweetcare.pt/eucerin-facial-sunscreens-p-002734eu?)|50+|\\~10?|\\~5.9?||||?|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Company claims it's \"non-greasy texture\"|$11.83|$1.18|$2.01|\n|Lotion|Aloe Up|[White Collection 30 SPF](https://www.aloeup.com/shop/white-collection-spf-30-sunscreen-lotion)|30|6|5.6|3|PA++|5.5|Y|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Company claims it's \"non-greasy\"|$3.00|$0.50|$0.54|\n|Lotion|BGS|[Black Girl Sunscreen SPF 30](https://blackgirlsunscreen.com/product/black-girl-sunscreen-spf-30/)|30|6|5.4|3|PA++|4.2|?|N|**Y**|N|Silicone/Acrylic Polymer,|$6.33|$1.06|$1.17|\n|Moisture|La Roche-Posay|[Toleriane Double Repair Facial Moisturizer](https://www.thebeautyplace.com/la-roche-posay-toleriane-double-repair-moisturizer-2-5-oz.html)|30|6|6|3|PA++|5.2|Y|N|**Y**|N||$7.87|$1.31|$1.31|\n|Moisture|CeraVe|[Ultra Light Moisturizer + SPF 30](https://www.walmart.com/ip/CeraVe-Ultra-Light-Moisturizing-Face-Lotion-with-SPF-30-1-7-oz/647153722)|30|6|5.4|3|PA++|4.2|Y|N|N|N|Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Reviews claim it's \"wasn't greasy\"|$8.82|$1.47|$1.63​|\n\n\\* Not sure why, but the SPF 30 tested a higher UVA protection than SPF 50  \n† Doesn’t list % of active ingredients.

        "body": "Hi, nice post.\n\nThere are a few details I would like to explain:\n\n* **PA-rating** is NOT related to SPF. PA++ is a PDD between 4 and 8, no matter the stated SPF. **Boots star rating** IS a relative information though (in percentage of SPF; 3 stars is the minimum)\n* **Trolamine** **Salicylate** might get banned, but I've honestly never seen it in any sunscreen. I think it'd be much harder to find one that has it than to list it as a \"bad thing not to have\"\n* **comedogenic ratings** are close to useless. Some individuals might find their skin reacts according to the CosDNA scale or some other, but it's not a general/scientific thing. Products stating to be non-comedogenic can still be comedogenic. There is no regulation or common standard or anything. Btw, **Tocopherol** often gets a higher comedogenic rating, and some people really have to avoid it.\n* Similar with the \"feel\" of a product, though there might be a bit more of consensus. **Acrylates/Silicone Copolymer** usually improve the spreadability of a sunscreen, increasing its protection (which is one of the two major reasons the Sunscreen Simulator tends to underestimate protection). They (the copolymers or acrilates, not the silicone) are also necessary to make a product resistant to sweat and water. I personally prefer such products because they actually tend to feel *less* greasy.  **Methyl Methacrylate** is a common ingredient to encapsulate UV filters, which improves their stability (something Avobenzone and also Octinoxate need). Tinosorb S Aqua (Tinosorb S on steroids) also uses this technology.\n* **Parebens** are not all equal. You may want to avoid them all, your choice, but Methyl- and Ethylparaben are technically not capable of binding to your hormone receptors, so they basically cannot disrupt your hormones. Butyl- and especially Propylparaben are different (longer chains, higher affinity - but still very low; wait for next week when the CIR is releasing their final safety assessment of Parabens, the tentative report is incomplete but the discussions are worth a read if you're interested). They are also the least likely preservative to cause any irritation or reaction in sensitive skin, though there are of course some people who do not tolerate them.\n* As long as the sunscreen doesn't come in an aerosol bottle (which is harmful to the environment, does not provide decent protection, and is dangerous for a large number of ingredients), mentioning ingredients that are **potentially toxic when inhaled** as a con doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Talc, etc etc are all toxic when inhaled at larger quantities, not because the substances themselves are harmful but because the particles have a structure that is specifically dangerous to our lungs. The EU is currently deciding on the danger of TiO2 for that reason alone, we might get some sort of warning on products in the future (in the EU).\n* most people are able to use **Sunflower oil** without any issues. Most non-synthetic and some synthetic substances are potential allergens for some. Not worth to be mentioned imho. **Methylisothiazolinone** for example is banned in the EU for leave-on products due to its high allergenic potential, as with continued use more and more people developed sensitivities to it. But: it is still fine for 95% of the population.\n* whether a sunscreen leaves a **whitecast** or not is actually quite easy to determine. There are only a few ingredients that are visibly white: Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Tinosorb A2B and Tinosorb M. They can be totally invisible on pale/light skin, but easy to sport on deeper tones. If a sunscreen does not contain any of these, it is invisible.\n* The UVA-PF of **Altruist** is 31 for the SPF50, and 23 for the SPF30.\n* Right, as you can see in the Sunscreen Simulator, **UVA-PF** (Europe) and PPD (Asia) are NOT the same. So comparing PA++++ (PPD of 16 or higher) to SPF50 with UVA-circle (UVA+PF of 16.66667 or higher) is a bit sketchy (though we all do it, because we have no other information).\n* I'm a bit surprised about your love for **Avobenzone**. Yes, it provides great UVA protection but it is highly unstable, stings people's eyes and stains your clothes (yellow). Uvinul A Plus is the way to go in my opinion (same pros, no cons). In order to trust Avobenzone you'll want to make sure it is at least stabilized. Ideally by Octocrylene (3.8% of that and Avobenzone barely degrades at all over 8 hours, really the best stabilizer; Oxybenzone is also good, Octisalate and the Tinosorbs are not that powerful). Octinoxate and minerals (TiO2, ZnO) decrease the stability of Avobenzone, unless coated (Avobenzone can also be encapsulated, same goes for Ocinoxate - encapsulated Octinoxate is quite stable, does not penetrate the skin and provides better protection).\n\nOut of curiousity, what is the problem with short chain alcohols? There is a risk of irritation for some people, but that is very individual, not only with respect to the person but also the product.\n\nAnd where did you find the information that PABA will get banned? Does it apply to derivatives? That would surprise me. Ethylhexy Triazone does not pose any substantial risk to human health as far as we know, it's too big to be absorbed into the skin and has thus far has not shown to cause allergic reactions or anything.\n\nThere is a bill suggested in California that proposes the ban of ingredients that are known to be dangerous.  [https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill\\_id=201920200AB495](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB495)\n\nAnother suggestion is to look into European (or Asian, though Ocinoxate is extremly popular there) sunscreens.\n\nAnd definitely have a look to Peter's Posts and Excel sheet:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/5w4o0g/sun\\_care\\_mega\\_list\\_of\\_fragrance/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/5w4o0g/sun_care_mega_list_of_fragrance/)  and  [https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/a1m15a/review\\_comparison\\_of\\_sunscreens\\_with\\_tinosorb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/a1m15a/review_comparison_of_sunscreens_with_tinosorb/)",

        "body": "The sunscreen calculator is considered unreliable. It doesn’t take into account how other filters boost uva protection of others, or the boost from antioxidants and so on.\n\nEwg is as equally unreliable. \n\nYou should look at kind of Stephens website/blog. Probably the best source of info and understandable explainations. Lab muffin is pretty reasonable also. They both also link the research on the supposedly risky avo and at best it shows we would need 277 years of daily all over use to cause any effect on us.\n\nI agree that physical filters on their own are massively over rated. When most of the population can’t wear thick enough layers of them without getting impossible whitecast then they can’t provide the protection advertised on the bottle. I’m also somewhat sick of hearing that physical filters are ideal for sensitive skins- ymmv always applies and I’m sure I’m not the only dry and sensitive skinned person who reacts badly to zinc oxide. Yet I get on great with chemical filters, as long as the base is fragrance free and moisturising. \n\nI think the other issue with sunscreens often not noted is whether they are water resistant or not. Sweating filters off won’t offer protection as advertised.",

Avobenzone needs other filters to stabilize it. Avobenzone by itself degrades so so so much faster without the accompanying stabilizer like tinosorb, mexoryl, uvinul, octocrylene, etc. \n\nAnd avobenzone can't be mixed with uncoated mineral filters as they also can degrade avobenzone.",

Eye holes not too big. The mask is black.\n\n**WEAR TIME**\nAverage. I hit 30 min easy.\n\n**AFTEREFFECTS**\nIt managed to leave this sticky film not unlike a clear tar all over my face... without actually managing to penetrate and hydrate AT ALL! (I judge hydration by the depth of my fine lines and wrinkles after a mask.) It didn't whiten, it didn't hydrate... Re: sebum control, it did take the oil off just my nose area, but I'm pretty sure anyone who wants sebum control wouldn't enjoy the sticky tar feeling on the rest of their face. Editx2: It does suck the oil away if you immediately wash your face afterwards.\n\n**Edit: Oh yeah, sensitive types may want to avoid anyway**\nThe preservatives and fragrance are higher up on the ingredients list than usual. \n\nThis one is a HARD SKIP!",

My skin also feels unusually smooth and soft.\n\nI had also used it overnight on a couple of spots on my leg that were struggling to heal over the past month and was really surprised to see that they are significantly improved this morning.\n\nI'm going to use it for the rest of this week and see how I go - maybe it's a flare thing, maybe it's a weekly/monthly mask... interested to hear others' experiences or thoughts.",

        "body": "\" Sharing my recent personnal experience with this brand:  \"Brand who was good until they suddenly restricted me and ignored my DM on purpose; to you: Why are you doing this? I never said anything bad about your brand,in contrary I wrote many good reviews, shared it in Instagram stories and love it. But since one week I can't tag you anymore and your staff has ignored me. Also,I tested with some friends who don't follow you and they can't tag you either. So, my guess is that you're now only allowing influencers to tag you,to participate to your challenges. No normies like me anymore. Nor the pp who dare to gave you construct criticism when you're using AI, telling you u made a little mispell in stories, or are sad about something. No, you're just ignoring us instead of coming clean. That's disappointing. You used to be a great inde brand; for the products you still are,but on the commercial aspect and communication it's getting worse. Also, for a brand who is doing great pictures of shiny products, why are you using photoshop or AI to modify it? The stars aren't necessary! Also, why are you using old pictures of old products for new? That's false publicity. Look, I don't care if you threaten me, don't publish ,ignore me or block me, because that'll only show how hypocritical you might have become. And anyways, I'm already sharing this thought on platform and stories. There are p who agree you know? Your challenges and stuff is only about influencers now, not customers. And last, 120 as a price for a box full fo the same items and no new stuff is disappointing too. Others brand are doing it, they also care about us,they don't shadowban or restrict us. Just because something is not as you like give you permission to act like this. Period. \"",

    "body": "I wrote all of this on my phone, so if there’s formatting issues, I’m sorry.\n\n\nMy skin: \n\nCombo. Super oily t-zone, regular oily cheeks and eye lids. Dry mouth area and the space between my brows gets flaky. \n\nSkin tone: light to light medium, neutral to warm. I tend to tan more than burn, but it does happen, just very rarely.\n\nAcne: CCs (10-ish a week) mainly on my forehead these days, some on the center between my brows, close to the hairline, and chin area. My forehead is usually clear in the past, so I’ve been trying to figure out what’s changed. Cystic acne (2-3 a week) along my jawline, though this is mostly non-existent for the past 3 weeks bc I switched the brand of my spearmint supplements. There’s blackheads &amp; enlarged pores on the sides of my nose. Occasional whiteheads from laziness (not changing the pillowcase enough, usually 1-2 when it happens. Mild bacne around my shoulder blades, usually the clogged, dried out and waxy stuff.\n\nOther concerns: Hyperpigmentation from acne scarring, mostly on my cheeks and jawline. Dark mouth area from reason(s) unknown, dark neck from contact dermatitis from a body wash. Fine expression lines at the corner of my mouth, and eyes. \n\nIngredients that break me out: Coconut oil, certain coconut-derived ingredients, and certain silicones in certain areas. \n\n\nReviews:\n\nHumane’s Clarifying Toner BHA Exfoliant 2% Salicylic Acid\n\nActive Ingredient: Salicylic Acid 2% (Beta Hydroxy Acid) • Inactive Ingredients: Aqua (Deionized Water), Zemea Propanediol (GRAS Natural Corn-Based Solvent), Sodium Hydroxide (GRAS pH Adjuster), Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea Antioxidant), Gluconolactone (PHA Antioxidant), Sodium Benzoate (GRAS Preservative).\n\nThis is cheaper and better version of Paula’s Choice 2% BHA Liquid. I used to go through a bottle of PC’s in about 3 months. The Humane dupe is $10 cheaper at $18 for the same 4 oz/118 ml. This doesn’t leave a slightly, oily finish like PC’s. Very liquidy, slightly more viscous than water. If you smell it from the bottle, it has a melon-like scent? I have no idea what ingredient that could possibly come from, since there’s no fragrance. The scent isn’t strong at all, I don’t really smell it whenever I use it. It unclogs pores and soothe skin from possible irritation w/ green tea. Not super drying, but not moisturizing. \n\nI use this on my face, my pits, my legs, and my back. I decant this into a 1 oz spray bottle I got from the $1 dollar store, to be more convenient for my back. This helps my bacne a lot, but it doesn’t totally clear it up. My bacne is the only reason why I decant into a spray bottle. I spray this into the air and then walk backwards. For everywhere else, I spray onto my hands, then apply where I need. (I feel like decanting into a spray bottle makes me use less while still being effective. I also hate wasting product and cotton balls/pads.) This works with natural everyday odor in my pits, but I would put on anti-persperant/deodorant for sweaty/hot days. I don’t use it consistently enough for my strawberry legs, so I can’t give a definitive review on that. I put it on after I shave my legs, but I don’t shave on a regular schedule (especially bc it’s still cold outside). \n\nI use this 2x a day on my face, and my pores are less clogged and a smidge less dark. This helps prevent and lessen blackheads and whiteheads.\n\nI don’t wait 15 minutes, I feel like that’s kinda unnecessary. The time it takes to brush my teeth, floss, and mouthwash is how long I let it dry.\n\nNot for: anyone who’s super sensitive to salicylic acid, has dry or really dry skin. \n\nGood for: Normal to oily ppl who have blackheads, CCs, and whiteheads. Use for treatment and maintenance.\n\nTime: Early November 2018 to present, repurchase about every 3 months\n\nScore: 4.5/5\n\nWorth it: Yes\n\nRepurchase: Yes\n\nReplace with: This was the replacement, so no.\n\n\nHerbivore’s Phoenix Cell Regenerating Facial Oil\n\nIngredients: Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Rosa Canina (Rosehip) Seed Oil, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Salvia Hispanica (Chia) Seed Oil, CoQ10, Hippophae Rhamnoides L (Sea Buckthorn) Oil, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Rosa Damanscena (Moroccan Rose) Absolute, Citrus Aurantium (Neroli) Essential Oil.\n\nI’m gonna confess here that one of the reasons why I brought this was bc I love the name of this. I’m a sucker for mythical creatures. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nI actually brought Herbivore’s Lapis Balancing Facial Oil but it broke me out, unfortunately. :-( I brought this bc I still wanted an oil blend. It’s target consumer is ppl concerned with aging who want an ‘all-natural’ option. I don’t care about treating aging at 23, so I can’t review it on that topic. I care about preventing premature wrinkles and lines, but I use sunscreen and staying inside for that. \n\nThe claims Herbivore listed on their site: brightening, evening skin-tone, smoothing, plumping, nourishing, rehydrating dull and dry skin, and reducing aging from sun exposure. \n\nI mainly use this along with my nighttime moisturizers, 3-7 drops depending on how dry/cold it is or if I used a chemical peel. I combine this oil blend with my moisturizer bc the Phoenix oil is mainly emollients. There’s no humectants, and my night time moisturizer is oil-free, PC’s Oil-Free Moisturizer.\n\nThe Phoenix oil is nourishing, I wake up with smoother, more even textured skin, and I’m noticeably less oily at the end of the day. My face is more glowy in general, and it helps heal my PIH. By itself, it doesn’t wholly sink in. My face is more oily in the morning, still smoother and all that good stuff, but to a lesser extant than if I combine it with a moisturizer. It’s a very nice booster, in a sense. This is not a light or dry oil, like squalane, but it’s definitely not greasy and clogging, like coconut oil. Lighter than argan oil, closest to rose hip, which it contains.\n\nThe best results I have with this is mixing it with my overnight mask, PC’s Hydrating Treatment Mask, after a chemical peel, either DE’s Sukari Babyfacial or TO’s Peeling Solution. I wake up with the best skin. The PC mask by itself is good enough after a peel, but it’s AMAZING with a couple drops of the Phoenix oil. It helps the results from the peel last a bit longer, sometimes a day longer if I’m lucky.\n\nThe only issue is the neroli oil and rose extract. I don’t really smell either, I mostly smell the rose hip oil. I’m not super sensitive to fragrance, but I do prefer unnecessary ingredients. A lot of oil blends have fragrant oils and other fragrant ingredients, but this only has 2 and I don’t smell them. Of course, given that it’s been a year, it may have dissipated, I’m nose-blind to it, or the Phoenix oil is just starting to go bad.\n\nI brought this a year ago and I’m not even half way through. I have about 60% left, and it hasn’t gone rancid. At $88 for 1.7 oz/50 ml, I think that’s pretty good. The bottle and dropper is really luxe and pretty, so I’ll probably decant another oil when I’m done with it. Herbivore states that the shelf life is around 12 months. I keep it in the dark w/ no heat, so I believe it’s still good. I’m going to try and hurry to finish it up before it goes bad, so I’ll probably mix it in w/ body lotion and use as hair oil. \n\nNot for: ppl extremely sensitive to fragrance, on a budget, basilisks, destructive children or pets, clumsy ppl. It’s a big glass bottle.\n\nGood for: dry to oily skin types, ppl wanting to glow, in need of some healing. \n\nTime: March 2018-present \n\nScore: 4/5, mostly bc of price \n\nWorth it: Yeah. Definite splurge at front, but a lot of bang for your buck.\n\nRepurchase: Probably not. \n\nReplace with: I’m probably just gonna make my own custom blend for cheaper. \n\n\nPeter Thomas Roth’s Therapeutic Sulfur Mask\n\nIngredients: Sulfur 10%, Water/Aqua/Eau, Bentonite, Kaolin, Propylene Glycol, Talc, Glycerin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Zinc Oxide (CI 77947), Polysorbate 20, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Carbomer, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben.\n\nThis works what it claims to do: clear acne, soothe with aloe, oil absorbing. The texture is very smooth, not gritty at all. Smells like sulfur. Not overly drying like most clay-based masks. This doesn’t flake too much if you apply a thin layer. Not as big of a pain to wash off unlike other clay masks.\n\nThe price is great per oz, $47 for 5 oz/142 grams, at most retailers. On Amazon rn, it’s $23.15. You don’t need a lot, a thin layer works best.\n\nMy biggest gripe is how the mask makes my eyes water really bad??? I don’t understand why. I’ve used products with sulfur before, and never had irritated eyes, so it has to be some other ingredient/s... I just don’t know what. This has never happened with any other product I’ve ever used before. I’m not sensitive to fragrance, so I don’t believe it’s that either.\n\nThis mask leaves a residue if I just wash it off with regular water, and I rather not use my second cleanser a third time in one routine. The way I make this work for me w/ the least amount of tears is to oil cleanse, apply a thin layer of the mask for overnight, and then wash off with my second cleanser in the morning. Most effective and it shortens my night routine significantly.\n\nNot for: super dry to dry skin, sensitivity to sulfur, sensitivity to some other ingredient that makes your eyes water. If you have dry skin, using it as spot treatment may work best. I would just get a mini for that tho.\n\nGood for: normal to oily, and acne-prone skin. \n\nTime: Early January-present, use 1-2x a week.\n\nScore: 3/5, mainly for super watery eyes and residue\n\nWorth it: It works, but I’m on the fence due to  the waterworks.\n\nRepurchase: Possible. My acne is mostly under control, so these days I use it more for maintenance and oil control. It’s also the least drying clay mask I’ve used so far. \n\nReplace with: I’m very interested in PC’s Oil-Absorbing Mask. It doesn’t have sulfur, but it’s cheaper, $22 for 4 oz/118 ml, and contains more skin-soothing ingredients. Also won’t dry out as bad bc it’s in a tube, not a jar.\n",

The stinging lasts about ten minutes if I don't wash the lotion off and stops immediately if I do wash it off (which I usually do).  Sometimes it doesn't sting at all, though.\n\nOther products that sometimes sting are the Neutrogena Hydro Gel stuff, which stings like death, and Indeed Hydroluron Gel, which stings slightly.

In my opinion, this stuff is garbage. It has the consistency of chunky super glue and reeks of alcohol. Due to it being primarily alcohol, it evaporates almost instantly on the skin, so applying an even layer over the face is impossible. Has the cosmetic elegance of an industrial solvent. Not a fan.\n\n2) Tretinoin 0.1% Gel - Menarini (India)\n\nIngredients: the label states that the tretinoin is in a \"gel base,\" but the ingredients making up the \"gel base\" aren't listed except for the preservatives methylparaben and propylparaben. I suspect it contains the same gel base as this company's other tretinoin gel strengths, which is composed of PEG-4 olivate, olive oil PEG-7 esters, propylene glycol, silicon oil, caprylic/​capric triglyceride, carbomer, and triethanolamine.\n\nI bought this online. It has the consistency of honey. It easily spreads on the skin and dries down fairly quickly without any stickiness. So far I have not experienced any pilling. I plan on using this product for the forseeable future.",

I recently fell in love with [this sunscreen](https://www.cantabrialabs.com/en/products/heliocare-color-gelocream-spf-50/) but have a labeling question: My novice understanding of how sunscreen protection is labeled across the pond is that UVA must be at least 1/3 of the labeled SPF for them to advertise UVA protection. I noticed that this package says \"broad spectrum\" but doesn't have the little circle around the UVA letters that I typically see to signify UVA of at least SPF/3. Can anyone help me decode what this labeling means? Can I assume that this product has UVA protection <SPF/3? \n\nI know we can't infer SPF/PPD/UVAPF from presence of filters alone, but in case it's helpful this sunscreen contains Tinosorb S (Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine) as the highest sunscreen ingredient on the inci and also contains Uvasorb HEB  and avobenzone, all of which I believe cover at least part of the UVA spectrum.

I am looking to get it cut short in a style similar to this one:  [https://imgur.com/a/8GzdNt2](https://imgur.com/a/8GzdNt2)\n\nThe best styling products for my fine hair have a matte finish - usually matte clays. Unfortunately, I have seborrheic dermatitis, which means that products containing almost any oil will give me dandruff. The only oils that are safe for seborrheic dermatitis are squalane oil, mineral oil, and MCT oil. (Essential oils are fine. Also, see the edit below.)\n\n(For those interested, a lot of great information on seborrheic dermatitis can be found in this blog post [https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) and this ingredient checker [https://www.sezia.co/](https://www.sezia.co/).)\n\nFor example, the beeswax that seems to be present in almost all matte clays is a problem. The closest product I've found that's safe for seborrheic dermatitis is the Aquage Texturizing Wax\n\nIngredient List:\n\nWater (Aqua), Propylene Glycol, Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum), Oleth-5, Dea-Oleth-10 Phosphate, Oleth-20, Otylacrylamide/Acrylates/Butylaminoethyl Methacrylate Copolymer, DEA-Oleth-3 Phosphate, PVP, Fragrance (Parfum), Ascophyllum Nudosum Extract, Chondrus Crispus (Carrageenan) Extract, Gellidiela Acerosa Extract, Hypnea Musciformis Extract, Neptune Kelp Extract, Palmaria Palmata Extract, Sargassum Filipendula Extract, Undaria Pinnatifida Extract, Sorbitol, Cholesteryl Oleyl Carbonate, Cholesteryl Chloride, Cholesteryl Nonanoate, Aminomethyl Propanol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Mica, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Blue 1 (CI42090).\n\nbut this product still adds too much shine for my hair. (Also can anyone tell me which ingredients give the product hold??)\n\n\\*I am wondering if it is possible to make the product I'm looking for myself. In short, the parameters are:\n\n1. matte finish\n2. medium-strong hold\n3. Passes the ingredient checker here ([https://www.sezia.co/](https://www.sezia.co/)) - in particular, practically no oils (that means no beeswax) besides squalane oil, mineral oil, and MCT oil. (Essential oils are fine.)\n\nAny other suggestions or pieces of advice are welcome.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: I just realized that Carnauba Wax and Ozokerite Wax look to be safe for seborrheic dermatitis & may be able to provide hold. (As used in this product: [https://www.imperialbarberproducts.com/shop/hair/matte-pomade-paste/](https://www.imperialbarberproducts.com/shop/hair/matte-pomade-paste/).) Carnauba wax is safe because it contains fatty acids in the C26-30 range and the fungus causing seborrheic dermatitis can only metabolize fatty acids in the C11-24 range.\n\nEdit2: Disregard the previous edit. Carnauba wax is not safe for seborrheic derrmatitis (but Ozokerite wax is.)",

Or should I just wait and find some vitamin E oil like other posts here report using?",

    "body": "Hello! I just recently bleached my dark brown hair a silver blonde. I went to a fabulous salon that did a great job. My hair stylist suggested Clairol Shimmer Lights to maintain my silvery locks. After my first shampoo and condition I broke out in major hives all over my body (I\"m an idiot and took a bath letting my body marinade in the chemicals)\nWent to the dermatologist who put me on prednisone and benedryl. Things were looking up until I decided to condition my hair with the SAME conditioner (this time in the shower). My hives had dissipated right before the shower and up until this point I had no idea what was causing the hives. Now I know.. It's something in the shampoo. Here's the twist: I need to use a purple toning conditioner in the future because it does such a great job of maintaining my hair. There are a few out there that I'm willing to try but not until I find out the specific ingredient in the Shimmer Lights that causes my hives. Here's the ingredient list:\nWater/eau, glycol stearate, acetamide mea, stearalknonium chloride, cetyl alcohol, polysorbate 20, hydrolyzed collagen, parfum/fragrance, hydroxyethylcellulose, methylparaben, imidazolidiny urea, propylparaben, phenoxyethanol, ext. violet 2\nI'm THINKING it's the tearalknonium chloride because that seems to break most people out. Are there any major chemicals that you guys see right off the bat that could cause my hives? I'm going to look for a conditioner without said mystery conditioner. I was thinking the DAvines ALCHEMIC CONDITIONER SILVER [Here is ingredient list](http://imgur.com/rdYD9au)\nPlease please please help!!",

It is kind of cool that they would consider reformulating based on the country's regulations than just excluding a product - well, that's my assumption at least.  I've been a bit salty that Neutrogena doesn't say anything about the UVAPF in other countries where that is more normal, besides Japan at least (they label the Sheer Zinc as PA++++).",

I've used it for a year now and my hair seems tired of it, so I tried purchasing some new ones after asking my hair dresser for a suggestion. I've tried Healthy Sexy Hair Soy Moisturizing Shampoo ( which is supposedly sulfate free and has argon oil in it) and also Paul Mitchell's Super Skinny line. Healthy Sexy Hair made my hair feel strawlike and Paul Mitchell's made it oily within a day, and feels almost waxy when it's drying. \n\n\nI've never dyed or permed my hair and have med-course and straight-wavy hair. I'm half Cambodian, half white, so I'm wondering if my hair chemistry is different from what they make products for. When doing at home masks, my hair seems to like olive oil. Since trying these shampoos, my hair has gotten frizzier, I've noticed new split ends that weren't there before, and is more tangled.

Or the study can be found here: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36377604/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36377604/)\n\n**TL;DR**: Some products that we buy and use every day contain chemicals that have been found to be Endocrine disruptors. Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that can interfere with the normal functioning of the endocrine system, which controls the production of hormones in the body. These chemicals can mimic or block the action of hormones and disrupt the delicate balance of hormones in the body.\n\nEndocrine disruptors can be found in a wide range of products and environments, including:\n\n· Personal care products like cosmetics, soaps, lotions, and deodorants\n\n· Plastics, including food packaging and water bottles\n\n· Pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides used in agriculture\n\n· Industrial chemicals, including heavy metals, phthalates, and bisphenol A (BPA)\n\n· Polluted air, water, and soil\n\nHere are some examples of endocrine disruptors:\n\n· Bisphenol A (BPA)\n\n· Phthalates\n\n· Tributyltin (TBT)\n\n· PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls)\n\n· DDT and other pesticides\n\n· Dioxins and furans\n\nPossible health effects associated with exposure to endocrine disruptors can include: \n\n· Problems with the reproductive system (infertility and decreased sperm count) \n\n· Developmental issues in children (behavioral problems and learning disabilities) \n\n· Cancers\n\nOf course, it depends on the chemical and exposure dose, timing, and person's individual susceptibility.\n\nAs an experiment, I have decided to take some measures to distance myself from harmful chemicals. Hopefully, I will have a more consistent mood and higher energy levels. Of course, some things are out of my control. And I don’t want to dramatically change my lifestyle. So here are some small things I do to limit endocrine disruptor exposer.\n\n· I buy natural soap, shampoo, lotions, and deodorant.\n\n· Natural toothpaste (have not found a non-plastic toothbrush I like, let me know if you do!)\n\n· I bought a metal water bottle with a filter (that is BPA free). I try to use that as much as possible.\n\n· All my tuber ware is glass\n\nAs you can see, I am mainly concerns with products that I put on or in my body. So…\n\n**Here is a long general list of chemicals I try to stay away from (and possible names they go by):** \n\nAluminum (Aluminum chlorohydrate, Aluminum chloride, Aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly, Aluminum hydroxide, Aluminum silicate, Aluminum starch octenylsuccinate, Aluminum sesquichlorohydrate, Alum, Alumina): This chemical is used in many antiperspirants to block sweat glands and reduce sweating. Some studies have suggested that aluminum in deodorants may be absorbed by the skin and potentially contribute to the development of breast cancer.\n\nBHA (butylated hydroxyanisole, Butylhydroxyanisole, 4-methyl-6-tert-butylphenol, 2-tert-Butyl-4-methoxyphenol) - This chemical is a synthetic antioxidant that is used in shampoos to stabilize fragrances and prevent spoilage. it has been shown to mimic hormones in the body and cause cancer.\n\nOxybenzone (Benzophenone-3): This chemical is found in many sunscreen products and has been linked to hormone imbalances and has been classified as a potential endocrine disruptor. \n\nParabens (methylparaben, propylparaben, ethylparaben, butylparaben, isopropylparaben) - These are a type of preservative that are often used in cosmetics and personal care products, to prevent the growth of bacteria and mold. Some studies have suggested that parabens may mimic estrogen in the body and potentially contribute to the development of breast cancer.\n\nPhthalates (DEHP (di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate), DBP (dibutyl phthalate), DEP (diethyl phthalate), DMP (dimethyl phthalate), DIBP (diisobutyl phthalate)) - These chemicals are used to increase the flexibility and durability of products and are commonly found in cosmetics and personal care products, including deodorants. Some studies have suggested that phthalates may disrupt the endocrine system and potentially contribute to the development of health problems such as cancer and reproductive disorders.\n\nPropylene glycol (1,2-propanediol, Methyl ethyl glycol (MEG), Trimethyl glycol, Dowfrost, Glysantin, Neopentyl glycol (NPG)) - This chemical is used as a humectant and moisturizer in shampoos, but it has been linked to endocrine disruption and can have an effect on the level of estrogen.\n\nSulfates (sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate) - These are harsh detergents that can cause skin irritation and dryness, and may also contribute to the development of certain cancers.\n\nSynthetic fragrances (Parfum): This is an antimicrobial chemical that is commonly used in personal care products to reduce bacteria and prevent odor. Some studies have suggested that triclosan may contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance and potentially disrupt the endocrine system.\n\nTriclosan (Irgasan DP 300, Microban, Lexol 300, Ster-Zac, Cloxifenolum) - This antimicrobial chemical has been linked to antibiotic resistance and may also contribute to the development of certain cancers.\n\nIt's important to note that not all studies have *proven* these chemicals as endocrine disruptors. These chemicals were just observed to have negative effects on the body. More research is needed in order to confirm their effects on hormones. This post was meant to discuss **possible** endocrine disruptors and lifestyle changes that can help you circumvent them. I encourage you to do your own research and not take it from me - I’m just a college kid on the internet!\n\n**What to avoid in soap:** \n\n· Sulfates\n\n· Parabens\n\n· Phthalates\n\n· Triclosan\n\n· Synthetic fragrances\n\n**What to avoid in shampoo:**\n\n· Parabens \n\n· Phthalates \n\n· Triclosan \n\n· BHA\n\n· Oxybenzone\n\n· Propylene glycol\n\n**What to avoid in lotion:**\n\n· Parabens\n\n· Phthalates\n\n· Oxybenzone\n\n· Triclosan\n\n· Sulfates\n\n**What to avoid in deodorant:** \n\n· Aluminum\n\n· Parabens\n\n· Phthalates\n\n· Triclosan\n\n**What to avoid in toothpaste:** \n\n· Triclosan\n\n· Sodium lauryl sulfate\n\n· Propylene glycol\n\n· Parabens\n\n**Brands that I would recommend:**\n\nDr. Sasquatch makes quality natural soaps and such, but they are EXPENSIVE.\n\nA more affordable option is Esty! It is a good place to shop around for natural alternatives that are high quality but not the Dr. Sasquatch price tag.\n\nAlso, I have found Native ( [www.nativecos.com](http://www.nativecos.com/)) to be a good middle-range. I need to investigate it more, but the deodorant is 10/10.\n\nI would like to use this post as a way to help each other find good, affordable products that allow us to be as endocrine disruptor free as possible! Thanks!",
