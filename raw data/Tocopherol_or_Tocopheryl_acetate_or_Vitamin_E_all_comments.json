    "body": "I’m a teacher. A kindergarten teacher. And I should know better. \n\nRight now, for some reasons, Kindergarten is on Zoom. I teach from my dining room table, because it is the best space with the best light. Unfortunately, there’s a big sliding glass door in my dining room and it’s not one of those fancy double pane insulating ones, either. Oh, and I removed the curtains months ago because I wanted all that sweet, sweet sunlight to illuminate my sweet, sweet teaching. So it’s kinda cold. My feet are always freezing. Last night I  asked my dear husband to please bring in the space heater from the garage, so I could put it in the dining room to warm my piggies during Zoom Kindergarten. \n\nNow dear husband is really a dear, and I love him and he loves me. But. BUT. Sometimes he’s a bit of a nag and a worrier. And the space heater lives in the garage because he hates it - always concerned that I’m going to burn the house down or the cat will set herself on fire. Still - because he loves me, he brought it in. And because he’s a worrier and a nag, he reminded me this morning to keep it three feet away from furniture, upholstery, and the (currently nonexistent) curtains. And for god’s sake be careful. And because I love him, I waited until he was out of the room before I rolled my eyes, tucked that bad boy under the table, and fired it up. \n\nNow this hot beast cycles on and off. It was getting me nice and toasty while we reviewed rhyming words. My feet stayed warm while we read “The Mitten” and cut out animal pictures. It shut off for a while when we were watching a Scholastic Magazine video about arctic animals, so by the time we finished my tootsies were feeling the Arctic Chill. I pulled the heater in just a little closer. The cat was into it, too. I mean, I take full responsibility but we were in this together. \n\nAbout halfway through Measuring Length With Linking Cubes, I felt like my legs were maybe a wee bit to hot, so I tucked my feet back under my chair. We wrapped up with a Jack Hartmann video “Count to 100 and Exercise” and about an hour ago I waved the kinders off for their asynchronous work time, and got up to make myself some tea. Of COURSE I turned the heater off. I’m careful like that. Plus, the cat was sitting closer than she probably should have. \n\nBut as I sat down with my cuppa, I noticed a stinging sensation just below my right knee. I pulled my pant leg up and kids, I was shook. I have angry red splotches on the front of my leg, and the beginnings of a blister. It is not pretty. And now that I look at it, it kinda hurts, too. \n\nFolks, be careful with your space heaters. It was 3 feet away from anything combustible EXCEPT for me and the cat. She’s fine, but I’m slightly flame-broiled. \n\nAnd I am NOT telling my husband. He would be kind and sympathetic and he might even resist the urge to say “I told you so” but he would never never forget. So I’ll be wearing knee high socks to bed for a while until this heals. I’m an idiot. \n\nTLDR: TIFU (yup, today) by broiling my limb on a heater, and now I have to hide it because I, a grown-ass woman, can’t bear to see my husband’s pitying look and read the reproachful “But I WARNED you!!” in his eyes.\n\nEdit: Sincere thanks to all who showed concern & gave treatment advice. It’s several hours later, and the blister is about the size and shape of a large sunflower seed. I have about 6 similarly sized livid spots below it, and one a little larger. The total amount of injured skin is probably just over a square inch. I’ve treated it with aloe and Vitamin E. \n\nI’m sending the heater back to the garage. The cat will be disappointed.",

    "body": "EDIT: \"Intermittent Fasting\" in the title of this thread should be replaced with \"Intermittent Caloric Restriction\" (creds to: u/Jiend).\n\nI wrote a review on some recent fitness/nutrition papers. I tried my best to write for the layman but also not oversimplifying anything. I originally wrote all of this on an external page which will not be linked here but for those who wish to see it, kindly DM me. Regardless, I hope you all learn something and enjoy reading this. This is all written for educational purposes so any discussion or comments within this thread are very encouraged! Also, if everything is far too wordy for you, I have included TL;DRs for each section.\n\nThe covered topics: The anabolic window, intermittent caloric restriction, protein supplementation, omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants and squat technique (chronological order).\n\nThe first paper that we will cover is a short one by Schoenfeld & Aragon (2018) in which they reviewed the literature on the “anabolic window” for protein intake after training. Short-term studies had conflicting results but a meta-analysis conducted by Schoenfeld, Aragon & Krieger (2013) actually showed a minor benefit to consuming protein immediately after a training bout in terms of muscle hypertrophy. However, after more analysis where they controlled for more variables, they found that this small benefit was more attributed to overall protein intake. This is because some studies did not match for daily protein intake between groups meaning that some groups were having a higher daily protein intake than some other groups (which is generally considered to be more important than intake timing).\n\nThis meta-analysis has what we call a “heterogeneity” in the literature used. This simply means that the papers pooled and analyzed together widely differed in methods, populations and outcomes. So amongst those papers, we could see different protein intakes, training and untrained individuals and some being matched and not matched for daily protein intake. The review highlighted a trial done by Schoenfeld, Aragon, Wilborn, Urbina, Hayward & Krieger (2017) where 21 trained participants exercised 3 times a week for 10 weeks while either being allocated to a group that consumed 25 grams of whey protein immediately before or after a training session. Hypertrophy was similar between groups but the dietary control in the study was questionable as subjects actually ate at a reported calorie intake that was lower than baseline when they were supposed to be bulking.\n\nIt is still up in the air as to whether there is any real benefit but all in all, the authors suggest that if there is any effect, it is likely very small. They also propose that a meal 3–4 hours before a workout is likely good enough as the anabolic response to a meal lasts up to 6 hours (Layman, 2004). 0.4/0.5 g/kg of protein intake pre or post exercise is also advised to be sufficient.\n\n**TL;DR:** There may be some advantage to eating protein immediately after a workout but it may be very small. More rigorous research needs to be conducted. Meals 3–4 hours before training and 0.4/0.5 g/kg of protein pre/post workout may yield adequate results.\n\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\n\nA randomized control trial studying the effects of intermittent caloric restriction (compared to a standard, continuous caloric restriction) on body composition and other bio markers in 136 men and women was recently published. Schübel et al. (2018) split all subjects into 3 groups. The first group did continuous caloric restriction where the daily caloric deficit was around 20%. The second group followed a 5:2 pattern for intermittent caloric restriction in which 2 non-consecutive days of the week consisted of a caloric deficit of 75%. The final group was a control group; a group with no advice to lose body mass.\n\nThe first 12 weeks of the study (intervention phase) had the subjects work closely with dietitians to help follow their allocated diet plans. This included face-to-face sessions as well bi-weekly phone calls. The following 12 weeks (maintenance phase) had no advice from any dietitians but the participants did receive motivational support. In the final 26 weeks (follow-up phase), the subjects received no help whatsoever. Scales and diaries were provided to everyone to help track and follow their diets.\n\nThe primary outcome chosen by the researchers was the expression (taking genetic information and turning it into a product) of 82 genes that are related to the pathophysiology of obesity. Other studied variables include body mass index, blood pressure, waist circumference, body fat, liver fat, diet compliance and quality of life.\n\nDuring the intervention phase, the intermittent caloric restriction group actually lost more body mass (-7.1%) compared to the continuous restriction group (-5.2%) but the p-value was just above significance (p=0.053). This just means that if were to repeat the experiment (assuming there is no difference between interventions and that results are obtained purely by chance), the chance of seeing a more extreme result is above a level that is considered safe. Anyways, after the 50 weeks, the percentage losses were a lot closer, -5.2% vs 4.9% for intermittent caloric restriction and continuous restriction respectively with no statistical significance. For the primary outcomes (gene expression), there was no difference. Between sub-groups like male vs female or overweight vs obese, there were no differences. There were no differences in biomarkers or quality of life.\n\nAn interesting finding was that the intermittent caloric restriction group had the worst compliance in the later weeks. From 49 participants, only 9 were doing 2 energy-restricted days per week at the final week. This may be reflected in the fact that the intermittent caloric restriction group had a higher mass re-gain after week 24 compared to the continuous restriction group. Despite this, there were never any significant differences in any body composition variables at any time point in the study. \n\n**TL;DR:** Intermittent caloric restriction is a valid method for weight loss but there does not seem to be a metabolic advantage from 5:2 intermittent caloric restriction over continuous restriction in overweight individuals. It may be harder to follow the intermittent caloric restriction diet for an extended period of time.\n\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\n\nThe next study was carried out amongst new recruits in the US army while doing their Initial Entry Training (IET). IET is basically where civilians learn the fundamentals of being a soldier and improve their fitness before moving on to become trained soldiers. The programme is known to be quite tough and part of this is due to the documented caloric deficit (~600kcals) that most of the recruits suffer from during training (McAdam, McGinnis, Ory, Young, Frugé, Roberts & Sefton, 2018). McAdam et al. (2018) sought to see if there was an effect from whey protein supplementation on body composition measures (body mass and skin folds) as well as fitness test results amongst 69 male recruits.\n\nThe investigation was done in a double-blinded fashion (both the subjects and the researchers did not know who was getting which intervention) and the intervention lasted 8 weeks. Two servings (293 kcal, 40g protein) of whey protein were given per day (morning and night). Another group received a carbohydrate placebo that was matched for calories. Dietary analysis was done through logs completed by subjects in week 1 and 9 on 3 non-consecutive days.\n\nBoth groups maintained about the same body mass and gained similar amounts of lean mass, however, there was a statistically significant, greater fat loss in the whey protein supplemented group with a large effect size (-4.6kg vs -2.7kg). An effect size is basically a numerical measure on how strong one variable affects another. It is generally categorized into small, medium or large effect sizes. In terms of fitness, the amount of sit-ups done in 2 minutes as well as the 2 mile run timing did not differ between groups despite seeing improvements in both groups. For push-ups, the whey protein group performed 7 more on average in 2 minutes (medium effect size).\n\n\nDespite having regimented meals and meal times, dietary control was an issue with this study. There was a documented ~150 daily kcal intake difference between groups favoring the whey protein group. Therefore, the results may be due to the higher kcal intake rather than the higher protein intake or it may be more of a combination. There was also a great difference between all the subjects in terms of training history as evidenced by the extreme variation in lean mass between recruits at baseline. Training history has an effect on bodily response to protein as well as fitness. Lastly, this study lacks a control group. Regardless of these problems, it is clear that the additional calories ingested by the recruits had a positive effect on their fitness. Perhaps such a dietary approach can be adopted by the U.S. army in the future.\n\n**TL;DR:** The whey protein supplemented group had more body fat loss and higher push-up counts compared to carbohydrate supplemented group consisting of young males. This study, however, contains a few shortcomings in design (no kcal/training history matching).\n\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\n\nA review on omega-3 fatty acid (n-3PUFA) supplementation for sports performance was recently published (Philpott, Witward & Galloway, 2018). From the work of Smith et al. (2011), we see that n-3PUFA supplementation has the potential to increase muscle protein synthesis (MPS) rates in response to protein intake. Muscle protein synthesis is the addition of muscle proteins to muscle, the building blocks of muscle. The main acids of discussion are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and α-linolenic acid (ALA). EPA and DHA is mostly derived from fish oils while ALA is more from plant-based oils like soybean oil. An in-vitro (experiments done in controlled environments like laboratories instead of in living organisms like humans) study by Kamolrat & Gray (2013) found that DHA has no effect on MPS while EPA does. However, these effects on MPS may be redundant because optimal protein intake likely saturates any amelioration in MPS.\n\nUnfortunately, no studies looking at the effects of n-3PUFA supplementation of muscle strength/hypertrophy in the young and athletic exist. Although, there is some evidence suggesting muscle strength/hypertrophy and performance benefits in older men and women(Smith, et al., 2015; Rodacki, et al., 2012). There is theory for n-3PUFAs to help with synthesizing mitochondria. The mitochondria are parts of a cell that have the role of producing energy for our body. However, only one study examined this relationship and while there was a positive correlation, it was conducted in obese subjects (Laiglesia et al., 2016). Therefore, the use of n-3PUFAs for improving endurance is largely still theoretical especially in the athletic population.\n\nThere is also some theory in n-3PUFAs having a positive effect on insulin sensitivity but it is mostly not understood. In a rodent study, increased expression of GLUT4 (protein which transports glucose to muscle, lowering blood glucose) was seen with n-3PUFA supplementation but any of this has yet to be seen in human experiments (Lanza, et al., 2013). Kawabata, Neya, Hamazaki, Watanabe, Kobayashi & Tsuji (2014) found reduced oxygen consumption with n-3PUFA supplementation in untrained, young males. This may be linked to insulin sensitivity theory as increased insulin sensitivity leads to more glycogen in muscles which would displace fat use for energy and less oxygen consumption as a result. This effect may not have such a considerable effect in sporting performance as Hingley, Macartney, Brown, McLennan, & Peoples (2017) found no improvement in time trial times, strength or average power with n-3PUFA use despite an observed reduction in oxygen consumption.\n\nn-3PUFAs have anti-inflammatory properties so it has been proposed that they can support the recovery process after sport/exercise. However, the literature shows equivocal results. Finally, there is interesting discussion as to whether or not n-3PUFAs can aid in the recovery from a concussion as substantial amounts of DHA can be found in the brain. Wang et al. (2013) showed that rats had better cognitive performance with n-3PUFAs compared with rats that had soybean oil. The closest human evidence to all this theory was obtained by Oliver et al. (2016) in which less concentrations of a biomarker for head trauma was seen in American football players who ingested n-3PUFAs.\n\n**TL;DR:** Omega 3 fatty acids have potential to improve muscle strength/hypertrophy, endurance, recovery and concussion recovery but much more evidence is needed before any recommendations can be made.\n\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\n\nDutra, Alex, Mota, Sales, Brown & Bottaro (2018) ran a randomized control study to evaluate the relationship between antioxidants and muscle strength, hypertrophy and fatigue. 42 young women participated in the study and they were separated into 3 groups. The first group ingested 1000mg of vitamin C and 400IU of vitamin E daily. The second group received a placebo and the last group was the control. Everyone followed a periodized training programme consisting of 2 upper body and 2 lower body exercises 2 times per week for 10 weeks.\n\nThere were no reported differences in lower body muscle thickness, fatigue or strength. Furthermore, only the placebo group showed an improvement over control in peak torque and total work done. This indicates that antioxidant supplementation has a negative effect on muscular performance. It is unknown as to why the researchers did not assess the same variables in the upper body. The use of a dynamometer as a measure of strength limits applicability to training as more specific measurements like 1RM bench press or squat would give more realistic results. Finally, there was little to no dietary control within this study.\n\n**TL;DR:** Antioxidant use was detrimental to muscular performance amongst young women.\n\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\n\nComfort, McMahon & Suchomel (2018) undertook a review in search of the optimum squat technique. They defined optimum technique as having the least injury risk, most muscle activation and most carry-over to athletic performance. In regards to safety, they noted that squats are generally safer for the knee ligaments when compared to other leg exercises like leg extensions, however, the strain on the posterior collateral ligament increases with squat depth (Zheng, Fleisig, Escamilla & Barrentine, 1998). Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) strain can also be minimized by keeping the heels on the ground likely due to less tibial displacement (your shinbone moving around) with the heels on the ground (Toutoungi, Lu, Leardini, Catani & O’Connor, 2000).\n\nSome people suggest to keep the knees behind the toes in the squat especially if you want to preserve knee joint health. While this does decrease the knee joint forces by 22%, it increases the hip joint forces by over 1000% and it may have negative effects on the lumbar spine due to a more forward trunk lean (Fry, A. C., Smith, J. C. & Schilling, B. K., 2003). One final point to make on injury risks is that using lighter loads for greater depth will not necessarily decrease the joint stress at the knee because the knee still has to withstand more force from the higher knee flexion angles as a result of increased squat depth.\n\nAs for squat depth, deep squats are better than 1/2 and 1/4 squats for strength and performances like jumping (Weiss, Andrew, Wood, Relyea & Melton, 2000; Hartmann, Wirth, Klusemann, Dalic, Matuschek & Schmidtbleicher, 2012). Part of these results were in conflict with a study done by Rhea et al. (2016) where sprints and jump performances were improved best in the 1/4 squat depth group when compared to those who did 1/2 depth or full depth squats. Bazyler, Sato, Wassinger, Lamont & Stone (2014) discovered that the addition of partial range of motion squats to full-depth squats over 7 weeks led to greater 1 rep-maximums against those who did only full-depth squats in trained men. However, this may simply just have to do with the increased volume as well as increased training intensity for those who did partial squats.\n\nDigressing to muscle activation, smith machine squats have been shown to decrease activation in a couple of the quadriceps muscles (Schwanbeck, Chilibeck & Binsted, 2009). Before continuing, it is important to discuss the relation of electromyography (EMG, recording electrical activity from muscles) to muscle strength/hypertrophy. Correlation with strength has been documented by Hof (1997). The correlation with hypertrophy is not perfect but it is strongly correlated with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for measuring muscle activation and fMRI can adequately forecast muscle hypertrophy (Dickx, D’hooge, Cagnie, Deschepper, Verstraete & Danneels, 2010; Wakahara, Fukutani, Kawakami & Yanai, 2013).\n\nIn an EMG study run by Caterisano et al. (2002), the full squat was found to have had better activation in the glutes compared to parallel or partial squats. A more recent EMG experiment from Bryanton, Kennedy, Carey & Chiu (2012) discovered greater EMG responses in the knee extensors (quadriceps) with deeper squats but not in response to heavier loads. The glutes, however, responded more to heavier loads and deeper squats as well. This suggests the quadriceps can be “isolated” in a sense with low load, deep squats.\n\nFoot rotation has only been reported to have an effect on hip abductor activation (the smaller glute muscles that sit under the gluteus maximus) with external rotation (feet turned out) and this rotation may allow for greater depths to be achieved (Pereira, Leporace, Chagas, Furtado, Praxedes & Batista, 2010). Lastly, an increased stance width (beyond shoulder width) results in more glute and adductor longus (thigh muscle under the quads, moves leg towards body along the lateral plane) activation.\n\nIn the end, the authors recommend a squat with a “natural” stance width / foot rotation, heels on the floor, full depth (115–125 degrees of knee flexion), neutral spine and free movement of the knees (allowed to go over toes).\n\n**TL;DR:** Squats are fine for knee ligaments. Heels on floor = less ACL strain. Knees behind toes cause more hip joint stress. Deep squats generally better. Smith machine may have less activation of relevant muscles, greater depth has better activation, feet rotation does not have much of an effect and wider stance width can activate glutes more.\n\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\n\nBazyler, C.

        "body": "I'm sorry but the study you quoted about Intermittent Fasting, unless I got it wrong, is absolutely not about IF (not the way it is commonly understood at least). Those people are NOT fasting, they are simply on a heavy caloric restriction on those 2 days (75%). Their diet is therefore simply a different kind of ICR, where instead of having a continuously lower caloric intake, they just do 5 days of maintenance eating, and 2 days of heavy dieting.\n\nThat is NOT fasting. If they weren't eating anything for those 2 days, then yeah, they'd be in a fasted state with everything it triggers. But they weren't.\n\nFeel free to correct me if I understood that wrong, but I read that study 1-2 weeks ago when it was posted in r/science and yup, I'm pretty sure the study itself didn't mention IF, it was just talking about ICR (Intermittent Caloric Restriction).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd let's not argue semantics either, when you say Intermittent Fasting, people generally understand it as a classic 16/8 or this kind of diet where you only eat for a limited period of time so that your body enters a state of \"fastedness\" on a regular basis.\n\nAnd on a side note for people who actually are doing IF: [https://www.t-nation.com/diet-fat-loss/5-ways-to-screw-up-intermittent-fasting](https://www.t-nation.com/diet-fat-loss/5-ways-to-screw-up-intermittent-fasting).

I thought she might have gotten injured while jumping off a piece of furniture or playing too hard with the cat, but quickly she couldn’t use both of her back legs. She also didn’t show any signs of being in pain. She was very cuddly and grooming us… \n\nI stayed up all night to care for her and obviously did intense research.\nI came across two options: FBS or E.Cuniculi.\n\nNot having any emergency vet nearby, I had to improvise. A common treatment for FBS is a good dose of pure Vitamin E. Since I make my own skincare I just happened to have top quality Vitamin E on hand. I gave her about 2 peas worth and then gave her water, pellets, spinach and some banana (high in potassium and selenium)\n\nAt 4am, I put her in her kennel with a comfy bedding and this morning when i woke up, she was already 85% better. By the end of the day, (when we took this video) she was back to 100%.\n\nHaving pure vitamin E on hand saved her. Moral of the story: keep pure Vitamin E in your bunny kit. ",

I also took it to the vet and they gave it an anti-inflammatory and fenbendazole incase it had EC. I think with floppy bunny it can be caused by different things. This one was a 8 weeks old so I wondered if it hurt its back or neck playing - then when inflammation went down it came right again. But I don't know. If it ever happens again I will definitely try Vitamin E though.",

Her vet said there was nothing that could be done besides pain meds for arthritis. I did what the vet said, but she didn't seem to me like she was in pain; her legs just couldn't hold her up, and her back end would tip over if she tried to stand. Some days were good, but sometimes it was so bad, she looked more like she was flopping around like a seal, instead of hopping like a bunny. She was clearly depressed that she couldn't run around like she used to and just spent most of her time hiding in a box.\n\nWhen I came across this thread, I had heard of FBS, but I didn't really understand what it was. I figured, what do I have to lose besides a few dollars on vitamin E oil? I gave her one drop with her daily mashed banana treat, and the next day, she was standing up straight. By nighttime, she was a little floppy again, so I gave her two more drops of E with mashed banana the next day. That was two or three days ago, and she's mostly been standing up straight ever since. Even she seems confused at the quick recovery. I'm always worried she's going to go back to being floppy, but even if that happens, I'm so grateful for her good days.\n\nedit a week later: She's still going strong! I do have to keep giving her the drops, or she starts to lose strength again. But she's doing really good.",

    "body": "What's up everyone. This has been a great subreddit to follow for fashion advice so I thought I'd contribute what I could as a dermatologist since I know that many of my friends view skincare as too complicated or cumbersome to worry about so they do nothing. There was a guide about 10 years ago that talked about [some of these things](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/t0yzd/a_guide_to_taking_care_of_your_face/) but I think that this is a bit more comprehensive and aligned with the research and what I discuss with patients daily. I am a practicing dermatologist but I have to make it clear that this post is **strictly for educational purposes** and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. It's also not intended to be a comprehensive review of the topic but I'm going to try to cover the big points. If you have any concerns or questions about your skin health, it's definitely best to see a dermatologist in person.\n\nThese are going to be listed in descending order of importance. You can stop at any stage here and still see tangible benefits for your skin in my opinion. I'm also going to avoid listing specific products to avoid any appearance of conflicts. Make sure that you follow the instructions on the packaging of anything you start.\n\n# 1. SUNSCREEN, SUNSCREEN, SUNSCREEN\n\nI know you've heard this a million times but sunscreen is absolutely THE MOST important thing you can do for your skin. Even if you don't apply to your whole body, using an SPF 30+ sunscreen (for some people with pigmentary disorders like melasma, we will recommend 50+) on your face should be a minimum. Besides causing skin cancers, sunlight is the **#1 factor** causing aging of the skin (wrinkling, pigmentary changes, \"sun spots\"). For a really clear example of this, here is a photo of one-sided photoaging published in the [New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm1104059) in a truck driver (who gets sun on the left side of his face while working). Ideally, you would use a \"physical\" sunscreen that has zinc oxide or titanium dioxide but these can leave white streaks on the skin, especially for darker skin types. If you have this problem you can get \"chemical\" sunscreens that have compounds like avobenzone, octinoxate and oxybenzone. There are also a number of products that are 1/2 and 1/2 which leverage the advantages of both. Physical sunscreens work immediately while you want to apply chemical sunscreens \\~30 minutes before you go out into the sun.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qzji12hcmhra1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=fae4500f6f6ff33b2a72aaf4c06f4eb27fb58654\n\n# 2. Nighttime retinoid\n\nAmong all actives in skincare products, retinoids have by far the most demonstrated efficacy. These products are all derivatives of vitamin A. In addition to improving acne by shrinking sebaceous glands and reducing comedones (blackheads/whiteheads), retinoids [significantly improve the appearance of the skin](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2147/ciia.2006.1.4.327). They do this by increasing cell turnover and stimulating production of collagen/elastin (which increase firmness and general \"youthfulness\"). Almost all retinoids are inactivated by sunlight so the advice is to apply nightly to dry skin then moisturize. They can also be drying and make you more sun sensitive so using sunscreen and a facial moisturizer is important if you're using a retinoid. There are prescription retinoids such as tretinoin which you can get from your PCP or dermatologist as well as OTC products which use retinol (not as potent).\n\n# 3. Moisturizer\n\nA lightweight non-comedogenic (look for that term on the bottle/box) moisturizer in the evening and morning is an important part of taking care of your skin. They help to lock in moisture and restore your skin's barrier, which can also decrease rashes if you're breaking out because of scratching dry skin causing a cycle of inflammation.\n\n# 4. Topical vitamin C\n\nThe last topical product I'll talk about with patients interested in a cosmetic skincare regimen is vitamin C. It has been shown to brighten skin and even skin tone as well as stimulate collagen synthesis but its number one effect is as an antioxidant. As an antioxidant it can help to neutralize free radicals generated by environmental exposures. It does break down when exposed to UV so you need to layer a sunscreen on top to make sure it has an effect.\n\n# 5. Everything else\n\nAs I alluded to earlier, the skincare market is vast and filled with different compounds and actives. Some have proven efficacy, many more do not. In the interest of keeping things simple, I'm sticking to the above for now since they have the most demonstrated efficacy, but if there's interest, I can do a follow-up post in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# A simple regimen incorporating the above would be:\n\n**Morning:** gentle cleanser, vitamin C, moisturizer, sunscreen\n\n**Night:** gentle cleanser, retinoid, moisturizer\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Update\n\nFirst, thank you gentlemen for a Sunday reminder about the power of community. It's been beautiful to see the engagement and advice in the comments. I want to do an update for some of the common questions that came up:\n\n**OK what do I absolutely have to do?**\n\n* If you're going to pick just one thing to use, put on a moisturizer with SPF 30+ before you go out in the morning. Trust me, I get it. In my younger years, I wasn't always consistent with this but it doesn't take much. Make it a part of your morning routine. It adds an extra few seconds but it's like brushing your teeth, and your younger, less wrinkled, and less prone to skin cancer future face will thank you. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\n\n**Sunscreen? Do I have to? It's cloudy out.**\n\n* I recommend that everyone incorporate sunscreen to their morning routine. Like I wrote above. just like you brush your teeth, look at it as a thing you do every day and it becomes much less of a hassle. Yes its ideal to reapply every two hours and that is the American Academy of Dermatology's [recommendation](https://www.aad.org/media/stats-sunscreen) but don't make the perfect the enemy of the good. Use it every morning and if you can find a way to do it more frequently that's even better. Don't use the fact that you don't want to reapply as a reason to not do it at all.\n* I'll avoid getting too far into the weeds of the science but sunlight has UVA AND UVB. UVB does peak at mid-day but UVA is constant ALL day. UV also penetrates clouds. So cloudy days aren't a free pass to skip your sunscreen. UVB is more responsible for sunburns and DNA damage leading to cancer while UVA is more responsible for photoaging and tanning but there is overlap there and UVA can cause skin cancer as well. SPF is actually just a measure of how protective sunscreen is against UVB but look for a BROAD-SPECTRUM sunscreen which means that it will protect against both. To protect against visible light which can worsen hyperpigmentation and some conditions like melasma, use a tinted sunscreen. **The TLDR here is just use sunscreen every day before you go out.**\n\n**What order should I use the products?**\n\n* I'm not aware of any studies that look into this but what I generally advise patients is to apply any prescription medications to clean, dried skin first, then layer other products and finish with moisturizer and sunscreen.\n\n**What specific products do you recommend?**\n\nI wanted to not list specific products because I'm personally a bit suspect of posts that push brands or products but since it's been requested, I'll list as many as I can think of that I've used myself, my patients have reported good results from, or other dermatologists I know use. I'll focus on more affordable brands available in most stores that sell skincare products. A few that are pricier I'm mentioning mainly because of how many dermatologists I know use or recommend them. This is by no means an exhaustive list and I'm sure I will be leaving out some great products.\n\n* Moisturizer\n   * [La Roche-Posay face moisturizer](https://www.laroche-posay.us/our-products/face/face-moisturizer/toleriane-double-repair-face-moisturizer-tolerianedoublerepair.html) \\- I personally like this one because it is hydrating but not too thick\n   * [CeraVe PM facial moisturizing lotion](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/moisturizers/pm-facial-moisturizing-lotion)\n   * [Vanicream daily facial moisturizer](https://www.vanicream.com/product/vanicream-daily-facial-moisturizer)\n   * [Cetaphil daily oil-free moisturizing lotion](https://www.cetaphil.com/us/moisturizers/daily-oil-free-hydrating-lotion/302993889038.html)\n   * [Neutrogena Hydro Boost](https://www.neutrogena.com/products/neutrogena-hydro-boost-water-gel-with-hyaluronic-acid-for-dry-skin/6811047XX.html?) \\- This one's a love it or hate it. It has HA and is a gel rather than a lotion or cream so the texture is off-putting for some people while others love it.\n* Sunscreen\n   * [EltaMD Daily Tinted Broad-Spectrum SPF 40](https://eltamd.com/collections/best-sellers/products/eltamd-uv-daily-tinted-broad-spectrum-spf-40) \\- EltaMD is one of those brands that most dermatologist are familiar with for sunscreen and makes good products. They have a few different lines but this is a best seller. This one has physical and chemical sunscreen compounds. They also make a non-tinted version and other lines if it isn't for you.\n   * [La Roche Posay Anthelios UV Correct](https://www.laroche-posay.us/our-products/sun/face-sunscreen/anthelios-uv-correct-face-sunscreen-spf-70-with-niacinamide-3606000591035.html) \\- Friends of mine use this and they swear by it. It is a chemical sunscreen.\n   * [La Roche-Posay Anthelios Mineral Tinted Sunscreen](https://www.laroche-posay.us/our-products/sun/tinted-sunscreen/anthelios-mineral-tinted-sunscreen-for-face-spf-50-883140020899.html) \\- Also a bit of a love it or hate it quality but for me rubs in very nicely and I like that it is a purely mineral sunscreen.\n   * [Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen](https://supergoop.com/products/unseen-sunscreen) \\- Some of my patients absolutely love this. It is a chemical sunscreen but they love the finish and feel of it.\n   * Others to look into: Cetaphil, CeraVe, TiZO (Titanium dioxide and zinc oxide sunscreens), Neutrogena\n* Vitamin C Serums\n   * [SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic](https://www.skinceuticals.com/skincare/vitamin-c-serums/c-e-ferulic-with-15-l-ascorbic-acid/S17.html) \\- This is very expensive for a daily skincare product and I don't know how necessary it is to go to a product that is this pricy but it is a favorite among dermatologists for themselves and their patients so I felt that I had to include it in the list. Has vitamin E and ferulic acid which are antioxidants too. Be warned that it has an iron-like smell to it.\n   * [Paula's Choice C15 Super Booster](https://www.paulaschoice.com/c15-super-booster/777.html) \\- Same ingredients as SkinCeuticals at a cheaper price. Haven't used it personally but have heard good experiences from others.\n   * [Vichy LiftActiv Vitamin C serum](https://www.vichyusa.com/skin-care/skin-care-product-type/face-serum/liftactiv-vitamin-c-serum-vitamincserum.html) \\- You'll see a trend here. This also has vitamin E and ferulic acid like the Paula's Choice and SkinCeuticals serums. Also more affordable than both of the above.\n   * [La Roche-Posay Vitamin C Serum](https://www.laroche-posay.us/vitamin-c-10-25-pure-vitamin-c-serum-3337875660570.html) \\- Has a more gel-like quality than others but it is more affordable and still has 10% vitamin C.\n   * [The Ordinary Ethylated Ascorbic Acid](https://theordinary.com/en-us/ethylated-ascorbic-acid-15-solution-vitamin-c-100416.html) \\- I recommend this brand for many patients for a variety of OTC agents like azelaic acid too. In my experience, their products are effective and very cost-effective.\n   * A note about vitamin C products: minimize how long you leave the cap open and how much light exposure it gets because the ingredient is prone to oxidation and breakdown when exposed to air and light. They come in oilier serums instead of water-based vehicles because it also breaks down when mixed with water.\n* Gentle Cleansers\n   * [Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser](https://www.cetaphil.com/us/cleansers/gentle-skin-cleanser/302990110227.html) \\- Great and affordable cleanser.\n   * [CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/cleansers/hydrating-facial-cleanser) \\- Another affordable and effective cleanser.\n   * [Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser](https://www.vanicream.com/product/vanicream-facial-cleanser) \\- Also a great cleanser, good for those with sensitive skin.",

Or somehow try to massage the retinoid into the beard?

Any insight and experience for us bearded dudes who are starting to feel our age would be appreciated. \n\nThe guide above is probably good, and seems in line with the info available in the skincare subreddits, but otherwise isn't specific to men and still doesn't address facial hair.

        "body": "i’m not sure if OP has mentioned this elsewhere, or if the medical community has come to a consensus on this yet but some people might find that applying prescription strength retinoids like retin-a/tretinoin directly to the under eye has caused them issues w dry eye and the meibomian gland. again, this is anecdotal but the tretinoin groups here have talked about it and seem to have been told by their doctors or derms that their usage on the under eye is the culprit and their symptoms went away after discontinuing application in that area. I don’t think tret is formulated for under eye or eyelid use but there are OTC retinols that are, so to be on the safe side i would use those within the orbital bone area and use tret more on the forehead, cheek, jaw etc right up to the border where your eye socket starts. My derm said I would still get the benefits even without a direct application since it spreads within the skin. I have thinner skin in general so i also buffer under my eyes and around my nostrils with a thick moisturizer\n\nif anything i said here is heinous, perhaps OP can offer some insight or a different perspective",

Instead, splash some water on your face in the morning, making sure to follow up with moisturiser,  which will have an effect but be less irritating. Cleansing your face is obviously important but it's also inherently damaging to the moisture on your face. Even as someone with acne I saw benefit to washing just once a day. \n\nFor sunscreen: \nCheck what the uv index is where you live. The epa actually has an app that you can quickly check what it is (EPA UV index). For me, I'm ok wearing no sunscreen if it's under 4. You could make an argument for under 3 but that was my judgement call. The majority of the year I don't need sunscreen, which is great as I really don't enjoy wearing it. This will vary a lot depending on where you live though.\nI personally wouldn't mess around with physical sunscreens unless you know chemical sunscreens bother your skin or something, the white cast is really annoying. Try to find the daily sunscreen at trader Joe's if you want an inexpensive but great sunscreen.",

    "body": "Intro:\n\nWhat's up fit fam! A fellow redditor with a similar body type as mine was curious about my progress. I was going to send him some before pics for comparisons, but i decided do it here as there may be more people who will find this helpful. This is my first large post like this so please forgive any formatting errors.\n\nBIO:\n\nBeginning Stats (2000): 13/130ish/5'4 http://imgur.com/rjlDhyE \n\nFreshMen Year HS (2002) 15/155/5'6 http://imgur.com/24bxbQ5\n\nSenior Year HS (2006) : 18/140ish/5'7 http://imgur.com/mjMUuDV\n\nCurrent Stats (2016): 28/150/5'7 http://imgur.com/bDNiGjR\n\nHere's my fitness journey in a nutshell. Started working out around 7th grade so about 12 or 13? I was a very shy awkward Chinese kid in a predominantly  white american school. I also had the mushroom haircut to top it off LoL. I was never bullied and i had the normal amount of friends. My main problem was the females. For the life of me i could just never talk to women. I knew i wasn't good looking and my skinny and soft bod didn't help my confidence. From there i bought my first Muscle & Fitness and my life changed. I always looked up to Bruce Lee so that was the physique that was ingrained in my head. The Abercrombie & Fitch look was very popular at this time. Also Brad Pitt in \"Fight Club\" came out around this time (damn I'm old lmao) and every girl and their grandma was talking about that fight club body. (Shout out to Brad & Angelina LoL) This inspired me to have that type of physique. Abs quickly became my main focus and by far my favorite muscle to train. So it took me about 4-5 years to attain a decent physique. Around junior to senior high school i finally had decent arms and a little 4 pack. http://imgur.com/ON43ytK My nutrition at the time was very simple. Probably the average high school kid diet with more of an emphasis on protein. Honey bunches of oats cereal, trail mix, Met-rx protein bars, turkey sandwhiches, chicken patties from school, 711 hot dogs, Wendy's, McChickens, 20 piece McNuggets, rotisserie chicken, gallons of Gatorade. All i tracked was the protein. Cals were prob around 2500-3000 over 3-4 meals a day. \n\nCurrent Workut Routine: \n\nMon: Chest / Abs https://youtu.be/52u1D07Fieg  (Incline Dumbbell Press 100's)\n\nTues: Back / Legs (Squats) https://youtu.be/zexHKNGy5Zo  (Deadlift 405)\n\nWed:  Abs or Active Rest = Dance (BreakDancing) / Stretching\n\nThurs: Chest / Shoulders / Arms https://youtu.be/ENq8Qv4qp1A (225 Bench)\n\nFri: Abs or Active Rest = Dance / Stretching http://imgur.com/Mj9SYX8 (Baby Freeze)\n\nSat: Bodyweight Workouts / Calisthenics (pull ups, handstands, L sits) http://imgur.com/yutH8wE  (Flag Pole)\n\nSun: Abs or Active Rest = Dance / Stretch (Cheat Day)\n\nThe best Ab exercises (from my experience) : Full hanging leg raises (feet touch whatever you're holding), front levers, L sit holds, dragon flags (Bruce Lee style), and Ab wheel https://youtu.be/Ja4IyrjHFVg (Standing Ab wheel) My fav exercise.\n\nPersonal Records / Bulk: \n\nBench 315 x2 / Deadlift 495 x1 / OHP 225 x1 / Squat 315 x8 : All these Pr's were hit during my last bulk at a bodyweight of (160-165)  I was strong but i just felt slow and sluggish. Had no mobility and always was breathing heavily even when sitting doing nothing. I was just very unhappy. Promised myself to never go back to this weight and try to get stronger from a lower bodyweight if that's possible. I forgot to mention I'm 100% natty haha.\n\n\nhttp://imgur.com/efQM0PI (160-165) Mirror selfie\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Jei6cm3 (160) Incline sitting relaxed\n\nhttp://imgur.com/hCWdFWm (160) Bench 315 sitting relaxed\n\nhttp://imgur.com/B4OsFWT (165) Most muscular pose\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Iwl0mR7 (165) Sitting relaxed\n\nhttp://imgur.com/PAmx1kc Legs / Quads\n\nCurrent Nutrition Protocol: \n\n3000-3500 Cals a day. I say nutrition instead of \"diet\" because I want people to make it a lifestyle. Any muscle you gained, gain it permanently. Any fat you lose, lose it permanently. Currently hovering around 145-150 lbs. Im very active everyday so it allows me to eat more. I literally never have an \"Off\" day where i do absolutely nothing. If I decide to skip gym and dance, I will usually just stretch at home. My stretch sessions can take up to an hour. Typical meal is white basmati rice with a protein...chicken thighs, beef / steak, shirmp, sausage. Goal is to get 150g of protein per day. Then fill the rest of the calories with carbs and fat. Cheat day is every Sunday. What i do is wake up and go dance or do abs at the gym on an empty stomach. Then I'll go for all you can eat sushi or Pho (noodles) somewhere. I don't track protein on Sunday. I also will have chips like Ruffles cheddar sour cream & a whole can of Blue Diamond wasabi almonds while watching football. Also other foods that i normally don't have during the week. Cals are prob the same, It's just that the foods are \"dirty\". It feels great not to track anything.\n\nTypical Day of 3000-3500 cals\n\n(5am) Pre-Breakfast: Black coffee or *sugar free Rockstar, Red Bull, Monster, Redline energy drink (10-20c)\n\n(6am) Breakfast: Whole eggs in coconut oil, peanut butter, 1 cup dry quick oats. Blueberries, Raisins (800c)\n\n(7am) Work: Shipping & Receiving / Loading trucks (constantly moving, good cardio LoL)\n\n(11:30am) Lunch: Chipotle steak bowl with guac (obviously) or footlong from SubWay or **(same as pwo) (800c)\n\n(3pm) Leave Work / Pre Workout: Dunkin Donuts black ice coffee or *(same as pre-breakfast, some sort of caffiene)\n\n(4pm-6pm) Workout / Train\n\n(7pm) Post Workout: **Half cup measured dry basmati rice, 10-12 oz some sort of protein in coconut oil (800c)\n\n(10pm) Dinner: **(same as post workout) (800c)\n\nSnacks: 1 serving almonds = 28 almonds, Muscle Milk shake RTD from gym, Ramen, Cereal (these vary day to day)\n\nSupplements: Absoutely drug free 100% natty. Animal Pak, Chromium, Calcium, fish oil, vitamin E, vitamin C http://imgur.com/fxUNiPY\n\nBefore & Afters: \n\nhttp://imgur.com/jYvgwZ7 (2006) Abs\nhttp://imgur.com/iYHA0dg (2016) Abs\n\nhttp://imgur.com/mjhEkOF (2006) Arms\nhttp://imgur.com/zpc7RzK (2016) Arms\n\nhttp://imgur.com/KDnLyke (2006)\nhttp://imgur.com/ls8SSIA (2016)\n\nhttp://imgur.com/MVHHY7r (2006)\nhttp://imgur.com/hCWdFWm (2015)\n\nConclusion & Things I've Learned:\n\nThe journey you go on through fitness is one hell of a ride let me tell ya. My advice is once you hit your goal weight...just start a maintenance phase and make slow gains for the rest of your life. Enjoy your new body forever.... not just for the next month then back to fatness. None of this dirty bulking crap. I cringe every time people lose a lot of weight then are like ok im done! Time to eat! Just try to add maybe 100 to 200 cals over maintenance and you will improve. I think the most I've ever weighed was prob around the 160 range. You will get stronger on a very small surplus. Just be patient. I was very impatient in the beginning. I wanted abs by next week! Never mind 4 years. Just because you don't have something now... doesn't mean you won't ever have it. The only thing separating you from abs is a couple hundred ab workouts and a deficit of a couple hundred thousand calories. The only thing separating you from being a doctor is 8-10 years of Med school. Save up 100 grand 10 times and you will be a millionaire. Once you lay it out like this your vision becomes more clear. Anything is possible. This is the logic i came up with. I used to tell myself i don't have abs \"yet\". I don't have a driver license \"yet\". I don't have a girlfriend \"yet\". As long as i knew i would be there one day that's all that mattered. There's always a future version of yourself that is depending on your actions right now. In 2 years i will be 30. That scares the shit out of me LoL. My 30 year old self is depending on the actions i make today. Procrastination is a dream killer guys. Never put things off. DO IT NOW and you'll love yourself for it. ALL THIS WILL PAY OFF ONE DAY. If you're just starting out just remember to love the process. Focus on what you're working for while enjoying working for it. There's a quote... success is just a bunch of small victories. Increasing your PR on bench by 10 lbs. It's not that much. But knowing you have never done that much in your entire life...that's a special feeling that's hard to describe. Whatever your goal is just remember that YOU WILL get there. Probably not by tomorrow. Unlikely by next week. Maybe by next month? Who knows. Who cares. All that matters is you got 1 day closer. Closer then you were 24 hrs ago. It's inevitable as long as you keep progressing pound by pound, day by day. That moment you finally take action is a win. Progress is victory. Achievement is success! You will be there one day I promise!\n\nEdit 1: \n\nWhat's up fam! Wow you guys are amazing. I'm currently at work right now about to grab the Chipotle lunch meal. I sit on this thread everyday soaking up info from you guys, and to see my journey help you in any way....means the world...extremely humbling. I'm going to edit in time stamps to the typical day to make it more clear after a brief skim through comments. Also i want to add my freshmen year high school pic. I gained a lot of fat from all the extra protein calories i was consuming. I never i mentioned i had a very low self esteem. Borderline depression through my early years. Fitness literally saved my life. http://imgur.com/24bxbQ5 (2002 Freshmen Year HS 14-15)\n\nCurrent Supplements: Yes absoutely drug free! 100% natty haha: Animal Pak, vitamin C, vitamin D vitamin E, fish oil, chromium, calcium, melatonin http://imgur.com/fxUNiPY",

    "body": "Naisipan kong dumaan sa Watsons ngayong araw para bumili ng lotion, dahil paubos na yung ginagamit ko. Nakita ko tong lotion na 'to ng Luxe Organix na naka B1T1 for Php 405, kaya naisipan kong subukan. 2 variant yung binili ko, itong Retinol + Gluta, tsaka yung Niacinamide + Arbutin. \n\nTLDR:\n\nMay microfoaming, malakas ang fragrance, heavier skin feel kumpara sa ibang serum lotions sa Market, mali-mali ang IL, mislabeled dahil imbes na retinol, Retinyl Palmitate ang laman base sa IL. \n\nUnahin muna nating tingnan ang packaging. Sa unang tingin, di nalalayo material sa packaging ng mga serum lotion ng Vaseline. Tho, yung sa Vaseline, rounded yung tabas ng seal ng tube sa both sides, samantalang itong sa LO ay pointed. \n\nSa itsura naman mismo ng laman, off-white na medyo madilaw yung kulay ng lotion. Medyo clumpy din yung itsura pagkalabas nito sa tube, at madali ding mag-break yung emulsion upon skin contact. Malakas yung fragrance nya na dominated ng floral notes. Unang naisip ko nga nung naamoy ko e amoy poon, dahil sa sobrang floral. \n\nMedyo matagal ipahid sa balat, kumpara sa ibang serum lotion na nasubukan ko na. Naka-observe din ako ng microfoaming during application nitong lotion. Ang microfoaming ito yung nagkakaroon ng puti-puting streaks sa balat habang pinapahid ang isang product, kadalasan mga emulsion gaya ng lotion at creams. Ang microfoaming ay dulot ng pagkaka-trap ng air sa product habang ipinapahid sa balat. Kung ikukumpara ko ito sa ibang serum lotion na nagamit ko na (Vaseline Gluta-Hya Serum Burst Lotion, Smoochkins Nia-Arbutin Nano White Serum Lotion), ito yung pinaka heavy ang skin feel. Hindi ko masyadong na-feel yung pagka serum lotion. And lastly naka-experience din ako ng pamumula at pantal sa braso ko after ko gamitin itong lotion na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list. \n\nWater (Aqua), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Myristate, Fragrance, C15-19 Alkane, Stearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Triethanolamine, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Glutathione, Polysorbate 20, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ceramide NP, Mannitol, Pentylene Glycol, CI19140, Phosphatidylcholine, Retinyl Palmitate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Chloride, Polyglyceryl-10,  Citric Acid, Tocopherol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nHindi na talaga nawala ang mga errors sa IL ng mga local products. Di yata talaga uso ipa-check man lang sa regulatory personnel ang IL na ilalagay sa final layout ng packaging bago ang ipa-mass printing. Para sa product na ito, hindi Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol ang tamang INCI name, kung hindi Cetearyl Alcohol. Next, Polyglyceryl-10, what? Incomplete yung ingredient name. Ang daming Polyglyceryl-10 esters na nag eexist, wag nyo na kami paghulain. (Side Note: Ang Polyglyceryl-10 esters ay kadalasang ginagamit as non-ionic emulsifier sa cosmetics.). \n\nPangalawa kong napansin, CI19140. Ang CI19140 ay isang dye na kilala din bilang Tartrazine Yellow or FD&C Yellow #5. Ito yung nagbigay ng medyo madilaw na kulay sa lotion na ito. Konektado ito sa kasunod kong punto. \n\nIkatlo, bakit Retinyl Palmitate ang nakalista dito sa IL? Kaya nyo ba nilagyan ng Yellow #5 ang lotion na ito para magmukhang may retinol, kasi nakakapagdulot ng paninilaw sa mga product ang retinol kapag ihinalo ito? Ngayon, ano ba ang problema kung retinyl palmitate ang nakalagay, imbes na retinol? Ito kasi yun: maliban sa obvious na mislabelling sa product na ito, mas mababa ang potency ng retinyl palmitate kaysa sa retinol. Sa buong retinoid family, ang mga retinyl esters kagaya ng retinyl palmitate ang may pinakamababang potency, dahil kailangan pa nito ng isang extra conversion step (retinyl palmitate -> retinol). Tandaan, ang mga retinoids, kailangang ma-convert into retinoic acid para ma-activate ang retinoic acid receptors natin sa balat at makuha ang benefits. \n\nRetinyl esters -> Retinol -> Retinaldehyde -> Retinoic Acid\n\nKada conversion step, bumababa ang potency ng isang retinoid, kaya sa kaso ng retinyl palmitate, na isang retinyl ester, eto ang may pinakamababang potency. \n\nMay peptides din pala itong lotion na ito: Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9 at Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11.\n\nAng acetyl tetrapeptide-9 ay isang signaling peptide na nagbibigay ng message sa fibroblasts sa ating dermis na magproduce ng collagen (specifically Collagen Type 1) at proteoglycans, na mahalaga para mapanatili ang structure at mapanatiling tight (hindi sagging) ang balat natin.  Nakakatulong din itong mabawasan ang appearance ng fine lines sa mukha, dahil na rin sa stimulation ng collagen at proteoglycan production. \n\nKung ang dermis ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, ang epidermis naman ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-11. Kagaya ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, signaling peptide din ito na nagbibigay ng mensahe sa epidermis na mag-synthesize o magproduce ng Syndecan-1 at Collagen XVII. Kapag mataas ang dalawang ito sa balat, nag-iimprove ang elasticity ng balat. \n\nKaramihan ng mga nabanggit na benepisyo ng dalawang peptides na ito ay base pa lamang sa mga in-vitro studies na naisagawa na. Wala pang gaanong in-vivo clinical studies na lumabas kaya medyo skeptical pa din ako sa mga peptides na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo lastly sa product claims. \n\n* Retinol + Gluta\n\n* Whitening Serum Lotion\n\n* Lightening\n\n* Firming\n\n* Hydrating\n\n* 24 hr Supple Smooth\n\n* 3X Peptide Youth Repair + Hyaluronic Bright + Ceramide Glow\n\nUnang claim pa lang, sablay na. Wala namang retinol tong lotion na 'to. Pinaglololoko ako nitong LO e. \n\nSa claim na lightening at whitening, medyo duda ako. Mukhang glutathione lang ang pwedeng masabi ng brand na ito na skin lightening ingredient. Pero duda ako sa efficacy ng glutathione na makapagpa lighten ng skin topically. Maraming limitations yung mga published studies tungkol sa efficacy ng topically applied gluta, gaya ng mababang bilang ng participants sa studies at sobrang iksi na study period. \n\nSa claim na firming, mukhang inilagay ito gawa nung mga peptides. Sa hydrating claim, meron namang hydrating ingredients (glycerin, hyaluronic acid derivatives, olive oil, Plukenetia Volubilis oil, tsaka Ceramide NP). Same din dun sa mga sumunod na claims, dahil sa presence ng mga nabanggit na ingredients. \n\n\nFinal words:\n\nHindi ako masaya sa nabili kong lotion na 'to. Hindi kasing lightweight at fast absorbing nung iba kong nasubukan na serum lotions. Amoy poon yung fragrance. May microfoaming during application. Nagkapantal ako sa braso. Mali-mali ang IL. Pero yung pinaka disappointing sa lotion na 'to e yung claim na may retinol daw, pero retinyl palmitate lang ang nasa ingredient list. May paglalagay pa ng yellow dye para magmukhang may retinol. Napakalaking red flag para sa akin ang pagmi-mislabel ng product.\n\nAyun lang. Salamat sa pagbabasa. At laging maging mapanuri sa mga binibili at balak nating gamitin na products. \n\n",

Yellow dye appears to have been added to the lotion to give the appearance of fully evolved retinol being an ingredient as retinol usually makes creams look yellow.\n* The peptides used claim to target fine lines and elasticity, but only proven by in-vitro studies (i.e. in controlled lab environments) vs. in-vivo (i.e. on living organisms)\n\nThank you for this in-depth review, skincare\\_chemist19!

    "body": "\nNgayong araw i-rereview ko ang Hikari Ultrawhite Sunscreen. Bago pa na-i-launch yung tinted sunscreen ng same brand, sobrang hype nito sa Tiktok, at marami na ding mga content creators sa Tiktok ang nakapagreview dito. Magbabahagi lamang ako dito ng point of view ko bilang isang cosmetic chemist at titingnan at magkukumento ako sa mga technical na detalye na nakapaloob dito sa produkto na ito. \n\nBago ang lahat, binili ko itong product sa legitimate na distributor ng brand sa Tiktok. Marami na kasi akong napanuod na videos nung CEO ng brand na kung saan sinabi nya na pinepeke daw ang product na ito. Gusto ko lang na lehitimong product ang gagawan ko ng review. Saktong sakto din na fresh batch yung dumating kong order, dahil kita naman sa batch code nito na nitong April 2025 lang ito na-produce. \n\nPagkabukas ko pa lamang ng product, ang unang bumungad sa akin ay ang fragrance nito. May kalakasan ang fragrance nito na may floral at milky scent. Maaring di akma ang produkto na ito sa mga end user na may sensitivity sa mga fragrance. \n\nSunod kong napansin ay yung kulay nito. Makikita nyo sa pic na kulay pink itong product. Mahalaga itong property na ito ng sunscreen kaya balikan ko ito mamaya. \n\nKapag inilagay na sa daliri yung product para sukatin ito bago ipahid sa balat, napansin ko na medyo nagtutubig or nagiging runny. Babalikan ko din ito mamaya pagdating natin sa analysis ng ingredient list nitong product. \n\nKapag ipinahid na ito sa balat, lightweight naman ang texture nito. Madaling ma-blend at walang white cast, na ok para sa moreno kong balat. Wala din akong napansin na pilling o paglilibag during application nitong sunscreen. So far, so good. \n\nNgayon, tumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list:\n\nAqua, Glycerin, Octyl, Methoxycinnamate, Dimethicone, Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Leaf Extract, Hyaluronic Acid, Polypodium Extract, Baicalin (Scutellaria Root Extract), Phenoxyethanol, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Carbomer 940 & Fragrance\n\nKung nabasa nyo na yung previous review ko sa Hikari Premium Sun Perfect Tinted Sunscreen Broad Spectrum, lahat ng typographic errors  at maling INCI name ng ingredient na nasa ingredient list ay nandito din sa Hikari Ultrawhite Sunscreen. Ang kinaibahan lang, yung tinted, may Niacinamide at Vitamin E. \n\nNgayon, balikan natin yung kulay nitong sunscreen na ito. Sa ingredient list, wala akong makita na ingredient na naging dahilan kung bakit naging kulay pink itong sunscreen. Walang colorant na ginamit. Sa mga nakalistang ingredients, walang isa jan ang kulay pink. So kung ano man ang nakakapagpa-pink jan ay hindi nakadeclare. Bakit kaya? \n\nBalikan naman natin yung napansin ko na nagtutubig yung product kapag in-contact na sa daliri. Marami akong nakitang users na sa Tiktok na nagtataka bakit daw watery or nagtutubig yung sunscreen. Dahil yan sa carbomer (ito ang tamang INCI names hindi  Carbomer 940). Ano ba itong carbomer na ito? Itong ingredient na ito, kapag ihinalo sa tubig at inadjust ang pH sa 5-7, pinalalapot nito ang tubig at nagiging gel. Ito gel na ito ay inherently na nagbe-break kapag ito ay napadikit o nalagyan ng ions. And since sagana ang ating balat sa ions (mula sa pawis, at naiiwan sa balat kahit natuyuan na ng pawis), expected talaga na magbe-break yung gel at magtutubig. \n\nNabanggit ko na din lamang na kailangang i-adjust ang pH ng tubig na may carbomer para lumapot, bakit kaya hindi nakalista sa ingredient list yung mga neutralizing agents (halimbawa: sodium hydroxide, triethanolamine) na normal namang ginagamit kapag may carbomer sa formulation? Napansin  ko din ito dun sa tinted version ng sunscreen ng Hikari. \n\nIsa pang napansin ko sa magkaparehong sunscreen ng Hikari, bakit hindi nakalista yung emulsifier na ginamit? Papaanong nabuo itong gel cream na ito kung walang emulsifier? Kasi kung walang emulsifier sa mga sunscreen na binanggit ko, hindi mabubuo at maghihiwalay lang yung water at oil phase ng mga unscreen na yan. Baka naman meron, pero di lang inilista? Kung meron man, dapat nakadeklara yan, alinsunod sa Cosmetic Labelling Requirements ng ASEAN Cosmetic Directive. This applies din dun sa mga nauna kong binanggit (yung nagpapapink dito sa sunscreen, at yung neutralizing agent na ginamit para sa carbomer). Paano kaya to nakalusot sa FDA? \n\nNgayon punta naman tayo sa mga product claims nito na may concern ako:\n\n* UVA/UVB SPF 50 PA++++\n* Non-comodogenic\n* Repairs sun damage\n\nItong sunscreen na ito ay gumagamit ng tatlong UV filters:\n\n* Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (ganito ang tamang INCI name) \n* Zinc Oxide\n* Titanium Dioxide\n\nAng Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate at Titanium Dioxide ay parehong UVB filters, samantalang ang Zinc Oxide naman ay UVA/UVB filter. Ang tanong ko lang, papaanong pumalo ng SPF 50 ang rating nito at may PA++++ rating pa, samantalang mas mababa pa ang concentration ng zinc oxide at titanium dioxide sa phenoxyethanol? Assuming na isinagad sa 1% yung phenoxyethanol, ibig sabihin nito, mababa pa sa 1% yung zinc oxide at titanium dioxide. Papaanong papalo yan ng SPF 50 at magkakaroon ng PA++++ sa ganyang kababang amount? Napapaisip tuloy ako kung SPF tested ba talaga to. May pinakita na bang SPF test result para sa sunscreen na ito, pati na din dun sa tinted? Kasi diba ganun ang uso sa mga local brand owner ng sunscreen, kanya kanyang lapag ng SPF test report as part of their marketing? \n\nDoon naman sa NON-COMODOGENIC, please lang, uso ang mag proof-read bago mag-approve ng packaging layout ha. Kasimple-simple e. \n\nSa claim na \"Repairs sun damage\", bawal yang claim na yan dahil ini-imply na may physiological effect (repair sun damage) ang sunscreen na yan, na dapat wala, dahil iyan ay isang cosmetic product. Yung mga claims na ganyan na may physiological effect e papasok na sa drug category, at hindi na sa cosmetics. Paano kaya nakalusot to sa FDA? \n\nFinal words:\nMula sa formulation, claims, at ingredient list, napansin ko na ang daming problema nitong product na ito (maging yung tinted version nito). Sana naman e ma-review ito ng brand owner para ma-address yung mga punto na nabanggit ko dito. \n\nSa FDA naman, wag naman sana basta-basta approve ng approve ng CPN ng mga cosmetic products ng hindi na-a-assess ng maayos. Kaya bumababa ang kumpiyansa ng mga tao sa locally produced cosmetics e.\n\nAyun lang, maraming salamat sa pagbabasa. ",

    "body": "**Sunscreens for Sensitive Skin at Low Price Point (with Photos!)**\n\nI usually post over on /r/Tretinoin, but the good people of that subreddit have encouraged me to post my reviews in SCA as well, so here we are! I've had a lot of fun trying new sunscreens this summer in the hunt for The Perfect One. \n\nI've been on retinoids (Differin, Adapalene 0.3%, then Tretinoin 0.025%) since March 2018, and have used SPF 50 every single day. I have desert-dry, sensitive skin with minor rosacea (subtype one) and PIE leftover from acne. \n\nMy selection criteria are as follows:\n\n* Low Price Point (I aimed for under $15 per bottle, with two exceptions)\n\n* Easily Accessible (available via drugstores or major online venues, e.g. Amazon, Dokodemo, Yesstyle, Ebay)\n\n* Marketed for Sensitive Skin (this varies by brand)\n\n* At Least SPF 50 (generally regarded as \"good enough\" for most people, even Tret users)\n\n\n**MY METHOD**\n\nI work from home, so I have the luxury of not worrying about sunscreen or makeup in the morning. I cleanse and moisturize, then wait until later in the day to apply my sunscreen. I treated each sunscreen exactly the same: I measured out a half teaspoon, applied on every inch of my face (up to my hairline, down my neck and décolletage, around the back of my neck, on my ears, lips, and eyelids), then reapplied a little extra to the high points of my face. All of these were applied over my morning moisturizers (FAB ultra repair cream, rosehip oil, sometimes Stratia LG).\n\nI don't want a sunscreen that I need to be fussy with or careful to keep out of my eye area. I want something cosmetically elegant that I can glob on everywhere and have it just work.\n\nMy dog and I go on our hour-long walk around 5pm every day, when it's cooler and the UV index is lower (under 5). We live in a hot, humid climate (American South) with temperatures up to 95 degrees and humidity above 50% almost every day. There's always a chance of rain in the summertime. I don't tend to sweat a lot, but my hair does get uproariously frizzy. \n\nI took each of the outdoor photos at the beginning of our walk, after the sunscreen had set but before it could degrade at all. The indoor photos were taken after we got back home and cooled off a bit for lighting comparison (bathroom lighting). I'm particularly interested in how these sunscreens wear, and whether they hold up to heat, sweat, and other environmental factors. Reapplication is part of life, but I also want a sunscreen that pulls its weight!\n\nIf a sunscreen did not work for me, I traded it over to Team Body Sunscreen or gave it away to a friend. I don't believe in waste, and sunscreen is still useful even if it doesn't agree with my face.\n\n[Group Photo of the Whole Squad Together!](https://imgur.com/a/4yr9RG7)\n\n**THE REVIEWS**\n\n**Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Milk Blue Bottle, SPF 50+, PA++++**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Nano Zinc Oxide, Octinoxate, Uvinul A Plus\n\n* Japanese, Alcohol Free, Fragrance Free\n\n* Moisturizing combination liquid sunscreen that contains hydrating ingredients (hyaluronic acid and collagen). It takes a few minutes to dry down and can get a bit messy/drippy, but it’s worth the effort. This sunscreen looks and feels better than any other I’ve tried. I especially like that it cooperates when you apply multiple layers, and it plays nicely when I apply makeup on top. The pink bottle version contains alcohol and brightening ingredients, while the blue one is the better choice for sensitive skin (it's identical to the old gold bottle from 2018). I'm finishing up my tenth bottle and (sadly) do not plan to repurchase. After the streaky UV photos from a couple months ago on SCA, I have some doubts about the protection this product offers, so I'm going to stop using this as my everyday.\n\n* [Photos Here](https://imgur.com/a/wggel4L)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon ($14 for 40 mL) or Dokodemo ($13)\n\n\n**Australian Gold Botanical Tinted Face Sunscreen Lotion, SPF 50, PPD 19.2/PA++++**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide\n\n* American, Reef Safe, Vegan, and Cruelty Free\n\n* Soft, creamy, clay-like mineral/physical sunscreen that dries to a powdery finish. Superpower level of mattifying on oily skin. It is slightly pink-tinted, and provides coverage comparable to a medium foundation (somewhere around Mac NW15 to NW25 if I had to guess). It dries down in 10 minutes, then it’s exercise- and water-resistant for 80 minutes. This one has serious staying power and usually takes a double cleanse (oil or micellar water followed by regular cleanser) to remove completely. It does dry out my lips (see the picture) and can be irritating on my undereye area, especially if I wasn't careful to layer my moisturizers beforehand. Best in this list for outdoor sports or hiking. This is my eighth bottle of this sunscreen, mainly becuase it's sold at my regular grocery store and it's an excellent shade match for my skin tone so I don't need to worry about blending it in.\n\n* I also have the UNTINTED version of this sunscreen, which I've been trying in desperation to use up for over a year. This is the ultimate sunscreen if you want ghost face. When I tried it the first time, my husband asked if I was wearing \"geisha makeup\" (he might have been joking, but my lord was the white cast bad). Try as I might, this does not work for body or face. It's real bad.\n\n* [Photos of the AG Tinted Here](https://imgur.com/a/fHjSGlM)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon ($11 for 89 mL), Walgreens/CVS ($13), or in grocery stores\n\n\n**Canmake Mermaid Skin Gel UV, SPF 50+, PA++++**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Uvinul A Plus, Uvinul MC80, Tinosorb S\n\n* Japanese, Alcohol Free, Fragrance Free, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, and Cruelty Free (not Vegan!)\n\n* This combination sunscreen doubles as a makeup primer and makes you glow! It has a gel texture, is easy to spread around, and dries to a clear, dewy finish with zero white cast and a slightly tacky feel. I waited around a bit and the tackiness did go away after about half an hour. As a highlighter addict, I love that it makes me glow, and it lets me skip the primer step when I put on makeup. When I put makeup on top, it amplifies the colors and gives everything a nice shimmer to it. I usually use an illuminating primer as my base (Missha BB Boomer) but this more than takes its place. I've finished the first bottle, will definitely repurchase, and plan to give bottles to my sisters-in-law as birthday gifts. I only wish the little bottles were bigger!\n\n* [Photos Here](https://imgur.com/a/DWwqBtP)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon ($9 for 40 mL) or Dokodemo ($8)\n\n\n**Amavara Tinted Transparent Mineral Sunscreen, SPF 50 (PA/PPD unknown)**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Non-Nano Zinc Oxide\n\n* American, Reef Safe, Vegan, and Cruelty Free\n\n* Thick, non-greasy sunscreen with the texture of wet clay. This one is mainly included to give the Australian Gold tinted sunscreen a comparison point. It is slightly olive-tinted, while the Australian Gold is cool/pink toned. It dries to a matte finish, and can be slightly drying if you have dry skin. It is water-resistant for 80 minutes. There are several reviews from surfers on the Amazon page that vouch for its staying power. My mom originally bought this for herself, but the shade wasn't a good match for her so she gave it to me... even though we wear the same foundation shade. I'm giving this one away to an olive-toned friend.\n\n* Rather than wearing this on my face, I decided it would be more useful to do [swatches of the AG Untinted, AG Tinted, and this Amavara one](https://imgur.com/a/wE5PuPO)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon: $35 for 70 mL\n\n\n**Sonrei Sea Clearly Translucent Gel Sunscreen SPF 50 (PA/PPD unknown)**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Homosalate, Octocrylene, Octisalate, Avobenzone\n\n* American, Fragrance Free, Alcohol Free, Paraben Free, Reef Safe, Vegan, Gluten Free (Contains Palm Oil as First Ingredient)\n\n* I'll be honest: I bought this when I was drunk. I was browsing Into the Gloss and found an article about [sunscreen for people who don't like sunscreen](https://intothegloss.com/2019/08/clear-sunscreen-gel/). I had never heard of this brand before, but the antioxidant-rich formula caught my eye. It contains Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and Ferulic Acid (the same combo in several top Vitamin C serums), albeit at the end of the ingredients list. If the antioxidants in this product are actually effective, it would be an EXCELLENT morning multitasker and would solve my problem of finding a Vit C product that I actually like using. I reached out to the customer service team to ask about the PA/PPD rating, and received [this email in response](https://imgur.com/a/YNDWOGY) in less than 12 hours. It seems like they're really dedicated to the efficacy of their products and if I decide to repurchase I'll definitely check back to see their new test results.\n\n* The texture of this sunscreen is unlike any of the others on this list. It's thick and difficult to squeeze out of the tube. Once it's out, it looks like apricot jam with texture that feels almost exactly like vaseline. As I worked it into my face it melted and broke down into a thick oil, not unlike olive oil. There was little scent, but it irritated my eyes anyway. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it did indeed dry down completely clear, if a bit uneven, and the greasiness mostly went away. I've included photos of it freshly applied and 20 minutes later when it was dry for comparison. As I walked around outside and sweated, it started to run down my face -- not okay when the UV index is 7! I do not think this one is a good match for me, but I thought of an alternate use for it: It performs beautifully as a brow gel to tame my unruly eyebrows! With the huge bottle I'll have enough to last the rest of my life (or until it expires).\n\n* [Swatch + Photos Outside, Inside/Wet, and Inside/Dry](https://imgur.com/a/E4U7TD9)\n\n* Buy it on the Sonrei website: $25 for 3.4 oz\n\n\n**Purito Centella Green Level Unscented Sun, SPF 50+, PA++++**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Uvinul A, Uvinul T 150\n\n* Korean, Fragrance Free, Alcohol Free, Vegan, Cruelty Free\n\n* 70% water base, hyaluronic acid, and four different types of “green” essences, it works like a moisturizing, calming cream. The “green” ingredients are derived from centella asiatica, a medicinal herb that hydrates, promotes wound healing, treats eczema/dermatitis, and reduces inflammation. There is another version of this product that contains essential oils and fragrance – this unscented one is the \"safer\" version for sensitive skin. This one is frequently compared to the Dear Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence, which I did not include in this review because of the price. \n\n* I noticed a subtle green-correcting effect when I wore this; it helped to calm down redness and make it less noticeable. It's not as pronounced as the Dr Jart+ Tigergrass or Cica products (which are literally green-tinted), but I think it makes a difference. The finish is pearlescent (not shiny, just a nice healthy dewiness) and it works well under makeup. My skin was noticeably calmer, less red, and less reactive, even at the end of a full day of wear. This has become the sunscreen I reach for most often (even more than my beloved Skin Aqua milk!) and I've already repurchased two additional bottles.\n\n* [Photos From Three Days of Wear](https://imgur.com/a/iqwhPgL)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon ($15 for 60 mL), YesStyle ($14), or Jolse ($15)\n\n\n**Purito Comfy Water Sun Block, SPF 50+, PA++++**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Titanium Dioxide, Non-Nano Zinc Oxide\n\n* Korean, Reef Safe, Alcohol Free, Silicone Free, Vegan, Cruelty Free (Contains Essential Oils)\n\n* This is the mineral version of the one directly above. I heard about it from [Gothamista's 2019 mineral sunscreen review video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMbO5RyUkUI). The formula has 70% water, hyaluronic acid, and centella asiatica. That review described it as \"highly hydrating, soothing, and disappears immediately into the skin with a silk, skin-like finish.\" My experience was COMPLETELY different. This was hands-down the most disappointing sunscreen I tried. When I first squeezed it out of the tube, I was hit with strong fragrance. This has orange peel oil, tea tree oil, and lavender oil. It smelled like I walked into a Bath & Body Works aromatherapy sale circa 2008. Eyes watering, I attempted to apply it the usual way (rubbing it in) and found that it wasn't cooperating at all. I switched to patting, which was somehow even worse. It never sank into my skin; instead it balled up and got even drier. The more I worked on it, the worse it got. It was like trying to rub zinc diaper cream into my face. There was no way to achieve anything close to even coverage. I didn't even leave the bathroom, I had to wash it off right away!\n\n* In the interest of full disclosure, my experience runs contrary to every other review I read about this product -- everyone else seems to have no problem getting it to blend in and most describe the scent as \"subtle\" or \"refreshing.\" I ordered this and the Green Level sunscreens from the Purito storefront on Amazon, and received a handful of legit-looking Purito foil samples with my order. I don't think this is a fake, so I think it must be the result of a bad batch. Honestly, this was so disappointing that I'm not going to order the unscented version (newly released in August). If you want to try this out, definitely go for the unscented one!\n\n* [Indoor-Only Photos](https://imgur.com/a/xs51wgk)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon ($15 for 60 mL), YesStyle ($15), or Jolse ($15)\n\n\n**Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish Sun Milk, SPF 50+, PA+++**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide\n\n* Korean, Contains Alcohol\n\n* This physical sunscreen starts as a thick white cream, and the marketing says it dries clear with a matte finish. The alcohol evaporates quickly, making this sunscreen one of the fastest-drying (under a minute). It contains aloe and centella extract (soothing ingredients) to help balance the drying effect of the alcohol. I found that it tended to clump up on the baby hairs on my face and neck, and the white cast only increased as it settled on my face. In one picture I have a lovely white moustache and a streaky white neck, and in another photo there are visible white lines where it creased on my eyelids. In the \"indoor\" photo you can see how ghastly I looked after being outdoors for half an hour. After several hours of wear my skin was dry, red, and not happy. I struggled to use this up on my arms and legs because of the clumping and white cast, but eventually emptied the bottle. Will not repurchase.\n\n* [Photos Here from Two Separate Days](https://imgur.com/a/ILON6wK)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon ($10 for 55 mL) or Jolse ($12, shipping from Korea)\n\n\n**Missha All-Around Safe Block Aqua Sun Gel, SPF 50+, PA+++**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Homosalate, TEA-Salicylate, Escalol 517, Tinosorb S, Amiloxate, Octocrylene\n\n* Korean, Contains Alcohol\n\n* This chemical sunscreen is absolutely invisible on the skin, and you can even double or triple layer it without looking like a zombie. Water- and sweat- resistant, which makes it a good option for outdoor activities. The potential downside is the alcohol content (fifth ingredient) which supposedly evaporates upon application and helps it dry down more quickly, similar to the Etude House one above. This one was extremely irritating for me -- my PIE and rosacea flared up immediately, and the alcohol sting did not abate as I wore it. My skin felt tight and warm until I was able to wash it off. I used this exactly twice, and will not repurchase. I gave this bottle to my husband to keep in his work bag.\n\n* [Photos Here](https://imgur.com/a/L0IY2XQ)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon ($15 for 50 mL), YesStyle ($11), or Jolse ($13)\n\n\n**Walgreens Sensitive Skin Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 (PPD/PA unknown)**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Zinc Oxide, Octocyrlene\n\n* American, Fragrance Free, Oil Free\n\n* This combo sunscreen is extremely cheap (it's a HUGE bottle) and free from oxybenzone and avobenzone -- but that's pretty much all it has going for it. It goes on chalk white, but with a little work it rubs in mostly clear but never dries down completely. My face was shiny and my eyes streaming from the burning feeling on my skin. The label claims it's water resistent for 80 minutes, but it started dissolving just minutes after I went outdoors and started to sweat. As it melted off my face, I looked greasier than ever. I'm also not convinced that the filters (5% zinc, 4% octocrylene) are high enough for this to be effective for us photosensitive folks. I've relegated this one to Team Body Sunscreen, and will not repurchase.\n\n* [Photos Here](https://imgur.com/a/PDKutDh)\n\n* Buy it at Walgreens ($11 for 236 mL or 8 oz) in the U.S. I'm sure there's a CVS generic equivalent product as well.\n\n\n**Vanicream Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 50 (PPD/PA unknown)**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide\n\n* American, Reef Safe, Alcohol Free, Fragrance Free, Lanolin Free, Paraben Free\n\n* When I first started my retinoid routine, my dermatologist told me to go to the drugstore and pick up Vanicream everything. It's her go-to brand for people with sensitive skin, and it's easy to see why. Vanicream is very concerned with avoiding \"harmful chemicals,\" so most of their ingredients lists are short and the products are no-frills. Like any all-mineral American sunscreen, it goes on chalk white and takes a good amount of elbow grease to work into my skin -- \"grease\" being the operative word. The white cast mostly went away, but I was still a little pallid a couple hours later. It leaves me slightly sticky/tacky until it dries completely (takes about 20 minutes) and after that happens it's bulletproof. It claims to be water-resistant for 80 minutes and it is absolutely correct: no amount of rain, tears, or chlorinated water can make this stuff budge. Like the Australian Gold one above, it takes a thorough two-step cleanse to remove at night, and balms/oils perform better than micellar water or makeup remover.\n\n* [Indoor Photos Here](https://imgur.com/a/RuVdbYm) (I didn't make it outside that day!)\n\n* Buy it at Walgreens/CVS/Drugstores ($15 for 113 mL or 4 oz) or Amazon ($17)\n\n\n**TOP PICKS AND RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n**Best for Sensitive or Reactive Skin**: Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Milk Blue Bottle (combination) or Vanicream Sunscreen (mineral)\n\n**Best for Oily Skin**: Australian Gold Botanical Tinted Face Sunscreen Lotion (mineral) or Missha All-Around Safe Block Aqua Sun Gel (chemical)\n\n**Best for Dry Skin**: Purito Centella Green Level Unscented Sun (chemical)\n\n**Best for Under Makeup**: Canmake Mermaid Skin Gel UV (combination)\n\nIf anyone wants additional swatches, comparisons, or whatever -- let me know! I've still got every single one of these in my bathroom waiting to be used up in one way or another. Also, if anyone spots an error or can fill in missing information (such as PA/PPD data) please let me know! I'm happy to edit this post to supplement my impressions.\n\nSide Note: I had to take a longish break in the middle of my testing because of an eczema outbreak on my left cheek and jaw. You can see it in a couple of the photos (kind of looks like a mosquito bite). I stopped all new products and went back to a bare-bones routine, then eventually had to use a mild steroid treatment to clear up the eczema. This doesn't usually happen outside of the winter months, but all's fair in love and skincare.",

If you're hitting your 30s and 40s you'll find this highly relevant to your life.\n\n##Summary\n\n- We lose muscle mass and strength as we age. This is known as sarcopenia\n\n- Muscle loss could begin in our 30s. Genetics and lifestyle play a major factor and there is a lot of inherited individual variability (not everyone is the same!!!).\n\n- There are several reasons why we become weaker: Our nervous system becomes more inefficient, our muscle quality decreases, our anabolic hormone secretion decreases, our bodies develop chronic inflammation and anabolic resistance.\n\n- How to prevent age-related muscle loss: eat more protein – at least 1.2g/kg BW up to 2g+/kg (counter-indication: careful if you have damaged kidneys), strength training with high intensities and volumes, active lifestyle outside the gym, supplement various nutrients like vitamin E, D, and omega-3s (if you are deficient)\n\n- There are also riskier solutions, but for those you have to see your doctor.",

I've long maintained that strength is more important than size and power may be even more important.  \n\nIt seems to me, and you mentioned it, that people train less as they get older because they see muscle loss and strength loss, so they get discouraged.  If the studies were able to account for that drop in effort, I think that the strength drop would be reduced.  Anecdotally you see people picking up strength training late in life and making progress for decades, conversely, people that started in their youth, usually due to sports, peak early and decline as their involvement in sports declines.",

Teammates of mine (wrestling, track) from 35 years ago that are overweight and weak stopped requiring their bodies to do the work and their bodies responded accordingly. I have continued to  lift heavy on occasion and push my current fitness level with sessions of HIIT. I feel/look pretty much the same as I did at 30. (except gray now and more wrinkly)\n\nI guess my point is that we decay because we avoid intensity. Lots of my peers seem to think that going for a slow jog is sufficient to be fit at 55+. I don't believe it is - your body will adapt to the minimum required. \n\nOf course you can't go from semi-sedentary to running hills and heavy lifting. Once you stop doing that stuff it is very. very difficult to dial it back up again without getting hurt. But, if you are a young (under 30) athlete, don't stop asking your body to do more. Keep pushing.",

As i have gotten older ( I am 35 now) my body has changed drastically.  When i swam i was 6,1 170lbs and shredded with endurance and stregth for days. Now at 35 i am 220 but my strength and endurance has changed in shape. My body now responded the best to powerlifting and strong man type training instead of high endurance full body training. I have tried to go back to the type of training i used to do and i just don't respond well to it any more. \n\nAlso more than anything after 25 your metabolism changes and that is where my type of training changed too. To adapt for my slowed metabolism i had to resort to heavy lifting with less reps versus the high reps i used to do. \n\nI would say over time your metabolism and flexibility go down and they force you to re adapt your training for you to still get gains. \n\nI would never have thought i would be able to deadlift 500 and bench 380 in my life but at 35 thats what i am good at",

Excess non-heme brain iron has been associated with neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease. High levels of brain iron can also be seen in normal aging, where they have been correlated with poor cognitive performance.\n\nA key question is whether age-related increases in brain iron and related cognitive declines can be slowed by environmental factors, such as healthy dietary intake. To explore this question, the research team evaluated the relationship between nutritional intake, brain iron and cognitive performance in a group of healthy, older adults between 61 and 86 years old.\n\nThe team was able to address the question using a variety of methods including computer assessments to quantify working memory performance, questionnaires to obtain nutrition information and an in vivo MRI technique called quantitative susceptibility mapping to measure iron concentration in brain tissue.\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458021002104?via%3Dihub",

    "body": "I've copy/pasted this text multiple times now and decided to just make a separate post about it (and I admit I want to be lazy and just post a link instead of repeatedly copy/pasting a comment). Some of you may recognize a good portion of this, but I've added some points because I'm trying to make this post as comprehensive as possible.\n\nIn order to determine whether a product is water-based or silicone-based, you have to look at the ingredients. -Cone/-methicone, and -siloxane words near the top of the list tend to signal a silicone-based product. Water will be at the top of the list for any liquid product because water makes it liquidy. It doesn't mean that a product is water-based. Without water, the product would not be spreadable/blendable. For example:\n\nMAKE UP FOR EVER HD Microperfecting Primer Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Aqua (Water), **Dimethicone**, **Trisiloxane**, PEG-12 **Dimethicone**, **Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone** Crosspolymer, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Squalane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Lauryl PEG/PPG-18/18 Methicone, Phenoxyethanol, Ceteth-10, Laureth-4, Ethylglycerin, Panthenol, Potassium Sorbate, Polysorbate 60, Parfum (Fragrance), Argania Spinosa Extract (Argania Spinosa Kernel Extract), C12-14 Pareth-12, Hydrolyzed Algin, Dodecene, Sorbitan Isostearate, Isostearyl Alcohol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Tromethamine, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. [CI 19140 (Yellow 5 Lake), CI 75470 (Carmine), CI 77007 (Ultramarines), CI 77288 (Chromium Oxide Greens), CI 77289 (Chromium Hydroxide Green), CI 77491 (Iron Oxides), CI 77492 (Iron Oxides), CI 77499 (Iron Oxides), CI 77742 (Manganese Violet), CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide)].\n\nSee the bold words? Definitely silicone-based! Again, the water keeps it a more liquid-y consistency so it's easily spreadable. It doesn't mean that the product is water-based. Particularly with primers, I can always tell because it has that \"silicone\" feeling. Now let's look at a water-based primer:\n\nLaura Mercier Foundation Primer - Oil Free Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Isodecyl Isononanoate, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, C22-20 Alcohols, Squalane, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Esters, Phenoxyethanol, Boron Nitride, Silica, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Allantoin Tocopherol Acetate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hamaelis Viginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Cucumis sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Retinyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Polyamino Sugar Condesate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Chlorphensin, Benzoic Acid, Polysorbate 60, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Saccharomyces/Xylium Black Tea Ferment, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Potassium Sorbate, Green 5 (CI 61570), Yellow 5 (CI 19140).\n\nSee how there are no -cone/-methicone or -siloxane words near the top of the list? That means that it's water-based. This primer does contain dimethicone, which is a silicone, but it's relatively low on the list, which means that it contains a very small amount of silicone (ingredients are typically listed in order, beginning with what is in there most and ending with what is in there the least). Thus, because this primer contains much more water (and other ingredients) than silicone, it is water-based.\n\nOil-based foundations are exceptionally rare. After much searching, I finally found one: Alexandra de Markoff Countess Isserlyn Cream Makeup (another is NARS Balanced Foundation, which has been discontinued, so I could not find an easily copy/paste-able ingredients list). Let's look at the ingredients:\n\nWater (aqua), **Decyl Oleate**, **Lanolin Oil**, Propylene Glycol, Talc, Isotearic Acid, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetyl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Fragrance (parfum), Emulsifying Wax NF, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Acetylated Lanolin Alcohol, PPG-12-PEG-65 Lanolin Oil, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben. May contain Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI77492, CI 77499, Ultramarines (CI77007)\n\nYes, water is listed as the first ingredient, but that is to keep the product more blendable. The second and third ingredients (in bold) are definitely oils. Phew! You don't know how many ingredients lists I went through to find that! I swear unicorns are easier to find! ANYWAY, they should play well with silicone-based primers. However, this is unlikely to be of concern to you because chances are you're not using an oil-based foundation (if you are using an oil-based foundation, check your closet for a herd of unicorns).\n\nIn general, you want water-based primers with water-based foundations (or tinted moisturizers, BB creams, CC creams, concealer, or any other base products; I'm just going to keep typing \"foundations\" for the sake of brevity), and silicone-based primers with silicone-based foundations. The two different bases (water and silicone) can cause your foundation to pill when layered on top of each other. In particular, using a silicone-based primer with a water-based foundation on top of it often causes the foundation to pill because the primer creates a silicone barrier. When you try to apply a water-based foundation on top of that, the silicone repels the water in the foundation, and the water in the foundation does not absorb properly into your skin, resulting in unevenness.\n\nPlease remember to moisturize well underneath your makeup (and to give your moisturizer time to absorb fully, meaning your skin should no longer have that \"tacky\" feeling that you have right after applying moisturizer). If you use sunscreen (which you should, especially with summer coming up), you need to let that absorb as well. The base of your moisturizer/sunscreen is irrelevant, because if you allow them to absorb completely, they will not affect makeup application at all. If you begin applying primer and foundation before your moisturizer and/or sunscreen has fully absorbed, they can cause your makeup to break up sooner, which is the opposite of what you want.\n\nAlong the same line, your powder is irrelevant to the base of your foundation/primer. There is no such thing as a water-based powder (it then wouldn't be a powder). If your powder isn't working with your foundation/primer and giving you the look that you want, it is not related to the base of your foundation/primer. Also, not everybody needs to use powder on top of their foundation, so if you're not liking the look, you may consider skipping powder altogether.\n\nAdditionally, you only need a small amount of primer for your face (a very thin layer is sufficient... your face should not feel too slippery). Do not apply too much primer. Water-based primers will absorb into your skin better, but silicone-based primers tend to sit on top of it. Using too much will create a slick film that causes your foundation to slide off much sooner. Remember that it is easier to add more (and I recommend that you add more gradually, little by little) than to take primer off of your face. Over time, you'll get used to the amount you need for your face.\n\nWhile pore-filling primers, such as Benefit Porefessional, NYX Pore Filler, and Too Faced Primed and Poreless, are designed specifically to fill in your visible pores, you can also use any primer to do this (though in my experience, they do not do as well at filling in pores as pore-filling primers, and silicone-based primers work best for filling in pores). Just make sure that you tap the primer into your pores rather than rubbing. Tapping gets the product into your pores to fill them in. Rubbing does not do the same (though you can rub afterward to make sure the surface is smoothed out) and will not give you the same pore-filling results.\n\nFinally, please remember that just because you are using two products with the same base, it doesn't necessarily mean that the products will work for you. Not every product works for every person. You may need to experiment to find the right combination for you. I highly recommend asking for samples, as they are a much cheaper (i.e. FREE) method of trying out a product. You can ask for samples of any product that can be sanitized and put in a small sample jar, such as primer and foundation.\n\nI hope this post has been helpful.

I literally cannot stop feeling myself up because my skin is SO SOFT.\n\nApparently TONS of you slather yourselves in body oil or lotion after a shower and have always done that.  (After finding out about this, I did some reddit research and I see all the posts about body oil.)  I never learned  to do this and just  w  o  w.  This is such a game changer.\n\nI'm obsessed now and can't stop wanting to try different oils.\n\nSo far I've tried:\n\n1. Plain old Johnson and Johnson baby oil - I liked this, but still felt a little oily. Also I read something on here about how mineral oil isn't the best.\n2. Neutrogena Light Sesame Oil - I loved the texture of this, but didn't love the scent.  The scent is lovely, it's just not me. I tend to wear vanilla or bright floral, citrus, clean scents and this is a little deeper and muskier.\n3. Aveeno Daily Body Oil Mist with Oat and Jojaba oil - Loved the scent of this but hated the misting bottle.  I'll try it in a different bottle and see if it's better.  Texture was great.\n4. Palmers Skin Therapy - Favorite so far.  Love the scent.  Love the texture.  It soaks in and feels increeedddible.  Love that it has vitamin e.  Only dislike is the shape of the bottle - it's a little hard to squirt when I'm all slippery and oily in the shower.  I'm getting a different bottle to make it easier.\n\nOnes I want to try:\n\n1. Jojaba oil\n2. Sweet almond oil\n3. Vitamin e oil\n4. Osea body oil  (eek! that price!)\n\nMy process - Shower like normal.  Shut off the water and pin up my hair with a clip.  Stay in the shower and slather oil on wet skin (no drying off beforehand).  Once oiled e v e r y w h e r e, step out and rub the oil in until mostly no longer wet.  I usually don't even need a towel after this - my skin just soaks it up.\n\nFor reference, I'm a pasty freckled girl with redish hair and permanently dry skin.  If you are also a pasty white person and did not grow up slathering yourself in oil after a shower, I STRONGLY recommend you try it.  Thank you to all of you who posted suggestions on body oil in past threads.  Super helpful.  Love ya'll!",

    "body": "I used the Aveeno Calm and Restore oat moisturizer for almost a year. Wounderful moisturizer, problem is that it was $15 for one jar when I first bought it, now (because of inflation) it is $25!! $25 for exactly a months supply. It is the most gentle, rich, nonscented gel moisturizer I've ever tried. I will recommend this for EVER if you can afford it.  But that's not worth snot if it's this expensive it really racks up. I'm how to start college and I don't have a job so I need to learn to keep my money. It's time to change.\n\nI search for a cheaper version.  I can't use the Neutrogena hydrogel moisturizers, both types don't moisturize and make my face sensitive. Cetaphil and CeraVe moisturizers make my face look like I have a burn with hot breakouts to boot the next day. Coca butter wouldn't work as much as I wanted on my face. Too much vitamin E. I have skin that changes with the weather every day so it's really important that I have a everyday gel-like moisturizer. If I need to layer up I will with slugging or with multiple different moisturizers/sunscreens, but I need an everyday one.\n\nEventually I find a post on this sub talking about how much they love this gel moisturizer. I join in and sing my praises, but complain about the price. They replied that that they agree and actually like the Aveeno baby eczema therapy moisturizing creme more ! I look it up and it basically had the same ingredients. And since it's for baby's it can't be too harsh so I went and looked for it at my local Walgreens and it was there. $11 for 5 oz compared to $25 for 1.7oz is a HUGE difference for me. It's the same oat infused formula by the same company!!\n\nLet me tell you I've used this for two weeks and this is a exact dupe. The only difference is the smell, in both products there is a slight oat smell. I will say in the Aveeno baby product the oat smell is a little bit more noticeable. The smell goes away after maybe 5 minutes though you can't even notice. I wasn't scared though, it's fragrance free  just like the oat gel moisturizer. Both are a watery gel, that when rubbed out is thin and moisturizing. The Aveeno baby cream has a little bit more shape when taken out of the packaging but rubs out like a serum. The Aveeno gel moisturizer starts out like a thick serum and rubs out nicely. Both take a little bit of product to go a long way. I haven't had a single pimple flare up since I started using the cheaper dupe. Layers wonderfully under sunscreen no pilling or weird shineynsss at all. Perfect for morning and night.\n\nI am so happy I tried this out, I will never buy that $25 moisturizer again because this is actually better. In the colder months I might want to go back, but I'm sure I could get away with layering a thicker moisturizer over this creme. I'll just remember that I did the same thing with the old stuff, nothing different. If you love this moisturizer try out the baby stuff. It is the exact same thing, moisturizes wonderfully. And if you feel like it's not moisturizing enough you won't feel guilty if you want to put it on your body or feet or something because it's $11. That's like two really good sandwiches!",

        "body": "Disregarding emulsifiers, buffers, and preservatives, there are a few key differences for people with more finicky skin—namely the Calm + Restore Oat Gel has no oils where the baby eczema therapy cream does. Some people cannot use oils on face without breaking out or feeding fungal acne. The oat gel also has a longer ingredient list with a few calming plant extracts, beeswax, and emollients added. The baby eczema therapy has oat oil, petrolatum, and ceramide NP where the oat gel does not. Again, this may not make a difference to you, but for others it cannot be considered a dupe.\n\nAll that being said, if you want a middle ground of these two products with no plant oil, I highly recommend the aveeno restorative skin therapy oat repairing cream (recommended by oncologists for “highly distressed” skin).

And i remember a few wks ago, I noticed that the lotion also had a similar thick gel cream consistency, smell, and color, plus I’m pretty sure it contains more colloidal oat and is of course cheaper!\n\nWhen i swatched them side by side though, it is pretty obvious that the body cream is much thicker while the aveeno calm and restore thins out much faster. Plus the body cream is much more siliconey and you definitely “feel” a layer left behind on your skin more. It was too much for my body during the summer, so i cant imagine it feeling comfortable for my face. The ingredient list is also pretty different so its safe to say its a totally different formula.\n\nI agree $25 for 1.7 oz moisturizer is a lot, but I typically stack coupons and end up purchasing it for around $12 which im not mad about. Maybe ill try using the eczema therapy cream on my face during the winter, but the gel cream is definitely more elegant. Tho if the body cream works for your face thats definitely a win since it also has a great ingredients list and is much cheaper!",

    "body": "Ya'll, I’ve been on a long long journey to find the perfect Vitamin C serum for my skin, and after testing/experimenting multiple brands over the past 2 years, I thought I’d share my thoughts. Hopefully, this helps someone else navigating the overwhelming world of Vitamin C serums!\n\nFor context: I have combination skin (oily T-zone, dry cheeks) and my main concerns are brightening, fading dark spots, and preventing premature aging. I’ve used each serum for at least 3 months to give it a fair shot. Here’s my 2 pennies on the matter: \n\n1. Skinceuticals C E Ferulic \n\nPrice: $$$ (Yeah, it’s expensive)\n\nLink: [https://www.skinceuticals.com](https://www.skinceuticals.com) \n\nReview: This is the holy grail of Vitamin C serums, and I totally get why. It’s packed with 15% L-ascorbic acid, Vitamin E, and ferulic acid. I noticed a visible difference in my skin tone within 2 weeks. My dark spots faded, and my complexion looked amaze! \n\nPros: Clinically proven formula, works FAST, perfect for sensitive skin (no irritation). \n\nCons: The price is *ouch* ($182 for 1 oz), the smell is… weird (like hot dog water, but you get used to it). \n\nVerdict: Worth it if you can afford it. I repurchased twice but had to take breaks because of the cost.\n\n2. Drunk Elephant C-Firma Day Serum Price: $$; Link: [https://www.drunkelephant.com](https://www.drunkelephant.com) \n\nReview: This one has a cult following, and I was excited to try it. It contains 15% L-ascorbic acid, ferulic acid, and fruit enzymes. The texture is lightweight and absorbs quickly. \n\nPros: Brightens skin effectively, comes in nice airless packaging to prevent oxidation, smells nice (like a light citrus). \n\nCons: Oxidizes faster than I’d like (turns yellow after a few months), didn’t fade my dark spots as well as Skinceuticals. \n\nVerdict: A good mid-range option, but I wouldn’t repurchase because of the oxidation issue.\n\n3. Paula’s Choice C15 Super Booster Price: $$ Link: [https://www.paulaschoice.com](https://www.paulaschoice.com) Review: This serum has 15% Vitamin C along with hyaluronic acid and peptides. I loved how hydrating it felt perfect for my dry patches. \n\nPros: Lightweight and layers well under makeup, great for hydration and brightening, doesn’t oxidize quickly. \n\nCons: Took longer to see results (about 4-6 weeks), the dropper isn’t the best (hard to control the amount). \n\nVerdict: A solid choice for dry or sensitive skin, but not the most potent for dark spots.\n\n4. The Ordinary Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2% \n\nPrice: $ \n\nLink: [https://www.theordinary.com](https://www.theordinary.com) \n\nReview: This is the most affordable option I tried, and it packs a punch with 23% L-ascorbic acid. However, the texture is gritty and can feel a bit harsh on the skin. \n\nPros: Super affordable ($6.80!), high concentration of Vitamin C, works well for brightening. \n\nCons: The gritty texture is annoying, can cause tingling or irritation (not for sensitive skin). \n\nVerdict: Great for beginners or those on a budget, but not my favorite due to the texture.\n\n5. Maelove The Glow Maker \n\nPrice: $$ \n\nLink: [https://www.maelove.com](https://www.maelove.com) \n\nReview: This serum is often called the “dupe” for Skinceuticals, and I see why. It has 15% L-ascorbic acid, Vitamin E, and ferulic acid at a fraction of the price. \n\nPros: Affordable ($29.95), brightens and evens skin tone effectively, lightweight and absorbs quickly. Cons: Slight tingling sensation (not irritating, but noticeable), doesn’t last as long as Skinceuticals. \n\nVerdict: The best budget-friendly alternative to Skinceuticals. I’ve repurchased this multiple times!\n\n6. Numbuzin No.5 Vitamin Concentrated Serum (Not REALLY Vit C, but has some % in it)\n\nPrice: $$ \n\nLink: [https://www.numbuzin.com](https://www.numbuzin.com) \n\nReview: This is a K-beauty gem that I recently discovered. It has 5% Vitamin C derivatives (gentler than L-ascorbic acid) and is formulated to brighten and improve skin texture. Pros: Gentle on sensitive skin, lightweight and hydrating, gives a natural glow over time. \n\nCons: Lower concentration of Vitamin C means slower results, not as effective for deep dark spots. \n\nVerdict: A great option for sensitive skin or those new to Vitamin C. I’d recommend it for daily use!\n\nTldr:   \nIf money isn’t an issue, Skinceuticals is the clear winner. But if you’re looking for something more affordable, Maelove is an excellent alternative. For hydration, Paula’s Choice is great, and if you’re on a tight budget, The Ordinary gets the job done (just be prepared for the texture). Numbuzin is a fantastic gentle option for sensitive skin or beginners.\n\nLet me know if you’ve tried any of these or have other recommendations! I’m always on the hunt for new serums to try.",

    "body": "Hello all! So I was answering a question on r/AsianBeauty, but I thought maybe it will help some other people out who is dealing with dehydrated skin.\n\nSeveral years ago, I was a dumbass and used vitamin c crystals and mixed with water and used that for my \"vitamin c serum\" and completely overexfoliated my skin/got a chemical burn basically. And before and after that too, I thought exfoliating more was better (using AHA/glycolic acid/lactic acid), and did that everyday, which caused my skin barrier to get reck'd.\n\nIt took me a good year/year-and-a-half to fix my skin. This is what worked for me personally:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what I do is use a very gentle, non-foaming cleanser (I use [LRP Gentle Hydrating](https://www.amazon.com/Roche-Posay-Toleriane-Hydrating-Gentle-Cleanser/dp/B01N7T7JKJ/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538877830&sr=8-1&keywords=la%2Broche%2Bposay%2Bhydrating&th=1)) and while my face is still wet, put on all my hydrating toners and serums. Then go into lotions and creams RIGHT AWAY. Putting on occlusives right away after you wash and put on humectants is super important. Otherwise they can actually dry your skin out more.\n\nWhen my skin was SO full of pain, from extremely dry, tight skin and irritated acne-like cysts everywhere, the only thing that didn’t hurt like a mf was Vanicream. It took me hundreds of dollars and tons of trial and error and babying my skin to get it back to normal. Now I can use AHA, azelaic acid, vitamin c, and even tretinoin and hydroquinone without a problem!!!\n\nNo one or two products fixed my dehydrated skin. It took a TON of research over the years learning which ingredients were the most healing, moisturizing, how they work, etc.. And an entire routine around hydrating and moisturizing as much as possible. \n\n**I always make sure to include ingredients like:** panthenol (derivative of vitamin b5), allantoin, urea (a HUGE factor in getting my skin back to normal), hualuronic acid, glycerin, aloe, colloidal oatmeal, ceramides (important!!!), niacinamide (especially useful for brightening and healing your skin), petroleum (studies show that there is NOTHING out there that reduces transepidermal water loss like petroleum can. I tried to be all \\~natural is better\\~ for a while, but realized it wasn't doing anything to help fix my skin), etc.\n\nAnd not just adding these helped fix my skin, but **leaving things out** was a YUGE step in finally letting my skin heal. I avoid these like the plague: fragrance, natural (essential oils) or synthetic, alcohol anywhere other than sunscreen, sodium lauryl sulfate (sodium LAURETH sulfate is the gentler one, but I avoid that for my face too anyways. Surfectants can be aided to be milder by adding cocamidopropyl betaine), **LAY OFF all acids** until my skin could handle them (interestingly enough, vitamin c serum actually helped my skin hold more water instead of hurting me), and things that I know irritate my skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Things that were/are biggest contributors of keeping my skin moist and hydrated, in no particular order:**\n\n[**Thayers Unscented Alcohol-Free Witch Haze**l](https://www.amazon.com/Thayers-Alcohol-free-Unscented-Witch-12-oz/dp/B0045PCAI6/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871279&sr=8-1&keywords=thayers+unscented) \\- the first thing that goes on my skin after washing. It's just water, aloe, glycerin and witch hazel. It's so simple but idk why my skin likes it so much, lol. It's HG for me.\n\n[**Hadalabo Premium Lotion**](https://www.amazon.com/Hadalabo-Skin-Institute-hyaluronic-solution/dp/B013HHJV0C/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871410&sr=8-1&keywords=hadalabo+premium) \\- HG, must have. **Hyaluronic acids**, urea, algae. This is my one non-negotiable skin care item.\n\n[**Aveeno Eczema Therapy Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Eczema-Therapy-Moisturizing-Sensitive/dp/B003O7IBZC/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871429&sr=8-3&keywords=aveeno%2Beczema&th=1) \\- Super moisturizing. **Colloidal oatmeal**, glycerin, panthenol, petrolatum, a ceramide, dimethicone. (People demonize silicones, but they are not bad ingredients. They are actually really helpful in keeping in moisture, providing slip, and smooth feel for skin and hair. And no, they don't prevent other things from reaching the skin. [More on silicones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXHA7_dBRJY&t=12s).) And [Aveeno Eczema Therapy Night Time Balm](https://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Baby-Nighttime-Colloidal-Dimethicone/dp/B01HI7VY84/ref=sr_1_4_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871429&sr=8-4&keywords=aveeno+eczema) for something heavier but has same ingredients. You can use both.\n\nAnd of course, [**CeraVe Moisturizing Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Cream-Daily-Moisturizer/dp/B00TTD9BRC/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871829&sr=8-3&keywords=cerave+cream) \\- **ceramides, cholesterol, must have skin-identical lipids** that dehydrated skin lacks, hyaluronic acid, petrolatum, dimethicone. This by itself didn't help a whole lot, but with an army of all the different gentle, soothing things, it helped tremendously. There are lots of other \"golden ratio\"/fragrance-free ceramide stuff out there, CeraVe isn't the only one. Some of them are: [Stratia Liquid Gold](https://www.stratiaskin.com/products/liquid-gold), [Meishoku CeraColla gel](https://www.ebay.com/itm/JAPAN-MEISHOKU-CERACOLLA-MOISTURIZER-CREAM-50g-FACE-SKIN-CARE/173351832927?epid=1541103247&hash=item285c930d5f%3Ag%3AjbkAAOSweEFbFoJ-&LH_BIN=1) (they have toners as well), [Superdrug Hydrating Serum](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face-Skin-Care/Face-Serums/Superdrug-Simply-Pure-Hydrating-Serum-50ml/p/342700), [Curel Fragrance-Free lotions](https://www.amazon.com/Cur%C3%A9l-Fragrance-Comforting-Lotion-Sensitive/dp/B00171ETM6?th=1), [Ziaja Med Atopic Dermatitis Regenerating Face Cream](https://yanca.co.uk/product-eng-16098-Ziaja-Med-AD-Atopic-Dermatitis-Regenerating-CREAM-oiling-the-skin-atopic-for-infants-children-and-adults-50ml-5901887027942.html), among many others.\n\n[**CeraVe PM**](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Facial-Moisturizing-Lotion-Lightweight/dp/B079H99466/ref=sr_1_1_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1538872080&sr=1-1&keywords=cerave+pm)\\- same as the cream, but much, much lighter and has 4% **niacinamide** I believe. Niacinamide has been key to helping my dry-ass skin. It does SO many things. Heals and mends, fades spots,etc. etc. I DIY 6% niacinamide and 5% **n-acetyl glucosamine** to boost the niacinamide even further. (Commercial version [Skinlex 10% Niacinamide Serum](https://www.skinlex.com/product/10-niacinamide-serum-60ml/)) But you can find this ingredient in loads of Asian Beauty things and Olay products. Make sure the Olay stuff is fragrance-free if you get them. I like the [Olay Anti-Aging Face Cream](https://www.amazon.com/Olay-Anti-Aging-Moisturizer-Micro-Sculpting-Fragrance-Free/dp/B007M81B4M/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872043&sr=8-3&keywords=olay+fragrance+free) a lot. It really helps refine texture, as well. You can use the CeraVe moisturizing lotion if you for some reason can't tolerate niacinamide, but want something lighter than the cream. Really, any one of CeraVe products is good, they have loads.\n\n[**Aquaphor Healing Ointment**](https://www.amazon.com/Aquaphor-Advanced-Therapy-Ointment-Protectant/dp/B0107QPFBU/ref=sr_1_5_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872144&sr=8-5&keywords=aquaphor) \\- SLUG LIFE is a MUST if you have dehydrated skin. You can use Cerave healing ointment too, but it's redundant if you use the cream or lotion. It's not as occlusive as aquaphor. Aquaphor isn't just a more pricier Vaseline as people suggest. It does have white petrolatum that is oh-so helpful, it also has healing ingredients like panthenol and bisobolol, and also lanolin alcohol and glycerin for humectants.\n\nIf you wanna go a step further and go super saiyan, and you aren't sensitive to lanolin, you can use [**Lasinoh Lanolin**](https://www.target.com/p/lansinoh-hpa-lanolin-tube/-/A-92544) before or after Aquaphor. I can't stand the smell of lanolin, but this one is medical-grade and doesn't have a smell. Lanolin is SUPER helpful because of it's crazy humectant properties but it also acts as an occlusive.\n\nFor just uber **Panthenol** healing, you can get something that stars it as the main star ingredient, like [**DML Forte Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/DML-Forte-Panthenol-4-Ounces/dp/B000052YN6/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872923&sr=8-3&keywords=forte+cream) or [**Timeless Skin Care Vitamin B5 Serum**](https://www.timelessha.com/products/vitamin-b5-serum-1-oz)**.** I don't use the cream anymore, but I do still use the serum. It looks expensive, but if you get the refill sale, it's about $7/oz (this is the price for me in the U.S.). I HIGHLY recommend their [vitamin c, e, ferulic acid serum](https://www.timelessha.com/products/20-vitamin-c-e-ferulic-acid-serum-1-oz) as well when your skin can handle it. It works out to **about $8 an ounce** if you get it during refill sale. It stays good for a while in the fridge. I wrap it in foil to keep more light out and transfer some to a 1 oz dropper bottle for using it in my bathroom. It gives glow to your skin like ***NOTHING ELSE***, and boosts your sunscreen (the antioxidants slow the degradation of sunscreen ingredients) and has helped me with water retention. If you can't get it on refill sale, use the HotandFlashy (I also recommend her Youtube channel) code hf5off to get $5 off. It's a forever coupon code.\n\n**Urea** is **SO, SO,** **SO** helpful for healing dehydrated skin. It's an amazing humectant but also a mild exfoliator if you have a high enough %. [**Eucerin 5% Urea Face Cream**](https://us.feelunique.com/p/eucerin-dry-skin-replenishing-face-cream-night-5-urea-50ml?utm_source=googlebaseus&utm_medium=gen&gclid=eaiaiqobchmi4cftgp3z3qivc39-ch3qhgiheakyaiabegjud_d_bwe&gclsrc=aw.ds&curr=USD) is awesome for this. I don't use that anymore simply because it's more of a hassle to get (not available in the U.S.). My skin looks AMAZING with the [**TriDerma MD Eczema Fast Healing Cream**](https://www.walmart.com/ip/TriDerma-MD-Eczema-Fast-Healing-Face-and-Body-Lotion-with-Bonus-Tube-4-2-oz/21656991) used as a sleeping pack. It's full of skin-healing goodies, like urea (of course), 1.5% Colloidal Oatmeal, aloe, allantoin, arnica extract (a flower thingy that helps heal wounds), beeswax (beeswax and lecithin have great skin-identical components much like ceramides), shea butter, zinc and sodium PCA, and squalane.\n\n**Squalane** is another skin-identical ingredient that you can incorporate into your skin care. I use [this](https://www.timelessha.com/products/squalane-100-pure) one for now, but you can also get the oil at [gardenofwisdom.com](https://gardenofwisdom.com) or [lotioncrafter.com](https://lotioncrafter.com). The GoW one is a little bit more thinner more astringent-feeling to me for some reason than Timeless's.\n\nAnd while you're at it, mix in some other healing oils that help heal skin. Linoleic acid is very important in skin health and wound healing. Oils that tend to be high in these go off faster, however. So you may want to keep them in the fridge. Add in 1% mixed tocopherols (vitamin e) to extend the shelf life of your oils. I like hemp seed, wheatgerm, chamomile/calendula, rosehip oils (can aggravate acne if you're acne-prone). My choice of oils for my facial oil serum: 50% borage seed oil (the best healing), 29% squalane oil, 10% seabuck thorn BERRY oil (very different fatty acid profile to the seed oil), and 10% pomegranate (filled with antioxidants), 1% mixed tocopherols.\n\nSomething that really helps is layering a ton of humectants/watery steps in my routine. You can experiment with this, but right now I'm using the Thayers witch hazel, my vitamin c serum, timeless vitamin b5 serum, [**innisfree aloe gel**](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Innisfree-Aloe-Revital-Soothing-Gel-300ml/302699871225?epid=4002960484&hash=item467a517bf9:g:gy4AAOSwsTday~0A) (unscented, aloe, centella stuff), CosRX Snail, and Hadalabo Premium. I plan to get [Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495) (way cheaper on eBay- like \\~$12).\n\nYou don't **need** a shit load of expensive things to heal dehydrated skin. In fact, a lot of the expensive stuff I see are filled with tons of unnecessary, possibly skin irritating plant extracts and essential oils, super fragranced. Many people go, oh it's fine bc it doesn't irritate my skin, but it's not just \"I'm sensitive to this\" vs \"I'm not\". It's likely that you can develop an allergy or sensitivity to a certain ingredient the longer you use it.  Like how some people develop sensitivity to latex after using eyelash glue with it in it for a while, or people developing sensitivity with lavender after prolonged exposure to the essential oil or something.\n\nAnyway, I hope that was helpful to anyone out there who struggled like I did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: Also, I realized throughout my journey and research, a lot of things that look like \"break outs\", pimples, acne, aren't actually acne. Yeah, you can have acne due to bacteria or fungus or whatever else, but the stuff I'm talking about isn't really acne. Inflammation doesn't just manifest as rashes and thelike. A lot of things that look like acne are actually your skin saying \"no, this is irritating! Get it off me!\", like after you try a new thing for example. But that doesn't mean it will irritate it forever. You can use things that used to irritate your skin after your barrier heals. But some things you may be sensitive to forever..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDITED TO ADD 06/26/2019: AMINO ACIDS are also very important! They make up 40% of our stratum corneum (according to Susan from swiftcraftymoney)! If you want to fix your barrier, you want ingredients like amino acids, sodium PCA, sodium lactate, urea, and sugars like glycerin, fructose, what-have-you! For fatty acids, you want things like linoleic acids, oleic acids, and linolenic acids. Beeswax, lecithin, and lanolin are all great for rebuilding your barrier.\n\nI have not tried this, but The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA is a really good product with all of these NMFs. A pricy one is Paula's Choice Omega+ Complex (the serum, the moisturizer is okay too, but the serum has a lot more skin rebuilding goodies).",

        "body": "hey this post is a few weeks old but hopefully you can help me a bit; im also a dumbass and i recently fucked up my skin with overexfoliation. i thought my skin was sensitive before, but holy cow, it was nothing compared to how its been the past few days. it feels dry and irritated in a way that it's never felt before (i'm typically oily/acne-prone but it seems very dehydrated now)\n\nat the moment, i can't seem to tolerate any sort of fragrance or alcohols (including fatty alcohols). i had a lot of moisturizing steps in my previous routine, but they all had fragrance of some sort,so today i went to square one and tried to start a new routine. i've tried a few cerave lotions before and they didn't work well for me, so today i picked up cetaphil moisturizer (face + body) but that seems to irritate me a bit too. \n\nSo right now, I'm using a hyaluronic acid serum, aquaphor, and carrier oils that are high in linoleic acid (I happened to have black currant seed and grapeseed oils; they've been sitting in the closet for awhile but they smell and feel fine... and I picked up some \\[toasted\\] pumpkin seed oil, but its made for cooking and i'm not sure if there's a noticeable difference between this and others marketed for skin/hair care...)\n\nOH, and what's been the most soothing has been putting honey (mixed with a carrier oil) on my face. I picked up some vegetable glycerin to mix with the honey and I'm going to try that tomorrow. But as I've been trying to research this stuff, I've read some things about how using too much glycerin can make your skin drier? Honestly, I'm so overwhelmed and confused.\n\nI'd love to incorporate more moisture layers into my new routine, because I definitely feel like my moisture barrier is damaged and I'm trying not to freak out. I'm hoping it won't take me super long to recover, since it's really just the past week that I went overboard and hurt my skin. But who knows, maybe I have made my skin upset over time with fragrances and actives over time :/\n\nhow did you go about introducing new products when your issue started? I want to start using the cetaphil moisturizer if possible, and other products with ceramides, urea, etc etc BUT i can't seem to find any that are totally free from the ingredients that seem to be irritating me now... I dont want to buy products that will just sting and irritate me further, but I also don't want to prolong healing by not giving my skin everything it needs?\n\nsorry this is so long ashdsgkhflj thank you if you read this far\n\nEdit/update: I can tolerate the cetaphil Moisturizer now and it helps me feel hydrated, but I’ve started breaking out with some whiteheads, which is atypical for me (usually I get cystic pimples and CCs)",

    "body": "Note: This happened a long time ago...  This isn’t my DH in my other stories but my kids’ father. The SO in this story and I broke up 4 years later. I married DH from the first stories 5.5 years after this story. exDH now. He had a JNM and a JNSM!\n—————————————\n\nI wasn’t aware of NPD disorders, enablers, Just No’s but I wasn’t a doormat either and my MIL still dicked me over. \n\nAt one time I had a JNM, the Taipei Typhoon, and a MIL who seemed super nice but went Just No when I was pregnant. Prior to pregnancy, I got along really well with her. I felt she accepted me and she seemed like a really interesting, educated, and independent woman. \n\nI was having multiples. SO and I decided to move in with her for one year for help to try attachment parenting (they would be preemies) and to save money for our next home. \n\nI sooner learned that MIL was fine on her own but acted differently when you were a long term guest. That independence was a thing of the past. She was a Level 5 clinger and would get her feelings hurt if we didn’t do everything with her. There was the usual BEC and deep burning desire to attend my Dr appts that I successfully defended as private. I’m surprised she didn’t try to shower with me  or rub vitamin E oil on my baby bump. (I’ll will write more about her not leaving us the fuck alone another time if anyone’s interested.) \n\nDue to my shitty ass childhood, I was an introvert who did not feel comfortable with this level of togetherness and I was massively preggers. I looked full term at 4 months and was put on bed rest at 6 months. One of my babies had stopped growing at month 7 and was in distress. \n\nI drew up a birth plan in preparation for my delivery with the usual requests for someone trying to avoid a c-section. My Doula has a big part in my labor strategy. The document was presented to the hospital but what I should have prepared for was my MIL becoming an entitled nightmare.\n\nOne thing I always thought was a huge character flaw of my MIL; she was hella bitchy to “the help” - wait staff, house cleaners, anyone who was in the unfortunate position to serve her. Though, up to my delivery she had treated professionals with respect. \n\nMy induction day comes and we head to the hospital. I was fine with her being in my big hospital room for a little while at first. I did tell my SO that MIL needed to go when shit got real. I viewed my hard labor and delivery as a medical procedure and not a spectator sport. This was discussed previously as well.\n\nThankfully my Doula (who MIL had met a few times) soon arrived and started working with me, helping me relax, rubbing my feet, doing acupressure points, and the breath work coaching. She was a woman maybe 5 years younger than MIL. \n\nNow I know that what happened to MIL when Doula started touching me is the phenomenon known as sudden and severe Cat Butt Face. Her entire head was an ass tight pucker of rage and petulance. \n\nMIL called SO over to talk. I was busy being in labor and stupidly thought SO would manage her. They talk for a long while and MIL left without saying goodbye to me. I honestly didn’t give a shit because labor. \n\nSO asked Doula to step out for a minute so we could talk. He tells me that MIL said that Doula is ruining her special faaaaamily moment by being here. That Doula is a stranger. MIL could be rubbing my feet and helping me. MIL insisted that there is no reason to have Doula in the room. Her concession is that it’s okay if Doula comes over to cook or clean after we all go home. \n\nI tell him that his mother wasn’t supposed to even be in the fucking room. This is not fucking brunch. Remember the birth plan that Doula helped me write that we just submitted yesterday, MoFo? Doula is helping me just say no to fucking unnecessary drugs. MIL’s time to go is now if she can’t leave me the fuck alone. Lots of cursing because, “You did this to me” had set in and he kept talking to me about his mommy.\n\nThis veers hard off into JustNoSO territory because of course, he couldn’t/wouldn’t/didn’t upset his mommy even more. MIL had come back and was being cold and distant - clearly annoyed at Doula. She sat there staring at my crotch.\n\nLabor was getting more intense, it had been hours by now, and they gave me more pitocin. To me, the conversation was over and it didn’t occur to me that as the woman having his babies, right now,  he would pick his mother’s feelings over my needs. But he did.\n\nLabor is an animal brain process and soon MIL was forgotten. I had that haze where you can’t really focus far beyond your own body. Doula was successfully keeping me from freaking out. SO never actually helped me out at all during labor.\n\nEventually a nurse had to help me use the restroom. I had all sorts of wires and monitors stuck to me and an IV to carry. The trip took a while. I get back and settled into bed and ask SO where Doula went. He lied and said she had to go but would be back. \n\nAround 4 pm on the second day I went to the delivery room and MIL was forbidden to come since high risk. \n\nSO tells me in the recovery room that while I was in the bathroom MIL fired Doula, in a mean way, after unloading on her about how useless she was. She did the thing she did to waiters to my Doula. SO didn’t defend Doula so she left. She would not return my calls later.\n\nDelivery and recovery story soon....\n\nEdited an probably still has mistakes.",

    "body": "TLDR; La Roche Posay and Brush on Block were my top picks!\n\nAfter my family had a scare with melanoma a couple years ago, slathering myself with sunscreen is an every day must! No matter the season, I'm always wearing sunscreen as my base and so I've accumulated a nice collection. I used these four over the last year and thought I'd share my take for anyone else wanting to make sunscreen part of their daily routine. \n\nI live in really cold, dry winters and very hot humid summers. I have sensitive combination skin that is medium olive tone. I probably go half the week wearing makeup and the other half makeup free. \n\nI've based my ratings on things I find important which are: \n\n1. Broad-Spectrum Protection - I need both UVA and UVB protection. \n\n2. Texture & Finish - can this be worn alone or under makeup? how does it pair with makeup? does it pile etc. is it drying or gives moisture or is it greasy?\n\n3. Sensitive Skin Approved - I lean towards formulas that are free from fragrances, alcohol, and other irritants\n\n4. Price and Accessibility - I chose USA brands on purpose since I have to re-up yaer round. And yeah, price matters when I have to wear sunscreen every day\n\n\nSummer Fridays ShadeDrops SPF 30, $36\n6/10 \n\nGrabbed this on a whim while wandering around Sephora recently. It seemed like it might be a good fit for me: broad-spectrum protection, and when I gave it a quick test in-store, the texture was all light and hydrating, without any of that sticky feeling. Plus, it's eco-friendly and seemed to be on the gentler side ingredient-wise, which is a big deal for my sensitive skin. I normally pick up a higher SPF, but some times (especially in winter) I get by with SPF 30. \n\nSo, I did the responsible thing and patch tested it on my face (lessons learned) and bam, welcomed a red itchy patch. Turns out, after a bit of a deep dive, that this isn't exactly unheard of with this product. Super glad I only did a patch test, because I've read about folks who went full face and ended up with major redness. Just goes to show, the higher pricetag doesn't always mean you're getting what's best for your skin\n\nFirst Aid Beauty Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30, $28\n6.5/10\n\nMy hopes were high with its promise of avocado oil and vitamin E—ingredients known for their healing and moisturizing properties. However, the experience fell short of expectations. Despite its appealing ingredient list, the sunscreen felt thick and heavy, a far cry from the lightweight, non-greasy promise often sought in sun protection. This texture issue became particularly evident under makeup, where it failed to blend seamlessly, leading to noticeable pilling. While it didn't match up with my daily wear hopes, especially for those makeup days, it's found a niche spot as my go-to for beach days when I don't totally care if I look a little extra shiney or if there's a little white cast. \n\nSupergoop Everyday Lotion 50 SPF, $24\n7.5/10\nAgreeing with all the sunscrean afficionadoes, it's a lot of hype and not with the pricepoint. Is Supergoop the new Glossier? Good marketing and packaging, but not living up o the hype/ I thinks so! Ok so I thought this was just OK, but there were a few things that made me stop wearing it after one day. #1 thing that will make me stop wearing a sunscreen is if it stings my eyes and this stung my eyes to the point where i had to wash it off. Then I did the face powder trick: washed my face, put this sunscreen on and then immediately powdered the areas around my eyes. this worked ok. stung less, but when I sweated again, it started to sting. The other fail was that it didn't seem to dry on my skin, it was super oily. I'm wondering if this stuff is meant for the beach only and for no make-up days? maybe? And then there was the smell. I am not that sensitive to smells, though I do prefer no-sceent products. This scent was kinda ew? Ayways, I am passing on this one, but if you like Supergoop sunscreens then this vould be a good one for beach days, summertime only\n\nLa Roche-Posay Anthelios 50+ SPF, $36.99 \n8/10\n\nThis seems to be the fan fave/holy grail, so I had really high hopes. It was pretty decent, once I got the hang of it.  Super liquidy and spilled out easily (not a big deal though), which meant it also spread evenly and nicely across my face. There was a slight white cast, which is to be expected for full spectrum (it has zinc). It also has oxybenzone which that is a no for me, now that I know more about this ingredient. I will say that it felt \"\"light greasy\"\" and I broke out just a little after using it for a week. When I spread it on my face, I waited to see if it would dry on my face giving it a ten minute timer, but it stayed still kinda slightly greasy - not too greasy, but perma dewy? if taht makes sense? if you have super duper dry skin, this could be for you. Maybe the oily finish is for dry skin? I didn't hate, but i didn't find myself reaching for it\n\nBrush on Block Sheer Genius SPF 50, $36\n9/10\n\nFound this one while traveling and after some quick research while standing in the store I thought I'd pick it up, Could this also be an undercover fan fave? This might be my unicorn, I love the pricepoint, slightly less expensive than sephora brands and the bottles lasts. Let's go through it: NO STING - this is my #1 litmus test. I even did a run (and sweated) and it did not sting. The  second priority for me is just overall texture and this stuff was is pretty perfect. At first I wasn't sure befcause it came out white, applied white, but then it dissapeared and went clear. ON top of that, i didn't feel like i was \"\"wearing\"\" another layer. it was really comfrotable. No white cast (even thlugh it has zinc), layered really nicely with my makeup. It's SPF + moisture, i see there is some squalene in there, so it's kind of a unique stand alone product, as in, I put this on and did not need moisturizer or primer. It's like it was a primer on it's own too? I didn't get tanned (woot), skin felt really comfortable, no scent. Found myself reaching for this every day and it ding ding, it's the winner (with the \"\"what am i reaching for in the AM\"\" litmus test)",

Glow Oil SPF 50](https://supergoop.com/products/sun-defying-sunscreen-oil-with-meadowfoam) (5.0 oz for $38.00 / $7.60 per oz). I am not planning on trying either of these myself, so if you have tried these, please share your thoughts for us!\n\n# 🌞 Review\n\n**PROCESS**\n\nI have been using both of these intermittently for the past couple of weeks. I also did a direct comparison one day where I applied Supergoop on one half of my face and Kroger on the other.\n\nI did not purchase a full size of the Supergoop, so feel free to take this as my \"initial impressions\", as the Supergoop sample size only provides about 8 applications using the 1/4 tsp rule. (If they're available, I prefer to try sample sizes of the products I'm considering before committing the counter space and the ca$h to full-size versions.)\n\n**Relevant about me and my skin:** Female, late 20s. Relatively pale. My skin is oily but loves hydration. No known ingredient sensitivities, skin is relatively clear except for occasional hormone-induced breakouts. Other skin concerns: mild redness, managing pore appearance and sebaceous filaments, fading hyperpigmentation and previous sun damage.\n\n**Since this is a sunscreen review, my current morning routine may be helpful, too:** Rinse face with water, pat dry. Timeless Vit C 20% + E + Ferulic. The Ordinary Caffeine 5% + EGCG under eyes. Hydrating serum if the mood strikes. Sunscreen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**APPLICATION**\n\n* **See photos:** [Packaging](https://i.imgur.com/mo8jhT5.jpg) | [Dispensed onto my arm](https://i.imgur.com/8clDq0R.jpg)\n* The Kroger formula does appear darker when coming out of the tube, but it is not actually tinted. Both sunscreens do not have any noticeable tint upon application for me.\n* They both have a similar gel texture, similar to...buttery Neosporin, in a non-gross way? The gel is not runny or goopy, but quite easy to spread as it glides easily over the skin. No issues with pilling, even upon reapplication. Easy to apply the recommended 2mg/cm^(2) \"dosage\" (\\~1/4 tsp).\n* Both make my hands feel weirdly greasy after applying for a bit, even after washing.\n* Neither have a distinct scent to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LOOK & FEEL**\n\n* **See photos:** [Immediately after application](https://i.imgur.com/safMkZr.jpg) | [10 minutes after application](https://i.imgur.com/ydlue5M.jpg)\n* Once applied, both the Supergoop and Kroger look essentially identical on my face. No whitecast whatsoever. Both have the signature \"velvety finish\" that Supergoop is known for, which is neither dewy/shiny nor mattifying.\n* Thanks to the silicones in these formulas, both provide a very slight smoothing effect. The Unseen has been described as [similar to the Smashbox Photo Finish Primer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sephora/comments/ghcihy/supergoop_unseen_sunscreen_spf_40_reviews_and_the/). I rarely wear a full face, so I did not test how these wear under makeup.\n* They both feel very soft and almost weightless on the skin. Both are quite moisturizing, which I appreciate since I prefer to have sunscreen double as my AM moisturizer.\n* Despite feeling quite light on my face, I find that both sunscreens take an annoyingly long time to \"set\" after application. The Kroger sunscreen dries more slowly than the Supergoop and feels a bit heavier to the touch, which to me is the only notable difference between the two. (Weirdly, this isn't noticeable in terms of how the sunscreen feels on my face – I'm only aware of it when I happen to touch my face with my hands, if that makes sense.) The Supergoop seems to finally mostly set after about two hours; the Kroger takes about three. In the meantime, it seems like there is still some malleability to the sunscreen finish. I wonder how susceptible the coverage is to getting disrupted up if I happen to touch my face.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PROTECTION & PERFORMANCE**\n\nPlease take the following with a grain of salt, as these are just my personal musings. I'm not a dermatologist or cosmetic chemist, I'm just a random person on the internet with skin.\n\n**UVA**\n\n* Since these are both American sunscreens, we already know that UVA protection is relatively lacking due to the abysmal selection of FDA-approved sunscreen filters. (For those not familiar with UVA protection ins-and-outs, [I enjoy this breakdown from LabMuffin](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-feature-why-you-should-protect-yourself-from-uva/).)\n* I emailed Supergoop and Kroger last week requesting current PPD ratings and both said they couldn't provide this info. Here's [Supergoop's response](https://i.imgur.com/KsL1tIA.png) and [Kroger's response](https://i.imgur.com/C33WWG4.png). \n* Supergoop [lists the Unseen as PA+++](https://thebrightside.supergoop.com/pa-sunscreen-rating-system/), so we can assume the PPD is somewhere [between 8-16](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-feature-why-you-should-protect-yourself-from-uva/#:~:text=PA%20is%20a%20similar%20concept,2number%20of%20plus%20signs.). They did actually provide PPD ratings at one point – [per this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/brih2q/i_emailed_supergoop_about_ppd_ratings_sun_care/) from May 2019 that lists Supergoop! Unseen as PPD 9.9 – but this was pre-formulation (that removed octinoxate at the end of 2019).\n* Without confirmation from Kroger, I am assuming the PA rating for the Invisible Gel is similar to the Unseen Sunscreen. Both contain [avobenzone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyl-methoxydibenzoylmethane), the only FDA-approved chemical filter that provides proper protection across the entire UVA range, but it is not photostable (degrades quickly with exposure to sunlight). The Kroger Invisible Gel does have a higher concentration of [octocrylene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/octocrylene), which is supposed to help stabilize avobenzone, but I am absolutely *not* qualified whatsoever to say if this actually results in improved UVA protection.\n* For some peeps, PA+++ is far too low of a level for UV protection. I feel like I'm personally in this category at this point in my Great Summer of Sunscreen Experimentation – especially on days that I'm going to be outside for long periods, I want a sunscreen that gives me better overall protection. \n\n**UVB**\n\n* Both sunscreens are SPF 40.\n* I did not notice any visible burning while wearing either sunscreen, but I also didn't use them on days when I was outside during peak sun exposure times.\n\n**Ingredient sensitivities**\n\n* Neither of these sunscreens caused breakouts or irritation, but my skin is not very sensitive in general. For those sensitive to chemical filters or silicones, these may not be ideal picks for you. Both are fragrance-free, however the Kroger does contain [citrus peel oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citrus-aurantium-dulcis-peel-oil), which could also be problematic for some.\n* Those with sensitive eyes may want to exercise caution when applying the Kroger Invisible Gel, as I did experience some minor irritation one day when I had liberally applied close to my eyes and got a bit sweaty. I haven't noticed this much with the Supergoop, but I'm not sure why – it could be because of the formulation differences, because I happened to not apply it as close to my eyes, or because I just simply didn't apply sweat as much on the days I wore the Supergoop.\n\n# 🌞 Conclusion\n\n**I'd recommend the Kroger Invisible Gel as a budget-friendly pick for Americans who currently love or want to try Supergoop! Unseen, but don't want to pay Supergoop prices.**\n\nIf you are willing to compromise just slightly on texture to pay literally *one fifth of the price per ounce*, give the Kroger a try so you can slather yourself in velvety sunscreen without emptying your wallet. For those with sensitivities to chemical filters or silicones, or who don't like the primer-esque texture, this is probably one to skip.\n\nYou're kind of prioritizing cosmetic elegance over higher UVA protection with both options, but this may be somewhat unavoidable for those who don't want to deal with sourcing foreign sunscreens or a [Zuckerberg-esque whitecast](https://www.reddit.com/r/awfuleverything/comments/hu8m7g/mark_zuckerberg_surfboards_in_hawaii_with_way_too/).\n\nIf you're in the US and willing to regularly spend $20 per ounce for a cosmetically elegant sunscreen like Supergoop, it may be worth your time to explore La Roche Posay or EltaMD sunscreens that offer equal elegance and better sun protection for your buck. Or even better, source Asian or European sunscreens to get better broad-spectrum protection.\n\nIf you don't live in the US, I would not recommend either of these sunscreens, as you probably have more easily accessible options at home that fit your criteria for UVA/UVB protection, cosmetic elegance, and/or budget.\n\n**Would I personally repurchase?**\n\nNot planning on it at the moment, given my focus on sunscreens that provide better UVA protection. If I were on a trip and forgot sunscreen or something, I would pick up the Kroger Invisible Gel again, since I know it is excellently priced, easy to apply, and has zero whitecast. Personally, the gel vehicle isn't my fave. I found it annoying that it takes basically eons to set on my face, and the slightly lighter consistency of the Supergoop does not justify the huge price jump for me.",

The oil generally feels nice, like a moisturizing body oil does. I haven't tried the Supergoop! one, so I can't compare them. I'd also add that the oil does have a pretty strong smell. It's not a bad smell-- I actually liked it, but if you're sensitive to fragrance on the body, maybe skip that one. I also don't feel like I would use it on a sunny day while I'm outside. As an everyday sunscreen, I'm happy to use it. I also didn't notice any issues using it on my neck, which has a tendency to turn red if any sort of product touches it ever. \n\nAll fine and good so far, until I realized the next day that I made a rookie mistake and hadn't checked the expiration dates before buying. The oil expires 10/21, the gel 11/21. Took them back to the store just hoping to exchange them... all the bottles there were the same expiration dates. So I just got refunded.\n\n  \nToday I went to a different store and both the oil and gel were in stock. Unfortunately, all the oils still expire 10/21 and most of the gels expired 11/21. I managed to search through and found a gel with a date of 4/22, so I went with that one. I haven't repurchased the oil, but I would like to. \n\n  \nTL;DR: good sunscreens that feel great, but be sure to always check the expiration dates on the sunscreens!",

Once a day simply spray some directly on your piercing, let it sit for a minute or two and then dry with non woven gauze.     A few minutes before your daily shower, spray again. At the end of your shower, rinse the piercing well. Make sure to not let the waterspray hit the piercing directly. Then use the tip or edge of a piece of non woven gauze to soak up any moisture and carefully wipe away softened gunk and dry your piercing. Keep (wet) hair away from your piercings. Other then that keep the piercing dry and exposed to the air. Leave any blood, crusties etc. that didn’t come off during your shower be. They’ll come off during your next shower or the one after that. Do not touch, move, fiddle or disturb the jewelry in any way.

In the first yearish I used (The 'Ordinary' Haircare Growth Set Multi-Peptide Serum For Hair Density) which worked wonders and was cost effective. At nights I seal with any scalp oil that has rosemary oil. Sadly Mielle's formula no longer works for me, but As I Am rosemary oil has been working, I also like the Camille Rose Rosemary Oil Strengthening Hair and Scalp Drops. For Washing my hair I suffer from sebaceous dermatitis which causes scaliness. Paradoxically my scalp is so oily which is what triggers the ezcema and develops the dry patches. Reversing my PCOS symptoms fixed this but what also helped was the Nizoral shampoo with 1% Ketoconazole. It's harsh so I do it once to twice a month at most and I always follow up with a moisturizing shampoo, and of course finish with a wash out conditioner & leave in conditioner.\n\n**Hair Retention:** This is the info we all know about preventing breakage but I'll include just in case. Hair growth happens in the scalp like said before but to retain that growth it's important to wear protective hairstyles (especially while asleep), a silk/satin bonnet or wrap, silk/satin pillowcase, do not let your hair air dry at night. There is debate about this but I've seen hair specialists and scientists say our hair is especially fragile when wet (especially curly/kinky hair). Therefore, we are much more prone to snags and breakage while our hair is wet. So going to bed make sure your hair is dried. If you're air drying your hair during the day try not to touch it too much  - as little manipulation as possible. Personally choose to diffuse/blow dry my hair and this has prevented most of the breakage I was previously experiencing. Lastly, moisturize and oil your ends. I won't pretend like I know which order is best or even if it's important but I've found that using hair moisturizer/diluted leave in conditioner then hair oil works best for me.\n\n**Hirsutism/Facial Hair:** Spearmint essential oil. I add 1-2 drops of the oil to my moisturizer each time I put on my moisturizer and it helped A LOT with reducing my facial hair. I also drink a lot of spearmint tea. Spearmint specifically has been proven to lower androgen/testosterone levels which is why it helps. I also took supplements which I'll include at the end because they served multiple purposes. Be sure not to add the oil to the entire bottle because that will ruin your moisturizer's formula. Just add the drops in your palm/finger tips and mix in your face cream each time you moisturize your jawline, chin, underneck. Also, do this after moisturizing the upper part of your face without the oil because it's harsh and the scent can be irritating to your eye area.\n\n**Body hair:** Personally I sugar wax my arms and legs, the hair has grown back so thin now. I make it myself and follow tutorials from abetweene on youtube.\n\n**Hair colour/Hairstyle:** This will depend on your face shape and color season. I'm a dark winter colour season and I have a heart face shape. I used the Dressika app to discover my color season before I could afford to get myself professionally assessed and I got the same results. Just be sure to use natural lighting, like by a window. Once you have your colour season you can choose hair colours that work best for you (although natural almost always works best). For my hairstyle I try to choose styles that compliment my heart shaped face. I used the youtube channel Dear Peachie to help me with figuring this out.\n\n# Style\n\nI think most of us know about **Kibbe and colour seasons.** This was how I upgraded my wardrobe. I'm a soft dramatic so I wear things that work for my tall height and accentuate my waist.\n\nThis was the game changer with colour seasons. Most of us know about our true seasons, but it can get restrictive. Sister seasons and colour dissonance is also helpful to know.\n\nMy colour season is dark winter, so my sister seasons would be dark autumn and true winter. Thid gives me more wiggle room to style myself.\n\n**Dissonance** are colours that are outside your true season and your sister seasons, you sprinke this in to add interest. Think of an outfit that is extremely matchy and cohesive but has that one accessory or item that stands out and adds interest. It's really fun in art and in fashion.\n\nFor my **shoes** I've started wearing dancing heels which help my flat feet lol and look stylish. Heel insoles help too, as well as the product Shoe Gummi. I still can't last more than 2, 3 hours at most but it's definitely bearable compared to before.\n\nMatching pajamas and loungewear. You just feel so luxurious dressing up at home and they can (should) be comfy :)\n\n**Accessories:**\n\n* I wear glasses that work with my heart shaped face.\n* I have a neutral leaning warm undertone so I wear gold jewelry, if I wear pearls or other gem stones I mix in gold to provide more harmony with my skin.\n* Perfume, wear what works with your body chemistry. Some smell delictable on people I know and icky on me, and vice versa. Wear what works for you.\n* Nails, press ons. So convenient, so cheap.\n* Hair accessories, bows, barretes, clips, scrunchies, a ribbon, you could be wearing jeans and a t shirt but a simple hair accessory upgrades the look automatically.\n\n# Makeup\n\nI used the youtube channel Dear Peachie to help me with finding eye looks, brows, blush placement for my face shape\n\nI have a low visual weight face and I am a romantic ingenue, because of this I go for more subtle looks that emphasis two facial features maximum at a time (eyes, lips, cheeks).\n\nDon't get me wrong I love glam bold makeup but soft and subtle makes me glow, I turn heads when my makeup is done like this.\n\n# Teeth\n\n* Wax free floss (Cocofloss $10 expensive but I love it 😅, Burst black floss, Moon graphite floss, Twice floss, Dr. Jen’s silk floss)\n* Oil pulling (coconut oil with clove & tea tree oil, or Guru Nanda oil pulling product)\n* Brush teeth\n* Tongue scraper (not everyday, couple of times a week and not too hard)\n* Alcohol free mouthwash (TheraBreath)\n* More so related to my lip area but I try to use wrinkle preventing straws or when I do use regular straws, I place it on the side of my mouth. The reason this works is because puckering the lips excessively causes smokers lines/wrinkles around the mouth. \n\n# Skin\n\nSkincare. This was something that took me a while to work on because of my PCOS, age, weight and etc.\n\n**Facial Care:** The basics includes chemical exfoliation, retinol, moisturizer/recover. I cycle my nightly skincare routine with this in mind and always keep the same morning routine. Mornings look like this (Jojoba oil to help while I use my gua sha, Water based cleanser, eye cream, vitamin c/peptide serum, moisturizer with a drop or two of glycerin, spearmint oil mixed with face cream on the jawline & neck area, finish with sunscreen).\n\nMy nights I alternate these routines in this order\n\nNight 1 - Chemical Exfoliation (Oil cleanser to help while I use my gua sha, Water based cleanser, eye cream, glycolic/lactic acid, moisturizer with a drop or two of glycerin, spearmint oil mixed with face cream on the jawline & neck area, castor oil on lashes and brows)\n\nNight 2 - Retinol (Oil cleanser to help while I use my gua sha, Water based cleanser, eye cream, retinol, moisturizer, spearmint oil mixed with face cream on the jawline & neck area, castor oil on lashes and brows)\n\nNight 3 - Moisturizer/Recovery (Oil cleanser to help while I use my gua sha, Water based cleanser, eye cream, retinol, moisturizer with a drop or two of glycerin, rosehip oil as sealant on entire face, spearmint oil mixed with face cream on the jawline & neck area, castor oil on lashes and brows)\n\n*Repeat Night 1 - 3 (sometimes I need more days to recover if my skin is sensitive or acting up, do what works for you personally)*\n\nOther things that I've done/used to help: red light therapy (helps with both hair growth, so I use it on my scalp, and with stretch marks so I use it on my face and body), Microcurrent device (helps with collagen production and stretchmarks) - I use the brand NuFace & NuBody, Volufiline (a skin serum I mix with eye cream that helps with hollowness under the eyes, Kigelia Africana Skin Cream (I use the brand Maelys B-Perky which contains this ingredient and helped to tighten my chest area and my loose skin on the area),  face yoga and myo fascia face massage, these help with the tautness of my face (basically everything else helps with wrinkles, these exercises and the microcurrent helps and prevents, sagging especially jowls). I follow tutorials I search for from youtube.\n\n**Body Care:** Similar to facial care body care includes exfoliation, retinol, moisturizer/recover\n\nNight 1 - Physical Exfoliation (Dry brush/Body Scrub, Hydrating lotion with a few drops of glycerin, rosehip oil as sealant on entire body)\n\nNight 2 - Retinol (Jojoba oil to help while I use my gua sha, retinol body wash, retinol body lotion)\n\nNight 3 - Moisturizer/Recovery (Jojoba oil to help while I use my gua sha, Hydrating lotion with a few drops of glycerin, rosehip oil as sealant on entire body)\n\n*Again, repeat Night 1 - 3 use more days for recovery if needed*\n\n**Stretch marks/loose skin:** Whether due to weight gain, pregnancy, etc. we can't ever truly get rid of loose skin or stretch marks but moisturizing the skin and derma rolling can help with the appearance. Especially derma rolling. Do NOT derma roll while pregnant but you can do so after when you’ve recovered and talk to your doctor (if you've had a c section you have to wait before derma rolling). I used this video as motivation [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChG8aSvEU6A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChG8aSvEU6A)\n\nFor the body I never went beyond 1.5mm it worked for my deepest stretch marks. If this is too aggressive 1.0mm still works just as well. Make sure you use 70% alcohol as this is what experts say is better at disinfecting. It has more water, which helps it to dissolve more slowly, penetrate cells, and kill bacteria. The disinfecting power of rubbing alcohol drops at concentrations higher than 80%-85%. Make sure you disinfect the derma roller before and after use, and make sure you disinfect your area of contact before rolling as well. Do not do heavy workouts workout or sweat inducing activities for at least 3 days after and avoid harsh products.\n\nI started derma rolling while working on losing weight (at the beginning of my journey while still obese) and continued a year after losing 130lbs. Derma rolling works by causing micro tears, the skin heals the area and in the process of doing so develops more collagen - leading to thicker skin, lighter stretch marks and tighter skin. Since I did this before losing the weight it helped my skin adapt a lot. I won't pretend like I have 0 loose skin or stretch marks but it's barely visible. Someone has to be intimately close to notice. Obviously genetics, how slowly you lose the weight, diet, and moisturizing the skin helps but my PCOS contributed to low collagen (thin skin) and so the derma rolling really helped.\n\n# Weight loss vs Fat loss\n\n**Tons of info here but I promise if you read through it helps to know this stuff.**\n\nWeightloss comes down to calories in versus calories out. I know that's rudely simpliflied and not that easy, but it truly is the answer to **weightloss** (which may be fat, water, or muscle). This is why people can eat barely nothing, lose weight but their shape stays the same (basically skinny fat). It's also why fasting or going low carb works so fast (water weight is the first to go).\n\nFatloss on the other hand is more complicated. This involves our TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure).\n\nTDEE includes: Resting/Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), Metabolic Equivalent of Task or Exercise activity thermogenesis  (EAT), Non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), Thermic Effect of Food (TEF), and Adaptive Thermogenesis (AT).\n\n**BMR (\\~70% daily energy)** the energy taken to exist, so tasks like breathing. Your sex, body composition (muscle to fat ratio), age, and genetics play a role in this  \n**EAT (\\~5% daily energy)** the energy taken for exercise weight lifting, swimming, high intensity walks, etc.  \n**NEAT (\\~15% daily energy)** the energy taken for non exercise movements like walking, fidgeting, showering, standing, etc  \n**TEF (\\~10% daily energy depending on the macronutrients of your meal)** the energy taken to digest, protein has the highest TEF of all the macronutrients, Carbs have a TEF of around 5-10%, while Fats have the lowest TEF, around 0-3%.\n\n**Adaptive Thermogenesis (AT)** is the changes in energy expenditure (energy used) that occur in response to changes in energy balance. For example when you eat more food than you need, your body may increase energy expenditure to prevent weight gain eg. move more, eat less the next day, etc.. On the other hand, when you eat less food than you need, your body may decrease energy expenditure to conserve energy and prevent weight loss eg. less movement, eat more the next day.\n\nOther things that affect AT include diet composition (eg high/low protein, high/low carb, calorie dense foods, etc), physical activity (eg. weights vs. cardio), and environmental factors such as temperature and altitude.\n\nThings that influence AT can make weight management challenging, as it can lead to plateaus or rebounds in weight loss efforts. This is why lack of sleep, hormonal issues, aging, etc. makes weightloss harder.\n\n*Here is a clearer example of this*\n\nThings that affect calories in:\n\n* 8-9 Hours of sleep (Maintains metabolic homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, hormonal processes). Compromised sleep lead to:\n   * Increased Gherlin (hunger hormone - feeling hungrier & therefor eating more)\n   * Decreased Leptin (sensation of satiety - needing to eat more to feel full)\n* Insulin resistance: This is when the cells in your muscles, fat, and liver don't respond well to insulin and can't easily take up glucose from your blood. This results in excessive sugar in the blood & as a result the body produces more insulin in order to try to help the cells obtain the energy from glucose. This leads to weight gain as the insulin increases hunger. Also, since the body is insulin resistant, the excess glucose is converted to fat for long-term storage.\n   * Things that can cause insulin resistance: PCOS, Inactivity/sedentary lifestyle, family history of diabetes, gestational diabetes, hypertension, alcohol abuse, poor sleep habits, high cholesterol levels, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, high bodyweight, acromegaly\n\nThings that affect calories out:\n\n* Body Composition (Fat to muscle ratio) \n* Gut health\n* Compromised sleep affects our energy levels which leads to\n   * Decreased NEAT (Non exercise activity thermogenesis)\n* Hypothyroidism (lowered levels of T3 and T4)\n   * Thyroid hormones T3 and T4 affects every cell and all the organs in your body by regulating the rate at which your body uses calories/energy which is known as our bmr, meaning this affects your metabolic rate.\n* Too few calories lowers daily NEAT\n   * By eating below your BMI (calories needed to perform basic biological processes), your body makes up for this through energy conservation by lowering your NEAT (non exercise activity thermogenesis). Basically you lack the energy to perform your normal daily activities. This also affects your body composition and cardio health as you become sedentary (stop moving as much).\n\n# Healthy Fat loss\n\nSo to lose fat in a healthy way you need to:\n\n1. Get enough sleep (8-9 hours per night)\n2. **Manage your stress levels/nervous system regulation**\n3. **Look after your gut health**\n4. **Manage inflammation**\n5. Increase your daily steps (8-10k per day)\n6. **Weight lift**\n7. **Eat high protein (protein takes the most amount of energy to digest).**\n8. **Manage your insulin resistence**\n9. **Eat in a caloric deficit (make sure your calories in do not exceed calories out).**\n\nFuther information about the bold items in the list is included below. Also, I know this all seems overwhelming but keep in mind you are creating a lifestyle change. This is not a quick fix. \n\nTo **manage your insulin resistance** (info from the book Glucose Goddess by Jessie Inchauspé):\n\n* Eat within an hour of waking up\n* Protein with breakfast\n* Tablespoon of apple cider vinegar before each meal (diluted in a glass of water)\n* Eat foods in this order, veggies -> protein -> fat -> starches -> carbs -> sugar\n* Never eat sweets/dessert/carbs on an empty stomach (dessert after dinner)\n* Keep refined carbs and added sugar at a minimum.\n* Minimize alcohol intake\n* Try to minimize sodas, fruit juice and sweet drinks (this is because there is no fiber to help with the glucose spike or at least try to have these drinks after eating something fiberous)\n* Only eat fruit whole, not transformed eg. eat the orange instead of having the orange juice, again fiber makes a world of a difference\n* Put clothing on your carbs. Eg. have protein/fats/fiber with your carbs\n* A short walk after carb heavy meals\n* Fasting - this is controversial and I should add a disclaimer, if you in any way shape or form have or had an eating disorder, especially restrictive eating, I highly recommend against fasting. Intermittent fasting has a lot of studies out there that were done on men. The book Fast Like a Girl by Dr. Mindy Pelz includes a nuanced view of fasting that takes into account our hormones and our monthly cycle. She also has a free app 'Fast like a girl', you log your period and it tells you how long to fast. However, bioindividuality is key here, genetics, etc. Please if you are considering fasting make sure you get bloodwork done first. Manage your electrolyte levels, do not neglect iron and protein levels. Personally, I prefer using the other methods since fasting can also inadvertently worsens insulin resistence due to increased stress/cortisol which cause higher hunger cues. Some with insulin resistence found fasting to be helpful. So make sure you do what works for you and always consult your doctor. \n* Supplements:\n   * Vitamin D paired with Vitamin K1 & K2\n   * Magnesium Biglycinate (I take this before bed)\n   * Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n   * Turmeric\n   * Coenzyme 10 (Take with Clomid & Vitamin E)\n   * N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)\n   * Inositol\n   * Zinc (Important to Note: It works inversely with testosterone - raises testosterone if your levels are low and lowers it if your levels are high)\n\nTo eat in a **caloric deficit**, calculate your TDEE and subtract 200-500 calories from that number. I like using this calculator.   \n[https://tdeecalculator.net](https://tdeecalculator.net)\n\nEg. If it's calculated to be 2000 calories, you subtract 200, so 1800 should be your daily calorie intake. For the activity levels make sure you do not oversell yourself. Here is a general guide:\n\n* Sedentary: Office job sat all day or less than 3000 steps per day\n* Lightly Active: Exercise 1-3 times per week or 3-10k steps daily (up to 3-4 miles daily)\n* Moderately Active: Exercise 3-5 times per week or 10-15k steps daily (up to 4-7 miles daily)\n* Highly Active: Hard exercise 6-7 training days per week or 15-20k steps daily (up to 7-10 miles daily)\n* Extremely Active: Intense daily exercise/hard physical labour 7 days a week or 25k+ steps daily (up to 10 miles daily)\n\nAs you lose weight your body adapts so after a while you may need to recalculate your TDEE and deficit. Once you are at your ideal weight, you no longer subtract the 200-500, you simply eat the TDEE amount to maintain but you do this gradually. After I lost the weight I came out of the deficit by adding 50 calories to my daily intake per week, till I was at maintenance/my TDEE. This prevented me from gaining fat or water weight.\n\nLastly, muscle mass (increase in muscle raises your metabolic level, meaning you burn more calories at rest). This is ideal and is also how you'll see someone who is short, seemingly small but weigh more than you imagined. Muscle density weighs more than fat. Think of a 50 pound dumbbell versus 50 pounds of feathers, you would need a whole lot of feathers to match the weight. Same difference, you need a larger volume of fat to equal to the same amount of muscle. Therefore, lifting weights is ideal because you will become more toned, burn more calories at rest, be able to eat more even when you've lost the weight to maintain your phisique, you'll be more insulin sensitive, and you will have stronger and higher bone density (really important for women, we lose up to 5% of muscle mass per decade after the age of 30).\n\n# Body Recompositon: Weightlifting for health (and aesthetics), lose fat & gain muscle\n\nIt is possible to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time. I followed Huskular Goddess and and LexiiGettingFit for inspiration and they were really the ones that opened my eyes to the concept of body recomposition (gain musle while losing fat). \n\nThe benefits of this is as you're getting smaller your TDEE is increasing. This means by the time you lose the weight you'll still be eating an adequate amount. The other benefits include insulin sensitivity versus insulin resistence, higher metabolism, and a improved body composition like I mentioned before in the dummbell versus feather example. The downside is the number on the scale won't have a dramatic shift while your clothes will be fitting looser. Again, weight density plays tricks on us and it's easy to get caught up in body dismorphia but I promise it works. \n\nIn order to sustain and build muscle while losing fat, you need to be consuming enough protein while remaining in a caloric deficit. So 60-80g of protein per day minimum to lose 1-2lbs per week. Ideally it should be 0.8-1g of per pound of lean body mass. Eg, someone is 300lbs and they want to get down to 150lbs. They would eat 120-150g of protein per day. If this is too much, try to get at least 60-80g like I mentioned before. Remember even though 1-2lbs per week sounds small, the changes are significant because of the muscle gained. You will look and feel smaller.  \n\n**Weightlifting for a rounder booty** (I reshaped my glutes by weightlifting. Hormones can actually affect the shape and my PCOS did a number on me. I developed a V shape over the years. Round, square, heart, A shapes are all based on your bone structure and fat placement. Some of us just have those stubborn fat deposits in certain areas that are genetic, even when we lose the weight, it's a smaller version but the same shape. V shape on the other hand is largely seen in older women post menopause and in younger women with hormonal disorders. This is becuase the hormonal imbalances also causes muscle imbalances. Regulating your hormones helps but it won't grow the muscles for you, so I used Fit With Emely's glute guide based on your glute shape (completely free, I watched all her videos to get this info and it took me two years to go from a V shape to a round shape.\n\nHere is the guideline for each shape:\n\n**Glute Maximus** - Everyone should be working on glute maximus. It builds the shelf and overall size. Step ups (all variations), hip thrusts (all variations), lunges, rdl, leg press, all squat variations  \n**Glute Minimus** - (V and Square shapes), this muscle fills in the middle between the top and lower glute. Hip abduction, single leg bridge, Standing hip abduction/cable raises  \n**Gute Medius** - (Heart, Round, and A-shaped) this muscles builds a longer hip for top portion of the glutes. Eg. Single leg squat, Single leg deadlift, Cable clamshells, Reverse lung, step ups  \n**Underbutt** - Everyone should be working on underbutt but this is especially useful for V shaped folks. It works the hamstrings and lower portion of glutes. Good mornings, single leg rdl (also works minimus), single leg hip thrust (also works maximus), hip abductors (also works minimus)\n\nHow to structure workout:\n\n* Warm up/Dynamic Stretches (specific to the muscle group you're working eg. lower body warm up or upper body warm up, etc.)\n* Compound exercises (2-3 exercises eg. single leg rdl, good mornings, leg press - for each exercise you do 3-4 sets, 8-12 reps, with 3-4 minute rest between sets). That probably sounds like a foreign language to some, so for instance:\n   * **Start excercise 1**\n   * Set 1 (repeat exercise 1 - rdl 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 2 (repeat exercise 1 - rdl 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 3 (repeat exercise 1 - rdl 8 times)\n   * **Move on to exercise 2**\n   * Set 1 (repeat exercise 2 - leg press 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 2 (repeat exercise 2 - leg press 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 3 (repeat exercise 2 - leg press 8 times)\n   * **Move on to exercise 3**\n   * Set 1 (repeat exercise 3 - good mornings 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 2 (repeat exercise 3 - good mornings 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 3 (repeat exercise 3 - good mornings 8 times)\n* Secondary Workouts (2-3 exercises eg. step ups, bulgarian split squats, lunges - for each exercise you do 3-4 sets, 8-12 reps, with 3-4 minute rest between sets)\n* Isolated/Accessory Movements: these exercises work one part of the muscle more than others, for example an overbias on the underbutt/hamstring like I mentioned before to help with the V shape ( eg. hip abductors, kickbacks, glute bridge, lying leg raises, etc. (1-2 exercises high repetitions, low weight 2-3 sets, 15-20 reps, 1-2 minute rest between sets)\n* Static stretch/cool down (specific to the muscle group you're working eg. lower body cool down or upper body cool down, etc.)\n\nKeep in mind that you only need to work on a muscle group 2-3 times a week. So I only do glutes Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Also keep in mind while I work the lower body I am also working my upper body (eg. while doing rdls I am lifting the weight with my upper body), which is why I don't have tailered upper body days, this is for aesthetic reasons, and because weightlifting more than 3 days per week is not feasible with my PCOS. \n\nMy full routine is:\n\n* Monday- lower body\n* Tuesday - Pilates/core\n* Wednesday - Rest (I still go for walks on these days)\n* Thursday - lower body\n* Friday - Pilates/core\n* Saturday - lower body\n* Sunday - Rest (I still go for walks on these days)\n\nI also used primarily resistance bands in the beginning because gym equipment intimidated me (not anymore :) ). I started with 25lb resistance and went up to 125lbs. I use the product BandBar which allowed me to use the resistance bands like a barbell at home. This isn’t the only option and you can definitely buy resistance bands and do it without the bar. [BandBar](https://shopbandbar.com)\n\nFor the ab separation from being obese, I did this workout 3 times a week (also helpful post pregnancy): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smiGsW-mQX0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smiGsW-mQX0)\n\nFor my chest to help with getting perkier boobs (the derma rolling was what made the biggest difference, but this exercise helped as well though it took 6+ months for the changes to be significant. Women tend to take longer to grow chest muscles): [https://youtu.be/hg7\\_R29jGIE?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/hg7_R29jGIE?feature=shared)\n\nI also did workouts to help with my posture and mobility 3 times a week (any I could find online)\n\nThe last thing I will say is be mindful that you may gain weight initially when you start lifting weights. This is due to slight inflammation/water gain from foreign tension, which will last about a month or two before you adapt BUT your body will adapt, I promise. Keep in mind if it's days before your period or if you are on your period. It's not if, but when, our weight fluctuates. As long as you are in a deficit and doing everything right, the number will go down. Do not get discouraged!!!\n\n***Here is the edit to this post which includes my supplements, how I managed my inflammation, and how I improved my gut health. I also edited the information I shared prior to include a few more tips and lifestyle changes I made, and included a few more details. I also rearranged things so there is a separation between style/hair/skin and health information. The post is getting really long so I may create a separate post for personal development/mindset tips.*** \n\n# Inflammation\n\nIn my case my inflammation was caused by my PCOS, insulin resistence and my obesity, but it can be caused by chronic stress, other autoimmune disorders like IBS, Crohn's disease, etc, smoking/alcohol, age related diseases, environmental toxins, diets high in processed foods, sugars, trans fats & high omega-6 fatty acids. \n\nIn my case the inflammation from the PCOS led to gut inflammation due to the high levels of coritsal (stress hormones) in reaction to the high testosterone and insulin resistence. I also experienced metabolic inflammation (non alcoholic fatty liver disease), skin inflammation (as I mentioned earlier the ezcema on my scalp, alopecia, and hirsutism), adipose tissue inflammation, chronic low grade inflammation (this led to edema or fuid retention -> insulin resistance and my high testosteron/androgen levels also exacerbated this).\n\nTo fix this these were the thin I added to my life:\n\n* Dry brushing 2-3 times a week\n* Body Gua sha\n* Face Gua Sha or Face Yoga or Myofascial Massage \n* Jump Rope\n* Trampoline/Rebounder\n* Vibration Plate (very useful for after a workout or while sitting down)\n* Acupressure mat\n* Arvigo (Mayan Abdominal massage) & Lymphatic drainage massage\n* Leg elevation, I sleep with a pillow under my knees. In the evenings I keep my legs up.\n* Massages\n* Sweat more (exercise/sauna/steam room)\n* Portable Infrared Sauna (reduce cortisol by 25%)\n* Microcurrent\n* Compression socks\n* Castor oil pack 3-4x per week\n* Eliminate inflammatory triggers (mine were gluten & dairy)\n   * Switch to sourdough\n   * Eliminate seed oils\n   * Avoid alcohol & smoking\n* Supplements\n   * Vitamin D paired with Vitamin K1 & K2\n   * Magnesium Biglycinate (I take this before bed)\n   * Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n   * Turmeric\n   * Coenzyme 10 (Take with Clomid & Vitamin E)\n   * N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)\n* Teas that helped\n   * Turmeric\n   * Red Rasberru Leaf Tea\n   * Fennel\n   * Chamomile\n\n# Gut Health \n\nYour microbiota needs the right bacteria in the right amount to perform its hormone regulating functions properly. When the type or number of bacteria gets disturbed by events such as stress, or poor diet, or your gut can no longer accomplish its job meaning you'll have inflammation, increased risk of chronic disease, skin conditions, mental health issues, weakened immune system, nutrient absorprion problems, and weight management challenges.   \n\n\nFor weight loss issues, gut microbiomes influence hormones in producing and signaling leptin and ghrelin (these hormones regulate hunger and fullness signals). Inflammation and insulin resistence is also associated with gut health problems as mentioned before. Energy extraction from foods, certain gut bacteria are more efficient at extracting energy from food, particularly carbohydrates. When there is an imbalance, more calories can be absorbed from food leading to difficulties gaining or losing weight. \n\nThings I did to improve gut health/intestinal permeability:\n\n* Ate foods rich in digestive enzymes (mangoes, pineapple, etc.)\n* Pre and probiotics (incorporate bifidobacterium and lactobacillus)\n   * Favorite brand: Seed Heath Probiotics\n* Pickles (without vinegar): Great source of prebiotics\n* Apple Cider Vinegar/Kimchi/Kombucha/Sauerkraut\n   * Beware of certain types of vinegar contain chemicals which kill bacteria, “the good bacteria”, and leave the yeast Candida albicans alone.\n   * Raw apple cider vinegar contains: Natural probiotics (friendly bacteria), which may help with your immune system and gut health.\n      * Tablespoon of apple cider vinegar (diluted in a glass of water) before each meal\n   * Balsamic vinegar: Acetic acid is the active compound in balsamic vinegar. This acid contains strains of probiotics that aid digestion. The probiotics found in acetic acid can help promote good gut health and digestion while supporting overall immune function.\n* Raw Carrots (has the type of fiber that binds and flushes out toxins in gut, good to have as daily hormone & digestion support)\n* Limit Processed foods and Sugar\n* No drinking or smoking \n* Stress managment (which I'll expand on just below)\n* Increase fiber intake\n* Regularly exercise\n* Supplements\n   * Ginger \n   * L-Glutamine\n   * Olive leaf extract (especially helpful if you have candida overgrowth)\n   * Turmereric \n* Teas\n   * Ginger\n   * Lemon Balm\n\n# Lower androgens/testosterone\n\n* Teas \n   * Nettle Tea\n   * Spearmint tea\n* Spearmint oil topically for hirsutism\n* Supplements\n   * Schisandra (adaptogen - stress management & hormone balance)\n   * Saffron (Also helps reduce testosterone, lower blood pressure and prevents bad cholesterol)\n   * Inositol\n   * Holy Basil\n   * Magnesium Biglycinate (I take this before bed)\n   * Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n   * Coenzyme 10 (Take with Clomid & Vitamin E)\n   * Zinc (Important to Note: It works inversely with testosterone - raises testosterone if your levels are low and lowers it if your levels are high)\n\n# Nervous System Regulation/ Stress Management \n\nStress is one of the things that age us the most, and people with PCOS already have higher levels of cortisol so these are the things I do to manage my stress levels:\n\n* Regulate circadian rhythm, direct sunlight upon waking up. I use a sunrise alarm clock lamp for this\n* Same bedtime everynight (pre midnight)\n* Invert screen colors at bedtime (red filter on screens)\n* Pillow under knees\n* No loud alarms\n* Magnesium biglycinate supplement before bed\n* Regulate circadian rhythm, view the sunset before bed. I use a sunrise alarm clock lamp for this\n* Spend a few minutes breathing through left nostril only\n* Epsom salt foot soak\n* Journal\n* Get back to using my coloring books (I even invested in alcohol based markers it's so fun). Regulates me and gets me in touch with my inner child\n* Time with friends, my puppy, and my family\n* Supplements\n   * Holy Basil (adaptogen - stress management & hormonal balance)\n   * L-Theanine\n   * Magnesium biglycinate \n* Teas\n   * Red raspberry leaf (adaptogen - stress management, also good for menstrual cramps)\n   * Reishi Mushroom\n   * Lemon Balm\n* Night time mocktail (have after dinner and not on an empty stomach due to the sugar levels in the tart cherry)\n   * Teaspoon of tart cherry (high levels of melatonin)\n   * Magnesium biglycinate powder\n   * Probiotic soda (good for gut health)\n\n# Tea cycling\n\n- On your period\n    - Nettle leaf: Increase iron levels\n    - Moringa: Increase iron levels\n    - Red Raspberry leaf: Helps with period cramps (best to drink throughout the month, especially at the end of the luteal phase\n    - Chamomile: Helps with wellness wind down routine when you're feeling extra tired\n- Follicular phase\n    - Focus teas: Peppermint, Spearmint\n    - Adaptogens: Lion's mane, Adaptogen latte, and Chaga mushroom\n    - Detox: Dandelion Root\n- Ovulation phase\n    - Detox: Dandelion root tea\n    - Bloating: turmeric tea latte/golden latte\n    - Estrogen dominance - symptoms (bad hormonal migraines, hot flashes, nausea): Schisandra berry, Lemon balm\n- Luteal phase\n    - PMS symptoms: Raspberry leaf, Schisandra berry, Ginger root (powder or tea)\n\n\nThe best teas for PCOS\n\n- Spearmint\n    - For reducing androgens & lowering hirsutism (facial hair)\n- Cinnamon tea (improves insulin sensitivity)\n- Chamomile tea (Adaptogen)\n- Nettle Tea (reduce androgens)\n- Red raspberry leaf (adaptogen/stress relief, also good for menstrual cramps)\n- Schisandra (adaptogen/stress relief & hormone balance)\n- Saffron (Also helps reduce testosterone, lower blood pressure and prevents bad cholesterol)\n- Ginger (ginger offers anti-inflammatory, fertility and hormone-balancing benefits, aides digestion )\n\n\n# Seed Cycling\n\nWhat is seed cycling? Seed cycling refers to the consumption of specific seeds at different times of the month in order to improve the production and levels of sex hormones, specifically estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone.\n\nSeed cycling divides the female menstrual cycle into two parts:\n\n1. During the first half of the menstrual cycle, or days 1 through 14, seed cycling encourages daily consumption of **flax and pumpkin seeds.**\n2. During the second half of the menstrual cycle, or days 15 through 28, seed cycling encourages daily consumption of **sunflower and sesame seeds**\n\n*Results from seed cycling will not happen overnight. Normally women observe improvements after approximately three months of seed cycling adherence. It took me about 4ish months.*\n\n**The Benefits of Seed Cycling:** Support hormonal balance, alleviate PMS symptoms, decrease hormonal acne, alter irregularity of menstrual cycles, and fight stomach bloating and fatigue.\n\n",

    "body": "I really really wish I had before and after photos to share but when I started my routine, my expectations were so low that I didn’t think it was worth it. I mostly started doing this routine because I’m pregnant for the first time and have a lot of time on my hands. I also hoped I would prevent existing stretch marks from worsening if I gained weight during my pregnancy. \n\nAnyway, I’ve had stretch marks on my knees and inner thighs since I went through puberty. They started out red/purple when I was teenager but have long turned white and I just figured there was nothing to be done about them. The ones on my inner thighs never bothered me a ton but I admit, I’ve always hated the ones on my knees since it doesn’t seem as common to have them there. \n\nAnyway, four months ago, I started a routine of microneedling, using lactic acid, vitamin e oil, and red light therapy. Basically I microneedle the problem areas and then apply a small amount of lactic acid to the area. Then I use my Current Body red light mask (which is for the face but it’s bendable so I just make it work) on each area for 10 minutes (so 40 minutes total). Afterwards I use a thick, sticky vitamin E oil/serum. \n\nI swear, my stretch marks are all but gone. I couldn’t be happier, especially about the improvement with my knees. I really started doing this with very little hope and mostly out of boredom. I’m not sure which part of the routine has helped the most or if it’s the combination but I just wanted to share. \n\nI haven’t gained any new stretch marks yet in pregnancy (27 weeks currently) but if they start popping up, I’ll definitely attack them with my amateur routine.\n\nETA: the stretch marks, specifically the ones on my knees went through a short period where it almost seemed like they were getting worse before they got better. They went from white back to the reddish/purple color they were when they first appeared as a teen. I also thought I’d note that if I weren’t pregnant, I’d have probably used tret on and off as well. I think tret could probably do a lot of good in combination with microneedling. I might also opt for glycolic acid over lactic acid but I just happened to have the lactic acid already but I’ve read glycolic might work better.",

    "body": "Three things that make the biggest impact!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe get a great deal of questions about how to start an anti-aging routine, what to use, what works best, when to start, etc. This is a hella basic post full of information repeated pretty much everywhere, *but* this is where to start your anti-aging routine (and where you can end it, tbh). It’s never too late and pretty much never too early* to start a basic routine.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Please don’t sunscreen tiny tiny infants or use retinol when you’re twelve.\n\n\n## Sunscreen, sunscreen, sunscreen. \n\n\nThis is the single most important thing you can do as UV rays are responsible for 80% of extrinsic (non-genetic) skin aging/damage. I’d recommend at least SPF 30 and PA++ or a PPD score above 8.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n+ SPF 15 protects against 93% of UVB rays\n\n+ SPF 30 protects against 97% of UVB rays\n\n+ Anything higher than that is unnecessary.\n\n+ The PA+ system measures protection against UVA rays.\n\n+ PPD means “persistent pigment darkening,” another measure of UVA rays.\n\n+ PA++ = PPD 4 to 8. PA+++ is equivalent to at least PPD 8.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs for application, you want to apply it long enough before sun exposure to set and then reapply after every couple hours of sun exposure. The recommended amount is 2mg/cm2 or about ½ a teaspoon for your entire face - see the Beauty Brains [explanation](http://thebeautybrains.com/2014/07/how-much-sunscreen-should-you-put-on-your-face/). You can use moisturizer/sunscreen combos, but make sure you’re still applying enough to get the full UV protection.\n\n## Retinoids and retinols.\n\nI’ll focus on two out of the many forms available: tretinoin and retinol.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Tretinoin** (a retinoid) is the gold-star treatment for reducing wrinkles, and has been shown to reverse the damaging effects of the sun. It improves fine lines, tightens and smoothes the skin, increases collagen and hyaluronic acid production, and is [practically magic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqkt9rYtt2Q). For the vast majority of us, tretinoin is only available by prescription, either through your local doctor or a dermatological service like Curology.\n\nIn addition to being incredibly useful, it’s also incredibly strong and is notoriously drying. \n\n**Retinol** is a weaker form that’s available in a lot of over-the-counter (non-prescription) products. Retinol improves wrinkles, lightens hyperpigmentation, and increases skin elasticity without all the irritation of retinoids. Supposedly, it shows anti-aging effects at concentrations as low as 0.01%, but can be found up to 1%. Depending on the results you’re looking for, 0.04%-0.4% might be all you need. While it’s not as strong as tretinoin, it’s also not as irritating, making it more suitable for a lot of people.\n\nRetinoids and retinols, of any kind, increase your sensitivity to the sun, making you more likely to burn, etc. Please make sure you’re using (enough) sunscreen while using these products, and for at least a few weeks after.\n\n## Antioxidants. \n\nAntioxidants work against free radicals, atoms with an unpaired electron that can cause a chain reaction of damage in your cells in their quest to acquire one more. Antioxidants are usually molecules that work by donating an electron to the free radical, neutralizing it and stopping the chain reaction. Thus, they’re an important part in anti-aging and preventing oxidative stress.\n\nFor the best results you’ll want to make sure you’re applying your antioxidants *before* exposure to the sun and pollution, and to use a variety of antioxidants (at recommended doses, as well). It’s also a bonus if your antioxidant product isn’t consistently exposed to light or air - like they are in jars or clear packaging.\n\n***Note:*** Your #1 source of antioxidants should be from [your diet](https://www.google.com/search?q=antioxidants+in+food&oq=antioxidants+in+food&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1893j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). Eating well and incorporating more vegetables and fruit will your skin, mind, and body. Topical antioxidants are a secondary measure.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThese topically-applied antioxidants are some of the ones with the most research behind them:\n\n+ **Vitamin C** is the most common antioxidant found in our skin, and can regenerate vitamin e. It also works to improve the efficacy of physical sunscreen filters. For L-AA, the most common form of vitamin c, look for a product with 5%-20% vitamin c and a pH of around 3.5. SAP and MAP, derivatives of L-AA, are effective and less irritating to some, without the need for a low pH. Vitamin c works especially well in combination with vitamin e and ferulic acid.\n\n+ **Ferulic Acid** is a very powerful antioxidant. It’s included in SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic at only 0.5%, which is enough to double the photoprotection.\n\n+ **Vitamin E:** The other ingredient in the vitamin c trio, vitamin e isn’t super amazing as an antioxidant on its own, but works synergistically with other antioxidants. \n\n+ **Coenzyme Q10:** Proven to be an effective antioxidant, but isn’t photoprotective. Idebenone, the synthetic version of CoQ10, is stronger but potentially irritating.\n\n+ **Green Tea:** The primary beneficial compounds are polyphenols, including the popular EGCG. 2-3% green tea extract has been shown to have [photoprotective benefits](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19624431), although I believe that’s higher than what many commercial products include.\n\n+ **Resveratrol:** Most known as coming from grape skins, resveratrol has been shown an excellent antioxidant, [even at only 0.0001%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21120261) (in vitro).\n\n+ **Superoxide Dismutase:** An important enzyme and a very strong antioxidant that isn’t “used up” when neutralizing free radicals.\n",

UV damage is not responsible for 80% of all skin damage, but rather 80% of EXTRINSIC damage that comes from environmental insults:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3299230/. \n\nOur skin is still susceptible to the natural processes that age every one of our body's organ's (referred to as \"intrinsic\" or \"chronological aging\"). Sadly, the strongest, most photostable sunscreen in the world is not going to do anything to protect against that. Don't get me wrong - I put on sunscreen every day and think it's definitely an integral part of a skincare routine, but this 80% number is constantly thrown around here and it's simply misleading. \n\nOh, and one more thing about sunscreen that is often overlooked.

    "body": "I had a breakout from using an after sun gel. My skin was so sensitive it burned as I applied it. I have eczema and never had it on my face until now. The problems were dry patches, discoloration, pimples and tiny pustules of dead skin cells. So, I started researching ingredients that could work for me. While doing that I found out I had a broken skin barrier. My skin was reacting negatively to anything I put on it. And using the antibacterial soap totally dried out my skin. I started with the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Cream-to-Foam cleanser for sensitive skin. At first I wanted the La-roche Posay Lipikar gentle face wash but that was out of my price range and I didn’t want to wait for the order to come in the mail. I found the Neutrogena one at Walmart. The main thing that attracted me to the wash was its inclusion of CICA (Cantella Asiatica) aka BarrierTechnology™ which is an extract that helps soothe the skin and moisturize. Next, I got vegetable-based glycerin in the first aid department at Walmart. I mixed one drop in with my regular moisturizer to leave my skin feeling soft. Glycerin also penetrates deep into the skin because the molecular size/shape is similar to water molecules. Next, is using a 2% salicylic acid cream I got from dollar tree (yes it actually works) 2-3 times a day on the affected areas. I did this for 4-5 days and saw amazing results. This got rid of the bumps and deep-seated painful acne that stayed under the skin. Lastly, I got the La Roche Possy Triple Repair Face & Body Moisturizer. This leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated. So after all of that. Now I just use the Neutrogena cream to foam cleanser in the morning and at night then follow up with the La roche posay. I spot treat any white heads I see with the salicylic acid. I also started using the Black Girl Sunscreen kids version and it’s the only sunscreen that doesn’t hurt or cause reactions. \n\nThese photos were taken 9 days apart. \n\nTLDR: \nI had a breakout from over stripping my skin, had a reaction to an after-sun gel, and sunscreen. \n\nProducts used: \n-La Roche Posay Triple Repair Face & Body moisturizer. \n-Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Cream-To-Foam Cleanser \n-Dollar Tree 2% Salicylic Acid Acne Spot Treatment \n-Vaseline \n-Vitamin E Oil \n\nRoutine Now: \nNeutrogena Cleanser 2x a day\nLa Roche Posay moisturizer 2x a day\nVaseline 2-3x a week at night \nBlack Girl Sunscreen as needed\nSalicylic Acid Acne Spot treatment as needed",

    "body": "Hey guys,\n\nThis has been happening over the last few days, and will continue over the next few days so will be updating with the final decision sometime soon.\n\nSo about 4 weeks ago I walked into a tattoo and piercing store (“The best and most trusted in the world!”), asking about nipple piercings. I.e. what are the risks and benefits, what kind of price range to expect, aftercare needs, etc.\n\nAfter having a conversation with the piercer about this he told me to expect a price between $100 and $120 at most stores, but that today only he could offer me the piercings plus jewellery for $80. That sounds great, is it okay if I just call my boyfriend and come back? Boyfriend ok’d the early spending money for the next fortnight and we were good to go.\n\nThis piercer wasn’t like some of the other piercers I’ve encountered. After placing the dots on either side of each nipple, he didn’t ask me how i liked the positioning (not that i could have told him, because these dots covered half of each nipple). He didn’t notify me of any issues or the resolutions to said issues. It was simply, “deep breath in, deep breath out” *stab*. At that point I started to get iffy, but I wasn’t about to say anything to the guy with a needle in one hand and my boob in the other. \n\nA few days after having them pierced, I started to get a bit concerned because the small size of the bars he used meant that the holes were stretching over the balls on the ends as they were very constricting. I went to a different tattoo shop to buy longer bars to try to remedy the situation. All was okay for the next couple of weeks. \n\nIt was only when the pain started subsiding and I could actually touch them that I started to have a bit of a look and I saw that the piercings are a lot further back than I was expecting. I went to another piercer, one I had been to before, for their opinion on the positioning. Her advice was to go back and make a complaint, because these are not nipple piercings, these are areola piercings. They don’t even touch my nipples.\n\nBefore I went back to the original piercer, I went to one that I had never visited, for another opinion and received the same advice. So on Saturday, I went back out to the shop where I got them done and spoke to the manager about the problem, saying that I was told by two other professional piercers that the piercings I had were not what I asked for  and not what I had paid for. When she said she was not sure what could be done about this, my request was simple and polite. \n\n“I was wondering if it would be possible for me to have the bars removed and the piercings cleaned, and receive a refund due to the fact that this is not what I asked for?”\n\nManager agrees that these things would all be suitable actions and asked me if I could come back in Monday, because there isn’t a piercer working over the weekends because it’s a bit slow. All good, agreed to come back on Monday.\n\nSo Monday rolls around and I got up early, cooked breakfast for my housemate who offered to drive me instead of having to get a bus, and off we went. Got to the store and the manager said, “I’m really sorry, the man who was supposed to be working today got called to a different location and we don’t have a piercer today”. Their piercers work on a who needs it most kind of basis, so it makes sense. She asked me to come back tomorrow, and I left my mobile number with her so she could let me know if anything changed.\n\nTuesday. Today I got smart and called ahead to ask if the piercer was working today before I left the house. He was booked to be tattooing until 2pm. That’s okay, I’ve got some errands to run anyway. I showed up at the shopping centre about 20 minutes early, having run out of things to keep me occupied. Walked past the shop to go to the pet store with a friend while I waited and noticed the piercer who did my piercings standing there with nothing to do. Manager saw me and greeted me, piercer is ready, he just finished his booking early, I got there right on time! So we had a bit of a chat while the piercer was getting the room ready, sterilising everything, washing his hands, slapping on his gloves. \n\nHe called me into the room and I asked my friend to come with me. After removing the necessary clothing, he inspected them and asked what the problem was. I explained everything to him in detail while he interrupted me every two minutes to the point my friend just said, “how do you expect to know what the problem is if you can’t shut your mouth and listen to her talking”. That shut him up long enough for me to give him a list of the things that I’d already covered while he was too busy trying to defend himself.\n\nAfter I finished he asked me rather rudely, “so what do you want ME to do about it?”\n\nI told him that I would like for him to remove the piercings safely and clean the area with an antibacterial. He made this sound like he was about to say “for f*cks sakes” but stopped himself before it came out. Anyway, he did almost exactly what I asked him to. Almost.\n\nAfter quite aggressively (not safely) removing the bars, he put antibacterial on a cotton ball and wiped each side with it. I told him I appreciate that he was willing to help me, but I don’t appreciate the way he just acted, especially his rough treatment of a sensitive part of my body which was more sensitive due to the fact that  these piercings were still very new.\n\nHis reaction was to speak to me very rudely again, stating that my nipples are tiny so I can’t possibly have expected to get real nipple piercings and have it work. Small nipples tend to push piercings out in a most unpleasant way, so when he pierces nipples that are very small he does it a bit further back. It’s a basic thing for him to do and if i didn’t like it I could take my business elsewhere. Very hushed though, so the manager didn’t hear.\n\nWhen he left the room, I was standing right in front of the door, and when the door is open people walking past the shopfront can see straight through to where i was standing. I was left in a wide open room with my bra only covering me because i saw him going to open the door and hastily picked it up to cover myself. He left the door WIDE OPEN with me standing there half naked. Friend rushed to close it so that I could continue to get dressed again. \n\nWhen I cane out of the room I went back to the manager to receive my refund, and she said to me, “we dont actually do refunds usually, but I can give you store credit.” Oh boy, am I heated at this point. But still, I replied politely, respectfully. Don’t ask me how I kept my cool, I honestly have no idea how. It’s almost midnight now and I’m still reeling from it.\n\nI tried to argue that I had been told on Saturday, by her, that a refund would not be an issue. Nothing was said about store credit, and what would I do with said store credit? After the serving I just got from your piercer I honestly have no desire to return. \n\n“Well, you could sell the credit to your friend, I remember her saying she wanted to get a tattoo. I can set up an account for the credit to be added to.”\n\nYeah sure let’s do that. I have been here an hour already and it’s my third time here in 4 days. I just wanna go home. So the account is set up, repayment sorted with my friend, and off we go back to the car. \n\nAs soon as we got home I called another one of their stores in the area, and asked if there was any regional/district manager or someone a bit higher up than a store manager that I could speak to about an issue at another location. The man there took my details and told me he would ask the owner of their store to get the owner of the other store to contact me. I was called within the hour, explained my issue and how I tried to have it resolved professionally and had originally been met with nothing but smiles and helpfulness, only to have a dreadful experience today. I told him everything that happened. Made sure he knew I wanted to ensure that other customers don’t have experiences like this in the future.\n\nMr Bossman was unimpressed. Apologised profusely, thanked me for trying to handle the situation responsibly (as opposed to walking in angry, making demands, etc.) and also thanked me for letting him know about the situation. He said “I know it’s not an excuse, but [piercer] has some stuff going on at the moment. He’s been spoken to a couple of times already. This time he won’t be piercing for us anymore. I’m sorry that he brought his shit to work with him.”\n\nHe then organised for one of their most qualified and experienced piercers to review the situation (basically she’s gonna look at my boobs and decide whether or not he made the right decision when he put the piercings further back than normal). \n\nMr Bossman said that depending on this piercer’s opinion after our meeting, either he will ask her to pierce me properly free of charge (once the current holes close and heal), or he will provide me with $100 store credit to be used at any of their stores to go towards other piercings or even a tattoo. Not exactly what I was going for, but I’ll take that deal. I thanked him for taking my complaint and his help, his patience and also asked him to thank the piercer for agreeing to come in to see me on a day when she wasn’t originally going to be working. Overall it’s looking like there will be a great result, but to be completely honest I’m a little worried that the helpful attitude will again disappear on the day. Fingers crossed though and I really hope that I’m wrong. \n\nSo on Thursday night I will update with whatever happens at my appointment, good or bad!\n\n\n\nUpdate:\nI am so so sorry I have taken so long to update! I swear i typed it out on Thursday night and I’m sure I pressed the button to update the post but it must not have gone through! I didnt check it until now though, so I’m sorry to those who’ve been waiting since thursday for the update!!\n\nSo I went to see the new piercer on Thursday afternoon, and was told not only did the guy pierce my boobs in the wrong place (new piercer being a female with small nipples as well told me that what the guy told me was absolute BULLSHIT) but he also pierced me the wrong way!!! I told him that I wanted them for sensitivity reasons, and they pierce differently for people who want sensitivity, but because most people just want them for the looks he just pierced me the looks way and not the sensitivity way!\n\nSo the advice from this piercer was to go to a chemist and buy a saline mixture with tea tree oil in it, and vitamin E oil (saline and tea tree to clean and prevent infection, and vitamin e to prevent scarring) she also said to bring in the receipt on wednesday when I go to see her again and she will reimburse me the full cost of these products because the original piercer was completely at fault. She was talking about “when i repierce them” so i 100% will be getting them redone, and I’m quite confident with letting her do them because she and a few others there told me that she does all of her own piercings (inluding her own nipples - no thank youuu) and also there are so many 5 star google reviews from other people who mention her name as their piercer, so i’m really excited to get my nipples pierced properly!\n\nWill update again after my next appointment (Wednesday) and this time I’ll check to make sure it actually updated the post!\n\nUpdate: appointment has been moved to Monday, I’ll let you guys know how it goes!",

You don't need to join the APP to pierce someone, but their standards are the highest in the industry, and I couldn't go anywhere that isn't certified myself.

    "body": "**Hypothesis:**\n\nAs we are all aware, the SEC has been in the news a lot lately specifically because of a highly public spat between two of the larger brands in the conference, Alabama and Texas A&M. There have been strong allegations of cheating, pay for play, and even a suggestion that one coaches father should have slapped them more as a child. However, as the media's attention continues to be focused on the verbal altercation between the coaches, I believe the real reason for Alabama's concern about Texas A&M has flown under the radar. I believe that Alabama is concerned that the strength of Texas's egg production industry will lead to an upheaval of the traditional SEC hierarchy and establish a competitive imbalance that Alabama will not be able to overcome.\n\n**Understanding Egg Production in the United States**\n\nAs I've established in previous investigative reports, agriculture yields by state have a direct impact to on-field production for various teams. Iowa's blowout win over Ohio State 5 years ago can directly be tied to Ohio's failure to [maintain competitive corn yields](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/7b1ab5/understanding_iowas_blowout_win_vs_osu/) and Georgia's ascendence to the CFP national title was easy to see coming when you looked into the data behind their [boiler chicken industry](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/85slzj/looking_at_the_future_of_the_sec/). The next battleground for the SEC is not in new recruiting tactics or aggressive oil collectives, it's clearly agricultural egg production within the state. While we all know that Texas A&M is the [iPhone of College Football](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/3hc8h9/cmv_a_successful_program_is_more_than_just_about/), it is the state of Texas's position as the [fifth largest egg producer](https://unitedegg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UEP_WebsiteGraphics_2021_TopTen.jpg) in the country that will create a new competitive moat for Texas A&M and eventually Texas.\n\n**Why Eggs are Important**\n\nFor college football players, eggs are packed with nutrients needed for a healthy diet. In fact, [some sources](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/11-most-nutrient-dense-foods-on-the-planet#_noHeaderPrefixedContent), consider eggs one of the most nutrient dense foods you can consume. A single large boiled egg [contains the following](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-proven-health-benefits-of-eggs#TOC_TITLE_HDR_2):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Vitamin A:** 6% of the RDA\n* **Folate:** 5% of the RDA\n* **Vitamin B5:** 7% of the RDA\n* **Vitamin B12:** 9% of the RDA\n* **Vitamin B2:** 15% of the RDA\n* **Phosphorus:** 9% of the RDA\n* **Selenium:** 22% of the RDA\n* Eggs also contain decent amounts of vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, vitamin B6, calcium and zinc\n\nThis all comes with only 77 calories while delivering 6 grams of protein and 5 grams of healthy fats. For the US as a whole, the benefits of eggs go even deeper. The US is the second largest exporter of eggs in the shell, accounting for [$515,351,000 in exports in 2015](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/top-15-exporters-of-eggs-in-shell.html#:~:text=Top%2015%20Exporters%20Of%20Eggs%20In%20Shell%20,%20%20%24273%2C457%2C000%20%2011%20more%20rows%20) and that continues to expand with the US Poultry and Egg Export Council claiming [record exports](https://www.usapeec.org/newsroom/news/poultryeggexportssetrecordsin2021/#:~:text=Table%20egg%20exports%20in%202021%20reached%20an%20all-time,export%20value%20in%202021%20increased%20by%2014.0%20percent) in 2021, and the 2021 college football national title game featured two SEC teams. We could make an argument that the ascent of the SEC is directly tied to the US egg industry as the US per capita egg production has been on a [consistent rise](https://unitedegg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UEP_WebsiteGraphics_2021_WebPerCapitaConsumption.jpg) since 2007-2008 when Florida & LSU beat the pants off Ohio State in consecutive years. The only dip in US egg consumption was 2016 and the following year Clemson beat Alabama in the national title game. More eggs clearly mean more success for the SEC, the data is undeniable.\n\n**The Looming Spector of Texas**\n\nTexas has consistently invested in egg production over the years, the state’s natural geographic footprint gives them a competitive advantage in many agricultural categories and eggs are no different. According to the [Texas State Historical Association](https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/poultry-production), the state of Texas ranked 9th in the US for egg production in 1900, by 1968 they were ranked 8th, 7th by 1988, and as I previously noted they are now the [highest egg producing state in the SEC](https://unitedegg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UEP_WebsiteGraphics_2021_TopTen.jpg) footprint surpassing Georgia nationally. Texas A&M's record-breaking recruiting class last year most likely has more to do with the states increased egg production than it does NIL payments to high school stars. This is notably important for the state of Alabama because, while eggs rank in the [top 3 of agricultural](https://www.jobmonkey.com/farming/state-top-crops/) exports from the state generating a [$15 billion economic impact on the state](https://www.alabamapoultry.org/) according to the Alabama Poultry and Egg Association, Alabama's egg [production ranks only 14th in the US](http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1650). The failure of Alabama's department of agriculture and their [commissioner Rick Pate](https://agi.alabama.gov/) to invest in Egg production is leading to a college football environment that they cannot compete in, Nick Saban clearly recognizes that fact and called out Texas A&M to draw attention to their growing egg production.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nPoultry and eggs are key agricultural products for the SEC, and the success of each states individual industry will directly impact the success of the major university football teams in the state. Nick Saban believes Alabama must invest more heavily in egg production if Alabama hopes to compete with well egg-funded athletic departments within Georgia and Texas, and he's right.",

    "body": "# Jewelry\n\nWearing quality jewelry is extremely important.\n\n**The best jewelry for stretching your ear lobes are \"Single Flare Glass Plugs.\"**   Acrylic & cheap metal plugs should never be used. Avoid double  flare plugs or use them with extreme caution & never use them for  stretching.\n\nPorous jewelry: wood, stone, etc should not be worn in a freshly pierced piercing.\n\nAlways buy jewelry from a known good manufacturer.\n\nSome of the Quality Jewelry Manufacturers Are:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [Anometal](http://anatometal.com/)\n* [Industrial Strength](http://www.isbodyjewelry.com/)\n* [NeoMetal](http://www.neometal.com/)\n* [Glasswear Studios](http://www.glasswearstudios.com/)\n* [Gorilla Glas](http://www.getgorilla.com/)s\n\n## Why Glass Single Flare Plugs?\n\nSingle flare plugs have a gentle tapered edge which makes inserting  the jewelry easy and comfortable. The risk of damage is very low. Glass  is extremely smooth, non-porous and can also be autoclaved, making it an  excellent choice for a fresh piercing.\n\nSingle Flare *Implant Grade* Titanium/Surgical Steel Plugs & Tunnels would be the next best option. Wood is also a good because it holds oils well, **however** it is very porous, not nearly as smooth as glass and it can also tend to stick to your lobes a bit when removing the jewelry.\n\n## O-Rings\n\nPeople often have trouble losing O-Rings.\n\nBehold! [X-Ring - Nitrile No-Roll O-Rings.](http://bodyartforms.com/productdetails.asp?ProductID=10515)  These beauties stay put much better than normal o-rings...  Unfortunately, they only come in sizes from 8 gauge to 1\". So until you  get to 8 gauge, you'll have to suffer with normal O-Rings.\n\n## Stretching Basics\n\nLubrication is **key** when stretching and everyday  maintenance. The products below are very good for keeping your lobes  healthy & moisturized. When mixed with beeswax, they will work for  twice as long.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [Jojoba Oil](https://www.amazon.com/Viva-Naturals-Pressed-Hexane-Organic/dp/B01AYG74DK/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1488192485&sr=8-3&keywords=organic+jojoba+oil)\n* [Coconut Oil](https://www.amazon.com/Carrington-Farms-Organic-Virgin-Coconut/dp/B00CPZPYLS/ref=sr_1_4_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1488192516&sr=8-4&keywords=organic+coconut+oil)\n* [Avocado Oil](https://www.amazon.com/Avocado-Oil-Sky-Organics-Aromatherapy/dp/B01I3ZVI86/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1488192560&sr=8-1&keywords=organic+avocado+oil)\n* [Emu Oil](https://www.amazon.com/Australian-Triple-Refined-Organic-100/dp/B00KGNPOUW/ref=sr_1_18_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1488192593&sr=1-18&keywords=emu+oil)\n* [Raw Cocoa Butter](https://www.amazon.com/Cocoa-Butter-Raw-Pure-Unrefined/dp/B00CIZ0DNO/ref=sr_1_8_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1488192663&sr=8-8&keywords=organic+raw+cocoa+butter)\n\n**Always keep your lobes well lubricated!**\n\nEspecially when inserting jewelry!\n\n**Patience is a Virtue!**\n\nThe longer you wait in-between stretching the better.\n\nBelow is a approximate time line you can follow. When in doubt, wait longer.\n\nThe approximate healing/wait times in-between stretches are as follows:\n\n1. Fresh Piercing 5 to 6 months\n2. 14g to 12g 1+ month\n3. 12g to 10g 1.5+ months\n4. 10g to 8g 2+ months\n5. 8g to 6g 3+ months\n6. 6g to 4g 3+ month\n7. 4g to 2g 3+ months\n8. 2g to 1g 4+ months\n9. 1g to 0g 4+ months\n10. 0g to 9mm+ 4+ months\n\nThese are just general recommendations. It is important to note that **some people may need to go slower.** It can be VERY hard to tell if you are going too fast. Stretching is not a race. The question should **never** be \"How fast can I go?\" But rather: \"How *slow* should I go to avoid doing any damage.\"\n\n## TAPERS\n\n**Tapers should never be used for stretching.** Tapers  can (and often do) easily cause severe damage before you realize what is  happening. This is due to to the very gradual increase in size. The  only person that may need to use one of these tools is a professional  piercer.\n\n## How To Stretch Your Lobes\n\nThe best method of stretching is simply \"dead-stretching\" using  Single Flare Plugs. What this means is you simply insert new plugs that  are slightly larger than what you have been currently wearing for a good  amount of time.\n\nIt’s become fairly easy to find Glass Plugs in 1MM and even .5MM  increments. The smaller the increase in size, the safer it is. You  should never stretch more than 1MM at a time.\n\nFor example, if you wanted to stretch from 14 gauge to 00 Gauge, you would buy sets of plugs in each of these sizes:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 14 Gauge (1.6MM)\n* 12 Gauge (2MM)\n* 10 Gauge (2.5MM)\n* 8 Gauge (3MM)\n* 6 Gauge (4MM)\n* 4 Gauge (5MM)\n* 2 Gauge (6MM)\n* 1 Gauge (7MM)\n* 0 Gauge (8MM)\n* 0 Gauge (9MM) <-- Always find half-sizes, the smaller the stretch the better.\n* 00 Gauge (10MM)\n* **You can find jewelry in .5MM sizes here:** [Gorilla Glass .5MM Plugs](https://www.laughingbuddhabodypiercing.com/piercing-jewelry/single-flare-stretching-kit-plugs/) & [Nirvana Glass .5MM Plugs](https://www.etsy.com/shop/NirvanaGlassMods)\n\nWear each pair for the recommended time (see above) or longer! After a  while, your ears naturally stretch enough to wear the next size. If you  ever feel tingling sensations, burning, pain, or any other sensation  after stretching, downsize immediately.\n\nIf you cannot (easily) fit the next pair of plugs after the average  time necessary, then you can use a small amount of weight suspended  through a pair of metal tunnels. Do not use glass or organic tunnels as  these can break. Only use weights for a short time each day (2-4 hours)  and give your lobes time to rest after their use. **Weights should only be used as a last resort.**\n\nTaping is a method of stretching in which one or more layers of PTFE  or Bondage tape are wrapped around jewelry to increase diameter.  Although this *can* be done safely, it's possible to cut your  lobes on the sharp edges of bondage tape. PTFE tape is thin & hard  to work with, tends to stick to your lobes and is extremely hard to keep  smooth. The methods previously mentioned are a far better option.\n\n## Gauges\n\nYou should completely ignore what “Gauge” your jewelry is past 2  Gauge. Instead, start measuring in Millimeters. Get yourself a decent  caliper:\n\n[Vinca Digital Caliper](https://www.amazon.com/VINCA-DCLA-0605-Electronic-Fractions-Conversion/dp/B017KUC6XQ/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1487982416&sr=8-4&keywords=caliper)\n\n[Empire Pocket Caliper](https://www.amazon.com/Empire-Level-2783-Pocket-Caliper/dp/B0002H33TQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1487982452&sr=8-1&keywords=empire+)\n\nYou can find these at your local hardware or department store. They  will help you measure your jewelry and confirm you received the correct  size.\n\n**Warning:** Nearly all jewelry varies a bit in size due to being hand-made!\n\nA pair of 18.5MM plugs that I ordered from Gorilla Glass were  actually 18.66MM and 18.78MM... This means that on average the  measurements were off by .22MM. In my opinion, this pair was off a bit  more than usual and I wouldn't accept anything off by more than that.\n\n## Keeping your Lobes Healthy\n\nIt is standard practice to remove your jewelry while you are  sleeping. This helps to promote circulation to the ear lobes and  prevents thinning.\n\nThere are exceptions to the rule such as when you are  about to  stretch, or have recently stretched. However, some people simply cannot  leave their jewelry out for 8 hours. The point is to allow your lobes  time to rest each day, while still being able to easily & gently  insert your jewelry again.\n\n2-4 weeks **AFTER AND BEFORE** a stretch, you should  leave the jewelry in while you sleep. Each day after you shower still  remove the jewelry, gently massage & re-lubricate your lobes, and  let them rest for **at least 1 hour!**\n\nT**ry not to sleep on your earlobes after a stretch.**  Instead practice sleeping on your back. There are pillows that have the  center cut out that you can find, usually labeled as \"travel pillows.\"  You can also cut your own using foam.\n\nIf you are trying to re-absorb a blow-out or reduce the \"cat-butt\"  effect, lubricating and gently massaging your lobes 3 times a day may  prove to be beneficial.\n\n## How to Make \"Ear Butter\"\n\nIt is incredibly simple to make your own ear butters.\n\nFor the ear butter you will need the following ingredients:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [Coconut Oil = 1 TBSP ](https://www.amazon.com/Carrington-Farms-Organic-Virgin-Coconut/dp/B00CPZPYLS/ref=sr_1_4_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1488192516&sr=8-4&keywords=organic+coconut+oil)\n* [Vitamin E Oil = 1 TBSP](https://www.amazon.com/SALE-Tocopherol-Organic-Anti-Aging-Antioxidant/dp/B01IB3P0N4/ref=sr_1_2_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1506518831&sr=8-2&keywords=Organic+Vitamin+E+Oil+8+oz)\n* [Jojoba Oil = 1 TBSP](https://www.amazon.com/Viva-Naturals-Pressed-Hexane-Organic/dp/B01AYG74DK/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1488192485&sr=8-3&keywords=organic+jojoba+oil)\n* [Raw Organic Cocoa Butter = 1 TBSP](https://www.amazon.com/Cocoa-Butter-Raw-Pure-Unrefined/dp/B00CIZ0DNO/ref=sr_1_4_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1505929308&sr=8-4&keywords=raw+organic+cocoa+butter)\n* [Emu Oil (AEA Certified Always) = 1 TBSP](https://www.amazon.com/PRO-EMU-OIL-Natural-Emu/dp/B001DKGJQU/ref=sr_1_1_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1505929371&sr=1-1&keywords=Pro%2BEmu%2BOil%2B8%2Boz&th=1)\n* [Organic Beeswax =  1 TBSP for a soft \"butter,\" or 2 TBSP for a firmer mix](https://www.amazon.com/ChefLand-ORGANIC-Beeswax-Cosmetic-Filtered/dp/B00455IWK6/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1488193128&sr=8-3&keywords=organic+beeswax)\n\nInstructions:\n\nYou will need two pots, a large pot filled with water, and a small  pot to set inside the larger pot which will float on top of the water.  This is how you make a double boiler.\n\n**1.** Place pots on stove, on Low heat.\n\n**2.** Add all ingredients to small pot.\n\n**3.** Slowly allow all the ingredients to melt together.\n\n**4.** Stir thoroughly & pour into small mason jar or other container and allow to cool at room temp.\n\nWhen cooled, it should be creamy to slightly firm depending on how  much beeswax you decide to use. If it is too hard for your liking, melt  mixture back down and add more oils. If it is too soft add more beeswax.\n\n## Remember: It's Not a Race! Be Safe!\n\nI have written this article to pass on the knowledge given to me by  \\*professionals. I have had over a dozen (trusted) professionals read  over this guide to verify it's safety & accuracy according to  current standards in the industry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* I do not claim to be a  professional piercer nor do I work in the body modification industry.

I do get that tapers are bad to use after 2g, since it's too big of a jump to do at once, but when you're just going .5mm increments every few months, I wouldn't consider that big.

    "body": "1. oil.  I never oiled when I first started bearding.  I started this time and I wish I could hop in a DeLorian, speed up to the necessary 88 miles per hour, jump out of the car slap my past self for this.  Jojoba is a great ingredient to have in your beard oil, it is the closest replicant to the sebum oil that your skin produces.  tea tree oil is good for killing fungus and cutting down beardruff. vitamin E is a good oil for the health of your skin which is in-turn good for the health of your beard.  good oil will make rubbing your beard feel like you are combing your fingers through silk. \n\n\n2. light trimming.  every few weeks just do some basic trimming.  not enough to lose length, just get rid of those straggly hairs and this will help with removing split ends.  but if you use oil, the split end isue should not be as big of a problem.  Don't use an electrical trimmer, those just leave a crap-ton of split ends.  Use good barber scissors.  those do the trick.\n\n\n3. Condition!  CONDITION YOUR BEARD!!! I had to repeat it to get this through.  conditioning your beard will do wonders for the health of your beard.  slap on a good amount, set it and forget it...for a few minutes. don't put it on and then rinse it off within moments.  that is just a waste of conditioner.  rinse it off after a few minutes have passed. I've noticed that the best conditioners are the ones that you rub between your fingers and they leave your fingers feeling slippery after you rinse \n\n\n4. don't trim after shower!! for the love of god, don't make this mistake.  When you are fresh out of the shower, your beard hairs are heavy with water and your beard will appear longer than it usually appears when dry.  as soon as it dries, it will shrink as a result of the water evaporating and the hairs not being weighed down, allowing them to spring back up.  if you trim after you shower, you will probably cut off far more than what you desire and you'll get sad that you lost half a month's worth of growth.  don't pull out the scissors until AFTER your beard has dried. \n\n5. Boars hair brush.  brushing in general is something you gotta do to promote good healthy growth.  it stimulates the hair follicles and speeds up growth as well (this is what my stylist taught me).  it also keeps the skin down there healthy which is definitely a big deal since you don't want flaky skin and beardruff (oiling is also important for this reason).  A boars hair brush is the greatest purchase I have ever made for my daily beard upkeep.  CVS sells a two sided one that's only $4!! not sure if it's real boars hair, probably not, but it's great nonetheless. the brush is better than a comb because it does a great job of dispersing the oils in your beard around evenly.  a little gets on your brush but that makes the brush better.  it's personal value goes up with use...though don't try selling it secondhand for more money using the argument that its covered in your beard oils.  I don't know how well that sales pitch will work.  then again, with the stuff people buy on Craigslist nowadays, I wouldn't be amazed. \n\n\n6. genetics. don't get frustrated trying to replicate someone elses beard.  more likely than not, you won't be able to get the same look, thickness, shape, yada yada yada.   beards are like fingerprints.  their appearances are greatly dictated by your genes and unless you are an identical twin or a clone, you are a very unique set of genes, with a unique beard.  let it grow naturally and appreciate that you are growing a one-of-a-kind gem that no one else has on the planet.  you may think some gems are prettier than others, but no one can take a sapphire and turn it into a diamond.  Also, some people like sapphires more than diamonds.  \n\n7. friends and family will try to convince you to shave.   A few years ago, I decided to not give a shit what my friends and family were telling me about shaving.  what happened?  within two months of growth, I got a call from Warner Bros to audition for a movie.   I got a small speaking part in Argo (http://imgur.com/hkhH2Zg and also http://imgur.com/PSYMWHp  @ approximately 2.5 months growth).  It turns out, I was one of the few people that went to the background extra call prepared with a beard.  as a result, they said I matched the look they want and they gave me an audition, an upgrade to a small speaking part, and movie credits too.  I learned a very valuable lesson that day.  Your beard is your own business.  If I had listened to others and shaved my beard, then I wouldn't have had such an amazing life experience, not to mention a check off the bucket list. people will say that a beard is dirty.  they have no idea what they are talking about!  A good beard requires SO MUCH UPKEEP.  Other parts of my body are probably starting to get jealous with how much attention I'm lavishing on my beard. I wish having a good beard was accomplished by doing nothing and being dirty, alas that ain't the way it is. \n\nMy beard @ [2 months](http://imgur.com/lvBnose)\n\nUPDATE:      [3 months](http://imgur.com/a/FcCIw)\n\nUPDATE 2:    [3.5 months](http://i.imgur.com/hmQaL7W.jpg)\n\nUpdate 3: [4.5 months](http://i.imgur.com/p6v7OTi.jpg?1)\n\nUpdate 4: [5 months](https://imgur.com/a/OprcL)\n\nUpdate 5: [6 months](http://i.imgur.com/gOtQ9UR.jpg?1)\n\n[7 months](http://imgur.com/r/beards/S04Hg9Y/)\n\nBe patient, KEEP ON BEARDING!!\n",

    "body": "**EDIT:** Wow guys, I did not expect this to blow up like it did. I want to thank each of you for taking the time to read through my story and share your thoughts and perspectives. I just want to say: by no means am I saying that I'm a \"success\" (which is subjective by definition, and there's still a lot of things I want to work towards and change) nor that all situations and difficulties can be overcome. What I do know is that I was very, very lucky to have two amazing, selfless, and loving parents who encouraged me down the path I've taken today.\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nI know this might come off as bragging and boasting, but it isn't intended to be. If you don't like it - please just ignore. These are things that I don't say aloud to others because it can be misconstrued.\n\nI was born in China 25 years ago. My mom left my father and me when I was 3 months old for the US; she'd gotten a scholarship for her graduate degree and was the lone person in all of our family to leave China. When I was 3 years old, my dad and I joined her. We had all our belongings packed and pretty much any money we had went into those airplane tickets. I remember those years vaguely. The three of us were crammed in a tiny one-bedroom apartment, my dad worked at a buffet and delivered newspapers in the morning, my mother was perpetually never home. One of my most vivid memories of that time is when I was around five years of age; I was so hungry one day that I ate an entire pack of my mom's Vitamin E pills thinking they were candy. I can recall with startling clarity the fear in my dad's face when he'd discovered what I had done, and how my parents stood around me in the bathroom as I was forced to throw it up.\n\nI give full credit to my parents for their hard work and for instilling in me the importance of education and drive. When I hit 18 years of age, I applied and was accepted to 3 Ivy Leagues, one of which was my top choice given its curriculum and its proximity to home. After four painful, grueling, and truly humbling years, I graduated and immediately moved to New York City to start working as a full-time Business Analyst. Three years later, I just purchased my own place (albeit strapped with a 20 year mortgage) and my annual salary has tipped the 6 digit mark.\n\nI know firsthand that life isn't easy and that there are some truly difficult families and situations people are born into; those things aren't in their control. But your starting point doesn't define your end point, so don't underestimate the power of perseverance and hard work.",

You and I sound very similar as I'm almost in a complete similar situation as you, a little younger, similar salary, poor growing up, etc.\n\nBut to start things off, I don't like the term 6-figures, to most people it's a powerful word, but to me, its very meaningless. A lot of fresh grads (especially developers working for Facebook and other big tech companies) start out making six figures but it's in expensive areas like SF and NY. In cheaper states their salary probably isn't more than 60k-80k. To hell with that though, all that matters is that they can say they make six figures right? \n\nMoreover, six figures is such a general term, if you are in the low 100s you probably aren't doing anything too crazy that someone making 60-80k can't already do, but they certainly don't get to use the term six figures. And low to mid 100s is pretty much the cap for most people in STEM /business fields. You reach that cap by just doing what you're told for your entire career like another cog in the wheel. \n\nTo me six figures truly starts out at 250k+ because that's an income that's impressive no matter what state you go to. That's the income that lets you get the Benz, first class flights and large home in upper middle class America. That's the income that has shown you've worked your way up either by becoming an executive or an entrepreneur. Even then though someone making 900k is way better off than someone making 250k yet somehow they are both classified as six figures? \n\nI'm not ragging on you in any way, though I was a just a little disappointed when I saw that you live in NY where salaries are pretty high already for the inflated market. This rant was in no way targeted towards you as it's just been building up inside me and I had to let it out! Good luck with everything!",

I had a fresh new pair of underwear laid out. I’ve been using clove essential oil mixed with castor oil for my hair—just a few drops in my hand, rub it on my scalp, feel the nice burn. All good.\n\nBut tonight, I foolishly moved my long-ass arms and knocked the cap off the clove oil. It flew across the room and landed on the ground. No big deal… or so I thought.\n\nAbout a minute later, I feel the most horrible pain imaginable. Like—worse than getting all four of my wisdom teeth out. It literally felt like my balls were being melted off in real time.\n\nTurns out, there must’ve been just enough clove oil on the cap, and somehow it got onto my balls when I bent over or something. I sprinted to the bathroom, washed with water (which made it burn even worse), and stood there half-naked in full regret mode.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity, I slapped some vitamin E oil on there. Blessed relief. The pain stopped. But now I’ve got blisters, shame, and trauma.\n\nAnyway… I hate having long arms. But I think my balls will be okay.\n\nTL;DR I put clove oil on my balls and it burnt so bad that I thought I was going to pass out and there is blisters everywhere and I don’t think I’m going to recover\n\n____\n\n># Notable Comments:\n\n- \n\nBrother you have chemical burns on your balls, you need to go to the hospital.\n\nTrust me when I say they won't judge you for it--they've seen worse and far more idiotic things.

She told me that the strongest painkiller she could give me without a prescription was what I'd already tried but suggested clove oil drops as an alternative. It worked - by initially hurting so much that the toothache became a secondary concern and then possibly sending the nerve into a coma.

I was just going to stay home and chill, but then the comments urged me to go to the doctor. I go to the doctor and tell me why, as I told a nice Indian male doctor my issue, he laughed in my face for a whole five minutes……… That was so embarrassing 🫠 I wanted to sink into the void. He then asked me, “Why I was actually here,” and I told him, “No, I’m serious.” He then put on a stern face, and he ended up checking me out. I had to retell the story to him (bro had to squeeze the balls to make sure everything was ok). He ended up prescribing me a hydrocortisone and told me to not wear any jeans and wear loose underwear. The reddening of the skin is still there, and I hope there won’t be scars … only time will tell, but un, yeah. I’ll never make that dumb mistake again I still haven’t told my parents I ended up just taking a Lyft because I didn’t want my parents to have another reason to be disappointed in me 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😭\n\nAnd for everything saying this is an AI story … I WOULD NEVER LIE about my balls burning! That was the WORST PAIN EVER!!!!!! Like it literally brought tears to my eyes And yeah, lol 😂\n\nAlso there is minor blisters (they look god awful scary and I don’t want to see them anymore) he said so it should go away with the help of the oitnent cream  \n\nTL;DR:I burnt my balls and was going to stay home until people told me to go to the doctors\n\n____\n\n># Notable Comments:\n\n- \n\nPlease do not worry about scars on your balls.

    "body": "Nuts might be small, but their power is massive. Every time you eat a handful of nuts, you’re giving your body some of the strongest tools to fight aging and protect your health. Studies from top universities and medical journals show that people who eat nuts daily live longer, healthier lives. They have fewer heart attacks, less cancer, better brain health, and stronger immune systems. It’s not magic, it’s just the perfect mix of healthy fats, antioxidants, minerals, and plant power packed into one simple food.\n\nThe best part is how nuts work with your body on so many levels. They feed your heart with omega-3s, magnesium, and good fats that clean your arteries and lower blood pressure. They protect your brain with vitamin E and polyphenols that boost memory and slow down cognitive decline. And they go deep into your cells, helping to repair DNA, reduce inflammation, and support mitochondrial function — which is one of the keys to staying younger longer.\n\nYou don’t need much. A small handful a day is enough to make a real difference. People worry about calories or fat, but the science is clear: nuts actually help with weight control. They keep you full, stabilize blood sugar, and even help reduce belly fat. They’re a natural energy booster too. If you’ve ever felt your mood and energy lift after eating almonds or walnuts, that’s not your imagination — your body knows it’s getting something real.\n\nThere’s also a beauty to how nuts make you feel from the inside out. They support glowing skin, healthier nails and hair, and steady energy that lasts without crashes. Your heart, your brain, your skin, your immune system — they all love nuts. And when you eat them every day, it’s like sending your body a little message: I want you to stay strong. I want you to live long. I want you to thrive.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing the best ones, walnuts are the champion for brain health and inflammation. Almonds shine for skin, heart, and bone support. Pistachios help with eyes and blood pressure. Brazil nuts are unbeatable for selenium, but just one or two is enough. Hazelnuts and pecans are full of antioxidants and healthy fats that slow down aging. And macadamia nuts give your heart the same kind of love as olive oil does — rich, smooth, and steady.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if you eat them raw or dry-roasted, just go for unsalted and simple. Toss them into salads, mix them with fruit, add them to smoothies, or just eat them plain. They’re easy, tasty, and one of the smartest daily habits you can build for your health.\n\nSo if you’re looking for a natural way to live longer, feel stronger, and fight off disease as you age, don’t overcomplicate it. Nature already gave you the answer. A handful of nuts a day can change your life — and possibly even save it.\n\nTell the people you care about. Share a bowl of almonds with a friend. Pack a snack bag of walnuts for work. Start a new tradition at home. These little things matter. And they add up to years of energy, vitality, and health that you’ll be grateful for every single day.",

    "body": "Hello everyone! \n\nI'm a new dad. During the pregnancy, like many first-time parents, my wife and I were constantly researching and planning for the big day. Last year saw a Reddit post here that helped me, decided to pay it forward with this post.\n\nOne of the most challenging things we faced was trying to understand the total cost involved—from regular prenatal check-ups, scans, and consultations to the actual delivery. We noticed that while there’s plenty of information on what to expect physically and emotionally during pregnancy, there was very little available on the financial side of things, especially from real experiences. This made it tough to budget and plan properly.\n\nNow that I’ve gone through the entire journey, I wanted to share my personal experience and give a transparent breakdown of the costs we incurred. I hope this post will help other new couples and first-time expecting parents feel more prepared and less uncertain about what to expect financially during such an important time.\n\nWe chose Aster RV Hospital mainly because of Dr. Bhawna Mishra. After reading numerous positive reviews about her, we decided to have her as our OBGYN—and we are glad we did.\n\n***Disclaimer****: This is based on my personal experience. My wife had a low-risk pregnancy, so she only needed the standard scans and a few additional medications, aside from the basic supplements. Costs can vary depending on the case and the hospital. This is just to give you a rough estimate of what to expect. I kept track of all my expenses, so the amounts shared here are what I personally incurred.*\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, I have bifurcated the costs into 4 major categories:\n\n\n\n|Category|Cost (INR)|Details|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Tests and Scans|33430|**Tests**: HCG Blood Test, Antenatal Profile, HCV, Immunology, Double Marker, Urine culture test, SGPT, Hb, Glucose, LFT, Bile Acid, HBA1C etc.                         **Scans**: Early pregnancy ultrasound, NT Scan, Anomaly Scan, Fetal Echo, Growth Scan, End Term Scan|\n|Medicines|19549|Iron, Calcium, Multivitamin, Ecospirin, Udiliv (this was only prescribed for 1 month to reduce my SGPT), Progesterone Tablets (for short term), Tetanus Injection, Boostrix Injection, Influenza Vaccine, Vitamin E Tablets|\n|Doctor's consultation|11,800|You can save 30% by visiting the Doctor at her clinic. We just chose the hospital based on convenience.|\n|Delivery (C-Section)|1,32,000|My wife had a C-section delivery, though there wasn't much difference in cost compared to a normal delivery. The delivery expenses totaled ₹1.05 lakhs, and the costs for the baby, including vaccines, came to around ₹30,000. Thankfully, our baby had no complications or jaundice, so we didn’t need to pay extra for NICU care.|\n|Total (Essentials)|1,96,779||\n|1Y Vaccine package|15,000|Opt at the Hospital or at your local Paediatrician. We chose the latter due to HepV vaccine shortage at all private hopitals|\n|Lifetime StemCell preservation|62,000|We chose Cryoviva public repository.|\n|Total (overall)|2,73,779||\n\nTakeaways from my experience:\n\no   Do thorough research before choosing an OBGYN. If you have a personal reference or know someone reliable, that’s great. But if you’re unsure, like we were, it’s important to take the time to find the right doctor.\n\no   Also, research the hospital you plan to deliver at, especially the nursing staff. While the doctor is crucial, they’re typically only there during the actual delivery. For the majority of your stay, you’ll be under the care of the nurses and resident doctors.\n\no   It's perfectly fine to have your tests and scans done outside the hospital.\n\no   Check if the hospital offers any complimentary tests or scans if you book a room early (usually around the third month of pregnancy).",

Normal delivery is the best option for the mother and kid but since C-section makes more money and lesser hassle, these doctors/ hospitals push for it.\n\nIn our case, my wife had good pregnancy (in terms of health and other issues that pop up during this period) and she was keen on normal delivery. Our doctor kept saying that we will do normal delivery but on the day when her water broke, she have some random excuse to push for C-section.\n\nNow imagine a scenario that you are in hospital and doctor is giving you mandate that choose C-section now otherwise your baby will be at risk - we caved in and went with c-section only to realise later that it wasn’t a big issue. She just emotionally manipulated us to make her money.\n\nThere is a documentary on YouTube explaining this rampant scam in India.\n\nAll the future parents - be aware of this scam",

They schedule deliveries in advance, but since no one can predict the exact delivery time, this isn’t always accurate. Once scheduled, you're often asked to book a bed. When the date arrives, regardless of whether labor starts naturally, patients are admitted. If labor hasn’t begun, they often induce it artificially using medication, which frequently fails to natural delivery. After induction there is no going back, there's a 24-36 hour window for delivery, leading to panic and, ultimately, a C-section. The patient is then discharged within a day or two, and the cycle repeats.\n\n**Reason 2:** Some doctors or hospitals avoid natural delivery because it requires patience, and they may lack confidence in handling unpredictable situations. To avoid risks and protect their reputation, they opt for C-sections.",

    "body": "Hello, here's a complete guide on how to prevent wrinkles as much as possible.\n\nBefore going into cosmetic procedures, it is important to know that wrinkles are HEAVILY influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Twin studies estimate that genetics account for up to 60 % of the variation in wrinkle development, but lifestyle choices such as sun exposure, smoking, and stress markedly accelerate aging ([article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/712313?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).\n\n* **Eat, sleep and drink well**\n\nBefore anything, you need to focus on what you're giving your body to work with. *Whole foods* rich in antioxidants support collagen integrity and combat oxidative stress. Drinking water (MORE than 2 L/day and please water with electrolytes) helps maintain both superficial and deep skin hydration which improves elasticity and reduces fine lines. \n*Sleep* is crucial for skin regeneration. Aim for 7-10 hours per night to allow your body to repair and regenerate collagen, as most of this process happens during deep sleep.\n\n* **Stress-free life**\n\nChronic stress elevates cortisol, which inhibits collagen synthesis, increases collagen-degrading enzyme activity, and delays barrier recovery—changes that accelerate wrinkle formation ([article 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4082169/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [article 2](https://columbiaskinclinic.com/skin-care/how-stress-affects-your-skin/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). Techniques such as meditation, yoga, and journaling can meaningfully lower cortisol levels and help with wrinkle prevention ([article](https://www.byrdie.com/does-stress-cause-wrinkles-8703479?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).\n\n* **Skincare** \n\n*Prescription tretinoin* improves fine lines, mottled pigmentation, and skin texture within one month, with benefits lasting up to 24 months.\n\nDaily application of a *sunscreen* (SPF 30 or higher) completely prevented detectable skin aging over 4.5 years in a randomized trial ([article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23732711/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [article](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/0003-4819-158-11-201306040-00001?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). \n\nSerums containing 15 % L-ascorbic acid (*Vitamin C*), 1 % α-tocopherol, and 0.5 % ferulic acid reduced wrinkle depth by up to 36 % and improved firmness in 12 weeks ([article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16185284/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). \n\n*Niacinamide* at 5 % reduces fine lines, hyperpigmentation, and sallowness and enhances elasticity over 12 weeks ([article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16029679/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).\n\n*Red light therapy* boosts collagen and smooth fine lines. Studies report up to a 30 % reduction in wrinkle volume after just eight twice-weekly sessions of 633 nm light ([article](https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/red-light-therapy-for-wrinkles/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)), and home-use devices (633 nm + 830 nm) used three times per week for 12 weeks improve skin texture, elasticity, and collagen density.\n\n* **Cosmetic procedures** \n\n*Microneedling* delivers controlled micro-injuries that stimulate dermal collagen types I, III, and VII, resulting in noticeable reductions in fine lines and wrinkles within weeks ([article](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11499218/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). \n\n*Botox* injections can relax facial muscles and inhibit the formation of deep dynamic lines before they set in.\n\n* **Supplements** \n\n*Oral collagen peptides* (10 g/day) significantly improved skin hydration and elasticity over eight weeks ([article](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8125628/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). \n\n*Hyaluronic acid* supplementation (120+ mg/day) reduced wrinkle volume and increased skin luster and suppleness in a 12-week, placebo-controlled trial ([article](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5522662/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). \n\n*MSM* at 1–3 g/day significantly reduced wrinkles and improved firmness, elasticity, and hydration in a randomized study ([article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32083522/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). \n\n*Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA)* attenuate collagen degradation by inhibiting MMP induction and support skin barrier function and anti-inflammatory processes; cell and small human studies show protection from photoaging ([article](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6117694/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).\n\n*Astaxanthin* (8 mg/day) improved skin elasticity, hydration, and reduced fine lines and age spots in 6- to 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled studies ([article](https://abp.ptbioch.edu.pl/index.php/abp/article/view/2168)).\n\n* **Misc:**\n\n\\-> layer antioxidants in the morning and retinoids at night  \n\\-> NEVER skip daily sunscreen  \n\\-> if possible, consult a board-certified dermatologist before starting prescription actives or procedures. \n\nEDIT: added astaxanthin and sleep",

That’s a shit ton of sunscreen. With a spray or a stick you aren’t likely to get a heavy enough application. That’s why lotion is best.\n\nHigher SPF has a better chance of protecting since most people when using sunscreens do not get fully efficacy of whatever SPF they’re using due to application being tricky.\n\nFor daily use with an indoor job, 30 is probably fine as long as you reapply like once. Sunscreen loses efficacy after 2 hours in the sun, or if it’s physically sweated/rubbed off of your face.\n\nOn mobile but I can provide sources if anyone specifically wants some.",

    "body": "Let me add this disclaimer since there's a little bit of confusion, I wrote this for people who have never shaved before or have really bad skin or have really bad skin irritations. as for myself I have to be careful what body wash I use even what laundry detergent I use so I don't end up with a rash. And of course everything that I use is hypoallergenic.\n\nI don't want people to shave and then get bumps all over and then give up and look like a Sasquatch in a dress, I want you all to look nice and cute and pretty.\n\nOkay let me give you all some shaving tips from a trans girl since so many of you guys say that you end up slicing yourself into sushi.\n\n1. NEVER USE THE SAME FOR FACIAL HAIR AND BODY HAIR (you will slice the shit out of yourself).\n\n2. Shave your body hair AFTER you shower or take a bath so your skin is softer.\n\n3. Use a good multi-blade razor, especially if you're going to shave the down there places (you definitely don't want blood pouring out of your junk so get a good decent razor) I shave completely I don't even like hair on my \"little girl\".\n\n4. Get a decent shave gel, don't get the dollar store crap or the barbasol, get a good shave gel for sensitive skin so that will help with razor burn.\n\n5. Shave with the grain, be it arms, legs, tummy, etc.\n\n6. Don't rush it, you'll have less cuts, take your time enjoy yourself shaving and relax knowing that you no longer look like Chewbacca in a skirt.\n\n7. After you shave your legs use lotion like cocoa butter or vitamin E or aloe so you don't get razor burn on your legs and end up with what looks like pimples going from your hips down to your feet.\n\n8. If you're going to shave the down there, and you know what I mean by the down there, do it very slowly and if you have a lot of pubic hair trim it with scissors first.\n\n9. When shaving the down there if you are amab, it is best to get yourself hard and shave it while you are hard so you don't slice yourself. Being a trans girl I learned that the hard way no pun intended.\n\n10. DON'T USE AFTERSHAVE WHEN YPU SHAVE YOUR BODY HAIR ESPECIALLY THE DOWN THERE!!!  It will burn worse than anything in the world basically think of dumping rubbing alcohol on your weenie.\n\nAnd my apologies if I have paragraphs running into each other, got to love reddit's Android mobile formatting.....",

    "body": "Description on website:\n“Lip balm that imparts a subtle fragrance at the tip of your nose. It provides immediate nourishment with rich plant-based oils, keeping dry lips moist and soft. The scent, made with safe ingredients, is packaged in a handy case resembling the smooth curves and texture of an egg, giving you a pleasant feeling anytime, anywhere.”\n\nhttps://www.tamburins.com/en/item/1695801896/\n\n\nI love eggs so the adorable container is instantly appealing, i love drinking milk tea and it smells like one, i could always use more lip balms, so i decided to get one when i saw it at ICN.\n\n \nBought for USD19 duty-free at ICN airport.\n\n\nMy lips are okay, doesnt get dry or crack often that i need lip balm everyday but they’re nice to layer under my lip colour or gloss.\n\n\nPackaging & Application:\n * Egg-shaped tube, twist up for more product. Comes in a sturdy, fancy box. Great for gifting.\n\n\n * Material & Design:\nEgg container is most likely made out of some plastic material but textured to resemble real eggshell. Imagine the softest sandpaper. No info on website.\n\n\n * Ease of Use:\nOpen cap, apply directly. Twist up the egg for more product.\n\n\n * Portability: It’s a flat little egg and fits in \n the slimmest bags, very handy.\n\n\n * Durability: Sturdy, quality packaging. Use some caution when taking cap off and putting back on. Certain angles may cause the cap to come in contact with the balm. I accidentally scooped a tiny bit of it just now with the cap.\n\n\nIngredients & Formulation:\n * Bis-Behenyl/Isostearyl/Phytosteryl Dimer Dilinoleyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil Dimer Dilinoleate, Phytosteryl/Isostearyl/Cetyl/Stearyl/Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Wax, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Seed Oil, Phytosteryl/Behenyl/Octyldodecyl Lauroyl Glutamate, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Synthetic Wax, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Fragrance(Parfum), Benzyl Alcohol, Linalool, Lecithin, Geraniol, Limonene, Tocopherol\n\n\nManufactured by Cosmax Co. Ltd.\n\n\n * feels oily, smooth and thin upon application- elegant formulation.\n\n\nScent & Flavor:\n\nTop: bergamot, lemon \nMiddle: black tea \nBase: coconut\n\nWebsite:  “based on black tea with a subtle flower smell, this scent brings you the soft scent on the tip of your nose when you drink a glass of black tea with a drop of warm milk, and the warmth gives you the comfort you feel when you take a full rest. Fresh and refreshing bergamot and lemon blend with the bittersweet feeling of black tea, adding layers for daily use. The coconut note adds a soft and sweet finish to the lingering fragrance.”\n\n\nMy thoughts:\n * subtle, pleasant fragrance of milk tea as if you just had a sip.\n * milk tea scent fades away after a while and does mot linger, good if sensitive to smell but still enjoys some fragrance.\n * unscented/unflavored version also available.\n\n\nPerformance & Effectiveness:\n * Immediate Hydration: when used in comparison with my current lip balm from hersteller and lip oil from Sampar addict, this balm is definitely more moisturizing.\n\n\n * Long-Term Hydration: one application lasts 3-4 hours without drinking/eating.\n\n\n * Healing Properties: pretty much immediate relief for chapped lips soon after application.\n\n\n * Protection: tested in a dry, airplane cabin for 7 hours. Held up well and lips remain moisturised upon disembarking.\n\n\n * Overall Comfort: feels pleasantly creamy on the lips and milk tea scent fades over time.\n\n\nLongevity & Value for Money:\n * i dont use lip balms often/everyday, only as needed.\n * Considering the price of USD19 for 5g of product, i dont think this is cost-effective.\n\n\nWho Would This Be Good For?\nGood for you if you find eggs cute, enjoys drinking milk tea,  need a quick relief for chapped lips and most importantly have USD19 laying around for fun money.\n\n\nWould You Repurchase?\n * No WNRP but only because i already bought it once and have the container now. I plan to refill it myself with a cheaper alternative. Would not pay USD19 for another lip balm.\n\n\nOverall Rating:\n * 4 out of 5, would WRP if it was USD9 and not USD19.\n\n\nTL;DR cute lil egg lip balm that smells of delicious milk tea, instant relief for chapped lips but quite pricey at USD19 for 5grams. Fun gift and souvenir.",

I prefer balms and salves that melt into oils like Smith’s Rosebud to hydrate rather than exclusively occlusive waxy “balms” though so it might just be personal preference. It’s pretty on my shelf but I don’t ever reach for it and would literally rather use anything else. \n\nOn a related note, the hince highlight balm with no color is a great giant lip balm for me, it’s everything I want (not for a face highlight formula though).",

    "body": "Let's say you've muscled through the sugar cravings and have figured out your macros and are solidly losing weight (or meeting therapeutic keto goals). Great! Unfortunately, weight loss can take a long long time, years sometimes, and if you're doing keto therapeutically it's a lifetime commitment. This guide aims to make keto significantly easier so it isn't something you have to maintain willpower in for months or years.\n\n**1. Electrolytes**\n\nElectrolytes are the difference between feeling like crap (or like you're dying) and not. Getting adequate amounts of them from food (or supplements) is essential, and not just during the induction period to prevent keto flu -- the lower insulin will mess with your sodium levels on a continuous basis.\n\nThat said, the amounts needed are highly individual and will probably go down over time as your body adapts. You may need less or more than what's recommended in the guide:\n\n* 5000mg sodium -- sodium, not salt. Table salt is 39% sodium. Sodium is the most important electrolyte and the quickest deficiency to make you feel like crap, and has effects on other electrolyte levels as well. Symptoms of a deficiency include lightheadedness, fatigue, and ironically, dehydration. Good sources include salted snacks, pickles, parmesan cheese, broth, salad dressings and basically anything processed whatsoever.\n\n* Potassium -- 1000mg as a supplement, ~4700mg as a baseline value. Signs of a potassium deficiency include having a fast heart rate for no reason, heart palpitations, anxiety, and high blood pressure (though granted that's less common on keto). A balanced keto diet should offer a lot of potassium, but good sources beyond that include avocado, beef, nuts/seeds, edamame, tomato paste/sauce, and on the supplement end, various \"hydration drinks\" offer ~700mg per bottle without adding carbs, and there's also lite salt (50/50 potassium/sodium) and nu salt/cream of tartar (100% potassium). Note that both caffeine and nicotine will deplete potassium levels, and also that obnoxiously cold weather and stress can also deplete it, so adjust your habits accordingly during those periods of time.\n\n* Magnesium -- 300mg per day. A lack of magnesium will normally manifest as constipation -- the painful difficulty-going kind, not the lessened frequency kind. It can also cause insomnia and muscle cramps. Good sources include nuts/seeds, dark chocolate and leafy vegetables. You can also supplement it -- avoid magnesium oxide, and aim for anything ending in -ate (citrate, glycinate for example).\n\n* Calcium -- while this doesn't go down with a keto diet, it's a good thing to have in your diet if you have a tendency towards oxalate kidney stones. With a high calcium intake (from food like dairy or sardines, not supplements), oxalates will bind to calcium in your intestines rather than your kidneys. Ketogenic diets can be pretty high in oxalates, so having calcium sources with them will help a lot. \n\n**2. Deliciousness**\n\nOkay, you no longer feel like crap, but now the restrictive nature of keto is catching up to you. You feel like you can't maintain this forever, or you're bored with the diet, and frustratingly the main advice you get for that is \"food is for fuel, not pleasure\". Great news, it can totally be for both.\n\nIf you do it right, a keto diet will be the most delicious diet you've ever been on. Keto-friendly foods are very flavorful, you have a lot of leeway with fat, and you're also cutting out the bland/filler parts of recipes (the starch). \n\n* Variety is key. Change up your protein sources, fat sources and vegetables if you're bored of whatever you're eating. If you really enjoy it though, by all means continue.\n\n* Overlooked fat sources include avocado, nut butters, salad dressings/mayonnaise, sour cream, cream cheese (and other cheeses). These can add a lot to a meal and because you're keto you have a lot of leeway around fat intake.\n\n* Flavorful vegetables add a lot -- olives, pickles and other fermented vegetables add both flavor and sodium, green onions and Roma tomatoes add a lot of flavor for less carbs than other onions/tomatoes, arugula and watercress taste *completely* different from spinach/lettuce, red cabbage is both sweet and low in sugar, and peppers (particularly colored) add a lot of flavor.\n\n* Butter adds a lot of flavor and doesn't add as many calories as you'd expect for what you get from it. Whenever I cook, I cook stuff in butter which adds a heck of a lot of flavor.\n\n* Soy sauce, lite soy sauce and seaweed add a lot of umami (a rich taste) with negligible carbs. They also add sodium (the soy sauces add a significant amount, seaweed less so). Additionally, lite soy sauce made with hydrolyzed vegetable protein will add quite a bit of potassium.\n\n* Spices are your friend. Get a bunch of them and learn to use them. Many *many* recipes are dictated by their spice blend alone, for example rye bread only tastes that way because of caraway seeds. Oregano/basil/garlic powder magically creates Italian food, cumin/cilantro magically creates Mexican food, ginger/hot pepper magically creates Chinese food. Dill and paprika add a hell of a lot of flavor and don't overwhelm your palate with higher quantities the way other spices do.\n\nDo a lot of experimentation and mix and match with different foods for optimal results, and constantly improve your recipes and you'll be making foods that taste *significantly better* than anything you can buy in no time. When you don't want fast food because it doesn't taste that great compared to keto food, you know you've won the battle. \n\n**3. Convenience**\n\nOkay, your food tastes great but it takes forever to cook and when you come home from work you don't want to then spend hours slaving in the kitchen. That bag of chips looks extra tempting, or your SO and kids are eating pizza they ordered, or you just want to stop at a fast food joint after work. Sure, keto tastes great but it's way too time consuming, right?\n\nWell, fortunately that isn't necessarily true either.\n\n* Meal prep is a big one. Sure you can cook one steak per meal, but you could also smoke/grill a bunch of them for later use. Hardboiled eggs keep very well if you wait to shell them and you can cook a ton of them at once. Chop up meat you've cooked in bulk, freeze it and you have easy access to protein for a long stretch.\n\n* Precooked meats are also a good option -- frozen precooked shrimp, precooked chicken breast, precooked beef are very helpful for weeks you don't want to cook or bulk cook. Also canned meats, particularly fish which is high in nutrition.\n\n* Cheese, tofu and protein burgers require zero prep as protein sources. Melt cheese in a microwave after a couple minutes if you're feeling fancy.\n\n* Vegetables can be eaten raw, and offer more soluble fiber that way. Don't do this with beans -- they're toxic raw. Granted you're probably not eating beans on a keto diet.\n\n* For days that even the ~5 minute prep time of precooked meat/salads/etc is too much, have snacks and very easy meals on hand. My go-to here are low-carb precooked sausages -- very easy to get protein and fat without work. Add some raw vegetables (or not) and I'm good to go. \n\n**4. Pizza and burgers**\n\nSometimes you just want a good burger or a few slices of pizza. Nothing wrong with that. Thankfully, there are ways of getting those on a keto diet.\n\n* Bunless burgers, *including* fast food burgers, give you what you want there without the carbs.\n\n* I'm a big fan of crustless pizza. Low-carb marinara sauce, lots of cheese (ideally mozzarella), pepperoni, 2:1 ratio of oregano to basil, plus garlic powder and (if you're feeling fancy), chopped green bell peppers, white onions and black olives perfectly replicate the taste of pizza if not improve upon it. If you need the crust, look into fathead dough or cauliflower/meat crusts. A good crustless pizza is also very convenient -- ~5mins of prep time if you're not feeling fancy around toppings, microwave for 2 minutes and you're good to go.\n\n**5. Alcohol**\n\nYes, you can have alcohol on keto. While beer is high in carbs, seltzers are zero carb, as are straight liquor/spirits. Red/dry wines are also surprisingly low in carbs. \n\nNote that keto drunks will feel significantly different from high-carb drunks. You'll likely be more of a lightweight, and you'll probably get more of an energy boost as well because the same mitochondrial buildup in your brain that's been running on ketones will use alcohol more efficiently. \n\n**6. Nutrition**\n\nDespite popular belief, keto diets can be well-balanced nutritionally. In fact, if formulated right they'll be the *most* high-nutrition diet you'll ever eat. Why? Well:\n\n* Vegetables have the same nutrient profiles as fruit, but higher quantities. They're also lower in carbs.\n\n* Seeds have the same nutrient profiles as whole grains, but *much much* higher quantities. They're also lower in carbs.\n\n* Nuts have the same nutrient profiles as legumes, but higher quantities. They're also lower in carbs.\n\nAdditionally:\n\n* Meat, eggs, cheese and fish provide gigantic amounts of varied micronutrients, and on a typical keto diet you're eating a lot more of them so are reaping more nutritional benefits.\n\n* The lowest-carb vegetables on keto (dark leafy greens) are also the most nutrient-dense.\n\n* The lowest-carb botanical fruit on keto (green bell peppers, cucumber, zucchini, yellow squash) also pack the most vitamin C. \n\n* Nuts and seeds offer a *crazy* amount of nutrient density, but are generally recommended to consume in moderation because of their fat (and sometimes sodium) content. On keto you have a lot  more leeway with fat so you can fully reap the benefits here. \n\n* Same deal with cheese -- it's not just a great source of calcium, it also offers significant amounts of vitamin A, B12, selenium and phosphorus, and since you have more leeway on fat (and hard cheeses are great protein sources), you can get a lot more.\n\n* Liver is high in all kinds of stuff, so high that if you eat too much of it you risk vitamin toxicity. Again, liver isn't generally recommended on standard diets because of the high fat content, but on keto this isn't an issue.\n\nAfter an excessive amount of research (and access to a modified USDA food database), my conclusion is that a balanced keto diet focuses on the following categories (and easily blows through the RDAs on everything):\n\n* Meat -- for B vitamins and minerals.\n\n* Leaves -- for vitamin K. Dark leafy greens offer other things as well but don't seem to be essential if you're getting them elsewhere.\n\n* Dairy -- offers calcium, selenium, B12, vitamin A, phosphorus\n\n* Nuts/seeds -- offer potassium, vitamin B1, magnesium, vitamin E, a bunch of other minerals\n\n* Botanical fruits -- offer vitamin C and phytonutrients if you care about that sort of thing.\n\n* Eggs/fish -- offer vitamin D, choline, various other nutrients (bony fish offers calcium on par with dairy, and fatty fish has a good Omega-3 content, though granted a high-fat diet is a high-omega-3 diet in general). \n\nI've been eating keto for almost 9 years, and so long as I stick to eating foods in all of those categories I'm healthy, feel great, have zero cravings for anything, etc. Otherwise problems will start to appear slowly. \n\nNow granted there are other ways of formulating balanced nutrition -- /r/zerocarb and /r/veganketo are both things that exist. This is just the bare minimum of what works best for me if I'm eating a very limited diet. It may be helpful for you as well over the long term if you find yourself lacking somewhere.\n\n**7. Sweets**\n\nOver months or years on a very low-carb diet, you're going to want sweets for a variety of reasons. Maybe someone brings donuts to work, or you see cookies in the store or whatever and this makes you sad. There are a variety of strategies for this:\n\n* Sugar-free candy or drinks that use erythritol, stevia, aspartame, allulose or monk fruit. None of these have an effect on blood sugar/ketosis (unlike other sugar alcohols) and still provide a sweet taste, allowing you to find subs when the sugar desires hit. Note that erythritol can sometimes cause gastric distress.\n\n* Almond flour + butter makes an excellent crust for keto dessert recipes. My mom made a keto key lime pie once that did this (and used erythritol) and tasted better than the real thing.\n\n* Low-carb ice cream is a thing. As are low-carb cookies. \n\n* Dark chocolate offers literal sugar but it's in such a low amount that you can easily fit it into your macros. After a while on a keto diet, your sensitivity to sugar will change and darker chocolates will taste way less bitter.\n\n* Zero soda (like coke zero) tastes indistinguishable from the real thing. There's still diet soda as well if you're old school.\n\n* There's a heck of a lot of variety in drinks that have artificial sweetener and no actual sugar. This wasn't the case seven years ago. Lots of options there if you want something sweet or are bored of water.\n\n**8. Your WALLET**\n\nKeto can be expensive. Meat is really expensive generally, and keto-friendly processed foods are way up there. If you're struggling financially at any point, you can nonetheless still do keto.\n\nProtein is going to be the main limiter with budget -- both fat sources and vegetables are cheap. I did an exhaustive study on keto-friendly protein sources, ranking them by \"cents per protein gram\", and these were the winners:\n\n* Eggs, bought in bulk\n\n* Hard cheeses in bulk. White cheeses offer less calories so are more valuable as a protein source.\n\n* Peanuts. Natural peanut butter is unfortunately more expensive, and you'd really want to go that route so it's a better protein source and doesn't have added sugar.\n\n* Chicken breast, bought in bulk. Chicken breast is very protein-dense and chicken is generally the cheapest protein, so add those factors together and the protein cost is almost on par with eggs/cheese/peanuts.\n\n* Bulk pork -- pork is the cheapest as far as red meat goes. Pork will sometimes be under chicken as well, but never chicken breast with my cents/protein metric. I didn't look at specific types of pork because I didn't eat cuts of pork at the time.\n\nCanned fish is surprisingly expensive by this metric. I think the difference there is that you're not actually getting a lot of protein per can, and the thinking around it is that it's a great protein source despite the fact that I need two or three full cans to hit my normal protein intake in a meal.\n\nCheese is actually a cheaper protein source than protein powder. The last time I measured it (last year), even bulk amounts of protein powder ended up being roughly twice as expensive. During the pandemic when the value of eggs shot way up, cheese actually topped the list.\n\nNote that my calculations here were made prior to the pandemic, when prices shot up across the board. I need to do a new study at some point, but the general rules (vegetarian protein, chicken breast in bulk) still seem to hold.\n\nBeyond vegetables, fat and fresh vegetables are dirt cheap. If you're buying nut butter or something, not so much, but if you're reliant on mayonnaise or salad dressing then it's much cheaper. \n\nNuts/seeds tend to be expensive, but there are exceptions -- sunflower seeds and pepitas are at the bottom cost-wise, as well as peanuts obviously. \n\nSpecialty flours are way up there -- almond flour, coconut flour, etc. It's cheaper to buy your own almonds and grind them, and then you get the fats from them as well. \n\nObviously, keto-friendly processed foods are expensive. Lily's chocolate can be as high as 5$, keto breads are 6$ or over, keto-friendly cookies, quest bars, shakes or snacks are way up there. As far as dark chocolate goes, the most cost-effective seems to be semisweet baking chips. Beyond that it's probably best to just avoid processed keto foods and specialty keto foods if you're on a budget.\n\n**9. Your sanity: changing your perspective and breaking cycles**\n\nSo you've followed the guide and have a well-formulated keto diet that will keep you satisfied for the months and years to come. Then your SO brings home ice cream and it's your favorite flavor and you can't help but eat a bowl of it and oh no now you've ruined all your progress and have to start over at day 1 and probably gained weight and you just suck at everything so you might as well go on a longer binge to-------STOP.\n\nThis kind of thinking is the actual problem, not the actual bowl of ice cream or whatever. Realistically, one serving of carbs isn't going to do a damn thing -- it takes a hell of a lot of calories to gain weight, and even ketosis itself will turn back on after ((net carbs)/6)+2 hours. The only way you reset your progress is if you use a slip-up as an excuse to break keto for a longer stretch, and that's easy to do if you feel like a failure.\n\nThankfully, your success is measured by what you do over the long term, not how strict you are for how long. The lifestyle is important, not the diet. As long as you maintain a general keto lifestyle, the time you start it is where you start counting the months or years, and anything you do outside of it is part of the keto learning process. With this kind of attitude, over time you'll find yourself cheating less and less frequently, eating less during them, and maybe ideally not even remembering any specific incident because they really aren't important.\n\nIf you've been keto for long enough, even *months* of a higher-carb diet can be reframed as unusual periods during your keto journey rather than \"I stopped keto, then I started again\". I had a period of time during covid where I went off the rails, but that's like six months in the middle of a 9 year stretch, so even that doesn't really matter.\n\nYour perspective is everything here -- that more than anything else dictates whether cheat meals become cheat weeks or cheat months. Ideally, you don't even use the word \"cheat\", but instead frame things as \"I eat a strict keto diet but occasionally go off it\". It's more normal than you'd think, and even if it isn't, it genuinely doesn't matter. You're making this choice for the long term so only your long term choices matter.\n\n**10. Conclusion**\n\nHopefully I've bored you to sleep. Please downvote accordingly. I have no conclusion and this is my thesis statement. IIFYM, KCKO and butter your bacon, goodnight.",

Make friends with your local butcher. Find out when they put out the discounted meats. Get yourself a good freezer if you can - stand up or chest style is your choice, but one allows you to stock up when you find a good deal. You can also talk to your local ranchers and get a deal on local meat. You can also join or organize a \"meat buyers club\", where a group of folks go together to buy a whole animal to get the lowest price. I got into one that bought a whole bison! Get creative. Learn to can your own (that's a 300 level option!), I do that for albacore tuna. I've even seen CSAs for meat or cheese, there is one local to me for goat cheese (yum!)

If you eat 4 to 5 of them you can have a moderately high protein while very low calorie meal.\n\nEggs are also natures multi vitamin. They are a very rich source of Vitamin A, Vitamin B12, and Vitamin E, as well as Folate, Choline. lutein and zeaxanthin. They also contain moderate levels of Vitamin D, Vitamin B5, Calcium and Iron. If you eat a few for breakfast you can knock out the vast majority of your micro nutrient goals before you leave for work in the morning. \n\nAlso, the whole thing where you shouldn’t eat eggs because they are high in cholesterol is absolute garbage. Most cholesterol in our body is created by the liver and does not come from the foods we eat. Dietary cholesterol actually has very little effect on our bodies cholesterol. \n\nEdit: To be clear, I’m not saying diet doesn’t affect cholesterol levels.

The best medical research available in 1985 led to mistaken recommendations, yet they were making reasonable conclusions based on the evidence they had.\n\n[Quoting *Harvard Medical School*](https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/are-eggs-risky-for-heart-health):\n\n> \"In the past, it seemed logical to think eggs would be bad for your heart health. We knew that the cholesterol in eggs came from the egg yolks, and we knew that high levels of cholesterol, especially LDL (bad) cholesterol in the blood increased the risk of cardiovascular disease. So, it seemed logical that avoiding cholesterol in the diet made sense.\n\n> \"Since then, however, research has shown that most of the cholesterol in our body is made by our liver — it doesn't come from cholesterol we eat.\n \nOnce in a while scientific knowledge improves and expert advice changes for good reason. Anyone who's lived through the last forty years has also seen recommendations change about treatment for peptic ulcers and about whether to feed peanut butter to infants.",

    "body": "After lurking here for a while, I noticed that a lot of people had questions about shaving or diet and exercise. [I wrote up a series of google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Y147QQp6S8f21Q_p96njkp95DrsQw2VaSqjOwphU34/edit) and made some product recommendations based on my own routine! I'll include some excerpts here to give you an example:  \n\n\n \n\n## What is Exfoliation?\n\nExfoliation is the process of removing dirt and dead skin cells from your pores by scrubbing the surface of the skin with a gentle abrasive. You can purchase any number of sugar scrubs, exfoliation brushes and scrub gloves pretty cheaply on Amazon or at most retail stores. Exfoliation softens your skin and helps unclog pores that create ingrown hairs, acne, and other things that will ruin your nice soft legs! The softer your legs are, the easier they will be to shave and the better results you will have in the long run.\n\n## What Do I Need to Start Shaving?\n\nHopefully you already have razors (I use the Gillette Proglide 5), there are many you can choose from but I have found a multi bladed razor like this works best for me. Some people have good results with a single bladed safety razor (I recommend any of the Merkur handles) but I had trouble using it, and still needed my Proglide for more sensitive areas so I felt the point was moot. \n\nAdditionally you will need shaving cream, not the “for men” kind without much moisturizer but a more “creamy” or lotion like product. I use EOS shave cream, but it can get pretty expensive and you may be looking for a more discreet option. In this case, conditioner is a great way to keep your leg hair soft and also prevent razor burn! \n\nMoisturizers that are oil free (Neutrogena is what I use) or for those with dry skin, moisturizers with vitamin E or shea butter (for this I usually go with a bath and body works body cream product) will do wonders for you post shave. Having a good shave cream/moisturizer combo will make your skin super soft and give you the easiest time removing that dastardly hair.\n\nSemi-Optionally (I recommend you get it, it really works) you can pick up a bottle of tend skin either from a major retailer or amazon. Tend Skin really works and it is my go-to ingrown stopper and post shave magic serum.\n\nOptionally, you can get electric clippers to cut down any large hair buildup or if you have extra thick hair that you need to control before shaving. Never shave hair more than 1/4in thick with a razor, it's not only a pain but the clogging will give you an inferior shave! \n\n## Sensitive Skin\n\nIf you’re like me, the above methods might not be effective, or might irritate your skin! I would recommend *reversing* the direction you shave if that's the case. Shaving with the grain instead of against can help reduce irritation and is barely noticeable with some practice! Make sure you’re pulling the skin taught and working slowly, making sure to follow the grain of the hair.\n\n## Treating Ingrowns\n\nIngrowns for me are almost solely caused by skin irritation from fragrances and tight fitting clothing. I recommend wearing no undies the day of/after shaving. Avoid skincare and bath products with fragrances as well, these totally mess with your sensitive skin. Staying consistent will also help you improve your technique and keep hair from growing long enough to grow under the surface of the skin, try to shave every 2-3 days. I also recommend you follow the sensitive skin guideline for anywhere you currently have ingrowns to avoid inflaming them further.  \n\n\n  \nHopefully this helps you guys out! The full guide with more sections and detail is available at the link above!  \n\n\n\\-Anna",

As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%.

It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

While you might have had a bad experience, using acids with retinol will NOT cause more breakouts as you erroneously suggested, and on the contrary many dermatologists recommend using benzoyl peroxide in conjunction with retinols to stave off purging and help acne heal faster. You can say be careful using acids, but speaking so definitively about something that is completely not true and unfounded (especially about it somehow causing more breakouts) is something that needs to be editing or removed.",

I use Pixi toner day and night, it's given me a really nice glow but it might've been too much use. I'm also using HA (unrelated to this post) but I think due to my dehydrated skin, it's becoming even more dehydrated. I will try TO's Mandelic and maybe alternate it with Pixi day to day.

Can you recommend any cleansers or toners to bring your skin's PH down to the appropriate level before applying HAs? \n\n2) Is there any issue with using two different HAs at the same time? Can I use some stridex pads and then throw some TO Glycolic Acid on top? Or do I want to wait 20 minutes in between each HA?\n\n3) If we are to wait in between HAs, then I wash my skin down to a good Ph to apply my first HA..but then 20 minutes later my Ph is going to be back to a 6. I wouldn't want to wash again, what do I do to repeatedly drag down my Ph??",

It also has ceramides and hyaluronic acid but no petrolatum.\n\n[**Cerave AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/am-facial-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a small pump bottle and has a thick, creamy (slightly greasy) texture. It is SPF 30 and contains the following active suncare ingredients: Homosalate (12% - for UVB protection), Octinoxate (7.5% - for UVB protection), Octocrylene (2% - for UVB protection), Zinc Oxide (3.5% - for UVA protection). It also contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/pm-facial-moisturizing-lotion) (my fave) comes in a small pump bottle and is a silky/gel texture. It contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and places more focus on chemical exfoliation. Notable ingredients are mineral oil, ammonium lactate (similar to lactic acid), salicyclic acid, ceramides and a lower concentration of hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-cream) comes in a tub and is a thicker version of the SA lotion and contains similar ingredients with the addition of niacinamide.\n\n[**Cerave Skin Renewing Night Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/skin-renewing-night-cream) comes in a tub and contains shea butter, ceramides, niacinamide, peptides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and contains niacinamide, ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and allantoin (an anti-irritant derived from urea). \n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-cream) comes in a tub and contains glycerin, petrolatum, ceramides and hyaluronic acid. No niacinamide or allantoin in this one.\n\n**Notable Ingredient Overview**\n\n**Ceramides**: Naturally occurring, long chains of skin lipids (fats) that are major structural components of the skin’s outer layers. Skin as a barrier system inhibits water movement via its extracellular matrix, which has a unique composition of 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% free fatty acids. Together, these lipids form what researchers refer to as \"crystalline lamellar structures\". Ceramides are necessary for the skin’s water-retention capacity as well as for barrier repair and cell regulation. Adding ceramides to skin-care products can help to restore the skin’s barrier system.\n\n**Hyaluronic acid**: Component of skin tissue that is used in skin-care products as a good skin-identical ingredient. Hyaluronic acid can boost skin's moisture content, reduce inflammation, have cell-communicating abilities, and help prevent moisture loss.\n\n**Niacinamide**: Also known as vitamin B3 and nicotinic acid, niacinamide is a potent cell-communicating ingredient that offers multiple benefits for aging skin. Assuming skin is being protected from sun exposure, niacinamide can improve skin's elasticity, dramatically enhance its barrier function, help erase discolorations, and revive skin's healthy tone and texture.\n\n**Ammonium Lactate:** Ammonium lactate is a mix of lactic acid and ammonium hydroxide. It is used as a skin moisturizer lotion to treat dry, scaly, itchy skin. Those who are using it should avoid exposure to sunlight or artificial UV rays, such as sunlamps or tanning beds. Ammonium lactate makes skin more sensitive to sunlight. Skin is more likely to sunburn. Use sunblock and wear clothes when exposed to sunlight.\n\n**Salicylic acid**: Referred to as beta hydroxy acid (BHA), it is a multifunctional ingredient that addresses many of the systemic causes of blemishes. For decades dermatologists have been prescribing salicylic acid as an exceedingly effective keratolytic (exfoliant), but it also is an anti-irritant This is because salicylic acid is a derivative of aspirin (both are salicylates—aspirin’s technical name is acetylsalicylic acid), and so it also functions as an anti-inflammatory.\n\n**Shea butter**: A plant lipid extracted from the karite tree that is used as an emollient in cosmetics.

    "body": "Gusto ko lang i-share yung review ko tungkol sa product na ito dahil sobra ang hype nito sa Tiktok. Nakabili ako nito nung nag live selling nito yung dalawang sikat na content creators sa Tiktok: Skincarebyruzz at Wearsunscreen.\n\nTingnan muna natin ang ingredient list nitong sunscreen (pwede din tingnan sa pic na nasa itaas):\n\nAqua, Glycerin, Octyl, Methoxycinnamate, Dimethicone, Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Leaf Extract, Hyaluronic Acid, Polypodium Leucotomos Extract, Baicalin (Scutellaria Root  Extract), Vitamin E, Niacinamide, Phenoxyethanol,Titanium Dioxide, Carbomer 940 & Fragrance\n\nComment:\nUnang tingin pa lang, kita na agad na ang daming mali-mali sa ingredient list na inilagay sa box. Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate ang tamang entry dapat dun sa UV filter na ginamit, hindi Octyl, Methoxycinnamate (pati yung comma sablay ang pwesto). Making entry din ang Vitamin E sa ingredient list, either dapat Tocopherol o kaya Tocopheryl Acetate ang inilagay jan (kung alin man jan sa dalawa ang ginamit), dahil hindi considered na INCI name ang Vitamin E. Meron pang isa, yung Carbomer 940. Carbomer lang dapat ang nakalagay jan, dahil ang Carbomer 940 ay isang grade lamang ng Carbomer at hindi ito tamang INCI name. Isa pa, since tinted itong sunscreen na ito, bakit hindi nakalagay ang mga pigments na ginamit dito (Iron oxide Red / C.I. 77491; Iron oxide Yellow/C.I. 77492; Iron oxide Black/C.I. 77499)? Panghuli, hindi gumagamit ng \"&\" symbol sa ingredient list kapag nasa dulo. \n\nNgayon tingnan naman natin ang ilan sa mga product claims nito namedyom problematic (makikita sa Pic 1 at Pic 3):\n1. SPF 50 PA ++++ UVA/UVB Sun Protection (Pic 1) \n2. Broad spectrum (Pic 1) \n3. Fragrance Free (Pic 3) \n4. Provides broad spectrum SPF 50 coverage using zinc oxide... \n\nAnong mga problema sa mga claims na ito?\n\nUna sa lahat, paano papalo ng SPF 50 ang sunscreen na ito kung ang UV filters lang na ginamit ay Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate at Titanium Dioxide lang? Kahit pa sabihin nating nakasagad sa 10% ang Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate na ginamit, malabo pa din mangyari yan. \n\nIkalawa, papaano na-claim na broad spectrum ang sunscreen na ito at may UVA protection, kung malinaw naman sa ingredient list na walang nakalagay na UVA filter? Ni hindi nga ito naglagay ng Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane (Avobenzone) para masabi man lang na may UVA filter ito.\n\nIkatlo, claim ng product na ito na may zinc oxide ito kaya naging broad spectrum. Paano mangyayari yan e wala naman sa ingredient list ang zinc oxide? \n\nIkaapat, nag-claim ang product na Fragrance free. E ang linaw-linaw sa ingredient list na may Fragrance. At nung ginamit ko yung product, meron ngang fragrance, pero hindi kalakasan, sakto lang para ma-mask yung amoy ng base. So basag na agad yung claim nito na Fragrance free. \n\nNgayon, tumungo naman tayo sa actual product use. Una kong napansin dito ay yung packaging. In fairness, cute naman ang bote, hugis araw. Ok sana tong bote kasi yung gitna nung bote e gawa sa squeezable material. Ang problema ko lang, nababakbak yung white na print, which is ok naman sana, kaso sumasama sya sa kamay kapag pinapahid na sa mukha yung sunscreen, kaya napagkamalan ko pang titanium dioxide na hindi na-disperse ng maayos. In fairness naman din sa product, hindi naman nag-pill sa balay ko nung ginamit ko na. \n\nFinal Verdict:\nKung hindi ko inurirat yung mga nakasulat sa box nitong product na ito, aakalain kong ok or matino ito. E ang kaso, ang daming mali at inconsistencies nitong product nito sa kanyang mga claim, kaya magdududa ka talaga kung maayos e. Di komo FDA notified ang isang product e maayos na. Kaya sa ating lahat na gumagamit ng skincare products, lagi tayong maging mapanuri sa mga binibili nating produkto. ",

        "body": "Based on my observation, the more a \"cheap\" product is shilled sa socmed and e-commerce platforms, the less I'm enticed bumili. Hindi naman sa pagiging matapobre no, pero looking sa price point ng products ni Hikari Skin Essentials (not just their sunscreen but their rejuv products too) you will really question yung quality ng binebenta nila. Sorry pero it's giving Rosmar and Viyline levels na ang target market is low-income people na naghahanap ng madaliang solution to skin problems at a low price point, regardless of the sussy quality.\n\nIf anyone needs affordable na locally-made beauty products, better stick na lang to mainstream brands na available sa Mercury and Watsons. Sure, malakas mambudol si Watsons as we all know pero surely every single brand they sell (including theirs) dumaan yan sa maayos na R&D at quality control.\n\nAnd if kelangan talaga ng  products na may pangmalakasang support like sunscreen, dun na mag-invest ng magandang brand if your budget can accommodate it.",

Hindi ko inakala na maraming magkukumento dito sa post ko na ito. \n\nSa mga nanghihingi ng recommendation ko sa kung anong sunscreen ang bagay sa kanila, pasensya na hindi ako makakapag recommend. Una sa lahat, hindi ko alam ang kundisyon ng inyong balat, kung kayo ba ay dry, oily, combination, o sensitive skin. Di ko din alam kung ano ang skin tone nyo (kung fair, light, o morena/o). Hindi ko din alam kung may mga existing kayong condition sa balat (e.g. melasma, rosacea, atiouc dermatitis, atbp.). Pangalawa, hindi ko din alam kung anong preference nyo sa isang sunscreen. Kung ang gusto nyo ba e matte o dewy, or kung pang daily use lang ba o pang beach. Ikatlo, hindi ko din alam kung magkano ang budget nyo sa sunscreen. Dahil alam naman natin na mumurahin, mid-range, at premium na sunscreen. \n\nAng tanging masasabi ko lang is kung meron na kayong ginagamit na sunscreen ngayon na inyong na-research ng maigi at kumportable naman kayong gamitin araw-araw ng walang problema, at pasok sa budget nyo, e para sa akin, yan na yung akmang sunscreen para sa inyo.",

Also checked the ingredients list and halatang hindi binigyang pansin ang tamang format at nakakapagtaka na walang pigment eh tinted sunscreen ito. Then the smell, kinda smells sour to me pero sobrang mild lang. Sadly I don't trust local brands na may hard selling marketing on tiktok because they tend to skimp on the quality & halata mong may ma launch lang para sa sales. Also, even if FDA notified ang isang product it doesn't totally assure the quality/safety of a product kasi sa claims pa lang at ingredients list palpak na yung nasa packaging. It's better if maging meticulous ka with products and do your own research. Lastly, I don't trust sunscreens that aren't SPF tested",

If this is somehow done incorrectly or against the rules I apologize please remove it. \n\nMy 2 cents?\n\nMy opinion is she's lucky if this is the biggest piece of BS she's had to swallow from a clinical instructor!\n\nAll the non nurses were acting shocked in the commentsand were holding on to the fact that it wasn't mentioned in the handbook! And she had kids! \nI practically got kicked out two weeks before graduation after I did a \"Follow a public health nurse around for a day\" as an OB assignment. We got to do clinicals in two fields, mine were psych and peds, so I had to go to three different sites and write three different papers for OB and Geri.\n\nI got a complete crazy lady and I am so glad I kept her texts! She has me meet her in her office, and a co-worker comes from behind a cubicle, sniffing like a hound dog, asking \" is anyone wearing coconut? I smell coconut and  I'm deathly allergic\"?!?\n\nMeanwhile the OB teacher always hated me, so the next morning she wrote me saying that I was failed from her class, she was forwarding me to the academic discipline committee and I would  have to stay another semester to just take her course, IF they didn't fail me out of nursing school completely!\n\nThese Public health nurses  called and complained about my trader Joe's lime, vitamin e and coconut lotion that my mother had given to me for Christmas Eve and I had put on after my shower the night before this meeting! \n\nKeep in mind this woman's job was to go visit low income women's houses to check on them and their babies! Are you telling me none of those ladies used coconut oil on their hair or body?\n\nAnd the OB woman justified it because there is a policy on offensive odors in the handbook!\n\nLuckily the chairman liked me, and I had a card in my back pocket from when one of her clinical instructors grabbed me and pushed me and shook me, screaming in my face during a clinical! I made sure to mention that to my clinical director that night and it was down to my word against hers,  but one of my friends was a big shot medical attorney locally and if I hadn't played my cards right, there at the end, I would have had to do an extra semester just because of this crazy situation! \n\nPersonally, I always think nursing school was our Vietnam! 😶‍🌫️🫥🤐😱",

I used creatine many times in the past for training, so I thought: what the hell.\n\nTurns out, creatine is the sleep aid I've been hunting for ages. \n\nThe first few days I felt downright amazing after waking up and throughout the day. The effect has calmed down some, but I continue to feel great all throughout the day in a way I haven't in a long time.\n\nAlso notable is that sleep deprivation has become a non-issue. Usually if I didn't get my full eight hours, I'd feel like a zombie - that's no longer the case.\n\nReally, really highly recommended. Easily the biggest no-brainer supplement for me since caffeine, maybe more than that.\n\nNotably, this is something I've tried a few times throughout the years, both as a workout aid and a nootropic, and I've never seen such a dramatic effect (or one at all tbh). The time of dosage *matters*.\n\n[Edit] \n\nIt seems like this is the opposite effect to a lot of people! \n\nMy sleep stack which I've added creatine to is: extended release magnesium/potassium/b6, reishi, epa/dha with vitamin e and inositol. I've taken these for a decently long time now and adding creatine was what made a huge difference. \n\nIf you do experiment with these and it works for you, do let me know!",

    "body": "My wife is a 5' tall, 100lbs, italian-american teaching here in Japan. Neither of us smoke or use recreational drugs, only having the very rare drink. The following is as detailed of a history as I could put together, but if you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask. I just want to figure out what is wrong here and help her feel better again. \n\n \n\n**Health Timeline and Overview of Appointments**\n\n**March 2019-** \n\nWent to a dermatologist for a fungal/bacterial infection? Rash and swelling on foot and hands. Was treated with a cream, and the swelling seemed to go away.\n\n**April 2019-** \n\nStarted feeling lethargic and noticed salivary gland swelling for the first time. We decided to wait and see what was going on before seeing a doctor. \n\n**May 2019-**\n\nGolden Week- (May 5-11) Went on 2 hikes, in Agatsuma and Numata.\n\nMay 12-18 -   \nWas sick to stomach, constant nausea, heart palpitations, pain, fevers and night sweats, and weight loss (5lbs in a week).\n\nWe went to a hospital with (JTE at Takajo) on May 17th.\n\nDoctor couldn’t find anything wrong, blood test was normal. Doctor said, “I can do a CT Scan if it will make you feel better?” We do not have these blood test results. \n\nThat weekend we called an ambulance due to the pain and heart palpitations, was discharged on May 18th(?)\n\nMay 20-   \nCalled another ambulance and went to Takasaki General Medical Center where I was admitted and examined by a doctor there.   \nWas kept overnight on an IV drip. Did a CT scan, which is when we discovered that the salivary gland was swollen and that the test results indicated some form of infection. \n\nHe suspected rubella, but I was vaccinated for this and other diseases when I was a child. \n\nMay 21- \n\nReleased from the hospital, ordered to stay home from school one week. Medicine prescribed. \n\n**Blood Test Results (5/24)**: High Calcium, Low Average RBC, High Neutrophils, Low Lymphocytes, Low Eosinophils, Low MCV, Low MCH, Low UN(BUN), Low Potassium. \n\n**Medicines Prescribed:** \n\nLansoprazole (stomach medicine) \n\nMosapride (stomach medicine) \n\nMay 27-   \nAnother visit to Takasaki General, medicine prescribed. ENT at Takasaki General Medical Center was suggested.\n\n**Blood Test Results (5/27):** High EBV-EBNA, High EB.VCA-IgG, High IgG for Mumps, Measles, Rubella, Low MCV, Low MCH, Low Lymphocytes (but Neutrophils were normal), Low UN(BUN), Low CK(CPK), Low eGFR. \n\n**Medicines Prescribed:**   \nCalonal Tablet 300 (NSAID pain relief)\n\nNexium Capsules 10 (stomach medicine)\n\nLevofloxacin Tablets 500mg (antibiotics)\n\n**June 2019-** \n\nJune 3-   \nBlood Test.  \n\n\n**Blood Test Results (6/3):** High RBC, Low MCV, Low MCH, Low MCHC, Low Lymphocytes (Neutrophils still normal), Low eGFR.\n\nJune 13- \n\nDoctor thinks symptoms are stress-related and suggests counseling.  ENT seen for the first time, suggested it was a salivary gland infection. He thought that something was making the salivary duct shrink. We asked him to check my ears, as I was feeling ear pain. He checked and said they were fine. More medicine prescribed. \n\n**Blood Test Results (6/13):** High CH50, Low MCV, Low MCH, Low Eosinophils, Low Lymphocytes, High Neutrophils, Low eGFR.\n\n**Medicines Prescribed:**  \n Prednisolone Tablets 5mg (steroid)\n\nFamotidine OD Tablet 20mg (stomach medicine)\n\nAzunol Gargle 4% 5ml (mouth gargle for uclers)\n\nJune 24-    \nWe told them the medicine wasn’t working to alleviate the symptoms, and that the swelling was still the same. The ENT questioned us. I told him about how I had started experiencing nerve pain, and when asked about it, the ENT said, “That’s strange.” He then said, “Well, we can do an MRI if you want, but it will take 3 weeks to get you an appointment.” We agreed to the MRI. \n\n**Medicines Prescribed:**\n\nMethylcobalamin Tablets 50o (Vitamin B12)\n\nTocopherol Nicotinate Capsule 100mg (Vitamin E)\n\nJune 26-   \nStarted counseling with Chiralaine Natschke from BetterHelp\n\nLCPC 180.010761\n\n**July 2019-**\n\nJuly 2-   \nHeadaches and pressure in head, neck feeling stiff, body parts starting to feel numb and in pain, specifically in the tongue, left side of chin, extremities, occasionally entire arm.\n\nJuly 6- \n\nFalling asleep suddenly, waking up with persistent, nauseating headaches that would last for multiple hours. Headaches were primarily back of the head or left side of the head.\n\nJuly 8- \n\nBlood Test.\n\n**Blood Test Results (7/8):** Low MCV, Low MCH, High Neutrophils, Low Lymphocytes.\n\nJuly 7-   \nSudden unexplained bruising, headaches, rashes primarily on extremities, fever.\n\nJuly 9-   \nMRI results show swelling in gland, nothing seen inside. \n\nJuly 12-   \nBlood Test, ENT visit, medicine prescribed. \n\n**Medicines Prescribed:** \n\nTsumura Kakkonto Extract title 2.5 g/ Pack (Chinese Medicinal Herb) \n\nJuly 13- \n\nJoint pain, nausea.\n\nJuly 14- \n\nNearly blacked out from headaches and dizziness. We went to Kurosawa Hospital and saw a neurologist who did an MRI of the brain and found nothing. The neurologist suggested that it may be a viral infection that may have infected the nervous system. He also asked if the heart had been checked, and it had not.   \nPain and nausea medicine and anti-vertigo medicine prescribed.\n\nJuly 20-   \nJoint pain returns. We considered if lyme disease was a possibility. \n\nJuly 26- \n\nA new painful lump formed under the left ear overnight. The neck pain was bad, but did disappear after two days. Symptoms of a fever and lightheadedness throughout the weekend. \n\nJuly 29- \n\nWe visited Doctorearly with no appointment because of the new painful lump.We requested a lyme disease test. Doctor  claimed that he only treated one other person with Lyme and that “almost everyone with lyme disease dies.” He was very dismissive and made a point to say that he had a lot of other people to see. He finally suggested that I had a mood disorder.   \nWhen asked about the new lump on my neck, he hardly felt my neck before passing it off as just a sore muscle and suggesting a massage. We had Doctor write a recommendation letter to Gunma University Hospital. In this letter, he wrote, “I think the patient has a mood disorder, but she insists this is something medical”.\n\n**Medicines Prescribed:**\n\nEthyl Loflazepate Tablet 1mg (sleeping medicine) \n\n**August 2019-** \n\nJuly 30- Aug 4 –   \nVery few symptoms present aside from the swollen lymph nodes, feeling slightly better.\n\nAug 5-   \nLeft knee became inflamed and painful. We went to doctor near my high school and had my leg examined and x-rayed. They could not find anything abnormal except for inflammation. Topical cream was prescribed to help with the inflammation\n\n**Medicines Prescribed:**\n\nDiclofenac Sodium cream 1% 25g\n\nAug 9- \n\nNew lump had not gone away and was still hard to the touch. We decided to go to a new ENT.\n\nAug 10- \n\nWe visited the new ENT in the Monterey building at Takasaki Station (Masako Furukawa). She said that the lump was a swollen lymph node due to an ear infection, and prescribed antibiotics. \n\n**Medicines Prescribed:**\n\nCefcapene Pivoxil Hydrochloride 100mg (antibiotic)\n\nCalonal Tablets 300 mg (NSAID pain relief)\n\nAug 14-   \nExperienced popping joints, pain, and more swollen lymph nodes in the back and side of neck. \n\nAug 15- \n\nWe made our first visit to Gunma University Hospital, seeing a general practice doctor there. \n\nBlood tests, urine test, and EKG was done. Most test results back the same day, and he said they were all mostly normal. The doctor felt the lymph nodes and said they were not swollen enough to be concerned about, but we could do another MRI or CT scan if we wanted to. He also said that next week, we would come to see a dermatologist first at the next appointment, and then we would discuss the rest of the test results.   \n\n\nAfter leaving that appointment we noticed in the blood test that the lymphocyte count was very low and the doctor had not talked about that with us, so we went back to talk to him before leaving the hospital. He explained that some people naturally have lower lymphocytes, and since we do not have a blood test from when I was healthy, we have no way of knowing if that is normal or not. \n\n**Blood Test Results (8/15):** Low MCV, Low MCH, Low MCHC, High MPV, High Neutrophils, Low Lymphocytes, High HDL Cholesterol, VERY LOW IggA (5, normal range is 110 to 410).\n\nAug 17- \n\nAt the ENT check up, she said that the ear infection was getting better, and she gave me another dose of the previous medicine. She said that I had an ear infection and may have caught a cold from having a weakened immune system. \n\nAug 20- \n\nHands and feet falling asleep again, knees locking up so it was hard to walk. \n\nAug 22- \n\nAt the dermatologist, he checked the neck and suggested that the disease could be something similar to fibromyalgia, based on the rashes and joint pain. \n\nThe general practice doctor later said the dermatologist was wrong. He thought there was nothing wrong with me. He suggested stress and mental issues were the problem. We asked how anxiety or stress could cause swollen lymph nodes, and informed him of the fact that I had been in counseling for many months due to the pain. The counselor had stated that these symptoms were not brought on by my mental health. The doctor refused to answer any further questions, or do any new tests, and suggested that I check into a mental hospital. We specifically asked about doing a lymph node biopsy to check what was going on, and he refused. \n\nAug 22- continued\n\nWe had another check up at the ENT and explained that I wasn't been feeling better. We asked if the lymph nodes should be something to be concerned about. The ENT said that she was not worried, and to wait a few weeks before coming back in to see if anything has progressed.\n\n**Current Symptoms:** \n\nAug 24-   \nRight arm felt tense. I felt a moderate stabbing pain in the arm, and when I touched the location of the pain, the skin felt hot and firm. My left arm did not show these symptoms and was cool to the touch. After about an hour, the right arm returned to normal. \n\nAug 26- \n\nMorning: Chest pain, Stomach pain, night sweats/ fever, itchy ears, stuffy nose, sore throat, head fog, nausea.\n\nDay: Chin itching on left side (side of swollen salivary glands and lymph nodes), itchy ear that popped constantly, stinging pain in hand and wrist, small rash on hand and wrist, nerve pain in hand, visible veins in hand, left arm shooting pain. \n\nEvening: back pain, pain in the neck, pain in the salivary gland, ears, and lymph nodes.",

There is no point speculating as all the conditions overlap, but I'd want to exclude SLE, Sjorgen's, Dermatomyositis, and a group of illnesses called 'vasculitis.'\n\nHas she lost any weight?\n\nDo you have health insurance?  Perhaps she should return to the states and see a rheumatologist here where language etc won't be an issue?\n\nThe first line tests - as someone else mentioned are CRP and ESR.  If these are normal that would be reassuring that nothing is being missed.  If they are elevated, it is a clue that something is up.\n\nI note too the consistently low MCV.  What is her haemoglobin and have her iron levels been checked?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit to add- have just re-read your post and noticed the low eGFR.  This suggests kidney damage, and is another hallmark of rheumatological disease.\n\nDo you have the results of a urine drip - ie any blood/protein etc in her urine? \n\nTo me, this evidence of kidney damage really means that if you are not getting to the bottom of it in Japan she needs to cone back to the US, at least for a week, to have the necessary tests.  Bills and shortened adventures suck, but not nearly as much as permanently damaged kidneys do.",

        "body": "As many responses have stated, you need a thorough rheumatologic evaluation. You seem to possible have connective tissue involvement and the salivary inflammation (sialadenitis) can be seen in Sjögren’s syndrome. Sjogren’s can also be associated with polyneuropathy manifesting as nerve-like pain as well as autonomic neuropathy which can cause issues like inappropriate heart rate or blood pressure fluctuations, particularly when standing from sitting or lying down. Overlap can be seen with other autoimmune processes such as mixed connective tissue disorder. \n\nSarcoidosis would be another but much less likely issue that could mimic some of this esp the lymph node enlargement. Historically high calcium can be seen in this condition, but the presence of it is not necessary. \n\nIf your GP can do so, while awaiting eval with a rheumatologist, would consider checking ESR (CRP might not be necessary given chronicity, ANA, ANCA, ENA (if available, otherwise anti-SSA/Ro, anti-SSB/La, anti-Sm, anti-RNP), Anti-dsDNA, \nanti-centromere. \n\nSuggest seeing an ophthalmologist as well especially if experiencing dry or uncomfortable eyes as ocular involvement can raise suspicion for Sjogren’s. Salivary gland biopsy and review with an experienced pathologist can also be helpful.\n\nEdit: occurred to me that another rare, but often overlooked condition to consider would be IgG4-related disease. Can definitely see lymph node enlargement and salivary gland inflammation. Checking IgG subclass levels in the blood is not helpful as these can be normal. Tissue is the issue- biopsy with special staining (I think IgG4 immunoperoxidase or something like that). Typically will see robust improvement in symptoms in response to systemic corticosteroids such as prednisone or methylprednisolone.",

You may want to keep that in mind.\n\nMy other thought is to wonder if she keeps getting re-infected somehow. Something she is constantly exposed to. Spider or mite bites in the house. Fumes from where she works (or even at home, just she can be more susceptible than you).\n\nI would definitely try to insist that the doctors take Lyme or Lupus as a serious concern.\nAnd if they're still not taking it seriously, I would very much try to go somewhere like the US, Canada, Australia, etc., where they'll not be so dismissive.

I’ve been on various meds and an arms length list of vitamins since my early 30s.  Two larger pill caddies, loaded once a week, one for morning other for evening. Evening lives near my bed and morning lives near my coffee. Not having to open a bazillion bottles in the morning made it MUCH easier to stay on track. \n\nPick a time to work out. Whether it’s lifting iron or walking weighted, this is when you work out. Pelvic exercises after. \nHubby works out \n every morning. Nothing interrupts. My post-work day time is not so fortunate but it’s where my sleep works best at this moment.  The “boot camp” type challenge where I made all 6 workouts for the 10 weeks I did 6am class, and had 6 shorts outfits so laundry didn’t HAVE to happen. Giving it a set time, supplies ready to go, makes it easier to say “this is what I do” rather than having to DECIDE. Load 5 into the gym bag if it helps. Same thing with the meds: reducing friction makes compliance easier. \n\nMy wind down is simpler. And here’s where I’m thinking a varied approach might help. \n\nI’m newly diagnosed with ADHD and my brain … works better some days. One suggestion I picked up is to have three night routines (in this case) one for when you have the time and energy for ALL the things, one medium, and one “bare minimum” routine. \n\nBare minimum for me is clean face, clean teeth, meds and bed. Usually I get a hydrating serum or two in there… but you get the gist.  Bottom line is to give yourself some breathing room when you need it, so you can get comfortable long term with life.  It isn’t easy so be kind to yourself. :) \n\nAnd yes life has changed.

I still eat my cookies, cake, chocolate and other treats when there is occasion! I’m not a monster! \nFor me- I cut dairy, most gluten, and night shades. I have to watch inflammation. \n\nI slip up once in a while. Who cares! Get back on the wagon. I learned recently if I have ONE small glass of wine, i plan NOTHING the next day cuz it will be an “in bed” day feeling tired and crusty a d take out for dinner! \n\nI DO keep the vag estradiol cream going.

I had awful hot flashes, insomnia, mood swings, gained 30 lbs, and fatigue.  I didn't know any better because I assumed menopause would begin in my 50s.  Not my 40s.  An older lady friend told me to take certain creams and many supplements to help with all this.  I started doing this in 2020, before Covid.  I felt better overall.  My energy seemed back to normal.  I stayed on that regimen for 2 years.  Then I took in a newborn (A CPS case) and my mother started Hospice a few weeks later, in my home.  I was watching both a special needs newborn and my mother, for a month before she passed away in 2023. And still working from home and in the office, in the evenings, to stay caught up.  Long story, short, I haven't taken any regular supplements or creams for 2 and half years now.  Never mind, starting or trying HRT.  The insomnia was back.  My energy level went down again.  And of course, taking care of small child requires a lot of energy to begin with. And still work full-time, etc.  Last night, I took a combo ashwagandha, Vitamin D3, magnesium glycinate, and K2.  I felt the nice effect of calm sleepiness within 30 minutes. I haven't slept like that in years. It's a lot of work to put together one's personal regimen to feel better.  But not doing anything or enough is worse.  I want to enjoy things in this second half of life.  Time and money prevents me from doing more.  I don't have insurance.  So going back on supplements, etc until I have the money to pay for HRT out of pocket.",

Some can go by the wayside, IMHO\n. \n\n>Hoping to hear from some ladies who have been doing this for at *least* a decade. I just don't see how it's possible to keep this up long term, \"forming good habits\" notwithstanding.\n\n>I'm now taking estrogen, progesterone, iron, a multivitamin, a probiotic, lion's mane, DIM, extra vitamin e and d and k. \n\nI'm not doing all of your list, but I have done some for over 10 years now.  Ive taken meds, estrogen & multi-vitamins / calcium over the past 15 years daily.  I did Gaba for a year.. decided melatonin worked better.  Lions mane, probiotic, iron, .... those ended years ago.  I don't tolerate extra iron.  But these are long term doable. \n\n\n>I have to lift heavy and eat 9000 grams of protein and walk around in a chic weighted vest. Also thrice weekly pelvic floor exercises and collagen.\n\nThis is where I don't.  I think worrying about grams of protein, collagen, a weighted vest and 3x pelvic floor is nuts. I have better things to do.  I'm active.  I eat what I want and live.  Constantly carrying heavy stuff anyway. \n I row 3x a week.  During prep & recovery, carrying gear, I walk around 3-4 miles. \n\n\n> I'm supposed to get bloodwork multiple times a year, possibly have a body scan to benchmark my bone density,\n\nI have bloodwork 4x yearly because im diabetic & have other health issues being monitored.  Up until two years ago, it was only twice a year, but its been a pattern for 15 years now.  Its not that much of a big deal. \n\nNo need for any full body scans to check bone density.  The  one to set your base line & ordered by your Dr is the hip bone area.  I had my 2nd one last year.  My first was around 10-12 years ago in my 40s.  There was a tiny change, but still well into normal.\n\n\n> on order to sleep i need to stop what I'm doing at the **same time every night, stretch, journal, meditate, take melatonin, magnesium, gaba and L-Theanine.** God forbid I've walked by a glass of wine in the last 10 days.\n\n\nOk, is all of this what you actually need to do or is it because you think you should?   I don't meditate.  My adhd brain **hates** it.  I also don't *journal*.  Ive never been able to in my entire life.  \n\nThe one constant is that I pull down blinds & darken my living area beginning around 6ish.  I have to fool my brain that the sun has set.  I'm in Seattle area. Full dark at this time of year is around 930pm.  Sunrise is 5:20am.  My body wants to be awake.  So I make it dark as best I can.  My meds help me sleep.  But I used to take them at 6v30pm for years.  Now im oddly procrastinating up to 2 hours later.  \n  \n\n\n>I realize the ignorance of earlier generations wasn't bliss, **but this is absurd. Is it even *possible* to keep this up for years? The opportunity costs are staggering. Saying 'yes' to all of these demands on attention and commitment means saying 'no' to a lot. Something's gotta give. (I mean, my brain has certainly been trying to retire, but I'm not accepting that resignation just yet.)**\n\nI don't know how much *better* we really are from previous generations.  These days, if we aren't always *busy*, theres something wrong.  One of my grandmothers lived until 98. The other was 89. My great grandmother was around 85 when she died in the 1970s.  \n\nThey lived their lives well & as best they could.  I know none of them worried about protein or wearing a weight vest.  Their lives were stressful, but they lived slower & would stop far more than we do today. \n\nMy perspective ...\nScale down your routine to what works best for you and you'll be fine, probably. \n\n\n>Secondly, moving the needle on anything I'm trying to do is so slow and so minimal that it's really disheartening.\n\n*Are you making realistic goals for yourself where you are right now in your life or are you aiming it for an ideal or standard that's unrealistic?*   Thats what I ask myself.  \n\nYou're probably doing better than you think you are.",

The next tiny rung on the ladder is mixing my supplements with my water to make it taste better. For example, adding chocolate collagen powder or flavored electrolytes.

        "body": "I've been into kpop and Korean and Japanese skincare for....awhile. like 2008 awhile. \nAt least back then, skincare was not a premium (for Asia). It was always cheap, relatively speaking for the quality you'd get. Whereas it was considered a little small luxury where I lived. Not $60 per cream luxury but still to have a line of skincare as a teenager was still expensive and the skincare wasn't that great per price in comparison.\nIn Korea and Japan, skincare is just something everyone did/does, it's been a thing for awhile, it's cheap, and widely accessible and the cultural emphasis on having good skin is just important. (Like how facemasks even back then were 50 cents to $1 USD, for example. Or a really good moisturizer was $8. Whereas on par with face masks (at the time) was $5 a piece and moisturizer was $12 and not as elegant or formula driven). I assume it's the same since 2008 to now. Having something widely accessible and time to research and a culture that emphasizes sunscreen, skincare and taking care of your skin, I believe these are all ways that has made skincare on average, cheaper to having a complete/buy a line of skincare for men and women, teens alike. That popularity also gives rise to experimentation. Also, I have been using snail mucin since the 2000s. It's \"disgusting\" (at the time at least) in the west but wildly open in eastern cultures. So when you are more open to experimentation as well with ingredients, and you have a demand from men and women, you have more opportunities to make something great. Also Japanese brands (were) and still are known for basic, working ingredients. Nothing too complicated but they work. And having it be built off other Japanese products is also successful (like Japanese use rice in a lot of their ingredients. Lots of modern skincare is just edited versions of what their grandparents used. Shishedo for example is also just less expensive over there).",

Have been working my way up the ladder for years, trying to get to my ultimate dream job in this industry.\n\nIn this particular industry, you have to go for a fairly thorough medical every year. Vision, hearing, urine sample, tough physical. There is little room for error but as long as you're healthy you will pass. Any little thing will disqualify you from your medical and thus you cannot work in the industry (for example, ADHD medications, antianxiety meds, diabetes, heart problems, depression, substance abuse....to name a few). I've always passed my medicals (and always lied about my drinking), although in the recent years I've had doctors hint that my blood pressure and resting heart rate could use some work.\n\nI've been drinking heavily since I was 22. I am now 36. It has gotten substantially worse over the last 3 years. 12-18 beers a day plus a bottle of wine is typical. But, because I always passed my medical, I never thought *now* was the time to quit when it came to my health (even though I've been questioning my drinking for the last 7 years and vowing to quit for the last 5). I knew I was doing damage to my body and to my life, but had yet to see the direct results in terms of my health. It was glaringly obvious with my finances, my relationships, my mental health, my social life, and *some* aspects of my physical health (heightened anxiety, terrible sleep, bad teeth, bad skin/hair, shaky hands)....but still, I had no cancer, no heart issues, no liver problems. Go me, right? (Sarcasm).\n\nWell, a few days ago, my annual medical appointment came up. I drank heavily the weeks/months before, and the day before as well. I usually take a \"break\" of a few days before my check-up hoping my vitals look better and to come in looking more \"fresh\". This time I didn't take the break, thinking I'd get away with it like I always had. I drank 22 drinks the day before the exam. Passed most of it with flying colors (vision, hearing, etc). Except for the ECG. \n\nDoctor: \"your heart looks good, but your resting heart rate is high. Let's send you back in for a redo of the ECG. Just relax, you're probably just too nervous\".\nMe: \"oh yes, white coat syndrome haha\" (creeping suspicion it's from my years of drinking..)\n\nI go back in. Heart rate is anywhere from 110 to 150. RESTING. They need it below 100. We sit for 10 minutes. I do breathing exercises, I meditate, the technician talks to me soothingly. Nothing. She makes me go and sit in a chair in the waiting room and relax for 30 minutes and come back in. Still 110 to 130 resting bpm. I'm asked to go home and come back the next day. I'm told to drink herbal tea, get a massage, meditate. Little do they know it's not a stress issue, it's years of heavy drinking wreaking havoc on my heart. I go to the pharmacy, purchase every supplement known to man that will lower my heart rate. Magnesium, potassium, pedialyte, vitamin e....trying to bandaid the problem. Praying to God something will help.\n\nGo back the next day. Same thing. 105-120. I'm freaking out now knowing I will lose my dream career if I can't get it down enough immediately. She sends me out one last time to the waiting room to \"find my inner peace\". I go to my car and google \"how to lower heart rate fast\". I discover Magnesium, in excessive quantities, can cause a super low rate rate (like 20 bpm, to the point you need to be hospitalized). I had brought my bag of supplemets with me and find the magnesium. I take 5 pills (*not* overdose worthy at all, but I was trying to 'semi overdose'), realize how absolutely insane what I'm doing is, start to panic, feel like a fool, but go back in. Pass the test by ONE point as my resting heart rate came down * just* enough. I left the office in shame. \n\nHere I sit thinking of all of the damage I had done over the years. How I tried to overdose on a supplement in the middle of a check-up. How helpless I felt seeing my dream job of 23 years almost slip away because of my ignorant choices. It was a life changing moment sitting in my car popping pills to try to pass a medical while there were 5 or so other normal professionals of my industry in that waiting room sipping water and relaxing on their phones. That was the wakeup call I needed. When I left with my fresh medical certificate, it felt like a second chance. Or a last chance maybe. I vowed to myself to give it EVERYTHING I've got to try and get sober. My job, my health, my life depends on it. I can't wait any longer.\n\nJust wanted to share. IWNDWYT",

It was hard for me to get here, but my gosh was it worth it given where I’m at today. Alcohol literally takes up almost zero real estate in my head anymore. I have a friend who drinks heavily, but then every year a few days before their annual, they try to not drink, or at least limit it, so their test results are better.

Officially, it had nothing to do with drinking or anything else I specifically did wrong.  I was downsized along with a bunch of colleagues.  My industry is just shrinking, largely due to AI.  But, if I'm being honest, I probably can trace it back to drinking.  I was working from home and drinking every day.  Not getting drunk, just chasing a buzz (and mostly failing) all day every day.  It affected my motivation more than anything else.  Unlike yours, mine wasn't my dream job.  It wasn't even in my top 10.  But it was something I could do well and the pay was really good.  I had gotten burnt out, so I wasn't super motivated to begin with.  The booze made it 10 times worse.  I had been considered a critical employee in my position and I had survived many layoffs in the past.  But I think my performance slipped below what it once was and I got transferred to another group where I wasn't a critical employee.  I was now vulnerable in the next round of layoffs, and they got me.  I'm still happier being sober even though I'm without a job at the moment.  In fact, I'm looking at it as a chance to start fresh.  No booze or shitty job holding me back.",

    "body": "Most of my life ketchup has been hyped as better than mustard, but I know the truth. 63% of Americans stated they preferred ketchup to mustard on a hot dog, which is pure slander. There are multiple aspects that give it an advantage including taste, appearance, and even health benefits.\n\nAlright to start with taste, mustard brings a unique contrast to foods and offers a variety of flavors. It has range from the good ole vinegary classic yellow to the fierce horseradish variety that will give a good nose clearing. Overly sweetened tomato paste is much more of a one trick pony and vastly underperforms comparatively in variety. I’d add sugar instead of this glorified red sauce if I wanted my food to be sweeter, which I would frankly not prefer.\n\nMustards got range and taste and just looks nicer too. Appearance wise, mustard can add a vibrant yellow to brighten your day, or a grounded, reliable addition to a dish. Ketchup does decently well with its crimson red color, but I have shocking concerns over how well it is in the long term. Especially after seeing it so easily turned *purple and green* by Heinz in the past. Terrible, just terrible to be so willing to give its identity up like that. \n\nFinally, mustard is healthier than its alternative on top of it looking better too! Mustard has less calories per serving. It’s also a source of vitamin E which is good for your skin.   Unfortunately both condiments can have a bit too much salt so that will be a wash. Now I know a-bit about the group  I’m dealing with here. The opposition will say but ketchup provides vitamin A and C, which is fair. But the unreliable condiment gets a majority of that from its tomato base, which it ABANDONED mushroom base, as well as many, many other bases, for!\n\nSo to my mustard kin, a piece of our truth has been sung today, an ode expressing mustard condiment supremacy of taste, appearance, and nutritional value. To the ketchup preferers, I hope you will someday see the light and come home from the condiment that so easily abandons it’s origins. To all, I wish you a good day.",

The premise behind vaping is that nothing is combusted, rather nicotine in combination with propylene glycol, glycerine, and flavoring is heated up by a coil so that it turns into vapor which is then inhaled. This is critically different than smoking cigarettes, since burning tobacco results in the formation of dozens of carcinogens.\n\nIt has been found that there are some carcinogens in vapes, since some chemical reactions do occur where the coil meets the e-liquid. However, these carcinogens are in minute amounts compared to any form of tobacco smoking, and risk can be mitigated by replacing coils before they become burnt up, and using a low wattage so that the vaporization process occurs at a slower pace.\n\nAnecdotally, anyone who has transitioned from cigarettes to vape will report that their lungs have cleared up and they feel healthy again, whereas before they may have had chronic lung problems due to cigarettes and a feeling of weakness in general. There is no doubt that vapes are far safer than tobacco smoking, to the point that there is practically no comparison, while simultaneously delivering as much nicotine as cigarettes. Therefore, vaping beats past cigarette replacements like nicotine gum, lozenges, and patches, which delivered an unsatisfying amount of nicotine while keeping the addiction going, setting the stage for a relapse onto cigarettes.\n\nThe miraculous thing about nicotine vaping is it has put a serious dent in tobacco smoking, with[ the rate of smoking declining 20.9%](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/adult_data/cig_smoking/index.htm) between 2005 and 2018, equivalent to a drop from 21 out of every 100 adults to 14 out of every 100 adults. Indeed, vapes entered the market around 2005. This completely changed the game for tobacco users, since they could switch to vaping and never go back to cigarettes, rather than going through the cycle of tobacco withdrawal and relapse due to a lack of good alternatives.\n\nUltimately, it is clear that vaping is saving lives and giving nicotine dependent people a chance at a healthy life. However, Big Tobacco is not happy with this trend. In the past 4 years cigarette sales have continuously declined, to the tune of hundreds of millions of cigarette packs disappearing from the market every year, while vape sales have skyrocketed.\n\nHowever, Big Tobacco is a $1 trillion industry globally, and they spend tens of millions of dollars per year in the United States alone on lobbying to keep the laws favorable for the tobacco industry. Clearly vaping is an inevitable existential threat to Big Tobacco, so of course these lobbyists would do everything they could to suppress the vaping industry.\n\nBig Tobacco got their perfect shot at destroying the vaping industry when reports began to roll in of a mysterious lung illness caused by vaping. So far 2,290 people have damaged their lungs and 47 people have died.\n\nWithout waiting for any evidence or research, [the Trump administration immediately readied a ban on flavored nicotine vapes](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/11/trump-to-consider-e-cigarette-policy-amid-outbreak-of-lung-disease.html). Most politicians rallied around Trump in favor of this, as well as the mainstream media. The debate also quickly moved beyond the lung illness outbreak, and into how the nation needs to ban vapes to protect the children.\n\n[Many states](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/news/20191115/are-vaping-bans-the-way-to-go) immediately enforced varying degrees of vape bans, including Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, and Washington. A bill was even passed in the House to ban flavored vape products, although it is not yet a law and hopefully never will be.\n\nThe theme of these bans was to eliminate all vaping flavors, including menthol, leaving only tobacco flavored vapes. This makes it all too obvious that this was a scheme by Big Tobacco all along, where the attractive vape flavors would be eliminated and only the worst flavor, tobacco, would remain. Perhaps Big Tobacco thought this would make vape users get a taste for tobacco again and switch back to cigarettes.\n\nHowever, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has finally figured out what really caused the lung illness. [Vitamin E acetate was found in all of the biopsy results](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html#what-is-new), in addition to 82% of the biopsies containing THC.\n\nEssentially, the outbreak of vape related illnesses had been caused by unregulated THC e-liquid. Apparently manufacturers of this blackmarket e-liquid would cut the THC with Vitamin E acetate to bulk up the product and make more money.\n\nTherefore, there is now solid evidence that nicotine vapes had nothing to do with the outbreak. The CDC still says however “The only way to assure that you are not at risk while the investigation continues is to consider refraining from use of all e-cigarette, or vaping, products.” This is a nonsensical statement, since the CDC themselves recognizes that the Vitamin E acetate contamination is only associated with blackmarket THC e-liquids. The CDC goes on to tell vape users that they should not go back to cigarettes while taking a break from vaping, and should consider the alternatives like gum, lozenges, and patches, which are extremely expensive and do not work.\n\nFortunately, President Trump is now coming to his senses, and is walking back his comments on banning vapes. Trump recognizes that if vapes were banned it would generate a huge black market, which would cause more cases of disease due to production of makeshift e-liquid, as opposed to keeping e-liquid legal and regulated so that it is safe. \n\nAlso, most of the 9 states which jumped the gun and banned vapes to varying degrees have rolled back the ban, aside from Massacdusettes, Rhode Island, and Washington. It is unfortunate that vape users in those states are forced to either get unsafe black market e-liquid or to smoke cigarettes, which is exactly what Big Tobacco intended.\n\nZooming out on this whole situation, it is insane that the President of the United States, several state governors, numerous politicians, and the mainstream media rallied against nicotine vapes, considering that [tobacco smoking kills 15 people every minute](http://cancerherald.com/tobacco-kills-15-people-every-minute-and-just-one-cigarette-has-the-potential-to-cause-cancer-via-carcinogens-binding-to-dna/). In 4 minutes 60 people die from tobacco smoking, far more than the total deaths from this outbreak that caused so much outrage across the country. In-fact, tobacco is essentially the leading cause of death on the planet, except that the WHO and CDC cook the books by not counting tobacco as a disease, even though it is.\n\nIf the President and all of these other politicians care so much about public health, then why are they not on a rampage against the tobacco industry and calling for a complete cigarette ban right now? The answer is money, either in the form of tremendous tax revenues or outright bribes. The politicians of this country have chosen time and again to make money rather than save lives, and in the process tried to ban a miraculous alternative to tobacco smoking, i.e. vaping, based on a hoax that was quickly revealed to have nothing to do with nicotine vapes.\n\nThe fact is nicotine vaping saves countless lives, and tobacco takes countless lives. If the government would have succeeded with a vape ban it would have been equivalent to murdering millions of people.",

A lot of the financing is over my head but basically it boils down to, if smoking rates decline, state's notes will be worth less and they will owe more to the investors who bought the bonds, when the bonds are due in like 2040. Ironically the states pushing the hardest to end vaping are the ones who stand to lose the most if tobacco sales continues to go down.

Probably the one everyone is going to latch onto is that Subculture shadows are based on talc, whereas MR shadows are based on mica, but it looks like the entire formula got changed between the two palettes. This likely explains why people are having problems with Subculture not blending in as well as MR, as well as some major kickback issues.\n\nInterestingly enough, the ingredients for MR aren't [listed on the ABH website](http://www.anastasiabeverlyhills.com/modern-renaissance-palette/ABH01-18170.html). I wonder why.",

So, from that standpoint, this switch is ethical. But, you know, the brand wasn't sitting there making this decision because of ethical mica concerns.  \n\nI guess what I'm saying is that ABH could have announced this and made it a good thing. If they partnered up with a children's rights org, and put out this palette as a first step toward using less mica. There was a way to have spun it.  \n\nBut even if they had spun it and we were sitting on this website gushing over how ABH supports human rights, the reality is that they did this to make their shadows cheaper. Lower quality. And that's a bummer. I definitely have been channeling my inner Kimberly Clark on this one. Don't need it, not gonna buy it.",

Plan on introducing the clicker by doing things he already knows, such as touch my hand/object with his nose for a reward. \n\nI also ordered some flax seed oil to put in his food for omega-3’s and vitamin E. His coat looks quite patchy/shaggy and I want him to shed out nicely for the summer. We shall see if it helps! ALSO ordered him a pony blanket, just in case it gets cold again. (Even though we live in Texas lol) or for next year. Is it overkill? Yes. Do I love him soooooo much I do not care? Yes. \n\nFarrier rescheduled for Sunday and I am just so afraid it will ruin the trust we have built so far. I would wait to get his feet done, but they are pretty bad. One has a bit of a crack forming too, don’t want it to get any worse. \n\nOkay done rambling now, I just love this man a lot. ",

    "body": "**\"The deodorant industry *hates* her!\"**\n\n\nWith a quick Google search, you can find a myriad of recipes and videos on how to make your own. I came across [this one](http://wellnessmama.com/1523/how-to-make-natural-deodorant-beating-the-b-o-with-natural-deo/) a few months back, and since then, haven't looked back.\n\nI've always had problems with sweat and odor, and went so far as to get prescription strength stuff like [HyperCare](http://www.drugs.com/comments/aluminum-chloride-hexahydrate-topical/hypercare.html) and considered (but didn't get) botox injections a few years back. Although HyperCare does work, it left my skin dry, flaky, and burning at times.\n\n>Be sure to follow the directions about mixing the dry stuff together, separate from the wet stuff, prior to combining all ingredients. The process for warming the coconut oil and shea butter is outlined on [the site above](http://wellnessmama.com/1523/how-to-make-natural-deodorant-beating-the-b-o-with-natural-deo/). Instead of a double boiler, I used a microwave to heat them for about 20 seconds.\n\n>My mixture consists of:\n* 3 Tbsp coconut oil\n* 1 Tbsp baking soda\n* 1 Tbsp cornstarch\n\n>... and the optional additions:\n* 1/8 tsp Vitamin E oil\n* 1/8 tsp Shea Butter\n* 8-10 drops Tea Tree oil\n\n\n>I put the finished product in a small glass jar that used to hold pimentos, flipped it upside down, and popped it in the fridge. When I need it after a shower, I just open it and apply because the mixture sits just above the lip of the jar. Note that you don't have to keep it in the fridge, but just know that it will liquefy in temperatures over 75 deg F (25 deg C).  You can add whatever oils suit your taste, but I love tea tree for its aroma, and anti-viral/anti-fungal properties.\n\nI was skeptical at first when I made it because we hadn't hit hundred-degree temperatures yet here in Texas, so I wasn't sure it would stand the test. I was also pretty worried it would stain my clothes. However, I'm happy to report that I've had complete success with this recipe, no stains on clothing, and I've even made it for 5 people, which in turn, have made it for others. \n\nOf course, I still sweat and stink a little when I'm outside doing stuff in midday heat, but it's definitely not as bad as it was when I was using HyperCare and clinical strength deodorant. Also, just like the website I linked first, I have also begun to sweat less, and I still can't believe it. I can actually skip a day and not put any deodorant on, and I don't sweat or have odor even half as much as I did when I was constantly re-applying with the store bought stuff. \n\nSeriously, do yourself a favor, ~~and stop putting aluminum compounds on your skin that can make you ill.~~\n\nIt works!\n\nEdit: Reporting in after running errands in 113 degree F heat. It's still working!\nEdit 2: Forgot to mention how amazingly soft my skin is now. It used to be dry, flaky, and irritated. Added bonus!\n\n*Edit 3: Alright guys, I get it. I said something that wasn't fact-checked, and that was an assumption. It's eliminated. The point I was trying to get across was that if you've never thought of making your own deodorant, and you have issues with products that you've tried that have failed in some way, then I suggest you try this method. What will it hurt? For years I tried different things, and this works well FOR ME. It's obviously not for everyone. Unless you have an allergy to any of the ingredients mentioned, then you're set. See if this will work for you as amazingly as it has for myself and my friends. That's it.*",

With that being said, I have had the botox treatments about four times now and they have been a lifesaver. Here is my story.\n\nAs a teenage girl with hyperhidrosis, high school was an absolute nightmare for me. People thought I smelled because they could see sweat on me (which I didn't) or would say that I don't shower and I was dirty because I sweat so much. It was extremely hurtful as I am a very cleanly person and I have a medical condition that I had no control over but was getting teased as if it was my choice. \n\nThe botox is painful. I am not going to lie. You aren't allowed to shave your underarms for two weeks before the procedure and then you have to lay hands behind your head on a doctor's table under a very hot light so they can see where you are sweating. It is very uncomfortable to have people staring at your unshaved armpits (something in my normal life would be traumatizing).\n\nThey stick about 50 tiny needles into each armpit and it hurts/stings pretty bad. Within the few days after the procedure, your underarms are very tender and develop bruises, BAD ONES. A few weeks later they are gone and I have about 1 to 2 years of no sweat dripping down my entire shirt. It was a miracle to find this procedure for me, I feel like a human being again and people treat me like one. \n\nEdit again, sorry. I used all the super aluminum deoderants-clinical strengths etc. And they always burned my armpits and irritated then tremendously. Botox has been the only solution for me.",

    "body": "I know to many of you suffering with Candida this story will feel unbelievable. You can’t possibly cure the overgrowth, can you?\nWell let me tell you I did and my annual Pap smear came back clear of infections to prove it. \nDuring my suffering I would read success stories and I would be filled with motivation and a glimmer of hope, I am hoping mine does the same for you.\nI’m not trying to sell anything here. I find it sickening that people try to make money off people who are suffering, quite often when they themselves were in that situation once upon a time.\nThis experience is my own. We are all different and have different intolerances in our bodies which is what makes it so hard to control this darn overgrowth for each of us. For this reason I won’t be listing quantities of what I took. Start small and build up, your body will tell you if it’s too much.\nI urge you to do your own research on anything you are going to try to reinforce your reasons and knowledge. \nI cannot tell you that my exact technique will work for you but I hope it inspires you to try new things and show you that it’s possible to tackle this thing.\n\nIf you are able to afford it I would recommend getting tested by a naturopath for intolerances so that you know what your body does not like and could therefore be linked to your overgrowth and not healing.\nIt’s something I wanted to do but just never got round to. If I had, I may now have a clearer idea of what to avoid to keep me healthy.\n\nThe answers are out there!\n\nMY STORY\nI suffered from on-off visible yeast infections (thrush) for 5 years. The fissures (skin splits in the private area) were so painful and regular, I felt unclean and extremely embarrassed and infuriated that I was suffering when others with worse diet and habits weren’t. I always classed myself a healthy eater and absolutely loved my veggies.\nI can tell you that Candida can be passed on by the mother at birth, so this is not necessarily something you could have ever avoided.\n I actually think that I had a Candida problem long before it was visible, intimacy was very painful for me and as you can imagine made me feel like there was something very wrong with me and resulted in many private tears.\nAs I said my physical infections were on and off, though I say this, when I thought I had the overgrowth under control due to no physical signs of it, the doctor told me that it showed up on my Pap smear test. I was completely gobsmacked and upset as I did not have thrush at the time and thought I was doing well. Though I have no proof of this, some key things which I think aided my Candida issues were:\n•Drinking caffeine on an empty stomach throughout my teens and early adulthood (no breakfast, and for many years no lunch either). I had an abnormal relationship with food.\n•Drinking alcohol in excess, towards my worse years relating to infection I was drinking beer quite heavily, and drinking every day so my body never had a break from it, even it was one drink.\n\nI HAD TO TAKE MEASURES\nI put up with the symptoms returning for years. I had been on fluconazole from the doctor before and it didn’t work. The doctor told me that my clothes must be too tight or not breathable enough, ha.\nMy symptoms were becoming unbearable and it was really affecting my mentally.\n In a desperate attempt to solve things myself and not have to return to the doctor I bought the over-the-counter antifungal treatments, to no avail.\nI went back, had some blood tests which showed negative for diabetes and liver issues. So I was prescribed with a 3 month course of fluconazole.\nI became consumed by Candida. My every spare moment was spent reading about it, researching cures and success stories. Reading where people thought they had gone wrong and watching YouTube videos about people’s journeys with it.\nOne youtuber I recommend is DR AXE. He’s a naturopath and full of excellent knowledge about health issues, supplements, herbs and how they benefit you.\nI found myself deciding that I needed to follow protocols for ‘leaky gut syndrome’ so I read in depth about how to heal a leaky gut, which I do think was imperitive to my healing as mentioned in the 4 step process below.\n\nIT BEGINS\nI had been putting off the drastic measures of diet change, but things were just too bad now. In 2018 I did a 5 week Candida cleanse, I had a short timeframe because I was going on holiday and knew I wouldn’t be able to maintain the diet there, especially since I was missing alcohol so much! I did however stick to it as much as I could and continued with my probiotics, vitamins and anti fungals while away from home. I remember my first proper restaurant meal with a glass of wine after being restricted for so long, it was bliss.\nWhilst on the cleanse I felt the most alive I ever had. I even experienced random feelings of excitement and would ping awake out of bed with energy, which I later discovered was hugely linked to giving up caffeine and becoming ketogenic through zero sugar/carb consumption.\n\nIn summary here are the four instrumental steps:\n\nCONTROL THE INFECTION / DESTROY THE BIOFILMS - Antifungals, digestive enzymes, limited diet and LOTS of nutrition.\nBIOFILMS are a protective barrier candida grows around itself which is very difficult to infiltrate. It’s going to take some work.\n\nREINTRODUCE GOOD BACTERIA - Take probiotics whilst continuing limited diet and nutrition.\n\nHEAL YOUR GUT - L-glutamine, spirulina. Whilst still continuing the above two steps.\n\nMAINTENANCE - It’s been a long slog but it ain’t over yet!\nMost likely many of the positive dietary habits you picked up along the way will stick with you, and rightly so. It’s better to be safe than sorry. Continue avoiding the inflammatories whenever possible, choose whole grain brown rice/pasta over white, keep up with the probiotics, vitamins and supplements.\n\nThe third step is widely unacknowledged, if you do not heal your gut you will be vulnerable to Candida Overgrowth again and all your efforts were in vain. A mistake so many seem to make!\n\nI wish I knew which of the below steps were the most influential to my healing but unfortunately I don’t, so it could be a few or it could be all of them combined. Therefore I will try to list them all in the order that they happened.\n\nHere are the steps I took. \n\n1.\nCandida diet cleanse.\nNo sugar, no carb, no dairy, no gluten, no alcohol, no inflammatories in general. Basically none of your daily enjoyables- this is no easy task, especially when you have a carb loving partner!\nI bought organic everything when it was available. See meal ideas below for inspiration.\nIn particular I followed Bruce R Blinzler’s ‘Candida: Treating it successfully’ diet. I have a pdf copy of this diet, you can download it here Flow.page/candidadietplan.\n I will say that I didn’t follow it to the T and did a lot of my own research so chopped in things I thought necessary. You have to listen to your gut (haha).\n\nGreen Smoothies-\nStarted my morning with smoothies for a nutrition boost. This involved blending cucumber, celery, lemon, ginger, spinach, coconut water and whatever nutrition I could get my hands on.\nMany websites will say that lemon and coconut water contain too much sugar but for me the benefits far outweighed anything else. There is also the argument that the sugar attracts the Candida and then the anti fungals get ‘em when they’re vulnerable.\n\nGave up coffee/caffeine -\nI was drinking 3-4 lattes a day at work, which were 80% milk.\nI exchanged it for herbal teas. This is still something I follow to this day and believe it crucial to maintaining my healthy gut!\nI start my day with a ginger tea and continue on with peppermint tea or any other blend I fancy. I’m still doing this 2 1/2 years later. \nI now do not need caffeine at all and feel far more awake without it then I ever did on it!\n\n2.\nAntifungals, vitamins and more.\nThis horrible bacteria adapts like crazy, you’ll need to rotate your antifungals every so often so it doesn’t get used to it.\nI’m not a fan of medication so tried to incorporate antifungals and vitamins in to my diet as much as I could, but in capsule form I took:\n\nWild oil of oregano\nOlive leaf extract\nSF722\nDigestive enzymes\nand a multi vitamin.\n\nAntifungals I put in to my meals as much as possible were: \n\nOnion, \nGarlic\nGinger\nCinnamon\nCoconut oil\nTurmeric\n\nI also took a digestive enzyme which breaks down the biofilm which Candida uses to protect itself. They are also great for alleviating bloat and easier digestion.\n\nAfter a few weeks on the diet I invested in the supplement SF722 which was highly recommended on the Bruce Blinzler diet I was following. A friend of mine said it had helped her cure her Candida overgrowth 15 years prior and she’d never had another one since.\nThis is a pricey supplement from Thorne medicine, but I truly think it was crucial in my healing. I would have successful days where there was no sign of Candida, and then the signs would return and I would feel upset and disappointed, until I started taking the SF722.\nHow it works is that it changes the environment were Candida lives in to one where it can no longer transform in to its fungi state. It’s an undecylenic acid, similar to coconut oil but much much stronger.\nJust read the reviews on Amazon for example, you won’t be disappointed.\n\nI took psyllium husk as I read that fibre was key to healing and clearing out toxins, it has a sharp texture so that it loosens whatever is clinging to your intestinal tract. Also eliminating (toilet time!) is key to your body getting rid of toxins.\n\nI used a colon cleanse capsule from Holland and Barret (in the uk) which contained more beneficial supplements such as dandelion extract and liquorice extract. This also helped with elimination and I found myself having very regular and healthy poops at the same time everyday hehe!\n\n\n3. \nProbiotics.\nI am giving these it’s own paragraph because I truly believe they played a huge role in my healing and still do currently in my maintaining health.\nI actually started with probiotics in step two, though I have read they are counteracted by the antifungals. I would take anti fungals at night and probiotics in the morning as far apart from each other as I could. I can’t tell you whether this was the right thing to do, but I’m healed now.\nI started with plain cultured yogurt, making sure there was no flavouring or unnecessary sugar.\nOnce I felt used to this I bought some probiotics in capsule form too. \nStart with a probiotic containing a medium number of cultures. You don’t want to shock your system as you could end with gas and other problems. Find one with the most different strains you can afford.\nI read that saccharomyces boulardii eats Candida and yeast.\nGradually build up to a higher number of cultures. I will be taking these for the foreseeable future and I now purchase ones which do not need refrigerating (always check the label for this).\n\n4.\nAlkalinity.\nI researched in to Candida and it’s links to deviated cells, which are linked to cancer and other diseases. This led me to reading articles about being ‘alkaline’ as there are many who believe this is the key to health and even keeps disease at bay.\nI cannot tell you that this is true, but I can tell you that I feel it works for me. \nWhen making my veg choices at the supermarket I would have my alkaline/acidic chart up on my phone and use that as a guide.\nHerbal teas keep me alkaline too!\n\n5.\nHeal.\nI continued all of the above for a number of weeks. I read on one particular web page that the most common problem with the Candida programmes people are selling is that they don’t tell you that once your gut is clear from all the nasties, there are pockets and holes left in your gut walls which need healing. This makes it much more difficult for reinfection, especially once your cultures are back in balance by means of probiotics.\n\nL-glutamine - I used it in powder form to aid with healing. I would add a spoonful to my soup or smoothie so that I couldn’t taste it much.\n\nBone Broth - The healer that went down in history (grandma’s chicken soup, anyone?).\nI made me own from my organic roast chicken meals and used it in my daily soups I had every lunchtime.\n\nI also use a ph balancing intimate wash. Where I’m from this is called Femfresh, but I’m sure there are others. It’s gentle and was a relief to be able to use something after only using water throughout my cleanse.\n\nWHAT CAN YOU ENJOY EATING?\nCandida dieting really gets to you. The fact that you can’t eat or drink ‘normal’ things really plays on your mental health. \nI was on a rabbit diet which quite frankly made me feel diseased and abnormal.\n\nEnjoyable meals to help keep you sane as well as getting your veggies and nutrition in are:\n\nStir fries\nPut something new in each one to make it feel different. This is the perfect meal for throwing all your antifungals in together (onion, garlic, coconut oil, turmeric, ginger).\n\nSoup\nHome made only, preferably with home made or organic stock (see below). \nAnother way to throw all that nutritional goodness together and not even know it’s in there.\n\nRoast chicken (organic if possible) with veggies (possibly roasted veggies but this may produce more sugar).\nFrom the roast chicken I would make my own chicken stock for my soups in my slow cooker, this meant I didn’t need to put yeast filled stock cubes in my soups, also I knew it was organic and exactly what had gone in to it. You can buy it, but as we already had the chicken it was cheap and easy to do.\n\nOmelette \nfilled with spinach, peppers, onions and any other greens you can cram in!\n\nOat Bran \nI watched a YouTube video on how oat bran does not negatively effect Candida overgrowth. I have been eating it for breakfast in my whole recovery process, it makes me feel so good and fills me up for a long time.\n\nInfused sparkling water\nIf you’re a soda drink lover then you may struggle to find a replacement. I recently discovered natural sparkling water infused with flavours. It’s virtually calorie free and one in particular brand I found very tasty is Benefit Water (apple flavour). I also enjoyed the from the brand Voss, these are British brands but there are many options available!\n\nSome great recipes for ketogenic diet are here:\n\nhttps://www.ruled.me/keto-recipes/\n\nI actually found this website via Halle Berry’s Instagram account, she follows a strict keto diet due to her diabetes.\n\nKETO\nOn the Candida diet you will no doubt end up ketogenic. I didn’t know what this was when it happened to me! In simple terms (the only ones I understand!) if your body has no sugar to burn it will burn fat instead. Your breath starts to smell sweet which is the smell of the ketones which are produced during this process.\nBurning fat means rapid weight loss unless you eat enough fat and protein.\nI did not know this and ended up losing too much weight and feeling very hungry all of the time.\n\nHere’s a few tips to help you:\nAvocado - I just wanted to express my love for this wonderful super food. It will keep your fats up and keep you full as well as give you an injection of green!\n\nAlmonds - Many nuts carry mould but generally not almonds. They are a fabulous natural fat source and full of fibre, protein, magnesium and vitamin E.\n\nAfter I was ketogenic for a few weeks, I started reintroducing small amounts of potato and brown rice in to my diet because one, I was losing too much weight and two, I felt the diet had cleared a lot of what it needed to.\n\n\nCHANGING THE WAY YOU THINK\nThe above may seem very daunting. I can assure you that if you are suffering enough to even be reading this then you already have it in you to do it!\nRemember this is a slow process where you need to alter your way of thinking about food, this way you will eventually not want the bad stuff and the cake isle will repulse you!\nHere are some ways to help you start transitioning to better dietary habits:\n\nAvoid white carbs whenever possible. Sure when you’re out for a meal this will be unavoidable but at home you need to eat whole grain brown rice and brown pasta.\nAvoid sugar, or if you must have this then stick to natural sugars. ‘Nakd’ bars (sold in UK) are a great example made with only dates and nuts. \nSwap your sweets for blueberries and cultured yogurt.\nAttempt to swap your sugar habits with savoury ones like salted popcorn to get used to not having sugar and curb the cravings. \nBake/cook with coconut sugar or honey instead of cane sugar. The end goal is that you will begin to be more conscious of what you’re consuming, and then start to cut sugar down and out even further.\n\nChoose low carb vegetables - basically mostly green veg but don’t be scared to have some carrots and others since they all have nutritional benefits.\n\nBecome conscious of inflammatory foods and drinks. Gluten, dairy, sugar, alcohol, fillers. Read the ingredients lists, you are what you eat. Swap out milk with almond milk. \n\nIt’s all about BALANCE. Getting your gut back in to good shape means you can start to reintroduce the normal things you love. I know where my weaknesses are, as do you know yours. I struggle with alcohol, it is my weekly relaxation method. So I make sure I don’t drink more than 3/7 days each week and try to make more conscious choices towards ‘clean’ beverages such as clear gin or vodka.\n\n\nSome very helpful information from someone who can explain the dietary benefits of some of the supplements listed above much better than me:\n\nhttps://www.reallifeofpie.com/blog/30-foods-to-help-fight-candida\n\nPlease please remember that everyone is different. I found all of these techniques through months of obsessive reading in a bid to heal myself. I have not made them up, and if you research each of them and their link to Candida you will find them backed up :)\n\nAs it was a while ago now that I suffered, I remember something occasionally, and so this post will be updated as and when this happens.\n\nI really wish you all the best with your journey and hope this post has helped you. \nBest wishes!!",

That three weeks of healing made me feel invincible for over a month! I could eat anything and digestion remained spot on. That hasn't been a thing in all my adulthood. You know what the nail in the coffin was?  Yogurt loaded with probiotics. I was like, hey, my gut is doing awesome, people always talk about how good this probiotic yogurt is for your gut. Let's take it up a notch. I am almost certain that the random 'probiotic\" in this yogurt went to war with my good bacteria and candita saw the perfect opportunity to take hold again.  So back on keto and antifungals I go and I'll do my best not to get cocky after I heal again. I think an immunity mushroom extract was helpful during the initial cleanse but now the candita is used to it. That was new info to me me. I didn't realize it was so adaptable.

I’ve always been blessed with a great porcelain complexion and never struggled with acne. I just have been noticing signs of aging, redness (i’ve always had sensitive skin), dryness, dullness etc. I’m just trying to find products that leave me radiant, while remaining hydrated,  eliminating fine lines, and being proactive to aging.\n\nI’ve been left with the understanding that you need(just naming off random things) Vitamin C, then with C you need Hyaluronic Acid, then Peptides, Vitamin E, a toner, a moisturizer, SPF… all for the morning…\n\nThen at night you need (again just naming random things) a retinol, a cleanser, a toner, eye cream, a nightly moisturizer…\n\nWhen in reality like ????  ACTUAL dermatologists are saying you just need some rosewater and moisturizer/ spf in the morning and cleanser, moisturizer, MAYBE retinol at night. I’ve been scammed and I hate it. My skin doesn’t necessarily look bad but i’ve wasted so much money piling these useless products onto my face. I started having an issue with skincare pilling that i’m still trying to figure out. but that’ll be it’s own separate post. \n\nWho TF started the narrative that you need a 10 step skincare routine both morning and night? I know it’s all in the name of capitalism but I seriously hate how predatory the skin care industry has become. ESPECIALLY when I see 13-14 year olds buying DE and using all these actives like what??? it makes me want to scream!!",

I have a few:\n- Revolution Pro Miracle Cream, $10 \nThis stuff is basically Charlotte Tibury Magic Cream, but with a light scent. Beat out my Missha Immortal Youth cream I was using. I love it. \n- Cerave Healing Ointment $19.88\nPeople cry when I tell them I coat myself in it at night, including my face. It is the most neutral occlusive I have found. I used to use straight Vaseline. I seal my moisturizers with it, including my lotion on my arms (where my KP is worst). I live in a cold climate, so this is during the winter. My tub lasts forever. \n- Oakcha perfume $30-$50\nYou've probably seen them all over online. I noticed they make a dupe of Baccarat Rouge, and I own that,  so I wanted to see how good the match was before I purchased others. I have a very sensitive nose to perfumes (I used to sell them) and I am serious when I tell you THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE. Same with their Tom Ford Lost Cherry. They last a LONG time. My Gypsy Water ran out, I got a bottle of their dupe, no difference! They come in very attractive glass bottles. I think I own 9 of them now.\n- Carenel Lip Sleeping Mask $9.90 for 3 jars\nIf you like Laneige, you spend about $20 for one jar of lip mask. The Carenel is just as good. \n- \"Liquid Valium\" a DIY aromatherapy spray.\nI studied at Aveda for skincare and got a certificate in aromatherapy shortly afterward. \nI mix lavender, chamomile, vetiver, and copaiba essential oils with a bit of almond oil, then mix a bit of that with water and a bit of vitamin E. I've now made a spray to use on myself and my linens. Knocks me right out.  \n- I always have cheap lip balm on my purse. Tames eyebrows and flyaway hair, adds a little gloss to your face, use it on dry cuticles, and of course lips. \n\nThere's my secrets. What are yours?",

I used to be somewhat of a high-end beauty product snob, but recently my financial situation changed and I have been replacing my products with more affordable alternatives, without sacrificing on quality and performance. These are some of my faves so far…\n\n\n\t⁃\tfine’ry not another cherry perfume (supposed to be a dupe of the Tom Ford lost cherry but I actually prefer it!) \n\n\t⁃\tPixi milky mist (I mist it on before applying a moisturizer and periodically during the day for an extra layer of hydration- I’d argue it’s comparable to the Dr. Barbara Sturm hydrating mist - great for bringing on the airplane imo) \n\n\t⁃\tJust for men beard dye (I use the shade light brown to tint my eyebrows - I apply it with a spoolie and leave it on for 10 minutes. I also pluck my own eyebrows - I used the TikTok eyebrow mapping filter and traced them out and followed that outline and I have to say I think my brows look better than ever.) \n\n\t⁃\tGot 2b glued brows & edges (I actually prefer this product to higher end versions like the benefit one as it doesn’t get all crusty dusty.) \n\n\t⁃\tGarnier fructis strength compare conditioner (love this sh*t and it often goes on sale for like $6 CAD - I’d be as bold as to compare it to the olaplex conditioner. They also have a bond filler product that I’m curious to try to see how it compares to the olaplex step 3) \n\n\t⁃\tessence lash princess brown mascara (this mascara is great and ACTUALLY brown not black-brown. Comparable to the YSL brown mascara but for $6 CAD it can’t be beat, especially considering I prefer fresh mascara and like to replace often)\n\n\t⁃\tMatrix “food for soft” hydrating shampoo (love this stuff - super moisturizing which is necessary for me cause I wash my hair everyday. You can get a big litre bottle of it for like $44. I used to strictly use kerastase shampoos because I was convinced they were the only ones that didn’t make my sensitive scalp itchy but I haven’t had any problems with this one) \n\n\t⁃\tElnett hairspray (I used to smuggle this back from Europe before it was available in North America and it’s a classic for a reason. Provides just enough hold but doesn’t make your hair too crunchy)\n\n\t⁃\tLanolips 101 ointment in strawberry(just got this and loooving it - I’d compare it to the pre-reformulation of the laneige lip sleeping mask when it still contained lanolin. Love it!)\n\n\t⁃\tCerave intensive moisturizing lotion with hydro-urea (I don’t use this on my face but on my body - it’s the only thing I’ve EVER used that has managed to heal my flaky dry eyebrows. I use it all over my body after a shower and love it) \n\n\t⁃\tAquaphor healing ointment (I feel like I always need to have a tube of this. Can be used for many different things but my fave way to use it lately is to layer it on top of moisturizer on my feet and put socks on top before bed and it makes my scaly feet actually soft) \n\n\t⁃\tThe Ordinary squalene (I use this to “slug” on top of moisturizer at night- I like how light it is) \n\n\t⁃\tDove sensitive skin soap (I use this to wash my body and “bits” before washing again with a loofah and body wash. I also use it to shave)\n\n\t⁃\tBillie razor (who knew the cheapest razor available at the drugstore would also be the best ? Certainly not me!) \n\n\t⁃\tNYX brow micro brow pencil in taupe (basically the exact same as the ABH brow wiz but half the price) \n\n\t⁃\tL’Oréal true match hylauronic tinted serum (love this stuff for low coverage everyday makeup with the caveat the dropper bottle sucks. There’s a pump available to buy that fits it perfectly on Amazon.) \n\n\t⁃\tIt’s a 10 leave in conditioner (I love this stuff - I find it performs better than anything I’ve tried, high end included) \n\n\t⁃\tByoma moisturizing gel-cream (I like this as a daytime moisturizer)\n\n\t⁃\tL’Oréal feria power toner (I use this between highlight sessions to tone down the brass more effectively than purple shampoo which I find to be drying- works great)",

    "body": "Just need to vent. I just turned 32 and seem to be aging rapidly. When I was 30, people guessed I was 26. Now, people are guessing that I am 36-38. When I go out with my older sister who is 40, people guess that \\*I\\* am the older one (but maybe that's because I'm 5'7\" and she is 5'2\"). I am pretty physically fit and lean (which I feel makes me look older?). I like my physique, and I have fun with the clothes I wear. I don't have kids, but my life is a little bit more stressful now than two years ago because I changed jobs and started grad school. I hydrate, wear sunscreen, use a gua sha tool a few nights a week, sleep enough, rarely wear makeup, wear reading glasses to reduce eye strain, wear sunglasses and hats outdoors... but my pores are huge, my wrinkles and dimples are deep, and my bright eyes are now becoming more deep-set and puffy. My mom had a blepharoplasty at 60, which creeps me the fuck out and I want to avoid it. I am not interested in Botox or fillers, but understand that these are highly effective methods that people love.\n\nI am old enough to know that vanity and outward beauty don't define me... but I just want to look my age- not older. Is it me or is it everyone else's distorted perception of age that is driving this? I feel insane.\n\n  \nETA: Thank you all for your replies! I can't respond to each one individually, but for those of you commiserating with me- THANK YOU! And for all who have offered specific products you recommend, I will look into them! Some mentioned thyroid issues- I have thyroid antibodies, but TSH has been normal and I don't have any other symptoms of hypothyroidism but maybe it's worth getting checked again. Also, this stress better be worth it- I agree that it must be wreaking havoc on my skin. I just want to look as healthy and young as I feel, I suppose. \n\nI... was hesitant to add a photo, but decided to add the photo that triggered my recent spiral. My friend took this photo of me while holding her baby on a beautiful day last weekend.\n\nI had horrible acne as a teenager and was always in the sun without sunscreen. Now I wear it daily (60 SPF), but I haven't found a good one that I like. My concerns are uneven skin tone, blotchiness, my pores, deep dimples, deep crow's feet, and my eyelids (mom had upper and lower blephs- the stuff of nightmares, no thank you). I used to have blonde hair- it naturally turned really dark brown around my early-mid 20s.\n\nProducts I use at night (though sometimes I forget): Cerave cleanser, Cosrx AHA/BHA Vitamin C daily toner, Cosrx The Vitamin C23/super vitamin E + hyaluronic acid serum, The Ordinary Retinol 0.5% in squalane, and Pacifica vegan collagen (my friend gave it to me- I don't really like it but feel bad throwing things out). 1-3 nights a week I use a gua sha tool with jojoba oil instead of using the vegan collagen. My morning routine is cold water + Cosrx snail mucin + Neutrogena Invisible defense face serum 60+ SPF (but I don't really like this SPF). Once a month I use this microdermabrasion thing I bought from Amazon before my night routine. I'm open to suggestions here!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/itiibdg9r5sc1.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0939cc7494c7565349b148b7c8cc94ea08234df5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f0bmv9g9r5sc1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f64c24df0c040ea56ad44f86b73986514a9ffc1d\n\n",

        "body": "You've hit your first \"aging cliff.\" I hit mine at the same age. As others say, hard to really judge without pics, but I made some massive leaps in terms of my skincare when I hit my first cliff, and also completely changed my makeup routine. That was my personal preference, not so much to stop or reverse aging, but just to feel comfortable with aging. So I'm not saying you need to wear more makeup... but I'll tell you doing so helped my confidence with aging a lot. It helped me feel like I had my \"old face\" (back when I didn't have super red skin and hyperpigmentation!)... I use the illusion makeup brings to even out my skin tone and add brightness and color to my features. ymmv.\n\nConsider adding toner, chemical exfoliator, and select serums to your routine. There's a whole world of products and options out there, but I personally started with toner and BHA/AHA, and played around until I found my favorite serums (niancinamide and azelaic acid for me personally--brightness/combating redness are big things for me), and I swapped out most of my moisturizers to those featuring hyaluronic acid & other super moisturizers b/c my skin is dry AF now. I treat skin care like a treat for making my skin feel good, and go from there. \n\nActually: do you wear moisturizer? I know you say SPF, but you may have been missing consistent moisturizing and that's an essential step to add. I have some wonderful, beautiful friends but the HUGE difference in how we've aged where they've ended up \"looking older\" faster than me is they've always had perfect, normal skin. So they never established solid face washing or moisturizing routines, whereas as an acne-prone person with oily skin, I did as a teen. I've SUPER MOISTURIZED my skin every day for 30+ years. It's made a difference. So if you're not using a cream cleanser (I use an anti-aging cream cleanser, personally) and good moisturizer--day and night--in addition to SPF during the day, that might be a place to start. (my skin is now dry type, so moisturizer is my #1!)\n\nWith makeup, you by no means have to wear it, but I flung myself fully into seeing what was out there in terms of liquid foundation and fuller coverage, eventually landing on dewy formulas that feel good but give me an even skin tone/bright appearance so I can be more confident. I can recommend some brands I personally like that don't feel to heavy but look nice. (one off the top of my head to look into is Hourglass Veil. Recently started using it and love it.)\n\nBut also: it will ebb and flow. I've aged a LOT during stress bursts (my mom dying is what finally made me look like my mid-30s instead of late 20s), but then its always evened out or even backtracked a bit and always ended up ok. It's just shocking when it first happens. Experiment with skincare/makeup to whatever degree you're comfortable and go from there!",

Botox and filler is very common and helps further push that down the road. There’s also not a hard style shift as you age like in previous generations. \n\nThere’s an additional breakdown between skin tone and race in terms of aging and collagen distribution. If you’re fair skinned, you may see those earlier than someone else. \n\nI would take a look at your hair / hair style and see if maybe an update would help there. Sometimes we get stuck and don’t realize that being out of date can make us look older than we are. Otherwise, chemical peels (or at minimum, using a chemical exfoliant like good molecules glycolic) will help will turnover, reduced look of pores, and skin texture. And just making peace with the fact that age will happen to us all. 🤷🏻‍♀️",

Also two years ago we were all still in Covid-related lockdowns, and by now it seems all that stress from three years of pandemic are catching up with us. I think stress is a big contributor to aging for myself personally.\n\nAlso -- I've been on this sub for a few months now and spend more time here than r/SkincareAddiction. But I wonder if there's a similar thing going on in that sub, with people experiencing \"normal\" skin changes as they enter teenage years and adulthood similarly to people entering their 30s and getting their first wrinkles and other signs of aging. Those first few pimples can be a big shock when you're a teenager; the posts I've seen on this sub are similar but for wrinkles, pigmentation, dehydration etc.\n\nI'm not disregarding the skincare issues that people bring up on this sub (clearly I'm here too to learn). But also:\n\nI'd tell my early teens self: you're going to get pimples. And I'd tell my late-20s self: you're going to get wrinkles.\n\nEdit: to end more positively, OP sounds like you do have a good attitude driving things! Keep drinking water, try to get sleep, do basic skincare, maybe add some vitamin C and wear sunblock.",

But if you have a side part, balayage, waves that are straight at the ends- these will make you look more dated. If you are wearing skinny jeans, ballet flats, etc, that can contribute. (Btw- I don't personally find anything wrong with any of these things, but they are not \"in\" right now and can make us look older). \n\n  \nFor skincare- are you using retinol or tret? Those boost collagen production which can really help. You could also incorporate red light therapy for more collagen production. I suggest these because from what you are saying, it sounds like you are just less supple and \"full\" than you used to be, which is usually collagen related. \n\nFinally- I think we all have an age where we start noticing aging more. I'm 34 and this year I noticed more lines under my eyes and that the skin on my body just isn't as smooth and plump as it used to be.",

Eventually I wound up on some tiktoks talking about the effect of cortisol (stress hormone) on the body and how it negatively impacts our appearance. I tried to follow some basic tips to help lower cortisol levels and noticed a bit of a difference! You can google these but the main ones I followed were not drinking coffee right when I got up/on an empty stomach, making sure to eat enough protein, and getting enough sleep. But the biggest thing that helped was just ... not being burnt out and depressed anymore lol. Which for me meant quitting a stressful job and staying with my parents for 3 months while I recuperated.\n\nWARNING that I think these cortisol tiktoks might fall into unverified wellness advice territory however I did notice an improvement following some basic tips!",

At night double cleansing first with mineral oil then a water based cleanser also seriously minimized the appearance of my sebaceous filaments and in turn, my pores. I just splash my face with water in the AM.\n\nProducts that made a big difference for me are The Ordinary’s copper buffet serum and their retinol serum followed by a moisturizer like La Roche Posay’s. I use them at night and am always getting compliments on my skin. Sometimes I use a vitamin c serum with the retinol because I love the effect it has on my skin but it’s not for everyone. I have come to find that less is more. My skin looks way better compared to when I had a strict routine with a lot of steps.\n\nEdit: Awesome, I see now that you already use TO’s retinol serum. Def recommend getting the copper buffet though. It starts making a difference almost immediately.",

I personally would go for the Be Plain when it's available because it has a simplified formula without the unnecessary plant extracts and flower oils. I think the Be Plain one would be better for oily skin than the Round Lab one. Both of the Hyggee sunscreens look promising, but I'm gravitating towards the Vegan Sun Cream because it is a chemical sunscreen and I have a tan complexion, I don't want to risk a white cast. However, the Real Sun Cream does have an interesting ingredient list and whipped texture (as I can see on Yesstyle)  and I will be looking out for reviews to see whether it leaves a white cast or not and make my decision accordingly. What I love about the Hyggee sunscreens is that they are fragrance/essential oil free, but they still contain alcohol. I prefer alcohol because it allows the sunscreen to set better and be less tacky. If you have oily skin, I would think that one of the Hyggee sunscreens would work better for you because I have a Kolmar sunscreen (Isntree Watery Sun Gel) that is similar to the new Round Lab and Be Plain sunscreens and I definitely wouldn't recommend it for oily skin as it is way too shiny.\n\nEdit: I just noticed that the Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream has beet root extract, which made me think of the Krave Beet Shield. Get this, the Beet Shield was also made in Cosmax, same as this new Hyggee one. So I did some digging and found out that the Beet Shield has the SAME exact 5 filters as this new Hyggee sunscreens in the same order. The rest of ingredients are not too similar though, so I do not think they are the same exact sunscreen, as opposed to how I feel about the Be Plain and Round Lab sunscreens, which I do think are almost identical. I do think this Vegan Sun Cream is inspired by the Beet Shield, with maybe an improved formula, since the Beet Shield did not pass SPF tests. So if you are looking for a replacement of the Krave Beauty Beet Shield but with verified SPF protection, get the new Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream!",

    "body": "Domestic cats (felis catus) are an invasive species. Free-ranging domestic cats impact biodiversity through predation, disturbance, competition, disease and hybridisation. Scientific knowledge regarding these impacts has recently increased.\n\nThis is just one of the reasons why there is an ever-growing movement of vegans who have taken to eating cats - to protect biodiversity.\n\n\"But vegans don't eat animals, and cats are animals!\"\n\nIt's true that abstaining from all forms of animal flesh is usually associated with being vegan, but there are a few problems with trying to live like this. Firstly, obtaining B12 naturally through plant foods alone is difficult, so many vegans choose to take a supplement. Supplements are unnatural (unless taken via cow's milk fortified with vitamin D, iodine and vitamin A; food grown in soil fortified with selenium and cobalt; cereals fortified with folic acid, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, pantothenic acid, iron, calcium and vitamin D; iodised salt; bread fortified with iron; products from animals raised on feed fortified with vitamin D, omega-3, selenium, zinc, iodine, vitamin E, phosphorus, vitamin B12 and copper) so it's not a good idea to supplement B12 and you're much safer getting it from a cat. That's not the only nutrient cats are useful for either, as they're also a good source of protein, iron and calcium.\n\nSecondly, it seems rather presumptuous to think that consuming plants instead of cats increases utility. Plants are living beings who therefore can probably suffer pain and have thoughts and desires to live and experience things. Cats on the other hand, well, how can we really know if they feel pain or want to live? Ever asked a cat how they're feeling and got an answer? No, with the knowledge we have it's probably safer to assume there's less suffering and less rights violations occurring when I eat one cat rather than eat a plate of several different plants.\n\nThere's more benefits to eating cats. Unlike conventionally eaten animals, cats are not intensively farmed. There is next to no environmental footprint of you walking outside right now, finding the nearest cat, and humanely bagging them and bringing them home. There's also somehing to be said about eating a meal that you know was truly free-range. Lots of cats are strays, so no one will miss them, and if they were someone's cat I want you to think about this - that family was probably going to have that cat euthanized one day, so by eating them you've robbed them of that responsibility essentially taking the blood off their hands. What could be more noble?\n\nIt should go without saying that one of the best things about eating cats is how delicious they are. Cat bacon, cat sausages, cat steaks, cat kebabs. There's many ways to enjoy it. Plus if you're really lucky when picking up a cat you might find a pregnant one. If this happens, rather than kill her straight away, you can use her milk for more delicious and nutritious products! Cat cheese, cat butter, cat ice cream. They really are an incredible resource.\n\nI hope I've convinced you to join me in eating cats.\n\n\"Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to include—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, cats for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of cat-based alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment.\"",

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

    "body": "\"Cholesterol is bad for you\"\n\nCholesterol makes up 15% the dry weight of the brain, is a vital part of the cell membrane in every cell of our body, and it is involved in the production of hormones, and bile acids.\n\nVitamins A,D, and E are cholesterol molecules.\n\n'LDL is bad cholesterol'\n\nLDL is 'Low-density lipoprotein.' Lipoprotein is not cholesterol. LDL serves a very necessary function in the body by transporting the body's needed cholesterol from the liver to where it needs to go. It also transports other vital fat-soluble nutrients like vitamin E, and Ubiquinol (CoQ10.) It is not 'bad'.\n\n'HDL is good cholesterol.'\n\nHDL is 'high-density lipoprotein' again not a cholesterol. It serves the necessary function of retrieving excess cholesterol and returning it to the liver. It is no more good or bad than anything else that's supposed to be in our blood.\n\n'Your cholesterol levels are...'\n\nYour cholesterol levels are a calculation based on triglycerides, ldl and hdl. This calculation assumes all ldl and hdl is saturated with cholesterol which is not always the case. Not that it is grossly inaccurate but it's an estimate only.\n\n'You should alter your diet'\n\nYour body is amazing, and since cholesterol is so highly needed if you don't eat enough of it your body knows how to produce its own. Any low cholesterol diets will only have temporary minimal effects.  \n\n'You should take a statin.'\n\nStatins prevent the body from making cholesterol which will lower your levels and make doctor happy. The pharm companies are getting about $10k a year for you to be that on for life so they're happy too. Taking it for a long time and starving your body and brain of an essential nutrient for too long leads to the predictable side effects. Muscle pain and damage due to your cells breaking down and not having cholesterol to repair itself. Memory loss and confusion due to the same reasons in your brain.\n\n'Saturated fats are bad.'\n\nSaturated fats are fat molecules that only have single carbon chains. Animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, etc) are saturated and have been vilified by the media and by the doctors, while highly processed unsaturated fats get heart healthy labels.\n\nhttps://www.foodrenegade.com/why-canola-oil-not-health-food/\n\n>Like all modern vegetable oils, canola oil goes through the process of caustic refining, bleaching and degumming — all of which involve high temperatures or chemicals of questionable safety. And because canola oil is high in omega-3 fatty acids, which easily become rancid and foul-smelling when subjected to oxygen and high temperatures, it must be deodorized. The standard deodorization process removes a large portion of the omega-3 fatty acids by turning them into trans fatty acids.\n\nSaturated fats in your body cells means they are more flexible and can change shape and move without rupturing. Unsaturated fats have one or more double carbon bond making them less flexible therefore making your cells less flexible.\n\nA few vids:\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/-T79dJI3xIw\n\nhttps://youtu.be/CJ_CQASmsLg\n\nhttps://youtu.be/nsISdNl2tWo\n\nhttps://youtu.be/8LkKkPEN0O8",

Muscle pains would wake me up about 2-3 times per night.  \nDoctors of course advised me to take a handful of medication and whatever else, which I declined and started eating healthy.  \nMy wife, being amazing as she is, joined me with my diets for support so we ended up following a low-carb (always trying to get back into keto which is irregular so Ill call it low-carb).\n\nEVERY ONE OF MY PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN SOLVED!!!!!!!!!!!!! Zero pains, zero sickness, zero diabetes attacks (daily migraines and nauseau), for for me AND HER! She has always been very healthy and atletic but even she would never, ever, ever go back to a western diet or lifestyle.\n\nI guess my next step is to study all of the content you (OP) shared and step up my health.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks again for sharing!",

And because of it ( didn’t make the news here but overseas financial papers so really needs to be verified by other sources) that our Federal Reserve had to print more money to again help the banks? Then the CDC dragging its feet about True cause ( tainted carts) and spreading the news instead that , just to be safe mind you, avoid All Vaping. And now that all this Damage is done CDC just now coming out to news media at the Same time Illnesses are dropping? I just find that strange. First , because lack of real information from CDC , I would have expected the illnesses to continue . As we know most people were not made aware ( because of Media misreporting) of cannabis  Carts being tainted and instead are blaming e-cigarettes instead. And usually with illegal drug use it escalates rather than this “ disappearing act” it seems to be pulling. I mean this occurred All over the country not in one area.  And timing so convenient .

I use this in the morning, alternating with the previously mentioned cream.  and the 15gm tube actually lasts for a while (about 2 months) since the you don't require that much for one application. if you feel the percentage is too much, they also have a clearz version with 0.75% kojic, but I haven't tried it. again another golden standard for PIH! **WRP (5/5)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n🐹 **Kozimax skin lightening cream**\n\n**pharma** : Ethicare\n\nMrp : Rs. 320 for 15gm . also available in 9gm.\n\nok I swear this is the last kojic acid product on the list lol. this one is a lot more stronger than the other two and I've only used it after building a good tolerance to kojic acid as a whole. has 5% kojic acid, 10% vitamin c , glabridin (knew nothing about this until I got this product), arbutin and octinoxate, which makes it suitable for morning use. despite the name, yall, this was mind-blowing 🤯. results right after 3-4 uses. this was the hidden gem all along 🥲 glabridin was something that intrigued me the most, since its a UV filter and its anti-inflammatory so that a bonus! it didn't aggravate my active acne although I would suggest this only after you have some prior experience with kojic acid. directly using 5% might cause irritation. deffo a staple for my PIH! **WRP (5/5)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n🐹 **sebogel**\n\n**pharma** : Ethicare\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 240 for 30gm\n\nholy shit! I didn't know this had 6% niacinamide and it dried me the fuck out. but its an absolute HG for pimples that come out like 'surprise motherfucker' lol. the best and fast-acting spot treatment I've ever come across. it also works amazingly for enlarged pores and excess oil product and is also good for contact therapy. didn't really see a difference in blackheads or sebaceous filaments but I think with constant use, the benefits will come in much better. this so much more effective than any other salicylic acid serum I've ever tried. just dries me out a lot . **WRP (4/5)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n🐹 **hyalugel plus**\n\n**pharma** : Ethicare\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 350 for 30gm\n\ngot this rec from the sub itself! and it didn't disappoint! I will say the tube packaging made the product end faster since I drench my skin in hyaluronic acid day and night lmao. but this leaves my skin so plump and juicy 🥵. its like someone packed the SNP peptaronic toner and isntree HA plus in a gel base and sold it for cheaper! although none of the HA serums I've used have disappointed me (only one of them has) , this one is such an affordable and easy to get option. one thing is though, it seriously causes the worst dryness if not used on damp skin. still if used properly, this is a boon for all my dehydrated and dry sisters/brothers out there! **WRP (5/5)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n🐹 **Zitmoist gel**\n\n**pharma** : Canixa Life Sciences\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 350 for 50gm ( available on discount on 1mg)\n\noh.my.god. the best summer gel moisturizer for dry skin?!? although its marketed for oily acne-prone skin , I believe this will work for all skin types. man , such a simple ingredients list and none o them aggravate my acne at all. has allantoin and sodium hyaluronate in aloe vera gel base (in contrast to what their website says. it does not have niacinamide or vitamin e). gives such a good matte finish without drying my skin. deffo suitable for oily skin throughout the year but only in summers for dry ones. this wont do much in the winters. also has a very refreshing and light scent to it although there is no added fragrance! **WRP for summers (5/5)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n🐹 **Demelan Cream**\n\n**pharma** : Glenmark\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 415 for 20gm (available on discount at 1mg)\n\nthis one is pretty good for extremely textured skin types! has a really high conc. of glycolic acid (10%) and also has arbutin and kojic acid pre-mixed. although it did break me out a bit (aha/glycolic cream forms tend to do that more as compared to serums and toners) it helped me out more in body texture as compared to on the face lol. I have extremely rough ankles and knees and this soften them up real quick along with lacsoft! not to mention, it gives good odor control when used on armpits along with lightening those areas aswell. not sure whether ill use it again on my face tho . **MRP (3/5)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**🐹 Cerasoft imf**\n\n**pharma** : Grace Derma Healthcare\n\n**Mrp**: Rs.300 for 100gm\n\njumping on the cerasoft whore train with u/Someonesometh1ng lmao. probably the best pharma barrier repair/ dry skin/ atopic skin/bajra roti skin cream ever to exist imo. cuz damn this slaps as hell 🥵 has ceramides, pentavin, HA and other good shit. seriously at par with bioderma baume for me. a bit heavy and greasy for morning summer use for me but this along with aveeno dermexa are probably going to be my favs for winter mornings! nothing but one of my HGs for sure! **WRP (5/5)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd that's it! hope this was helpful 🥰 I had more recs but I either used them a long time ago or they just didn't work for me. maybe ill make another post later but that's it for now!",

    "body": "Hey everyone! I've been on the k-beauty bandwagon for quite some time now so I've used a ton of products. I also help my friends and family with their skincare routines so I've had the chance to see how different products work on different skin types. Because some moisturisers work on more than one skin type, I will break this up by product and say the types of skin I think these are good for. Many of my friends/family used the same products as me because I always recommend my favourite items to others and get their feedback. I hope I can help some of you who are looking for some good moisturisers! \n\n* **Rovectin - Clean Lotus Water Cream:** This is one of those moisturisers that you can't go wrong with. It contains 75% lotus water and is both cruelty-free and fragrance-free. It's super lightweight but moisturising, although people with extremely dry skin may want to look elsewhere. All of the ingredients are certified green and it leaves my skin feeling really soft. **Recommended for oily skin, sensitive skin, acne-prone skin, combination skin. 10/10.**\n* **I'm From - Mugwort Cream:** I raved about this in an I'm From review I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/hvl9am/review_im_from_skincare_products_sensitive_skin/). It has a really light, whipped cream-gel texture that's unlike anything I've ever felt before. It has a very slight herbal scent that I enjoy. It doesn't pill under makeup and leaves your skin feeling moisturised all day and night. It's more occlusive than ordinary gel moisturisers but does not leave an unpleasant finish. This is good for dry skin but maybe not during Winter. **Recommended for oily skin, sensitive skin, acne-prone skin, combination skin. 10/10.**\n* **Wishtrend - Vitamin 75 Maximizing Cream:** This has a thick gel-like texture. It absorbs *very* quickly into the skin and doesn't leave a tacky finish at all. It works very well with the Wishtrend Vitamin C Serum because the Vitamin E in this product will enhance any Vitamin C you use. I usually need something else on top of this at night, but that's because I live in a dry climate and my skin is prone to dryness when I'm sleeping. It's perfect for daytime use. **Recommended for sensitive skin, combination skin, dry skin. 8.5/10.**\n* **Klairs - Freshly Juiced Vitamin E Mask:** Unlike the Wishtrend moisturiser, this Vitamin E stays on the skin. It's a gel that turns almost into a water on the skin. I have to say I prefer the Wishtrend moisturiser, but you might enjoy this if your skin is very dry. It also doubles as a sleeping mask at night and reminds me a bit of the Laneige Sleeping Mask. **Recommended for dry skin, normal skin. 7/10**\n* **Pyunkang Yul Nutrition Cream:** I recommended this to my best friend who has psoriasis and *extremely* dry skin and she swears by it. It has a very light, pleasant scent and a thick, emollient texture. Her skin would hurt in the morning because of how dry it was but this really changed things for her. She's bought like 3 bottles of this. **Recommended for dry skin, sensitive skin.** **10/10.**\n* **Whamisa - Double Rich Lotion:** I bought this when I was in Korea. It's called a lotion but it's quite thick. It's extremely moisturising and you get a lot of product in one big bottle. However, it is a bit pricey outside of Korea. It has a scent that reminds me a bit of tea tree, which I'm not the biggest fan of, but the scent goes away after a while. My friend with the extremely dry skin tried this out and loved it as much as she loved the Pyunkang Yul and Huxley moisturisers. **Recommended for dry skin. 8.5/10**\n* **Huxley - Anti-Gravity Cream:** Again, my friend with the severely dry skin loves this product but complains about the price. I've used other Huxley products and can say the brand is excellent if you have money to splurge or find yourself in Korea. It smells amazing like all the Huxley products, which might be a pro or con depending on your preference. It is very moisturising and feels creamy, rather than oily. **Recommended for dry skin. 9/10.**\n* **Huxley - Fresh and More Cream:** This is a lightweight gel cream that has the classic Huxley scent. I bought it in a set in Korea so it was pretty affordable. It leaves your skin glowy and moisturised. I would recommend this if you don't mind spending a bit more money or if you buy this on sale, but I wouldn't go out of your way to get it. **Recommended for oily skin, sensitive skin, combination skin. 7.5/10.**\n* **Purito - Centella Green Level Recovery Cream:** This is a lightweight gel cream that helps soothe red and inflammed skin. My friend who has acne-prone skin really enjoys this product. It has a centella/tea tree scent that I don't like but some do. Keep that in mind though if you're sensitive to essential oils. I have sensitive skin and this didn't bother my skin, just my nose haha. Still, my acne-prone friend swears by it. **Recommended for oily skin, acne-prone skin. 9.5/10.**\n* **Dear, Klairs - Midnight Blue Calming Cream:** This is my holy grail! I try a lot of new products and every time my face burns or feels sensitised, I use this cream and it soothes my face instantly. It's amazing for anyone who's prone to redness or sensitivity. It has a thick, creamy texture that oily-skinned people might not enjoy. Some people use it as a spot treatment on dry or sensitised areas but I like to put it all over my face. It makes my skin super soft the next morning. **Recommended for sensitive skin, dry skin. 10/10.**\n* **Pyunkang Yul - Balancing Gel:** My extremely dry friend and I have both tried this. It's definitely the strangest moisturiser either of us have ever used. I don't use this as my sole moisturiser but as the finishing step in my evening routine. It just helps lock everything in. This is a product that must be patted, not rubbed, into the skin. I enjoy using it either mixed with an oil or under an oil for an extra boost of moisture. It leaves a sticky finish so I would recommend this for before you go to bed because the stickiness might irritate you during the day. **Recommended for sensitive skin, dry skin, combination skin, oily skin. 8/10.**\n* **Dear, Klairs - Rich Moist Soothing Cream:** My acne-prone and dry friends have both tried this. Both found it to be just okay. It doesn't perform any miracles but it will keep you moisturised. It has a pretty thick consistency but it didn't clog the pores of my acne-prone friend. We didn't find this moisturiser to be all that memorable but the reviews online seem to suggest it's good. **Recommended for sensitive skin, dry skin, combination skin. 6/10.**\n* **iUNIK - Centella Calming Gel Cream:** This has a light gel texture that sinks beautifully into the skin. My friend with oily, acne-prone skin really enjoys this because it doesn't make her skin feel too oily or sticky. Personally, I would only use this in the Summer because my skin can get dry. It didn't break either of us out. **Recommended for sensitive skin, oily skin, acne-prone skin. 10/10.**\n* **Sulwhasoo - Overnight Vitalizing Mask EX:** I don't normally buy high-end skincare but I calculated the cost of this based on the amount you get and it isn't actually that much more expensive that the other brands on here! I find the price to be very worth it since you get a huge bottle. It has a lovely ginseng scent. It has a thick, creamy texture that is very moisturising and leaves my skin feeling soft the next morning. **Recommended for sensitive skin, dry skin, combination skin. 10/10.**\n* **COSRX Ultimate Nourishing Rice Overnight Spa Mask:** My acne-prone friend says this helps with her hyperpigmentation but very slowly. Personally, I didn't find that it did much. It leaves the skin feeling a bit sticky but that's not something I mind at night. It has no discernible scent and didn't break either of us out. **Recommended for sensitive skin, oily skin, acne-prone skin, combination skin. 7/10.**\n* **COSRX Ultimate Nourishing Honey Overnight Spa Mask:** I prefer this to the rice mask. It has a clear, gel-like consistency that I like to layer over a moisturiser. My friend with acne-prone skin enjoys this as well. We wouldn't recommend using this on its own, however, unless you have extremely oily skin and want something not overly occlusive. **Recommended for sensitive skin, oily skin, acne-prone skin, combination skin. 9/10.**\n\nThat's all from me! Feel free to share your experiences below and pop down any questions you might have. I've used a *lot* of skincare products so feel free to ask about products not listed here because I might have tried it. Either way, I'll do my best to help :)",

If I had one single complaint about it, it is that it absorbs very slowly into the skin.  I'll put it on last thing before I go to bed so I don't have to deal with accidentally smearing it.\n\n**Cosrx Rice Overnight Mask** - for me this is my go-to PM moisturizer, it's so rich and hydrating. It does leave me extremely shiny which is why it is PM rather than AM for me.  Again, I have very dry skin so I need all the moisturizing I can get and this really packs it in.\n\n**iUnik Centella Calming Gel Cream** - I was skeptical about how moisturizing a gel could be, but now I am on my 3rd tube if that is any indication of how effective it is.  I use it AM, and it is so light and cooling and not only hydrates well but really brings down the redness.",

    "body": "Just wanted to update everyone here. I'm on day 40 of my 41 day fast. \n\nTo be honest, I am slowly cheating (ie having a whole lemon, or lime), or for example 1 or 2 small fuzzy kiwis. I want the vitamin C/acid to balance my body's pH because I do feel the keto breath on me, and at this point I want to get some calories in to be beneficial to my body's pH. \n\nI have been taking the following:\n1. 2 men's multi vitamin gummies daily\n2. 1 vitamin E supplement weekly (it's a strong one, hence taken once a week)\n\nI have been off of the electrolyte powders for the past 2 weeks I would say. At this point I am disgusted with them. \n\nI have not taken any bone broth either in the past Iwant to say 2 weeks. I've taken a handful of bone broth up until day 30.\n\nExcercise:\nWalking ~3 miles daily, except maybe 1 or 2 days out of the week. I can walk much faster than usual. \n\nKeto rash:\nItching all over my chest (sides of chest) at nights, as well as around my wrists. I have bought black seed oil and that has helped a bit. \n\nWeight loss:\nStarted at 214 (97kg) and now 174 lbs (79 kg). Total weight loss of 40 lbs (18 kg) in 40 days so far. \n\nTests:\nTook a blood test this last week and all signs are great! Doctor was amazed at my results. My uric acid had spiked, but I told him it was from fasting and would get better in the next month or so once I'm off my fast.  Everything else was perfect, including my LDL cholesterol levels dropping. ",

As high insulin foods will pull your electrolytes out of your blood for digestion and can cause heart ❤️ failure. This is why we take electrolytes while extended water fasting.\n\nFor the first 3 days keep your calories to 50% or less than normal. \n\nSource: I've done a 71 day extended water fast, 30 day,  21 day, 20 day, 19 day, 15 days, 14 day ect....",

The swatches are done on back-of-hand skin, which is much more absorbent than face skin, so any sheen/white cast will be multiplied on the face.\n\n(In all photos, the NEW shaka fluid is on the LEFT side, while the OLD ultra-light fluid is on the RIGHT side.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Blobs of sunscreen on my hand.](https://preview.redd.it/0ggre1b9t5k21.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f496e108fa1843e36a154ba3f325c065238f660c)\n\n|NEW shaka fluid|OLD ultra-light fluid|\n|:-|:-|\n|Runny white fluid, but a bit less spreadable than the ultra-light.

Tends to be patchy at first on my face; rubs in to leave white patches. You think it's going to pill, but then you rub in the patches a little more and there's no pilling and the patches are gone. No white cast whatsoever :)|Has a significant sheen. Doesn't like to \"sink in\" on the face; remains spreadable and moves around. Doesn't rub in evenly; leaves white streaks on the face that are literally impossible to 100% blend out (also [these tiny white specks](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ff5f815faede7ce5649a190212000a4a/tumblr_pnuvm7CC2x1vnh3sio1_540.jpg)).

Sometimes the shine is unevenly distributed/there are patches that are less shiny, not sure what's up with that. Overall the shine is bearable; some days I don't powder it and it looks fine. Shine leans more dewy than oily. Despite the shine this is neither moisturizing nor drying.|Still has a white cast (though it fades very slightly) and looks shinier than the shaka. On the face it looks quite ridiculous and I always find the need to powder over it to hide the cast and shine. The shine is not \"dewy\", it's definitely oily. I would not say this is wearable for any skin tones darker than NC30 without a colored foundation/powder on top. Despite the shine this is neither moisturizing nor drying. |\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After 15 minutes, with flash. Neither sunscreen has much flashback.](https://preview.redd.it/6qtwlqauu5k21.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=239868fe76c2e83dd6fd28fdf6a1d9a2b370341c)\n\nIn terms of protection: I've worn the new formulation for normal office days (no reapplications) and skiing in moderate snowfall (also no reapplications). In both cases I was sufficiently protected; no burns or tans, no deepening of PIH (and I tan/get PIH very easily -- most US and Asian formulations aren't protective enough for me). For me this works just as well as the old formulation, if not better.\n\n\\--\n\nOverall, I was pleasantly surprised by this reformulation. Not only is it more cosmetically elegant in terms of both shine and white cast, but it has a slightly higher PPD and doesn't contain octocrylene, which was one of the ingredients I didn't quite like in the old formula. \n\nI will continue to purchase this sunscreen and look forward to seeing how it holds up in higher (summer) UV indices.",

    "body": "Healthy eating isn’t all about calorie counting. Nutritious foods are key, but sometimes it’s nice to know you can grab a quick snack that doesn't deliver an entire meal's worth of calories. The next time hunger creeps up when it’s least convenient (like 30 minutes before a dinner reservation), turn to this list for a small and satisfying bites that won’t ruin a healthy day.\n\n1. Cheesy Popcorn:\n Toss 1 tablespoon of grated Parmesan cheese and a dash of cayenne pepper with 2 cups of freshly popped popcorn. Choose a low-fat, low-sodium pre-packaged variety or pop kernels in a small paper bag in the microwave. Grated parm can have a lot of salt, but one tablespoon has only three percent of the daily recommended value, and only 22 calories for a whole lot of added flavor.\n\n2. Cottage Cheese and Cantaloupe:\n Top ½ cup of low-fat cottage cheese with ½ cup of diced cantaloupe. That ½ cup of cantaloupe delivers 50 percent of the daily recommended values of vitamins A and C, two vitamins that may help promote clear skin.\n\n3. 14 Almonds: \nAlmonds don’t need any extras to be a satisfying snack. Added bonus: They’re the most nutritionally dense nut (which means they have the highest concentration of nutrients per calorie).\n\n4. Baked Apple: \nBaked apples can get all dressed up and filled with oats, nuts, and other tasty stuff. But for a simple low-cal version, core a tennis-ball sized apple, dust with cinnamon, and bake at 350 for 20 minutes (or until tender but not mushy).\n\n5. Jicama and Honey Mustard Dip: \nJicama (pronounced, hic-kuh-muh) is a root veggie that touts 6 grams of fiber per cup. Peel and slice up 1 ½ cups, and dip into a mixture of 1 tablespoon of Greek yogurt, 1 tablespoon of mustard, and 1 teaspoon of honey.\n\n6. Mexican Potato:\n There’s always the option to bake a potato, but for a quick snack version turn to the microwave. Pierce a medium potato (about the size of a computer mouse) a few times with a fork, and microwave on high for about five minutes or until soft (you should be able to pierece with a knife and remove without any resistance). Top ½ of the potato with 1 tablespoon of salsa and 1 tablespoon of plain Greek yogurt (a great stand in for sour cream). Save the other half in the fridge for another snack!\n\n7. Kettle Corn:\n Toss 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of stevia with 2 cups of freshly popped popcorn. Try shaking it all up in a paper bag or a container with a lid on it for even topping distribution. Not a fan of stevia? Swap it for 1 teaspoon of honey plus 1 teaspoon of water microwaved for 20 seconds to thin it out.\n\n8. 22 pistachios:\n These little guys are the biggest bang for your calorie buck. Pistachios rank high in protein and lower in saturated fat compared to many other kinds of nuts. Pick the in-shell variety (not the pre-shelled ones) — they’re less expensive and one study found people consume up to 41 percent more calories from pistachios when they don’t have to crack the shell to work for it.\n\n9. Apples and Cheese:\n Pair a Laughing Cow Mini Babybel Light cheese wheel with half of a baseball-sized apple, sliced. The cheese has 6 grams of protein and 20 percent of the daily recommended value of calcium.\n\n10. Red Pepper and Goat Cheese:\n Slice up one medium red pepper and enjoy with 2 tablespoons of soft goat cheese. Goat cheese is tangy and flavorful, and has about ⅓ fewer calories, and ⅓  the fat per ounce compared to cow’s milk cheese.\n\n11. Chili-Lime Shrimp:\n Toss ten large boiled shrimp in 1 tablespoon of limejuice. Sprinkle with ½ teaspoon of chili powder. Here’s the kicker: this little snack has over 10 grams of protein! Shrimp also have a high concentration of the antioxidant astaxanthin, known to reduce inflammation.\n\n12. Carrots n’ Hummus:\n Chow down on 10 baby carrots with 2 tablespoons of hummus. Jazz it up with fresh herbs like dill or parsley.\n\n13. White Bean Salad:\nCombine ⅓ cup of white beans with 1 tablespoon of sliced scallions, a squeeze of lemon juice, and ¼ cup of diced tomatoes. White beans are a good source of dietary fiber, protein, and iron.\n\n14. Hard Boiled Egg Whites and Mustard:\n Boil four eggs for 12–15 minutes. Let them cool, de-shell them, slice them in half, and remove the yolks with a spoon. Sprinkle with pepper and dip in 1 tablespoon of mustard. The really yellow kinds of mustard get their color from turmeric, an anti-inflammatory spice. Pro tip: If you add 1 teaspoon of baking soda to the water, the eggs will be a cinch to peel!\n\n15. Frozen Grapes:\n  Grapes make a great snack fresh or frozen, but if you opt for the chilly state, they last way longer. Nosh on 1 cup (about 28 grapes). Feeling fancy? Use them as fruity ice cubes in a tall glass of water to stay hydrated while snacking.\n\n16. Egg Whites and Toast Toast one slice of whole-wheat bread and top with 2 scrambled egg whites. Sprinkle with a dash of pepper and paprika.\n\n17. Pumpkin Yogurt:\n Combine ½ cup of nonfat plain Greek Yogurt with ¼ cup of pumpkin puree. Sweeten with stevia, ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract, and a pumpkin pie spice blend (or cinnamon). Pumpkin is a low fat way to increase this snack’s fiber and flavor profile.\n\n18. DIY Chunky Apple Sauce:\n Dice up ½ of a tennis-ball sized apple and add it to ½ cup of unsweetened apple sauce. So much apple! You’ll get the spoonability of apple sauce, but with an added fresh crunch (not like that store-bought mushy chunk). Sprinkle with some cinnamon for an extra flavor kick.\n\n19. Watermelon Salad:\n Top 1 cup of raw spinach with 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar and ¾ cup of diced watermelon. Spinach has a ton of vitamin K (which helps blood to clot properly when you get cuts) and vitamin A (which is good for the eyes).\n\n20. Open Faced Turkey Sammie:\n Toast 1 slice of whole-wheat bread and spread with 1 teaspoon of honey mustard. Top with 2 slices of deli turkey.\n\n21. Avocado Rice Cake:\n Top a rice cake (we like the unsalted brown rice variety) with 1/4 of an avocado, mashed. Sprinkle with cracked black pepper and paprika. Avocados are a good source of monounsaturated fat, the kind of fat that can help improve cholesterol levels and decrease the risk of heart disease\n\n22. Strawberries and Goat Cheese:\n Pair 10 large strawberries with 1 tablespoon of soft goat cheese. This serving of strawberries has over 100 percent of the daily recommended value of vitamin C.\n\n23. Rice Cake and Almond Butter:\n Top a rice cake with 2 teaspoons of almond butter. While it’s not nearly as popular as peanut butter, almond butter is a better choice when it comes to fiber, iron and especially Vitamin E.\n\n24. Enlightened Bars:\n These healthier ice cream bars aren’t just low in calories — they actually have some impressive nutritional stats: Eight grams of protein, no artificial sweeteners, only three grams of sugar, and five grams of fiber per bar. They come in coffee, fudge, and orange cream flavors. (We’re partial to the coffee flavor at Greatist HQ — surprise, surprise.)\n\n25. Kiwi and Coconut Slice:\n 1 large kiwi and top with 1 tablespoon of unsweetened shredded coconut. One kiwi has all the vitamin C to meet the daily recommended value.\n\n26. Cukes and Cream Cheese:\n Cut one medium cucumber into long strips. Combine 2 tablespoons of diced roasted red pepper, 2 tablespoons of low-fat cream cheese, and ¼ teaspoon of cracked pepper. Spread the cream cheese mixture onto the strips. Cucumbers are made up mostly of water, which makes them a healthy low-calorie dipper.\n\n27. Broccoli and Tzatziki Sauce:\n Whip up a quick tzatziki-like sauce by combining 2 tablespoons plain nonfat Greek yogurt, 1 teaspoon lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon of minced cucumber. Dip six florets into the sauce. The healthy bonus here is that eating broccoli raw may help maintain the green veggie’s cancer-fighting nutrients.\n\n28. Baby Corn and Soy Sauce:\n For a super quick snack, dip 20 baby corns into low-sodium soy sauce. Baby corn is high in folate, a B-vitamin that helps produce and maintain new cells.\n\n29. Dark Chocolate:\n This snack doesn’t need any friends  — it’s tasty by itself. Enjoy three squares or five dark chocolate kisses. A bit of the dark stuff can help regulate levels of the stress hormone cortisol.\n\n30. English Muffin and Fruit Butter:\n Toast ½ of a whole-wheat English muffin. Top with 2 teaspoons of pumpkin butter or apple butter for about 30 calories. Choosing these spreads over conventional jams can save about 20 calories per serving.\n\n31. Protein Shake:\n Shake up 1 scoop of vanilla whey protein with 1 cup of unsweetened almond milk. This one’s perfect for post-workout snacking, too — whey protein has been shown to help rebuild muscles after exercise.\n\n[**For More snacking ideas**](http://workouttrends.com/healthy-snacking)",

    "body": "Most people don’t realize that deep inside every one of our cells, we’ve got tiny power plants called mitochondria that keep everything going—our energy, our heartbeats, even our brain function. But as we age, those little engines start slowing down, and when they do, so does everything else. That’s where CoQ10 comes in. It’s like giving your cells a fresh battery boost, helping your body run younger, smoother, longer. Supplementing CoQ10 is one of the smartest things you can do to fight aging, especially if you’re feeling low energy, brain fog, or heart fatigue.\n\nCoQ10 isn’t some trendy health hack—it’s a critical nutrient your body makes less of as you get older. Without enough of it, your heart struggles, your cells get tired, and your whole system runs sluggish. People on statins are hit even harder because those meds drain CoQ10 from the body. That’s why supplementing is essential. Think of CoQ10 like fuel for your life—it keeps your cells moving and your organs strong. And when combined with Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA), the effects are even better. ALA helps recycle antioxidants like CoQ10, vitamin C, and vitamin E—keeping your system in a younger, cleaner, more energetic state.\n\nThe science is actually incredible. In clinical studies like the Q-SYMBIO trial, heart failure patients taking CoQ10 lived significantly longer. It’s shown to improve heart function, lower blood pressure, and protect blood vessels. And for the brain, it helps boost mental clarity, protect memory, and reduce fatigue. Animal studies even show longer lifespans when CoQ10 is taken regularly. Add ALA into the mix, and you’re giving your mitochondria a full tune-up—more energy, less inflammation, better metabolism. This combo is like turning back the biological clock on a cellular level.\n\nTaking CoQ10 is simple, but how you take it matters. It works best when taken with a meal that has some healthy fat, since it’s fat-soluble. The most effective form, especially if you’re over 40, is ubiquinol—it’s the active form your body uses right away. Brands like Life Extension, Jarrow, and Doctor’s Best make highly absorbable versions you can trust. Most people do well with 100–200 mg a day, and if you're older or on statins, higher doses might be even more helpful. ALA is best taken at 300–600 mg a day alongside it for maximum support.\n\nThe benefits go far beyond energy. CoQ10 protects your DNA, lowers inflammation, and supports healthier blood sugar. ALA boosts all that and even supports brain health and nerve regeneration. When people say they feel sharper, stronger, and more “alive” after adding these into their daily routine—it’s not placebo. It’s real biology. You’re giving your body the tools it needs to repair and restore from the inside out. And unlike synthetic drugs, there are no toxic side effects. It’s just giving your body more of what it already knows how to use.\n\nIf you’re trying to convince others, skip the heavy science talk and just tell them the story. CoQ10 is what your heart and brain are begging for as you age. It’s what your mitochondria need to keep you feeling youthful. And if someone is on statins, the conversation is even more urgent—they’re burning through CoQ10 daily without knowing it. Without replacement, they’re aging faster.\n\nIt’s not just about living longer—it’s about living better. Stronger energy, clearer thinking, better workouts, less stress on your heart. CoQ10 and ALA won’t make you immortal overnight, but they’re one of the most proven, affordable, and powerful ways to build a foundation for longevity. They don’t just slow aging—they let you age in reverse where it matters most: your cells.\n\nSo if you're serious about living young and living long, start with your mitochondria. Feed them. Repair them. Power them up. CoQ10 + ALA is where real anti-aging starts—not in creams or surgeries, but in the energy factories that run your life. Give your body the charge it needs to thrive—for decades to come.",

I think the oils were $25 or so, and I've used not even a tenth of any of them to fill multiple pens. And tbh, jojoba is really the only one you probably need- everything else just adds some benefits and luxe feel.\n\nMaking your own nail oil is so much cheaper, and now I've got more money and rewards points for polish 😂 ",

I didn't realize they had a fill line, but honestly, all 3 pens have been perfectly fine without leaks when completely filled.  I also love that they are refillable and not adding waste. The pen only needs a modest intentional squeeze. The ONLY minor way they could improve them is i wish the brush was ever so slightly softer. Don't get me wrong, the brush isn't hard or scratchy, I just feel like a softer plastic would make it feel more luxurious feel/experience. Otherwise, I completely LOVE these. I certainly plan on buying more as I inevitably lose them around my house and work. \nPros: Buy once and reuse, holo lid, doesn't leak, affordable\nCons: could improve the cuticle pusher\n\nhttps://a.co/d/iMVNkCm",

A friend assured me she was a horse expert and would let him live with her two horses to get proper care while I learned, as I was a horse newbie with high anxiety I'd screw up his care. She cared for him and I paid for feed and hay, we would go for rides several times a week together. After the first year I took him to my trainer who had a frank discussion about his very poor body score (which I was somehow blind to because I trusted my friend who kept assuring me he was totally healthy). \n\nA week later I finished his fenced area and brought Commander to live at my house. He hangs out with my mini horse and mini donkey so he's not alone, and has no idea there's a size disparity between them. We gave him 6 lbs of triple crown senior gold 2x a day and added vitamin E, plus free choice hay. \n\n8 months later he's back to his full size self and no longer rushes me for feed. He knows meals are coming when they come, and isn't anxious about it. We have started cutting back the food some (the 12 lbs a day portion is what my trainer feeds her lesson percheron, who obviously works much harder than my glorified pasture princess) since we're at maintence weight, now we will start building muscle. \n\nFriendship with the other person detonated, but I'm okay with it if it means my horse is happy and healthy. I now have an incredible farrier who is an expert at her trade (specifically with drafts) and is more than willing to fill my knowledge gaps, an incredible vet which... same, and multiple absolutely lovely horse ownership mentors who answer every stupid question I have, and provide feedback on what I can do better. \n\nHoping 2025 is the year we build genuine trust and he starts being able to go riding without a friend. Right now he will only go out for rides if he can follow behind someone else.",

Lots of people shared helpful suggestions. Many people were curious to know what the answer would turn out to be.\n\nHere are my two previous posts, for reference:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Horses/comments/vimatm/extreme\\_and\\_dangerousand\\_completely\\_unexplainable/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Horses/comments/vimatm/extreme_and_dangerousand_completely_unexplainable/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Horses/comments/ut7fll/explosive\\_behavior\\_in\\_otherwise\\_sweet/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Horses/comments/ut7fll/explosive_behavior_in_otherwise_sweet/)\n\nSeveral commenters said I should pursue a full neuro work-up on my horse, so I did. He presented with a set of significant but sort of unusual neurological symptoms. His neuro signs oddly became very visible at right around the same time. Stumbling, buckling into front legs, great difficulty going up or down any incline at all. I had x-rays taken of his cervical spine to check for wobblers (or any kind of injury/compression)...but no dice. Blood testing done to look for things like EPM, vitamin deficiency, etc. Also nothing. All the while, he got worse and worse.\n\nI had two teams of vets handling his case. Both were forced to conclude that we were almost certainly looking at EDM. EDM is a progressive and incurable neurological disease. Vets think it is caused by a genetic predisposition, combined with a vitamin E deficiency at a young age, and possibly other environmental triggers. They just don't fully understand it yet. It is showing up in adult horses more and more in recent years. I hope they find a way to prevent it or treat it in the future, but sadly that knowledge will come too late for my horse. The vets recommended humane euthanasia. I felt it was the right choice to prevent any further decline, and for the sake of human safety.\n\nHe was PTS at the New Bolton Center after a final examination by the neurology specialists. Post-mortem results will come back in a few weeks, but the vets were already pretty certain about what they will tell us.\n\nOn his last morning I found him lying down in the field, far away from the other horses, and it took him a long time to get back on his feet. He followed me willingly all the way to the gate, without even being haltered. Somehow I think he knew it was time to go.\n\nEdit: thank you SO much for all of your kind words ❤️ it is truly appreciated",

But for the microbiome they are incredible. First understand how important Resistant starch is for the microbiome.\n\nhttps://www.dermveda.com/articles/why-you-should-eat-resistant-starch-for-a-healthy-microbiome\n\n>Resistant starch is metabolized by microbes in the gut to produce molecules called short chain fatty acids, such as acetate, butyrate and propionate. These short chain fatty acids have significant health benefits, including cancer fighting benefits and anti-inflammatory effects.[4,5] Diets high in resistant starch lead to higher levels of short chain fatty acids and may offer protection against colon inflammation and disease.[6] The dietary fiber that is fermented by our gut microorganisms are referred to as “prebiotics,” leading to the production of beneficial short chain fatty acids and other molecules, including serotonin and deoxycholic acid.[7,8]\n\n>Eating resistant starch may even improve problems with insulin regulation, including insulin resistance and diabetes.[9]\n\nhttps://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/en/new-review-explores-latest-knowledge-resistant-starch-nutrition-modulator-gut-microbiota/\n\n>In addition, RS (resistant starch) has specific beneficial effects on the gut environment including increased populations of Ruminococcus bromii -a dominant member of the phylum Firmicutes that plays a primary role in releasing energy from dietary starches that escape digestion by host enzymes through its exceptional activity against particulate resistant starches. Besides this, ingestion of food products rich in RS has been shown to increase luminal short-chain fatty acid levels, modulate microbial metabolism and improve markers of glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity\n\n>Regarding cell signalling pathways that can explain physiological effects of RS, using animal models it has been well documented that **resistant starch has strong anti-inflammatory properties**\n\nAnd beans are far and away the best source of resistant starch in our diets. They have many more times the RS as any other commonly eaten food. See here for more.\n\nhttps://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/2015/11/16/ask-the-expert-legumes-and-resistant-starch/\n\nEating beans may even alter the microbiome in such a way as to kill cancer cells!\n\nhttps://www.healio.com/gastroenterology/oncology/news/online/%7B1d9afc8b-cef1-4b45-94bc-61dbfc08144b%7D/rice-bran-navy-beans-boost-gut-microbiome-slow-crc-cell-growth\n\n>To evaluate the chemopreventive effects of rice bran and navy bean intake, Ryan and colleagues performed a phase 2 pilot study (the BENEFIT trial), in which they randomly assigned 29 CRC survivors to consume 30 grams of rice bran per day, 35 grams of navy bean powder per day, or neither for 4 weeks.\n\n>They found that increased consumption of rice bran and navy beans led to higher dietary levels of fiber, iron, zinc, thiamin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate, and alpha-tocopherol. Further, stool microbiome analyses revealed the rice bran group had increased gut microbial richness and diversity, and the navy bean group showed increased gut microbial richness.\n\n>Notably, analysis of human stool metabolite extracts before and after the dietary intervention showed increased intake of rice bran or navy beans reduced growth of colorectal cancer cells.\n\nThere's more but thats all I will post for now.",

Ammonia, short chain fatty acids, and in some cases, amines, were the principal products of dissimilatory metabolism. The types of SCFA produced were dependent on the chemical compositions of the test substrates. Thus, acetate and butyrate were formed from the acidic amino acid glutamate, while acetate and propionate predominated in aspartate fermentations. Breakdown of the basic amino acids lysine and arginine was rapid, and yielded butyrate and acetate, and ornithine and citrulline, respectively. The major products of histidine deamination were also acetate and butyrate. However, fermentation of sulphur-containing amino acids was slow and incomplete. Acetate, propionate and butyrate were formed from cysteine, whereas the main products of methionine metabolism were propionate and butyrate. The simple aliphatic amino acids alanine and glycine were fermented to acetate, propionate and butyrate, and acetate and methylamine, respectively. Branched-chain amino acids were slowly fermented by colonic bacteria, with the main acidic products being branched-chain fatty acids one carbon atom shorter than the parent amino acid. Low concentrations of amines were also detected in these fermentations. Aliphatic-hydroxy amino acids were rapidly deaminated by large intestinal microorganisms. Serine was primarily fermented to acetate and butyrate, while threonine was mainly metabolised to propionate. Proline was poorly utilized by intestinal bacteria, but hydroxyproline was efficiently fermented to acetate and propionate. The aromatic amino acids tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophan were broken down to a range of phenolic and indolic compounds.\n\nInterestingly the by product of microbial breakdown of most of the AA was SCFA, which are suspected to be very beneficial to gut health among other things.\n\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00185/full",

To my surprise, a new sunscreen! The hydration boost spf50+. \n\nThis sunscreen is nothing like their other offerings in my opinion. The box for one, calling it a primer, as well as being marketed as skincare. Also, the price tag is very unlike cancer council, being $36.95 RRP ($25.69 here on sale). Now, I get my cancer council products for “free” through AHM private health, so you bet I picked it up immediately. \n\nWhen getting home and opening the box, I was a little shocked. The packaging is… Amazing? It is a lovely blue colour, and it is an airless pump! That’s a win in my books. It looks nothing like any other cancer council product. \n\nNow, I would categorise this product as an “upgraded” version of their iconic face day wear moisturiser (the pink tube one). The sunscreen ingredients in this are similar, however I love the inclusion of Bemotrizinol at 2%, arguably the best sunscreen ingredient the world has to offer. Looking at the ingredients list on the TGA website, this includes squalane, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin E as the skincare ingredient. I have no idea what “PolyFructol Plus” could mean looking at the ingredients, but someone please feel free to enlighten me. This sunscreen does feel moisturising enough for my balanced skin type. \n\nThe feel of this sunscreen is somewhere between the matte fluid and the pink tube. It’s lovely. And the finish is stated as “satin”, which I absolutely agree with. The “matte” fluid is not matte at all, so my trust with cancer council has been down, but this sunscreen looks absolutely beautiful on the skin. \n\nAll in all, this may become my new favourite sunscreen. It feels beautiful on the skin, has superb ingredients, and the packing is delightful. The pink tube may have been dethroned!\n\nIf you get a chance to try this sunscreen out let me know your thoughts!\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDuePerfomance ",

    "body": "Public Service Announcement: Natasha Denona eyeshadow products are apparently \\[now?\\] **Preservative-Free**.  \\[Edits including PHOTOS at the end\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\"Free\"*\n\nI'm so mad at myself.\n\nA couple of days ago I watched Natasha Denona's YouTube videos revealing the Hyper - natural Face Palette.\n\nMinutes or hours earlier, I had bought the palette on early release on her website.\n\nI am not overly familiar with the brand (just bought my first ND products last year) or the artist, so I was enjoying learning more about both as she introduced the new palette.\n\nThen, at the end, in her pleasant soft-spoken voice with gentle accent, she said: \"All formulas are Paraben-free, CLEAN, and even Talc-Free\" <smile>\n\n***\\**** \\****Record scratch  \\* \\****\n\nI just took delivery of the palette and scrambled to read the outer packaging. Sure enough, the list of \"Frees\" on the outer box is almost a dozen items long.\n\nI ran to check the other powder products I had purchased over the past few months.\n\nThe older releases (Love midi palette and some minis/quints) had preservatives, but I would have known that when I ordered those last year; I almost always read ingredients lists carefully, to make sure (a) they have preservatives, (b) no essential oils or other things that wreck my sensitive, crybaby skin, and (b) no real glitter.\n\nI must have been coasting on the knowledge of the old palette when I made my most recent purchases that came out in 2023 and now, 2024.\n\nMini Starlette palette, Xenon midi palette , Mini My Dream palette, and now Hy-Per Natural or whatever face palette are full of \"Frees\" including the dreaded **Preservative-Free.**\n\nAt some point last year she must have gone \"free.\"\n\nUGH.\n\nI never, ever return any type of product. But **the excessive Freedom of this new palette** combined with how yellow-based an unfortunate number of shades turned out to be (I'm very cool toned) has me seriously contemplating a return.\n\nAnd now I am dismayed I can't get more of her new release powder products going forward. Her company obviously wants heaps of new or one-time customers who will buy a palette here and there, not beauty hobbyists like me with large wardrobes we cycle through over time.\n\nAnd that's fine for her and them, but products that list Vegetable Oil as a third ingredient and have no other preservative-action ingredients but vitamin E and, for some, plant extracts, are not the stuff of large makeup wardrobes.\n\nI can only comfort myself that I caught this after having spent 200-300 USD (caught a few sales) instead of many hundreds or even 1,000+ dollars.\n\n\\---------------\n\n**EDIT Feb. 23rd:** Thank you to those who in the comments who've commented about ingredients in the Hy-per Natural Face palette that may have some preservative properties, depending on the rest of the formula! I pointed out a few in my OP plus explained in the comments section why those and certain others are not ones I, based on my personal experience with using and, at one time, home-making, cosmetics feel happy to rely on long-term in formulas like these that seem to have lots of emollient ingredients.\n\n**But there may well be other ingredients with which I've not personally experimented and that consumers can reasonably expect to preserve their product.** I truly hope that, if not the ingredients with which I have experience, at least one other ingredient in every shade in this palette will sustain the creamy/oily formulas for at least the 24 Month life printed on the Hyper Natural Face palette package.\n\nMy point in posting was to alert potential customers of the Natasha Denona that the company has listed **\"Preservative Free\"** along with several other \"Frees\" on both the packaging of both this new palette and several other recent (2023-2024) releases. People deserve to know such information, which is not always readily available information during a new release.\n\nThose of us who have been using or buying powder makeup for multiple decades know that powders having a long-term life of use and enjoyment is a reasonable expectation given careful use and storage. But even for those of us who quickly go through one or two full palettes that get heavy use, I believe the information in this post is important to know before buying.\n\nSome of us with highly sensitive, \"reactive\" skin and eyes have spent many years building up our knowledge about common ingredients in their makeup and skincare. In my case, I started doing so in the 1990s, before wide access to any Internet beauty forums that may have existed, and I'm thankful we now have places like this to discuss the information or claims brands have made about their products and ingredients.\n\nTo that end, I'll be keeping my lined and shadowed eyes open for information about new formulas and combinations of ingredients, especially in the more emollient eyeshadows of recent years, and I encourage others to do the same!\n\nThank you each for your replies and discussion!\n\n\\[**EDIT 2, Feb. 24th**: I have attached and put in the Comments three photos, two of the Hy-Per Natural face palette released and received this week and one of the several palettes I bought in 2023 and early 2024.  All palettes purchased from Natasha Denona's US website.

Stuff going bad as quickly as a kosas concealer in a 75€ midi palette like xenon would be unacceptable\n\n_However_\nI ran a shade of Midi Xenon through inci decoder and it pulled ethylhexylglycerin and Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate\n\nThe first is a preservative and deodorant. The second is specifically preserving color. I'm not sure how good they are compared to others, but that means this palette is (fortunately!) NOT completely preservative free.\n\nOP, your face palette also contains  ethylhexylglycerin. I would look at that ingredient and decide whether that's sufficient for you to want to keep it or not. I'm no cosmetic chemist so I can't speak for how efficient this is, but it DOES look like you got a preservative despite them calling it clean and everything free. Personally, I won't buy from them until I researched that too, so thank you for bringing it to my attention!!\n\nClean beauty unfortunately isn't well defined, so it can mean a lot, from no preservative petri dish to some, but not the ones that are trendy to hate.

Both of these are synthetic and used in mainstream cosmetic formulations.\n\nThere are other ingredients in the products that have preservative qualities though this is not their main purpose; for example, Caprylyl Glycol is a preservative booster and again is used in mainstream products. Hydrogenated vegetable oil is also used as a preservative, for example in processed foods.\n\nThese ingredients are listed well before you get to Vit E, which is the last ingredient on the list, except for Casual which has raspberry leaf extract just after it.\n\n'Clean' is just a marketing term... people assume it means 'no preservatives or stabilisers' but quite a lot of the time when you look at the formulas this is just not the case. Sometimes it means that, sometimes it means 'hippie preservatives', and sometimes it means 'any ingredient we decided wasn't going to hurt anyone'. Here it looks like it might mean 'paraben free'.\n\nI guess the question is whether these formulations have a shorter shelf life than previous formulations - not sure about that.",

I'll need to do more research on this before I decide to buy any more of her palettes.\n\nIf anyone from Natasha Denona is reading this - please reconsider your use of of the word \"clean\", and removing preservatives from your products.

And I'm an Aussie! 😅 (living in Canada)\n\nMy sunscreen was old and I forgot to buy a new one, I was out in direct sun for a few hours unprotected. My burn looked normal the first day, but it got painful and turned purple!! I googled what the heck is happening and apparently it has to do with your blood vessels. 😵‍💫 My legs were so sore, I religiously put vitamin e and aloe everyday. But the damage was horrible and so sensative. My chest wasn't as burnt and wasn't painful so I was lucky I brought my hoodie to shield my shoulders and arms. PLEASE don't make the same mistake as me. Your skin is extra sensative and healing takes FOREVER! 😭😭 ",

I went with the keratin 3 day growth version after a week of Nail Envy and the difference was insane. I also oil once a day and did an oil soak whenever I took off the strengthener, I use the jojoba and vitamin e oil mix recommended by Christine from simplynailogical. \n\n * vitamins: prenatal worked so much better than hair skin and nails vitamins. I’m not sure what the difference is between the two but there was a big jump in growth rate with that switch as well. Hydration also seems to have played a big role, the more water I drank the smaller the white spots got on most nails. \n\n * general upkeep: I was filing back as far as I could every day, because if I didn’t they would inevitably crack or chip or tear and hurt like a mf. It’s better now that a lot of the damage is gone but I still have to be careful right now. ",

I'm posting to share my favorite bath time ingredients, and get suggestions for other bath time ingredients from the community. Here are the ingredients I use and what I use them for: \n\nDead Sea Salt- To moisturize, reduce inflammation, and nourish skin.\n\nEpsom Salt- To ease sore muscles and cramps.\n\nCitric Acid- To cleanse without soap, brighten skin, and prevent yeast infection.\n\nApple Cider Vinegar- To cleanse without soap, prevent yeast infection, and add micro-nutrients.\n\nVitamin E- To moisturize and nourish dry winter skin.\n\nOatmeal- To remove allergens and excess body oil, ease inflammation, and moisturize.\n\nTHC oil- For a super relaxing body-high.\n\n I don't use all of these ingredients at once. I usually mix two or three together to get the results I'm looking for. I always use either vinegar or citric acid to reduce the pH of my alkaline tap water and prevent infection. \n\nWhat do you use?   ",

Like literally the bath water was a different color! I hadn’t realized the water *smelled* like chlorine, too… until it didn’t!\n\nIt’ll help with hard water (your soaps, etc might lather better!) and other impurities as well (eg, stuff flaking off old pipes). \n\nSeriously, game changer.\n\n——\n\n…but I was also gonna say that I love adding rose petals to the bath. I thought it was just decorative, but no, in hot water the oils seep out of the petals and leave skin feeling silky.

I went to the one in Copenhagen but they have a couple in the states too, I think Chicago and NY, and several other locations across Europe. You guys… the room was a converted cellar with a stone tub and the bath water was blood red. The redness comes from Spanish Ribera Del Duero grapes. They did a jasmine scented hair mask and scalp massage, served me a glass of red wine and I got to enjoy the bottle throughout the salt pools the rest of the evening. The entire place was lit by candlelight and I got a merlot colored suede bath robe (everyone else’s is white teri so you feel like the fucking priestess). Chocolates, fresh grapes and Manchego cheese. The building is a 400yr old brewery with two giant stone elephants at the entrance and mountains of salt next to turquoise limestone pools.. I died.

With that said, I don't have any specific condition that requires special treatment or attention and I also don't get breakouts easily (last time I got one was last year). My nose, on the other hand, is VERY hard to treat - if I touch it feels like sand and grainy, but at the same time oily and dehydrated  - so, I'm still looking for a specific product that can do it justice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy main goal is: **hydration, hydration and hydration!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere we go, I'll try to be as simple and effective as possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*1ST CLEANSER*\n\n**2.5/5.  banila co. Clean it Zero Cleansing Balm (original, purifying and nourishing)** \\- honestly, didn't do much, it was hard to apply and it didn't clean as good as an oil cleanser (maybe my skin doesn't like balms?). I won't say it's a bad product, but I won't say it's good either. I used those 3 balms and I didn't feel they were any different in terms of results.\n\n**3.5/5. heimish All Clean Balm** \\- yeah, it's a nice balm (and balms don't sit well on my skin apparently), it smells like very good, it's not hard to apply at all, cleans just ok. I think it's a good product for any skin type without being amazing at anything.\n\n**4/5.  THE FACE SHOP Rice Water Bright Cleansing Light Oil** \\- glides beautifully, cleans really well, smells SO GOOD (but don't buy this if you're fragrance sensitive or don't like smells). Vitamins, minerals, ceramide... great! The fragrance, not much, without it, it would be 5/5.\n\n**4/5. Neogen Dermalogy Real Cica Micellar Cleansing Oil** \\- it's soothing and very good for sensitive skin. It cleanses really well, but I don't think it's enough to get rid of my blackheads. Great option if you want a good cleansing without compromising your skin. It's also hydrating!\n\n**4/5. Cosrx Low pH First Cleansing Milk** \\- I never heard of first cleansing milks until I saw this totally randomly. I was surprised how well it glided and cleansed, 0 irritation, 0 problems with this, perfect for sensitive skin, it's a very good product. However, if you want a deeper cleanse, you'll want to switch for something stronger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*2ND CLEANSER*\n\n**1/5. THE FACE SHOP Rice Water Bright Foaming Cleanser**  \\- unlike the oil cleanser that I absolutely like, this one is the exact opposite. It gives this squeaky clean feeling without sensing any good ingredient penetrating your skin, but it's also very drying!\n\n**1/5. \\[ETUDE HOUSE\\] Soon Jung PH 6.5 Whip Cleanser** \\- I don't know what's up with people loving this cleanser, it gives me a tacky feeling. I feel clean, yeah, but even using a toner after this is hard. It's definitely not abrassive whatsoever, but there are so many better options.\n\n**2/5. Innisfree Jeju Volcanic Pore Cleansing Foam** \\- I bought this when I was still confused about my skin type and condition. I really liked the texture of this cleanser and you could feel the little grains that served for cleansing - because of that, it felt a bit harsh on my skin and I was feeling that squeaky clean feeling from overcleansing. Not for me at all, but it can be quite good for oily skin types.\n\n**2/5. NEOGEN\\] Dermalogy Real Fresh Foam (Blueberry)** \\- supposedly, it's made for drier skin types, so I bought this after using the green tea one. It was worse, it made my skin drier (irony) and I was feeling a bit down for using this because I loved the green tea cleanser so much.\n\n**2/5. Hada Labo Rohto Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Cleansing Foam** \\- sorry, I know some of you love this, but it dried my skin a bit. I love how much product you get for the price and that's the biggest win for me.\n\n**3/5. SKINMISO Rice Foaming Cleansing** \\- for a foam cleanser, it didn't feel drying and it was quite brightening. It cleansed enough.\n\n**3,5/5.  COSRX Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser** \\- good cleanser, good price, does the job. The ingredient list isn't outsanding. Great for summer, not so much for winter as it can be quite drying. Cleans ok and foams just enough. There's one ingredient Doctor Pi mentionned to be quite bad for the skin but I don't recall the name.\n\n**4/5. NEOGEN\\] Dermalogy Real Fresh Foam (Green Tea)** \\- ahh, yes, love this but at the same time I don't like the fact that it's not hydrating at all (but it's not drying either). Sooo many ingredients in this product and I love its concept. It's definitely one of my favorite products and I wish it could be more hydrating.\n\n**4/5. Hada Labo Tokyo Hydrating Facial Cleanser** \\- this is the most hydrating cream-to-foam cleanser I've ever used and it's very hard to come by to something like that. The smell was so great, it cleansed so well and didn't feel too much. Why am I not giving this a 5? I still need a bit more hydration when cleansing and it's a product hard to find if you live in Europe. Overall, very good product.\n\n**4.5/5. KLAIRS Rich Moist Foaming Cleanser** \\- my favorite foam cleanser. It's VERY hydrating, so soothing, so soft... its got everything I like in a cleanser and it's not stripping at all. The problem? It's pricey and it's only 100ml in a foam format, so you will quickly use this.\n\n**5/5. LRP Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Facial Cleanser** \\- the best cleanser for dry skin, ever! The texture, the effectiveness, the quantity of product you get... everything is great with this product. After using this, my face feels soooo soft! It's aesthetically pleasing as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*EXFOLIATORS*\n\n**1/5. Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid** \\- I bought this twice, because I was convinced that one bottle wasn't enough to show results. It did NOTHING. I applied it in so much different ways (even using snail's method) but none worked, and I have huge blackheads and pores. At least it maked my skin slighty brighter, but nothing wow.\n\n**1/5. Dr G. Brightening Peeling Gel** \\- ugh, this product is a nightmare. It's so hard to use this without getting skin crawl. Just applying this feels awful and I didn't see any results or effectiveness. I was brighter though.\n\n**2/5. BY WISHTREND Mandelic Acid 5% Skin Prep Water** \\- skin is definitely smoother when I used this, but it tingled EVERY time. Not a good sign and not a good sensation, I stopped using this after 7 or 8 uses.\n\n**3/5. Cosrx AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid** \\- so, in the short run, my skin feels so freaking soft when I apply this. On the long run, I don't see any difference, my skin gets back to what it usually is. The smell is awful bad as well and it was very tingly at the beginning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*WASH-OFF MASKS*\n\n**0/5. Freeman Skin Face Mask Pack Purifying Cleansing (Avocado)** \\- I don't know what I was thinking when I bought this, it's just VERY drying, I don't even see the point of a mask that doesn't even hydrate a little bit.\n\n**1/5. ArtNaturals Dead Sea Mud Mask for Face, Body/Hair - honestly, not great for the face at all, as it's a bit drying. Definitely a good feeling on the body though.**\n\n**1/5. INNISFREE Super Volcanic Peel Off Mask** \\- I mean, it doesn't do anything specifically good. It's a gentler option than most peel off masks, but at the same time, if you're not peeling anything, what are you good for?\n\n**1.5/5. \\[SKIN&LAB\\] Glacial Clay Facial Mask** \\- very cooling sensation but it burns my face so much, I couldn't handle this for a long time. It's a great option if you're feeling VERY oily and you need something to cool down quickly.\n\n**2/5. Elizavecca Milky Piggy Carbonated Bubble Clay Mask**  \\- this is good for trendy selfies and instagram stories. It feels fresh when applied in the summer and it's a weird tingling sensation but not irritative. Other than that, not exceptionnal, I don't think it makes my skin any better than what normal clays would usually do. It's a fun product, nothing else.\n\n**2/5. SKINFOOD Black Sugar Mask Wash Off** \\- ok, a bit of controversy. This smells really great, it's easy to apply and wash off and leaves my skin really soft. BUT, it's also a bit harsh and as I was still uneducated about exfoliators and skin types, I was applying a physical exfoliator religiously on a dry skin. Good job. It's not a bad product, but avoid because it's easy to overexfoliate with it.\n\n**2.5/5. SkinFood ​Black Sugar Honey Mask Wash Off** \\- it's betetr than the black sugar mask, but a bit worse than the rice mask one.\n\n**3/5. SKINFOOD Rice Mask Wash Off** \\- I liked it better than the Black Sugar one, for being softer and gentler. But, it's still a physical exfoliator and I don't think I benefited my skin that much by rubbing those tiny little particules. It's definitely an improvement to the black sugar anyway.\n\n**3/5. Goodal Wash Up Deep Clean Pore Glacial Clay Wash Off** \\- great for summertime and for my oily nose. Normal results, normal product, nothing outstanding.\n\n**3.5/5. I'M FROM Volcanic Mask** \\- it's got the best texture out of all the clay masks out there, but I don't think it performs as well. It's kinda creamy and it's very easy to wash off, but it's a very expensive product for what it actually does.\n\n**4/5. Innisfree Super Volcanic Pore Clay Mask** \\- honestly, I don't think clay masks do that much to your skin besides a temporary clean and fresh feeling, but the only reason I'm giving a higher review to this one is because of how cheap it is to how much product they give you - and I find it also more effective! It's harder to clean, but you eventually get used to it.\n\n**5/5. I'M FROM Honey Mask** \\- this.is.the.goat. The most hydrating, soothing and softening product I've used all those years is right there people. It's on the expensive side, but honestly, there's nothing bad about this! I crave it every day and I wish I was a millionaire to buy a room full of this product only.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*TONERS*\n\n**0/5. COSRX Two In One Poreless Power Liquid** \\- what is even this product, seriously? It just felt like water and nothing else.\n\n**0/5. ETUDE HOUSE Wonder Pore Freshner 10 in 1** \\- honestly, a big no for a lot of reasons (drying af being a reason enough). This is the kind of product you start with when you begin a skincare journey and like what you see but don't care what you get.\n\n**1/5. Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera** \\- very, very drying. But at least it was a nice post-shave option.\n\n**2.5/5. LANEIGE Cream Skin Refiner** \\- ahm, I'm confused with this one. The rave is huge on the internet and everyone swears by this, but honestly, I just felt like applying watery milk on my skin and it didn't even feel moisturizing or hydrating at all, just a bit sticky. It does absorb after a while and it kinda brightens my face, but other than that, it's just a normal product for me.\n\n**3/5. SON&PARK BEAUTY WATER** \\- I think it's a good product to clean, exfoliate and tone at the same time, so I wouldn't use this regularly but rather when I feel my skin more congested or in need of some slight exfoliation but not enough to bring a specific exfoliating product. I loved the smell and the packaging. However, it's a bit drying depending on the products you pair it with, so it's very tricky to incorporate this in a stable routine.\n\n**3/5. \\[ETUDE HOUSE\\] Soon Jung PH 5.5 Relief Toner** \\- before saying anything, this is an excellent product for people with sensitive skin or people who need some hydration but don't want to spend tons of money on expensive toners. It's affordable and good, but since I have dry and dehydrated skin, it doesn't compare that well to toners like the KLAIRS one. Of course, ymmv, but I just felt like I was applying water and nothing else.\n\n**3.5/5. Benton Aloe BHA Toner** \\- very good for summertime and as an after shave. It's soothing, relaxing, a bit sticky but it compensates with the rest of the benefits. Since I have dry skin, I need something more hydrating.\n\n**4.5/5. KLAIRS Supple Preparation Facial Toner** \\- my go-to toner when I need to press reset or to wait while a find a new toner. So many hydration comes from this and the ingredient list is fantastic. I don't have a problem with the oils, but there's always the unscented version. I used both and didn't see any differene on my skin besides the smell. Other than that, I just don't give it a 5 because it's an expensive product and it doesn't last that long.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*ESSENCE/TREATMENTS/VITAMIN C*\n\n**1/5. MISSHA Time Revolution The First Treatment Essence** \\- another product that did absolutely nothing. At least the packaging feels luxurious and it lasted for a very long time.\n\n**2/5. KLAIRS Freshly Juiced Vitamin Drop** \\- another product that did nothing at all. I only liked how good it is for sensitive skin and I've used it on my nose several times, had no reaction, so I'll at least give a bit of props to the effort put into the formula.\n\n**2/5. MIZON Water volume EX first essence** \\- eh, it's nice, doesn't do anything exceptional besides giving some hydration.\n\n**2/5. Rohto Melano CC Anti-Spot Whitening Serum with Vitamins C** \\- same thing as the Klairs vitamin c, I don't see anything different (let's just say I don't need any vitamin c apparently).\n\n**2.5/5. PURITO Fermented Complex 94 Boosting Essence** \\- I noticed my skin brighter, that's for sure. Other than that, nothing really different, the product is ok, uses up pretty quickly, not innovative.\n\n**3/5. Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence** \\- it's not a bad product, at the beginning it was very hydrating and made my skin extremely soft! But, I can't stand the stickiness and it makes my next products apply much harder. I felt a bit disgusting wearing that on my face even though I know it contains really good ingredients.\n\n**4.5/5. ROHTO Hada labo Gokujyun PREMIUM Hyaluronic Acid Super Moist Lotion** \\- everyone knows this product, it just resurrects the Jesus out of my skin. I'm not giving it a 5 because it's actually very heavy on the skin and takes some time to penetrate, so when doing my routine I have to wait a bit more time just because of this one product. Other than that, a godsend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*AMPOULES/SERUM*\n\n**2/5. MISSHA Time Revolution Night Repair Ampoule** \\- hmm, yeah, I was expecting more from this. I saw the ingredients list and was amazed, but the results? I didn't see anything. But it still applies very well and leaves my skin a bit more soft.\n\n**4/5. Mizon Original Skin Energy Hyaluronic Acid 100 Ampoule** \\- oh wow, so hydrating! This is the stuff my skin needs. I'm just not sure how much benefits it gives to my skin besides hydrating it.\n\n**4/5. Klairs Rich Moist Soothing Serum** \\- yeah, loved this stuff. Great hydration for my skin, great ingredients, no particular reactions whatsover. I just find the price a bit high as in any Klairs product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*EYE CREAM*\n\n**2/5. Whamisa Organic Flowers Eye Essence** \\- the first and last time I bought an expensive product for my eye area. It smells really good and it's very light, but... no results. Don't expect anything from this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*MOISTURIZER*\n\n**1/5. Nature Republic Soothing & Moisture Aloe Vera 92% Soothing Gel** \\- very drying on the skin after a while, smell is not so great and there are way better aloe vera options out there without alcohol. It's good for sunburns on your body tho.\n\n**2/5. BENTON\\] Aloe Propolis Soothing Gel** \\- honestly, I don't feel like it's for my skin at all, even in the summer. I didn't feel moisturized enough and even when I was feeling all sweaty and clogging, it just felt like applying a cold gel and that was it. I know the ingredients list is good, it's just didn't provide enough hydration for me.\n\n**2.5/5 Cosrx Oil-Free Ultra Moisturizing Lotion** \\- ahhh, this product is so weird. It smells nice and it applies easily whenever it's summer or winter. However, it gives a strange greasy feeling to my skin, but it doesn't feel heavy or anything like that. I just feel oilier but no greasier, if that makes sense.\n\n**3/5. Rohto Hada labo SHIROJYUN PREMIUM Whitening milky lotion** \\- it's an ok moisturizer, it's definitely light on the skin, easy to apply, feels nice, but I feel like I need more hydration and protection.\n\n**3.5/5. Holika Holika Aloe 97% Soothing Lotion Intensive Moisturizing** \\- \"intensive moisturizing\" indeed, but not hydrating enough and doesn't have enough good ingredients to be THE moisturizer I'm looking for. It's a nice, casual option if you want a light moisturizer or after burn spot treatment, you get a lot of product for a good a price and you can also use this in your body.\n\n**4/5. MIZON Black Snail All in one Cream** \\- a great and cheap option for all the product you get. Not the best moisturizer out there but you get some good soothing ingredients and it's a good alternative for pricier products that do more or less the same. Don't recommend using this in the summer as you'll feel greasy.\n\n**4/5. Etude House Soon Jung 2X Barrier Intensive Cream** \\- I was surprised by the simplicity of the product and how well it functionned. For the price and for the ingredients you get, it's a good product for sure. I was needing a bit more hydration than what it could provide, but at the same time I wasn't feeling bad for applying this and it certainly is a solid choice if you want a safe moisturizer that won't compromise your skin in any kind of situation.\n\n**4/5. Klairs Rich Moist Soothing Cream** \\- lovely moisturizer, so soothing, a bit hydrating, it sits comfortably on the skin. It's got a fantastic ingredient list. If it were cheaper (and I understand why it's not), I would definitely give it a 5.\n\n**4/5. Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream** \\- instant soothing sensation, amazing texture and smell, god this product is fantastic and it helps so much for my shaving routine and tingling sensation when I get any kind of irritation. But again, it's pricey.\n\nEDIT: I don't know how I forgot this product! **4.5/5. Cerave PM Lotion** \\- it's so lightweight, it absorbs really well, it has fantastic ingredients for my skin, it's really safe to use and it lasts for quite some time! I know it's not AB, but it's one damn good product! Could have given 5/5 if it wasn't for the fact that's it a bit hard to find and some websites make it so damn pricier than it usually is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*SPF*\n\n**2/5. Klairs Mid-day Blue Lotion** \\- I hated the white cast on this so much. It's also not hydrating or comfortable to wear. I just give it a 2 because of the nice ingredients list.\n\n**3/5. Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence Sunscreen Hyaluronic Acid** \\- amazing protection, the products smells nice but it's also a bit drying if I don't use hydrating products before, so beware of that.\n\n**3.5/5. MISSHA\\] All Around Safe Block Waterproof Sun Milk** \\- I really liked this, glided so well, protected so much and it's an affordable product. I love the consistency and the easiness to apply it, great sunscreen option!\n\n**3.5/5. ROHTO Skin Aqua Super Moisture Milk -** I would say it compares to the previous one.\n\n**4.5/5. MISSHA All-around Safe Block Essence Sun** \\- hmm, essence spf, what a great invention! This is a must for winter times when you want that extra moisture. It's not sticky all (unless you use this in the summer) and it's cheap for how well it performs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*SLEEPING PACKS*\n\n**1.5/5. Laneige Water Sleeping Mask** \\- oof, the fragrance is so heavy on this one. It doesn't absorb that much and it feels very heavy on my skin. It's got some hydrating properties, but I don't think it's worth using this just because of the ridiculous amount of smell emaning from it.\n\n**2/5. Etude House Moistfull Collagen Sleeping Pack** \\- I liked how hydrating it is at the beginning but the next morning I don't feel my skin as plump as when I'm using other sleeping packs. It also contains alcohol and fragrance, big no no. I don't give it a 1 because my skin didn't suffer anything from it and it's still a good cream for other body parts.\n\n**3.5/5 \\[LANEIGE\\] Lip Sleeping Mask** \\- I love the strawberry smell and how much product you get for the price (it lasts a really long time trust me). It really hydrates and my lips feel very soft, however, it's easy to apply too much and it becomes quite greasy and heavy after a while.\n\n**3.5/5. Klairs Freshly Juiced Vitamin E Mask** \\- very good ingredient list, my skin was brighter and definitely more moisturized. Why this rating? It's very expensive for what it does, it's very hard to apply and it can be messy sometimes. I like how innovative the texture is but the overall result was good but not amazing (it dried my skin for a period but it went away).\n\n**3.5/5. Cosrx Ultimate Nourishing Rice Overnight Spa Mask** \\- hmm, it's good, I wake up brighter and smoother for sure. There's something weird with this product though. Some days it feels amazing on the skin but some days it just feels like it's drying but not quite, idk. I'm not sure about the smell either, it smells like rice but I can definitely smell some other chemicals that are a bit discomforting. But yeah, does the job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*SPOT TREATMENTS*\n\n**5/5. Cosrx Centella Blemish Cream** \\- I use this when I get pimples or some kind of inflammation. It's rare to happen, but when it does, I just put a bit of the product on those concerned areas and in the next 2/3 days they are GONE, it's no joke! Very good ingredient list, very good price, huge amount of product and it's effective.\n\n**5/5. Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch** \\- nothing to say about this, it's cheap af and effective af. I like to apply a patch on a pimple after cleansing and before toning, leaving it all night (or during the day, I just use a concealer or something on top of it).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*OILS*\n\n**4.5/5. Acure The Essentials Marula Oil** \\- the only oil I've used until now and I'm loving it. I pair this with a heavy moisturizer at night when I feel I need more hydration and protection, but I also pair it with a light-medium moisturizer if I want the same feeling but don't want to risk feeling congestionned (if it's summer for example).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI may be forgetting some products since I couldn't keep track of everything I bought, but those are the most importants at least.\n\nAlso, you may have seen I've used a lot of wash-off masks compared to the number of products I used for moisturizers or toners. It just means that I repurchased some products 2 or 3 times and most of my wash-off masks were given to some friends :) I also stopped using them on my whole face and restricted it only to my nose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo for now, my **TOP 5** produts are:\n\n1. I'M FROM Honey Mask\n2. LRP Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Facial Cleanser\n3. ROHTO Hada labo Gokujyun PREMIUM Hyaluronic Acid Super Moist Lotion\n4. KLAIRS Supple Preparation Facial Toner\n5. MISSHA All-around Safe Block Essence Sun (or Cerave PM Lotion, I have to include this in my ranking somewhere)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course, this can change with time and I'm still trying to find what works best for my skin, so if someone out there has a similar skin type or likes similar products, please shout and share something :D",

        "body": "I have the same skin type, dry and dehydrated, and sometimes oily on the nose with obvious blackheads. I find that foam cleansers tend to be more drying that’s why I steered clear of them. I’m using Fresh Soy Cleanser, but even though not AB, it’s got a 5.5 PH and it doesn’t foam, but I still feel clean and soft afterwards.\n\nAlso, I hope you alternate your exfoliation and wash off masks. Wash off masks especially the clay mask I find is another form of exfoliation. So I hope you didn’t overexfoliate. And as for chemical exfoliation, I was advised to leave it on for a few minutes before applying anything else. I usually leave it for 5 minutes though or less since I have drier and sensitive skin.\n\nAlso, I’m a big fan of Laneige Cream Skin Refiner so I’m a bit bummed that it didn’t work for you. Did you pat it on with your hands as opposed to using a cotton pad? I find that you waste the product by using cotton pad because and although it tones well, I prefer my skin to soak all the product up instead of leaving half on the cotton pad.\n\nAlso, if you’re gonna apply your essence, the first product you’ll need to apply is your vitamin c. Vitamin C can be very unstable, on the packaging and storage. Also, due to its compound, it might react with other certain products especially if you apply one another too soon*. (*also another reason why I find my hydrating/moisturizing products get sticky is because I didn’t leave enough time in between for my skin to absorb) Take  your time with it and enjoy.\n\nSo far, I enjoy reading your post. I hope you find my tips helpful.",

Although my skin doesn't work well with thick and heavy products like sleeping masks, I like this mask a lot. As long as I don't put on too much, it sinks in okay. Though I do avoid it during warmer days (tropical country with horribly humid climate) as I tend to wake up with greasy skin. But again, this might just be because my skin hates thick products lol.",

He left a large file box of case reports with me. I don't know what to make of them, but it looks like he tried to publish about three-quarters of them. All were rejected. I think he intended for me to publish them. What you make of them is up to you.)\n\nCase 3\n\nA brain abscess following foreign-object implantation in the brain.\n\nThe patient was a 25-year-old male. He had been out of contact with relatives for several weeks, which was unusual. When they visited him at his apartment, they found him lethargic and confused and brought him to the hospital.\n\nOn examination, he was underweight (BMI = 16.2), although apparently not malnourished. He was febrile (axillary temperature 102 F) and confused. He responded to almost all questions with garbled, indecipherable speech. The only notable physical abnormality was a fresh wound on the head, in the region of the right temporal bone. The hair in this area had been recently shaved, and the wound was covered with a gauze dressing, which, when removed, revealed an infected suture apparently performed with ordinary sewing thread.\n\nThe patient's father and sister could not shed any light on his condition, and due to concerns about possible illicit metal body modifications (the patient had numerous tattoos and holes from old piercings), a CT scan was chosen over an MRI. The scan revealed a round hole (approx 20 mm in diameter) in the temporal bone, small subdural hematoma over the medial surface of the right temporal lobe, an elongated abscess penetrating into the temporal white matter, and a larger abscess within the parenchyma of the right temporal lobe. This latter abscess appeared to contain an X-ray-dense foreign body. The patient was started on broad-spectrum IV antibiotics (chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and amoxacillin) and referred to neurology for emergency neurosurgery. Dr. Akbal performed the surgery, with the author assisting and observing.\n\nThe cranial opening pressure was 82 mmH2O, and a CSF leak was considered, although none was apparent on the CT scan. In view of the extent of the abscess and the potential for occult injury or foreign matter, a large craniotomy was performed, circumscribing the upper half of the temporal bone and a small portion of the lower parietal bone.\n\nVisual inspection revealed septic meningitis covering the entire surgical field. There was clotted blood on the surface of the meninges, as well as the small hematoma strikingly evident beneath the meninges. The field was irrigated and debrided, at which point a large quantity of yellowish-white purulent material oozed from the meninges at the location of the head injury. After this material was aspirated, foreign material was found adhering to the surface of the meninges. This was found to be partly-encapsulated monofilament fishing line, which had apparently been used to suture the meninges. This was carefully removed, which caused the release of approximately 100 mL of purulent, foul-smelling fluid. \n\nUpon examination of the brain, there was clear evidence of septic encephalitis, and a large abscess penetrating into the temporal lobe. This suggested to us a possible gunshot injury or other malicious trauma. The injury penetrated the brain approximately 1 cm below the midpoint of the Sylvian fissure, and was surrounded by inflamed tissue, small clots, and edema. The abscess was explored, and was found to extend 7 cm into the temporal white matter, almost reaching the margin of the right lateral ventricle. The abscess was drained carefully, and found not to be the source of the suspected CSF leak. Laproscopic exploration, however, disclosed a foreign body within the abscess. It appeared to be metallic and studded with small knobs or spikes. It was ellipsoidal in shape, approximately 10 mm by 5 mm. It was removed and placed in sterile saline for later examination. The abscess was irrigated with lactated Ringer's solution and cephazolin, debrided, and re-irrigated. A drain was placed within the abscess, and the craniotomy closed without incident.\n\nDue to the penetrating brain injury and the presumed latency between injury and treatment, the patient's prognosis was considered poor. However, he was treated aggressively with IV antibiotics. By day 10, his temperature had returned to normal, but he was now comatose (Glasgow Coma Scale score = 5, with decorticate posturing). His intracranial hypotension resolved spontaneously, and may therefore have been a result of a leak masked by clotted blood and infectious material.\n\nA repeat CT scan on day 16 showed no recurrence of the abscess. There was, however, some evidence of atrophy in the right temporal lobe, evidenced by enlargement of the right lateral ventricle and widening of the sulci in the region of the injury.\n\nDuring the patient's coma, the foreign object was subjected to careful examination. It was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with detergent, revealing an oblong object with the appearance of a prickly seed pod. Its surface was metallic and appeared to have been precisely machined. The knobs on the surface were small cones approximately 1 mm in diameter and 1 mm high. Each bore a circular aperture. Very thin wires protruded from some of these apertures. Their function could not be ascertained. \n\nSmall samples of the wires and the surface of the object were obtained and sent to the local university for analysis. The shell was titanium, and the wires were high-purity gold. The entire object was then sent to the university for analysis by high-energy phase-contrast X-ray. This revealed numerous wires (presumably gold) extending beneath the shell and into a central core containing x-ray-opaque polyhedral objects. The wires appreaed to be connected to these objects, but it was decided the objects themselves could not be scanned without the x-rays causing damage to the rest of the structure. The object was returned to the hospital.\n\nWhen confronted, neither the father nor the sister claimed any knowledge of the object or of its traumatic implantation. A sample from the abscess was washed with saline and analyzed, and found to contain numerous short segments of thin gold wire, consistent with those protruding from the object. There was also a quantity of tar-like organic matter. This was sent to the university, where it was found to contain large quantities of polyaromatic hydrocarbons.\n\nOn day 25, the shift nurse noted that the patient's mental status had improved. His GCS was now 10, with spontaneous eye-opening, object-tracking, withdrawal from painful stimuli, and spontaneous verbalizations. The latter consisted primarily of pseudo-grammatical nonsense words. The patient was tentatively diagnosed with aphasia. However, on day 28, the patient's sister claimed that she could recognize halting but fluent speech, and offered to translate. This offer was declined due to fears that her interference might hamper later speech therapy.\n\nOn day 30, his speech was dysarthic, halting, and slurred, but recognizable. He was found to be oriented to person and place, but somewhat disoriented in time, giving inconsistent or nonsensical answers when asked for the year and the date. (On one occasion, he gave the correct year, but when asked for the month and day, said “Yesterday” [sic].) \n\nOver the following days, his condition continued to improve. However, he displayed some retrograde and anterograde amnesia, showed poor spatial orientation, could not recognize familiar faces (he complained that he could not tell whether it was his father or sister in the room until they spoke), and had visual disturbances in the left visual field, including “static,” near-total loss of color vision, and fluctuations in the extent of the visual field. He also complained of hearing difficulties, vertigo, and severe headaches. However, on re-examination, no recurrence of the abscess was found, and there was no evidence of CSF leakage.\n\nOn day 39, he was judged well enough to be interviewed regarding his injury. When questioned, he became anxious and agitated and asked everybody in the room (the author, the staff neurologist, and his sister) to leave. He was questioned again on day 42, with a similar response. However, on day 45, the following conversation was recorded:\n\n[Author]: I wanna ask you again what happened. How'd you get that wound on your head?\n\n[Patient]: (After hesitating) You're... you're... you're gonna think... I'm a retard.\n\n[A]: No I won't.\n\n[P]: Maybe... maybe... maybe... it's not safe?\n\n[A]: Whatever you tell me stays between me and you.\n\n[P]: You... s-swear?\n\n[A]: I swear.\n\n[P]: (After a long pause) I... I... I... It's hard. I can't always remember. This lady... Hold on. I met...this lady. My...my...my girlfriend...knew the...lady...woman. The woman. The woman...she...she...she...she... (a very long pause) You swear?\n\n[A]: I swear I won't tell.\n\n[P]: Sh-sh-sh-she s-said...w-we should go to her...apartment. Sh-she made me a drink. It...it tasted funny. It...it...it...it was gin and...juice. It had a lot of...gin in it. I p-p-passed out. When I woke up...I was...still drunk...really drunk...or high...and sh-sh-sh-she w-was hurting my head.\n\nAt this point, the patient suddenly asked the author to leave the room, and was not heard to speak for the following three days. On day 49, he began responding to questions again, but would become unresponsive when the question of his injury was brought up.\n\nOn day 50, he began speech therapy. During his work with the speech therapist, he was found to be somewhat delusional. He claimed to have special powers, including seeing living creatures which nobody else could see, and being able to see colors nobody else could see. He claimed that there was strange writing on the walls in ink invisible to ordinary people. When questioned further about this, he said that he had once been able to see these things, but no longer could. When asked what had happened, he said “S-something went wrong” [sic].\n\nBecause of our suspicion that someone had drugged the patient and inserted an object into his brain, the police were immediately contacted. They requested that the foreign object be turned over to them. However, it had since been returned to the university to be dissected. The dissection was completed on day 54, and the object and copies of all the scans, photographs, and reports, turned over to the police.\n\nOn dissection, the object contained a very intricate network of gold wire resembling both a metallic sponge and a scouring pad. The wires were connected to holes in the faces of the polyhedral object, which were found to be truncated icosahedra (“soccer-ball-shaped”) and composed of silica-coated tantalum. The polyhedra contained black material (polyaromatic hydrocarbons similar to those recovered from the surface) and 100-um silicon monocrystals. It was the university's opinion that the object had been constructed by an experienced jeweler or machinist, and that it was either decorative or symbolic in nature.\n\nOn day 59, the patient suddenly began to complain of a burning sensation on the left side of his neck. His neck was examined, and found to be red, inflamed, and stiff, with evidence of nerve palsy and muscle spasms. There was no apparent injury to the area, so a neurologic cause was considered. A CT scan was performed. Neither meningitis nor abscess had recurred. However, there was evidence of dense infiltrates in the subcortical white matter. A brain biopsy was considered, but could not be performed, as the patient's condition rapidly deteriorated. He suffered marked fever (ranging between 104 and 107 F), tachycardia (between 100 and 130 BPM, mostly regular) and hypertension (averaging 190/100 mmHg). He was cooled with ice packs and chilled IV saline as necessary, but his temperature was erratic and difficult to control. By day 63, he was stuporous, and when awake, showed signs of severe neurological impairment. Over the following days, he experienced severe diarrhea requiring fluid resuscitation. His serum creatinine began to rise, and hemodialysis was initiated. A routine toxicology test revealed severe mercury intoxication (a blood level of 5,200 ug/L). Aggressive therapy with succimer, vitamin E, and vitamin C, was initiated. However, the patient remained febrile and lapsed into a coma. His kidney function continued to deteriorate. By day 75, he was ventilator-dependent and in a deep coma. EEG, reflex tests, and PET scans showed no evidence of either cerebral activity or cerebral perfusion. A repeat CT scan on day 83 showed severe atrophy of all brain structures with effacement of the sulci and extreme enlargement of the ventricles. The patient was pronounced brain-dead, and his family made the decision to withdraw his life support on day 85. He died immediately.\n\nOn autopsy, several striking findings were noted. Examination of the brain revealed tiny pinprick regions of hemorrhage and necrosis. Several of these regions contained metallic nodules. When examined, these were found to be metallic mercury. Within the void caused by the abscess, several more small pieces of gold wire were found. \n\nThe examination of the rest of the body revealed numerous droplets of metallic mercury. Many had embolized in the lungs, the kidneys, and peripheral capillaries. The largest globule was found in the tissue beneath the right common carotid artery, just above the clavicle. The artery showed marked inflammation and necrosis, and downstream mercury emboli. There was evidence of a possible needle mark both on the skin above the artery and in the wall of the artery itself. In all, approximately 1 mL of liquid metallic mercury was recovered from the body. The cause of death was determined to be mercury poisoning, likely by injection. This was believed to be deliberate, and the matter was turned over to the police. However, the case has since been closed for lack of evidence. \n\nThe university was contacted to obtain photographs, scans, and mass spectrometry results from the foreign object recovered from the patient's brain. However, the university had suffered a major computer malfunction, and the data had been lost. ",

There are a few things I want to clear up before I start:\n\n\\- This is not a post to start drama or to say bad things about Boxycharm OR Faccia Skin. This is simply research on the claims of the product and whether or not there is evidence that these claims are true. I intend to make NO speculations about this and only present the facts as I can find them (and cite them). If I do make any speculations, please call me out for it and I will remove them.\n\n\\- I am not going to tell you whether or not to use this product. This is just the information I think you should have to make an educated decision for yourself.\n\n\\- I have no stake in this product and hope that makes me as unbiased as possible. I don’t receive premium, and I don’t intend to buy. None of what I say here is based on my experience with the product OR any reviews of the product. \n\nFinally, the intention of this is to investigate these claims based on being an “average consumer.” I know that the actual average consumer does not actually do this much research. What I mean by this is that all this information comes from available online databases and resources, and the first couple pages of Google. I’m not doing a deep dive into any Instagram pages or people’s private lives to find this information. I intend for all of it to be easily verifiable by anyone who wants to find it.\n\nI will investigate 4 things about this product: cruelty free claims, safety of ingredients, benefit claims, and retail value.\n\n**Cruelty Free Claims:**\n\nAccording to [Cruelty Free Kitty](https://www.crueltyfreekitty.com/cruelty-free-101/cruelty-free-bunny-logo/) there are no laws to regulate when a company claims to be cruelty free. However, there are three organizations that have standards to verify a company’s cruelty-free status, and then allow them to use their logo to indicate to consumers that the product has met that set of standards. \n\nFaccia skin uses the PETA “Beauty without Bunnies” logo on their packaging, which means they claim to meet PETA’s standards as a cruelty-free company/product. Also according to Cruelty Free Kitty, if a company uses the logo but does not appear on PETA’s list of approved companies, you CANNOT verify that the product is cruelty-free.\n\nFaccia Skin DOES NOT appear on PETA’s list of approved companies, despite using the logo. According to PETA, in order to use the logo, a company must first be verified as Cruelty-Free by PETA, and THEN is able to pay a one-time $100 licensing fee to use the logos on their products ([PETA](https://www.peta.org/about-peta/learn-about-peta/info-businesses/beauty-without-bunnies-program/)). That means that if Faccia Skin is using the logo, they should already be on the list despite being a new company. The FAQ also suggests that this list is updated frequently so consumers are always up to date with additions, deletions, and other changes. [PETA FAQ can be found here.](https://features.peta.org/cruelty-free-company-search/index.aspx)\n\n**TL;DR – Faccia Skin’s cruelty-free status cannot be verified.**\n\nNote here: Other research on this sub has suggested that this company is owned by the same owner as DLS cosmetics, which is both PETA and Leaping Bunny certified. They may be licensing the logo legally, but from what I can tell, does not verify the cruelty-free status of this brand specifically. \n\n**Safety of Ingredients:**\n\nThis is the list of ingredients for this moisturizer on Faccia’s website:\n\nWATER, GLYCERIN, GOLD, HYDROLYZED SERICIN, CARBOMER, BETAINE, TAURINE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, TRIETHANOLAMINE, NIACINAMIDE, BUTANEDIOL, POLYSORBITULE-20, PALMITOYL OLIGOPEPTIDE, PALMITOYL TETRAPEPTIDE-7, ACETYL TETRAPEPTIDE-5, ACETYL HEXAPEPTIDE-8, EDTA-2NA, HYDROLYZED PEARL, FUCUS VESICULOSUS EXTRACT, SODIUM POLYACRYLATE, PEG-40, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, METHYLPARABEN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, DIAZOLIDINYL UREA, IODOPROPYNYL BUTYLCARBAMATE, PARFUM, CI19140\n\nVia SkinCarisma, 8 products on this list have an EWG Health Rating of “Moderate” or “High” risk.\n\nModerate risk:\n\nGold – SkinCarisma identifies this as a “cosmetic colorant” with no benefits\n\nTriethanolamine – This has a comodogenic rating of (2). Incidecoder says that this ingredient is generally safe, but can form carcinogens if it is included in a product with nitra-/nitro- type ingredients. I don’t see any of those ingredients in this list.\n\nMethylparaben – This is a paraben (obviously). There is nothing directly unsafe about using this ingredient. There was a 2006 study that found that skin cells treated with MP had more harmful exposure to sunlight than non-MP treated skin cells. This study was done in a lab and not on actual human skin, so there’s no direct link to this being harmful. When in doubt, wear sunscreen\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea – A preservative, This ingredient is controversial because it belongs to a family of ingredients that may break down into formaldehyde when added to a formula. A 1990 study found that it is safe in concentrations of <0.5%. The evidence on this is unclear, and since we don’t know what the concentration of this ingredient is, I can’t say definitively if it is safe or not. Use your best judgement.\n\nIodopropynyl Butylcarbamate – Also a preservative. This is safe in concentrations of less than 0.1%, and has an extremely low rate of skin irritation. Since we don’t know what the concentration of this ingredient is, I can’t say definitively if it is safe or not. Use your best judgement.\n\nHigh Risk:\n\nButane – Incidecoder brings this up as Butanediol, which is a solvent to help products absorb faster. Its safety has not yet been questioned. It’s sometimes used as a food additive. HOWEVER the ingredients list does actually say Butane and not Butanediol which is used as a propellant. It’s still safe but it doesn’t make sense for an ingredient that is not aerosolized.\n\nFragrance – The problem with this ingredient is that “fragrance” is a general term that can be made up of an average of 30-50 chemicals that aren’t required to be disclosed. A lot of products use this term and are still safe, but because all the ingredients are not disclosed, we can’t say for sure. Use your best judgement.\n\nOther:\n\nPolysorbate 20 – listed as a fungal acne trigger, but is an emulsifier and is safe.\n\nYou can find all this information at incidecoder.com and skincarisma.com\n\n**TL;DR : Basic judgement says that this product is safe to use, unless you are sensitive to fragrances or other ingredients on this list, react to comedogenic products, or have fungal acne.**\n\n**Benefit Claims:**\n\nOn Faccia Skin’s website, they make the following claims about this product:\n\nHydrate skin – We can expect this result based on moisturizing ingredients (glycerin, betaine, sodium hyaluronate, niacinamide, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, PEG-40, Propylene Glycol)\n\nAnti-aging – SkinCarisma lists Niacinamide as the only anti-aging ingredient.\n\nStrengthen skin – SkinCarisma lists Sodium Hyaluronate as an ingredient to promote would healing. Incidecoder also suggests that there are peptides in the ingredients which act as “cell-communicating” agents. Peptides are fairly common in other products that claim strengthening benefits.\n\nEnhance skin “radiance” – We can expect this based on the ingredient Niacinamide as well as moisturizing ingredients. Skincarisma lists Niacinamide as a “brightening” ingredient.\n\nReduce damaging environmental factors – This may be aided by Sodium Hyaluronate as a “wound-healing” ingredient.\n\nIt’s important to note that neither of these ingredient databases list gold as an ingredient with any skin benefits. Here’s some research on the benefits (or not) of gold for the skin from what I believe to be trustworthy sources:\n\n[https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/sensitizing/gold.html](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/sensitizing/gold.html)\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/fashion/27skinWEB.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/fashion/27skinWEB.html)\n\n**TL;DR – We can expect for this product to perform as it claims based on its ingredients. It is unlikely that gold provides any notable benefits.**\n\n**Retail Price:**\n\nI did a quick search of “best 24k gold moisturizers” to compare retail prices for other notable products. It’s hard for me to definitively test the “retail price” claim unless there was a very similar product out there that I can find. So I’ll have to base this on comparisons as well as knowledge of the ingredients themselves. I don’t know the exact volume of the cream in mL so we are going to assume for now that 50g = 1.6 fl oz someone can get me the actual volume I will change this. So $100 for 1.6 oz is $62.5/oz\n\n[Orogold](https://www.orogoldcosmetics.com/shop/orogold-cosmetics/white-gold/24k-deep-moisturizer/) 24K deep moisturizer: $55/oz \n\n[Physicians Formula](https://www.physiciansformula.com/physicians-formula-24-karat-gold-collagen-moisturizer.html) 24k Gold Collagen Moisturizer: $12.5/oz \n\n[Chantecaille](https://www.neimanmarcus.com/p/chantecaille-nano-gold-energizing-cream-1-7-oz-prod50660039?childItemId=NMC0BE1_) Nano Gold Energizing Face cream: $247/oz \n\n[Farsali](https://www.sephora.com/product/rose-gold-elixir-P417139) Rose Gold Elixer (24k infused) - $54/oz \n\n[Peter Thomas Roth](https://www.sephora.com/product/24k-gold-mask-pure-luxury-lift-firm-mask-P392607) 24k Gold Mask - $17/oz \n\n[Nuface](https://www.ulta.com/gel-primer-24k-gold-complex-brighten?productId=xlsImpprod13521083) Gel Primer 24k Gold Complex - $19.5/oz \n\n[Ahava](https://www.ulta.com/24k-gold-mineral-mud-mask?productId=pimprod2004002) 24K Gold Mineral Mud Mask - $34/oz \n\nThe Faccia cream has a price/oz most similar to the Orogold and the Farsali products, and is much cheaper than the Chantecaille cream which is a luxury brand sold at Neiman Marcus. Comparing the Chantecaille incredients list to the Faccia cream, they are very different. The luxury cream has a huge list of various plant oils, extracts and perfumes. That doesn’t make it better, but it does have more ingredients. The Faccia base of water and Glycerin is similar to other water based moisturizers like Neutrogena Hydroboost, Simple, and even Tatcha Water Cream (although all 3 of those contain dimethicone and variants). Tatcha contains some more ingredients like plant extracts. It’s difficult to compare the ingredients lists of the Farsali and Orogold because the textures of the products are so different. However, the Farsali oil ONLY contains 24k gold, vitamin E, and plant oils as the ingredients, and is still cheaper than the Faccia moisturizer. Additionally, the Orogold lists Gold as one of the last few ingredients.\n\nThere doesn’t appear to be anything in the ingredients list other than gold that would justify such a high retail price. Even other notable brands sold at Ulta and Sephora with gold in them do not reach that retail price, which suggests that the gold alone would not be enough to justify such a high retail price. In fact, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate and Methylparaben are all described as “cheap” ingredients on Incidecoder. One of the other star ingredients, niacinamide, is in a lot of products, and I can’t find anything that would indicate it is expensive. You can buy a niacinamide 10% suspension from The Ordinary for less than $6/oz.\n\n**TL;DR: The retail price of $100 is not justified by any ingredients or similar product retail prices.**\n\nMy conclusion: There is nothing wrong with this product at face value since It is safe for most people to use. If cruelty-free products are important to you, I would not use this product until the company’s cruelty free status is verified. As far as retail value goes, there isn’t any reason for you to repurchase at the retail price, unless you love this stuff and you can afford it. For other people, a basic silicone-free gel moisturizer with niacinamide should give you similar results for a lower price point. You can make your own decision about whether you should use it, but now you are educated on what it is, and you hopefully have a better idea of what you’re putting on your body.",

I have used expensive face creams like Elizabeth Arden Prevage line and see benefits for the cost for that particular brand.  However, I agree that a good moisturizer doesn’t have to cost very much.  Follow the process of cleansing, toning, serum, exfoliating, moisturizer...the massaging of the skin in itself will show benefits!  I can’t afford Prevage since a career change, and I am happier using trial size luxury products now.  The luxury is a gimmick too for the most part!

    "body": "&nbsp;\n\n**This post will not be updated anymore, in stead go this new post:**\n\n[**New post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/a1m15a/review_comparison_of_sunscreens_with_tinosorb/)\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nLast edited: november 18, 2018\nIn this list I tried to find all sunscreens with the newer more stable sunscreen actives like Tinosorb, Uvinal A Plus, Uvinul T150 etc, that are free of oxybenzone, alcohol, citrus extracts and fragrance. I tested all products with the recommended 1.5-2.5 mL amount. (Full inci in links. [Tested products](http://imgur.com/a/6nT48) are mentioned in order of how good the ingredients and ss actives are. In the notes at the end of this post is the order of greasiness and explanation on my whitecast scale). High UVA protection ss is great, but don't forget the role of sunglasses, hats and uv protective clothing.\n\n**Good organic sunscreen actives (the best in my opinion)**\n\n* [€39.95/50mL - Uncover Skincare Suncare SPF30/UVA22](https://www.dr-jetskeultee.com/products/skincare/protect/suncare-spf-30-face.html)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb S, Tinosorb M.\n  * **Whitecast:** 1.5-2  \n  * **Rating:** 7.7/10\n  * **Explanation:** This sunscreen uses Tinosorb S and M as the only sunscreen actives, which makes this a very good stable sunscreen, and combined with the non water reistant formula it gives theoretically a low risk of skin irritation and pore clogging. Relatively high uva/uvb ratio (UVA/UVB ratio = 1/1.18). Airless pump, preservative free, non greasy cream texture, slightly sticky, but relatively easy to apply the recommended amount. It is a thicker, more cream like consistency than the Uncover Suncover below. It's not completely matte, but better than Derma and Biodermal. The things I don't like: the slight whitecast and shine, and it could have been a little bit more hydrating.\n  * **Available at:** only online available via their own webshop for EU countries (no usa/canada)\n\n* [€11.30/50mL - MUTI BODY SPF50/UVA20](https://www.muticare.com/muti-sonnencreme)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb S, Tinosorb M, Tinosorb A2B.\n  * **Whitecast:** 3\n  * **Rating:** 6/10\n  * **Explanation:** Thin runny texture with matte finish, which I guess many will like. You need to work it in well, otherwise you can get some streaks. Very good stable sunscreen actives. Airless pump, preservative free. Unfortunately very high concentration of propylene glycol (1,2 Propanediol), which can be irritating and sensitizing, especially if concentration is higher than 10%, but for sensitive skin already from 2%. So I'm only showing this sunscreen hoping the company will change the Propylene Glycol, because the sunscreen actives and the price are great. (UVA/UVB ratio = 1/2.51)\n\n* [€49/50mL - HighDroxy D Light Fluid SPF25/UVA15](https://www.highdroxy.de/produkt/highdroxy-d-light-fluid/)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb S, Tinosorb M, Tinosorb A2B.\n  * **Whitecast:** 2.5 ([see this picture I found](https://konsumkaiser.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/img_2418-e1463422184478.jpg))\n  * **Rating:** 6/10\n  * **Explanation:** comparable to the MUTI one, very thin lightweight texture, but this one uses Propanediol (1,3 Propanediol), although a very similar molecule, apparently studies indicate this is less irritating than Propylene Glycol because the OH groups are at the opposite ends of the molecule, whereas with Propylene Glycol the OH groups are much closer together (above 75% propanediol can be mildly irritating according the CIR safety study). A really great sunscreen with some antioxidants, and very good sunscreen actives, although quite expensive.\n\n* [€17.99/50mL - Biodermal Gevoelige Huid Face Cream SPF50+/UVA>20](http://www.biodermal.nl/producten/gevoelige-huid-zonnecreme-gezicht-spf-50/)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb M, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Uvinal A Plus, Tinosorb S, Uvinul T150\n  * **Whitecast:** 1+\n  * **Rating:** 6.5/10\n  * **Explanation:**  Cream texture, no pilling. For sensitive and dry skin this is really a great option, I really think this is the best hydrating sunscreen from this entire list and although it contains Tinosorb M, it doesn't have visible whitecast. Although it contains mattifying Tapioca Starch, it is shiny. The \"Gevoelige Huid Spray SPF50\" has a comparable formula. The Sensitive Face SPF30, doesn't have any whitecast and contains great sunscreen actives, with the exception of the added Octocrylene.  Other [biodermal sunscreens](http://www.biodermal.nl/producten/#!/zon-huid/all/45) are fragranced, or contain Octocrylene/Avobenzone. The fragranced Biodermal Mattifying Zonfluide SPF50+ is just as greasy as the Gevoelige Huid Face SPF50+, although the name would suggest otherwise. Same products are sold in Sweden under the ACO brand and in Norway under Cliniderm and Cosmica. Good Aco products are for example: [ACO Sun Face Fluid ](http://www.yliopistonverkkoapteekki.fi/ACO-SUN-FACE-FLUID-MATTIFYING) and [ACO Kids Sun](http://www.aco.se/produkter/sun/spf-high/high-protection-sun-lotion-spf-50-big-size/). \n  * **Available at:** all drugstores in The Netherlands.\n\n* [€24/50mL - Oriflame Sun Zon UV Protector Face and Exposed Areas SPF50/UVA>16](https://nl.oriflame.com/products/product?code=23378)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb M, Octisalate, Tinosorb S, Uvinal A Plus, Uvinul T150\n  * **Whitecast:** 1\n  * **Rating:** 6.7/10\n  * **Explanation:** The sunscreen actives and ingredients are comparable to the Biodermal Face SPF50. The body SPF50 version is also good. I think the Biodermal above applies a bit more evenly with less chance of streaks and clumps.\n\n* [€2.75/50mL - Derma Sollotion SPF30/UVA>10](http://www.derma.dk/sollotion-hoej-spf30.aspx?id=126)\n  * **Actives:** Uvinal A Plus, Uvinul T150, Uvasorb HEB\n  * **Whitecast:** 0\n  * **Rating:** 7/10\n  * **Explanation:**  applies easily, doesn't pill, very nice sunscreen actives, no irritants and no whitecast, unfortunately it isn't matte (dewy finish) and sometimes I have a feeling my skin doesn't agree with this sunscreen (redness and itching in neck after shaving). Levevis, [Avivir](http://www.aloevera.dk/page124.aspx?recordid124=55), [Rudolph Care Kids](https://www.rudolphcare.dk/en/products/kids-sun-lotion-spf-30) and [Änglamark](http://anglamark.dk/solcreme/) have similar formulas as Derma. \nThere's also a Face version [Derma Ansigtsolcreme SPF30](http://www.derma.dk/ansigtssolcreme-spf-30-hoej.aspx?id=145) packaged in an airless pump, which  absorbs faster and is a little bit less shiny (comparable to the non-profit Uncover Suncover). The face version contains [Tinosorb S Aqua](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/eu/PersonalCare/Detail/804/240238/Tinosorb-S-Aqua), this active provides a very good uva coverage. The SLES in the product is part of the Tinosorb S Aqua suspension, concentration is <0.07%, companies don't have to list it on the ingredient list since it's part of the standard suspension, so most companies won't list it (Same with Ultrasun not mentioning Decyl Glucoside and Propylene Glycol part of Tinosorb M). If Tinosorb S and Polymethyl Metacrylate are on the inci list, probably Tinosorb S Aqua has been used. There's also a [Derma Sollotion SPF50](https://www.neutrale-produkte.de/sonnenlotion/81-derma-sonnenlotion-lsf-50-sehr-hoch-5709954015218.html) version, which doesn't have a whitecast and has a similar base as the face version, but it is thicker and more shiny. Some research indicates that aloe emodin from Aloe Vera can increase free radcial production under UV light, /u/pasqal20 has asked Derma: their Aloe is purified and don't contain (any significant amount of) antraquinones.\n\n* [€9.99/50mL - Änglamark Face SPF50/UVA>16 ](https://www.neutrale-produkte.de/sonnenlotion/506-anglamark-sonnen-gesichtscreme-lsf-50-hoch-fur-kinder-und-erwachsene-50-ml-7340011470243.html)\n  * **Actives:** Uvinal A Plus, Uvinul T150, Tinosorb S Aqua®\n  * **Whitecast:** 0\n  * **Rating:** 7/10\n  * **Explanation:**  These Anglamark ss are identical to the Derma sunscreens, but don't contain Aloe Extract and Vitamin E (perhaps this is a better option for people with sensitive skin). Just like with Derma, there's also an [SPF30 Face](https://www.neutrale-produkte.de/lippenschutz/504-anglamark-sonnen-gesichtscreme-lsf-30-hoch-fur-kinder-und-erwachsene-50-ml-7340011470236.html) version and a [SPF30 Lotion](https://www.neutrale-produkte.de/sonnenlotion/491-anglamark-sonnenlotion-lsf-30-hoch-fur-die-ganze-familie-7340011429265.html) body version. \n\n* [€11.13/50mL - Noreva Cicadiane Protect Crème Réparatrice Photo-Protectrice SPF 50+/UVA>20 ](https://www.cocooncenter.com/noreva-cicadiane-protect-creme-reparatrice-photo-protectrice-spf-50-40-ml/27319.html)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb S Aqua®, Uvinal A Plus, Uvinul T150 \n  * **Whitecast:** 0\n  * **Explanation:**  Not tested yet, but ingredients are good. Looking at the sunscreen actives it is unlikely this sunscreen will leave a whitecast.\n\n* [€5.50/50mL - Louis Widmer Sun Gel SPF30/UVA>10](http://www.louis-widmer.nl/nl_NL/zon/sun-care/zonnebescherming/sun-gel-30/)\n  * **Actives:** Uvinal A Plus, Polysilicone-15, Tinosorb S, Uvinul T150, Ensulizole, Uvasorb HEB.\n  * **Whitecast:** 0\n  * **Explanation:**  Shared by /u/ggabrielpp. Louis Widmer promises a non-greasy quickly absorbing sunscreen. In my opinion however it is extremely shiny and it doesn't absorb well either, it looks like an oily sheen on your skin. Ingredients and price are good.\n\n* [€1.75/50mL - Uncover Skincare Suncover SPF30/UVA12](https://www.dr-jetskeultee.com/products/suncover-suncream/suncover-spf30-1000ml.html)\n  * **Actives:** Uvinal A Plus, Uvinul T150, Tinosorb S, Ensulizole\n  * **Whitecast:** 0\n  * **Rating:** 7.25/10\n  * **Explanation:**  no whitecast, contains Niacinamide (at 1%),  thin fluid gel like texture that spreads around easily ([see also for example this youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8eHbNWMRGs&t=10m20s)). Because it's so thin and spreads around so easily I find it a bit hard to apply the recommended amount, it takes a few seconds but then it absorbs quickly but not to a matte finish, more a dewy finish, preservative free, most affordable sunscreen in this list. (UVA/UVB ratio = 1/2.5)\n\n* [€9.77/50mL - Eubos Haut Ruhe Schutzcremegel SPF30/UVA>10](https://www.apo.com/eubos-kinder-haut-ruhe-sonnenschcrgel-lsf-30uva-50ml-pzn-10395821?utm_source=idealo&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=Preisvergleich)\n  * **Actives:** Uvinal A Plus, Uvinul T150, Ensulizole, Tinosorb S.\n  * **Whitecast:** 0\n  * **Rating:** 5/10\n  * **Explanation:** Same sunscreen actives as Uncover Suncover, but this one doesn't contain fatty alcohols. Thicker gel-cream texture. Some people say it pills, but really this doesn't pill at all. I've tried very thick layers and applying it over other creams, but this doesn't pill at all. It is extremely sticky and extremely shiny however. If you blot your face, the shine can be eliminated very easily, but it is extremely sticky.\n\n* [Dermaviduals SPF50](http://www.dermaviduals.com/english/products/dermaviduals-special/sun-protection-cream-spf-50.html)\n  * **Actives:** Uvinal A Plus, Uvasorb HEB, Ensulizole, Tinosorb S.\n\n\n**Good organic sunscreen actives (with Avobenzone)**\n\n* [ €16/50mL- Avene Emulsion Fragrance Free SPF50+/UVA>20](https://www.dermatheek.nl/a-25365009/avene-van-a-tot-z/avene-spf-50-emulsie-zonder-parfum/#specs)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb M, Tinosorb S, Uvasorb HEB, Avobenzone.\n  * **Whitecast:** 3\n  * **Rating:** 7/10\n  * **Explanation:**  very nice non greasy texture ([see also review by Gothamista](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P54pmGJ3yYY&t=8m24s)), suitable for oily skin, the airless pump packaging is very convenient. I really like the texture of this sunscreen, but for me it leaves a very, very visible whitecast (therefore the low rating), and it contains avobenzone unfortunately. The same formula is sold under the Aderma brand. There's also a comparable [Avene SPF50+ creme](http://www.eau-thermale-avene.be/nl_BE/zon/zonnebescherming/oranje-gamma-spf-50-30-20/creme-spf-50) version, that's slightly more hydrating, and [Avene SPF50+ milk](http://www.eau-thermale-avene.be/nl_BE/zon/zonnebescherming/oranje-gamma-spf-50-30-20/melk-spf-50-voor-kinderen) that's more budget friendly with almost identical ingredients, but it is more greasy than the emulsion.\n\n* [€10.60/50mL - Avene Sunsimed SPF50+/UVA31.8](https://www.cocooncenter.co.uk/avene-solaire-sunsimed-very-high-protection-80ml/29945.html)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb M, Tinosorb S, Uvasorb HEB, Avobenzone\n  * **Whitecast:** 3\n  * **Rating:** 7/10\n  * **Explanation:** This products feels quite similar to the Avene Emulsion in my opinion. Full ingredients are not mentioned on websites, those fall under Expicients, full inci: Tocopheryl Glucoside 50%, Laurate Glyceryl, Ethylhexyloxyphenol(bis) Metho., Dioctyl Butamido Triazone, Butyl Methoxy Dibenzoylmethane, MBBT (Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol), Decyl Glucoside Med., Adipate Diisopropyl, Benzoate C12-C15, Pentanoate(neo)Isodecyl, Isononanoate Cetostearyl, Cetyl Phosphate Potassium, Behenate(Di)Glyceryl/Behe.

It's a good sunscreen, the whitecast is less visible than the Avene Emulsion and probably many will like the thin texture. Airless pump. Negatives, it is quite expensive, still slightly shiny and a slight whitecast, contains avobenzone. \n\n* [€9.36/50mL - Uriage Bariesun Creme Fragrance Free SPF50+/UVA>20](http://www.pharmaciefloritlafayette.com/uriage-bariesun-creme-sans-parfum-spf-50-50ml-p-1863888.html)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb M, Avobenzone, Uvinul T150\n  * **Rating:** 7/10\n  * **Whitecast:** 2\n  * **Explanation:**  see above. This is basically a budget option of the Uriage Depiderm, so good sunscreen, nice texture, but it does have a slight whitecast and it contains avobenzone.\n\n* [€7.35/50mL - Daylong Extreme SPF50/UVA>16](https://www.cocooncenter.co.uk/daylong-extreme-liposomal-sun-milk-spf-50-100ml/27578.html)\n  * **Actives:** Octisalate, Tinosorb M, Tinosorb S, Uvasorb HEB, Avobenzone\n  * **Whitecast:** 3\n  * **Explanation:** According some blogs it contains 2.5% alcohol. It does have gpod ingredients amd a great uva protection. \n\n* [€28/50mL- Bioderma Photoderm Kids Spray SPF50+/UVA39](https://www.cocooncenter.co.uk/bioderma-photoderm-kid-spray-spf-50-200ml/14662.html)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb M, Avobenzone, Uvinul T150\n  * **Rating:** 6.7/10\n  * **Whitecast:** 2\n  * **Explanation:**  Considering the extremely high uva protection these Photoderm sunscreens apply surprisingly well, slight whitecast and shine, but not too bad. Does contain high concentration of avobenzone and some other variants also octocrylene, so perhaps not the best for sensitive skin.\n\n* [€16.33/50mL- La Roche Posay Anthelios Ultra Zonnecreme SPF50+](http://www.laroche-posay.nl/verzorgingsproducten/Anthelios/Anthelios-Zonnecr%C3%A8me-Ultra-SPF50-zonder-parfum-p24269.aspx)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb S, Octisalate, Uvinul T150, Mexoryl XL, Avobenzone, Mexoryl SX.\n  * **Whitecast:** 0\n  * **Explanation:** Although this product does contain alcohol, this is the best sunscreen you can buy from La Roche Posay in my opinion at the moment. It's free from titanium dioxide, fragrance, homosalate, so an improvement from previous versions. It doesn't leave a whitecast, but it is shiny and sticky.\n\nAvene, Bioderma, Uriage and Musteala are available at https://www.cocooncenter.co.uk/ and for most countries in Europe just in pharmacies. \n\n**Good organic sunscreen actives (with Titanium Dioxide)**\n\n* [€16.50/50mL - ACM Depiwhite M SPF50+](https://www.labo-acm.com/en/anti-spots/49-depiwhite-advanced-3760095251899.html)\n  * **Actives:** Uvinal A Plus, Tinosorb S, UvinulT150, TinosorbM, Titanium Dioxide\n  * **Whitecast:** \n  * **Rating:** \n  * **Explanation:** \n\n* [€8.99/50mL Kruidvat Solait Face Sensitive Sunfluid SPF50+/UVA>20](https://www.kruidvat.nl/kruidvat-solait-sensitive-spf50-face-fluid/p/4329991)\n * **Actives:** Uvinal A Plus, Octisalate, Tinosorb S, Titanium Dioxide (nano), Tinosorb A2B, Uvasorb HEB, Uvinul T150m, Ensulizole.\n * **Whitecast:** 1+\n  * **Rating:** 6.7/10\n * **Review:** This product has a lot of sunscreen actives ([ingredients](https://imgur.com/a/gqH7FVS)), which can be good since it will give a good protection along all wavelengths, but in general it often means it increases the risk of skin reactions. The texture isn't very thin and doesn't spread very easily, I don't dislike that, it makes it easier to apply the recommended amount, it's not sticky and not very greasy. It isn't completely matte, although not too bad. From the same Sensitive Line there are also two 200mL lotion versions, an [SPF30 and SPF50+](https://www.kruidvat.nl/search?text=solait+sensitive&searchType=manual) they are considerably more shiny and sticky.\n\n* [€23/50mL - Ultrasun Face Tan Activator SPF30/PA+++](https://www.lookfantastic.com/ultrasun-tan-activator-for-face-spf30-50ml/11426025.html)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb M, Uvinul T150, Titanium Dioxide (nano), Tinosorb S, Uvinal A Plus, Ethylhexyl Salicylate   \n  * **Whitecast:** 1\n  * **Rating:** 7/10\n  * **Explanation:** These newer Ultrasun products are free of emulsifiers, alumina, PEG and preservatives. Airless pump. Lightweight gel-cream texture, spreads easily, dries down quickly, but not to a matte finish like the package seems to claim, the ss can pill a bit and it's a bit sticky. The nano titanium dioxide is double coated (Eusolex T-Easy), it's the only form of nano titanium dioxide that is stable enough to be combined with Avobenzone and Dihydroxyacetone (according the supplier). Does have some amount of grape seed extract, vitamin C and E and Q10. This version contains  Dihydroxy Methylchromonyl Palmitate, an ingredient that stimulates melanin production, increasing skins natural UV defences (again according the supplier). Most of the Face Sensitive and Body Sensitive have identical ingredients, so definitely look at the Ultrasun website under these 2 lines. The [SPF30 Family](https://www.ocado.com/webshop/product/Ultrasun-Family-SPF-30/28273011) is a more budget friendly option, with identical ingredients to the other untinted Ultrasun sunscreens. Untinted SPF50 versions have a slightly more visible whitecast (2).\n\n* [€28/50mL- Ultrasun Face SPF50+/PA++++ Tinted Honey](https://www.amazon.de/Ultrasun-Face-Tinted-SPF50-Honey/dp/B01BKF2N8K)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb M, Uvinul T150, Titanium Dioxide (nano), Tinosorb S, Uvinal A Plus, Ethylhexyl Salicylate\n  * **Whitecast:** tinted dark/tinted very fair\n  * **Rating:** 6/10\n  * **Explanation:**  this Honey version is quite dark (self-tan color) and contains some glitters due to the mica (almost invisible), the Ivory has a very light color and may appear a bit white on skin. Dries relatively quickly, not very greasy, these tinted versions are more matte and have a different texture than the untinted versions (see above), they don't pill as quickly as the untinted versions, but for dryer skin types also not very hydrating. It feels like there's sand scraping on your skin in these ss. Good sunscreens if the color matches your skin tone, airless pumps, not too greasy, relatively good sunscreen actives, some antioxidants, no irritants.\n\n* [€8.63/50mL - Musteala Bebe-Enfant SPF50+/PPD25 ](https://www.viata.nl/algemeen-welzijn/op-reis/zonvakantie/mustela-bebeenfant-zon-spf50-waterproof-melk-100-ml-nl#.WYDpbIjyiUk)\n  * **Actives:** Uvinal A Plus, Uvinul T150, Ensulizole, Titanium Dioxide, Tinosorb S\n  * **Whitecast:** 2\n  * **Rating:** 6.5/10\n  * **Explanation:**  thin runny texture, slight whitecast, slightly shiny but less than Derma, preservative free and some avocado oil and vitamin E. It's a good sunscreen. Although it's fragrance free, I didn't really like the smell.\n\n* [€5.15/50mL - Bamse Sunscreens SPF50+/UVA>20](http://www.apotea.se/bamse-solkr%C3%A4m-spf-50-100-ml)\n  * **Actives:** Uvinal A Plus, Titanium Dioxide, Uvinul T150,Tinosorb S\n  * **Whitecast:** 2\n  * **Explanation:**  Not tested yet.\n\n* [€19.95/50mL - Dado Sens Sonnen-Creme SPF50/UVA>16](http://www.dadosens.com/dadosens-de/produkte/sun/sonnen-creme-spf-50.html)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb S, Uvinul T150, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Uvinal A Plus, Titanium Dioxide\n  * **Whitecast:** 1+\n  * **Explanation:**  Not tested yet.\n\n**Mineral only sunscreens - Zinc Oxide**\n\n* [€15/50mL Cotz Flawless Complexion SPF50](https://ca.iherb.com/pr/Cotz-Flawless-Complexion-Lightly-Tinted-SPF-50-2-5-oz-70-g/68139?gclid=CN-vsMaqptQCFde6GwodDvcPoA)\n  * **Actives:** 20% zinc oxide (nano)\n  * **Whitecast:** tinted, invisible\n  * **Rating:** 6.5/10\n  * **Explanation:**  contains tetra-c and vitamin e, slightly thicker consistency, a bit shiny on application, I don't think people with oily skin will like it. It doesn't cause any streaks or clumps, it's really the most invisible physical ss I've ever tried, easy to apply recommended amount. Even on lighter or darker skin tones than mine it's very invisible. I would have liked it to be slightly more hydrating, easier to rinse off and less shiny. And probably it has a low uva rating. I don't have the same problems as [HotandFlashy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-yL1Qvxg_U&t=12m49s) considering the shine, it isn't matte, but for normal to dry skin types quite oke.\n\n* [€31.7/50mL - Paula's Choice Resist Super-light Wrinkle Defense SPF30](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/skin-care-categories/sun-protection/_/Resist-Super-Light-Daily-Wrinkle-Defense-SPF-30)\n  * **Actives:** 13% Zinc Oxide (nano)\n  * **Rating:** 4.5/10\n  * **Whitecast:** tinted, darker than Coola/Neostrata, red undertone\n  * **Explanation:** slightly darker redder tint than Coola and Neostrata, this tint does look nicer on my skin, it's slightly darker than my skin tone, but it's not bad. It contains some very good actives like EGCG, resveratrol, Vitamin E, although concentrations are unknown. Goes on relatively easily, but takes more time to dry down than Neostrata and remains slightly sticky.  Does give a very matte finish, this sunscreen looks extremely nice, I even dare to say the best looking sunscreen I have ever tried. However for me it's very dehydrating, even with a thick moisturizer, therefore the low rating. After a few weeks of use I start seeing dry lines and irritates patches due to dryness.\n\n* [$36/60mL Drunk Elephant Umbra Tinte SPF30](https://www.drunkelephant.com/products/umbra-tinte-physical-daily-defense)\n * **Actives:** 20% zinc oxide\n  * **Whitecast:** \n  * **Explanation:**  Unfortunately it's almost impossible to get it where I live, so not tested yet. It contains Titanium Dioxide as pigment.\n\n* [€9.30/60mL Thinksport Everyday Face SPF 30](https://www.iherb.com/pr/Think-Thinksport-EveryDay-Face-SPF-30-Naturally-Tinted-2-oz-59ml/72849?gclid=CjwKCAjwzYDMBRA1EiwAwCv6JglRyk9RqaQ7VPPwtJfjsC3sM2dk3pSllbOhkWrtp0R3CF-BwuRJIxoC2asQAvD_BwE)\n * **Actives:** 20% zinc oxide\n  * **Whitecast:** ?\n  * **Explanation:**  Does contain sensitizing Grapefruit extract and it is unknown if the particles are coated.\n\n**Mineral only sunscreens - Zinc Oxide+Titanium Dioxide**\n\n* [€9.40/50mL The Ordinary SPF30](https://eltamd.com/product/eltamd-uv-elementsbroad-spectrum-spf-44/)\n  * **Actives:** zinc oxide, titanium dioxide\n  * **Whitecast:** 3.5\n  * **Rating:** 4/10\n  * **Explanation:** very obvious whitecast, feels also very drying on skin, sets in pores and lines, didn't like it at all. Does contain some nice active ingredients and according Deciem coated particles with a medium particle size >200nm are used, so that's good.\n\n\n* [€15/50mL Elta MD UV Elements SPF44](https://eltamd.com/product/eltamd-uv-elementsbroad-spectrum-spf-44/)\n  * **Actives:** 10% zinc oxide (nano), 5.5% titanium dioxide (nano)\n  * **Whitecast:** tinted\n  * **Rating:** 6.7/10\n  * **Explanation:** sunscreen goes on easily, less streaks and clumps than the Neostrata one, and it has a matte finish. It does look very nice, but the tint is too dark for my skin, so in my neck and around my hair line there's a lot of color difference. Unfortunately it isn't very hydrating, although the bottle says its a hydrating sunscreen.  Otherwise really great sunscreen.\n\n* [€48/50ml - Neostrata sheer physical protection SPF50+/PA++++](https://www.neostrata.com/product/neostrata+sheer+physical+protection.do)\n  * **Actives:** 7% titanium dioxide (nano), 6% zinc oxide (nano)\n  * **Whitecast:** tinted, very fair\n  * **Rating:** 5.7/10\n  * **Explanation:** very thin runny texture, relatively easy to apply. It contains Vitamin E and Green Tea Extract. It has a nice tint, but it's slightly too light/greyish which causes it to set in pores and lines, it gives a nice matte/dewy finish. It isn't very hydrating, and unfortunately it gives some minimal streaks and clumps. It's a nice physical sunscreen, but cotz is more invisible, and Elta MD has a nicer finish.\n\n* [€38/50mL - Coola SPF30 Matte Tint ](https://coolasuncare.com/collections/sunscreen-face/products/mineral-face-spf-30-unscented-matte-finish-tint-sunscreen-lotion)\n  * **Actives:** 3.2%Titanium Dioxide (nano), 1.8% Zinc Oxide (nano). (lip and baby ss non-nano).\n  * **Whitecast:** tinted, yellow/brown\n  * **Rating:** 4.5/10\n  * **Explanation:**  In summer the color is a bit too yellow/greyish for darker skin tones. It has a mousse like silicony feel, that spreads very easily on your face. It gives a nice skin like look, although on it's own it isn't really hydrating. If you apply a tiny amount this is the nicest physical sunscreen I've ever seen, but if you apply the recommended 1/4 tsp amount it simply doesn't dry down/absorb and it keeps laying on top of skin in streaks and clumps, and it takes very long times before it really dries down. I also wonder if the UVA protection is high enough.\n\n* [€28.30/50mL - Paula's Choice Calm Dry SPF30/Skin Recovery SPF30](http://www.paulaschoice.com/skin-recovery-daily-moisturizing-lotion-spf-30/146.html?cgid=category-sun-protection#start=3)\n\n  * **Actives:** 3.8% Titanium Dioxide (nano), 3.12% Zinc Oxide (nano)\n  * **Whitecast:** 3.5\n  * **Rating:** 5.7/10\n  * **Explanation:** does leave a very, very noticeable whitecast, personally I really like the texture and feel of the product, not very matte but suitable for combination skin. But even with foundation this still gives a kind of purple/white tint to skin. If it would come in a tinted version this would be good physical sunscreen, considering the actives, texture and skin feel.\n\n* See for other sunscreens I tried (but wasn't really impressed about) the [excel-sheet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EM9cHmBt_e4O8L0tU76nCYVfnSMuNW_j).\n\n \n\n**Notes**\n\nPersonally I find the Derma, Suncover, Noreva and Änglamark and Biodermal good, they are transparent and contain great sunscreen actives, but they are a shiny and some contain some pore clogging ingredients. In theory the Uncover Suncare, HighDroxy and Avene Emulsion are very good since they mainly contain Tinosorb M and Tinosorb S, but I don't really like the slight whitecast of these sunscreens. Ultrasun, Kruidvat and Uriage are also quite good, no extreme whitecast, nor very shiny. But they are also not matte and still have a slight whitecast. Elta MD and Paula's Choice Resist give a nice matte tint to the face, they really look great, but low uva protection and not very hydrating. \nSo a lot of good stable fragrance free sunscreens, but all of them do have some disadvantages here or there.\n\n\n> **Sunscreen actives** were most important to me when selecting sunscreens. I tried to select sunscreens with the following actives. Important factors for a sunscreen active is it's stability, possibility of skin reactions and free radical formation and if it penetrates skin. Testings for endocrine disruption are mainly done in vitro, I think it's effect is negligible in real life. For EU sunscreens with unknown UVA level, I give 1/3 of the SPF level with a \">\" sign:\n\n\n> * **Tinosorb S** - Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine - BEMT (UVB+UVA2+UVA1)\n\n> * **Tinosorb M** - Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol - MBBT (UVB+UVA2+UVA1)\n\n> * **Tinosorb A2B** - Tris-biphenyl Triazine (UVB+UVA2)\n\n> * **Uvinul T150** -  Octyl Triazone/Ethylhexyl Triazone - EHT (UVB)\n\n> * **Uvasorb HEB** - Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone  - Iscotrizinol - DBT (UVB)\n\n> * **Uvinal A Plus** - Diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate - DHHB (UVA1+UVA2)\n\n> * **Mexoryl SX** - Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid - TDSA (UVA)\n\n> * **Mexoryl XL** - Drometrizole trisiloxane -DTS (UVB+UVA)\n\n> * **ZnO (coated)** - For US users in my opinion physical sunscreen actives are the best choice, all of the filters mentioned above are not allowed yet. I doubt there are many companies using true non-nano physical actives. The most common used patented physical actives used by the cosmetic industry have a median particle size under (nano) or just above 100 nm (non-nano). But with all these standard mixes, still a large part falls in the nano-range, and the stability of coatings and skin absorption over very long periods of daily usage is still questionable. The best option is to use coated zinc oxide.\n\n\n> * I don't really believe that antioxidants in sunscare work. Actives like Niacinamide, Licorice Extract or Green Tea Extract can be beneficial. The iron oxides in tinted products can help with protection against [infrared and visible light](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/606hwl/misc_how_much_truth_is_there_to_this_claim_on/df3v0la/). Although in my opinion it's often difficult to apply the recommendend amount of a tinted product in a way that it is invisible on skin.\n\n\n> All sunscreens are preferably free of:\n\n> * Oxybenzone,  Octinoxate, Homosalate, Octocrylene, Avobenzone, Isoamyl p-Methoxycinnamate, Enzacamene\n\n> * Alcohol denat.\n\n> * Fragrance\n\n> * Irritating essential oils or plant extracts, like Eucalyptus, Mint, Citrus, Lavender, Bergamot oil etc.\n\n> * Methylisothiazolinone, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Diazolidinyl Urea etc\n\n\n> **Whitecast classification**: Since for me after ingredients, even a very slight whitecast is a big no for me, I made the following classification. **Do note that I apply 1.25-2.5mL, if you apply less, what most people do, almost all sunscreens will look great**.\n\n> * **0)** no whitecast\n\n> * **1)** no to barely visible whitecast. I would say 99% of the people won't notice any whitecast.\n\n> * **2)** slight whitecast. From this point you may notice, your skin may appear somewhat lighter. Most people would still consider this a sunscreen without a whitecast though. You can counteract the slight whitecast very easily with a small amount of foundation or powder, if you want.\n\n> * **3)** visible whitecast. This is what most people consider a sunscreen with whitecast. \n\n> * **4)** very visible, typical physical sunscreen whitecast. This is what you see with physical sunscreens from PC or from Badger for example.\n\n> **Shine**, order from most matte to least matte:\n\n> * Coola Matte, PC Resist, Neostrata, MUTI/Highdroxy, Avene Emulsion, Uncover Suncare, Ultrasun Tinted, Kruidvat Solait Face, Uriage Depiderm, Ultrasun untinted, Bioderma AR,Uncover Suncover, PC Calm Dry, Derma Ansigtcreme, Cotz Flawless Protection, Derma Sollotion SPF30/Rudolf Suncare,  Biodermal SPF50, Derma SPF50, Drs. Leenarts,  Mustela Bebe, Uriage Bariesun XP, Eubos Haut Ruhe SPF30, Badger SPF30 Tinted.\n\n\n> Physical sunscreens\n\n> * Although physical sunscreens are known for being non-sensitizing, stable and providing some protection against visible light, which are the main reasons why I still really like physical sunscreens, they were not my first choice, for three reasons. For me the **first** reason; I really don't want a sunscreen that makes my skin lighter than it already is, and physical sunscreens in my opinion all leave a whitecast when untinted. Most tinted version are simply visible on skin when you apply 1/4 tsp, and I don't like the thought that people might be thinking I'm wearing foundation as a guy. Physical sunscreens are just cosmetically less elegant than sunscreens with organic actives, they clump and streak. They are very difficult to rinse of your face as well. But of course YMMV. The **second** reason is that, as [KindofStephan](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/50n4s5/lets_bust_some_sunscreen_myths_why_calling_them/)\n already pointed out, \"modern organic sunscreens have better UVA absorption (which results in higher UVAPF ratings) than can be offered by inorganic sunscreens\" . Physical sunscreens also mainly work by absorbing (~95%) UV radiation ([link](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/phpp.12214/abstract), [link](https://books.google.nl/books?id=rKHSBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA202&dq=Textbook+of+Cosmetic+Dermatology+Inorganic+Filters&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiS--Ok0IHUAhVNPFAKHUwQC1wQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=Textbook%20of%20Cosmetic%20Dermatology%20Inorganic%20Filters&f=false)), so on that front there's not a huge difference with ingredients like Tinosorb M. The **third** reason is photocatalytic activiy of nano sized titanium dioxide. Most companies use nano titanium dioxide and nano zinc oxide, or anything with a median particle size just above 100nm to be able to sell it as a \"non-nano\" sunscreen, but then still a large parts falls in the nano range. These nano particles with todays knowledge appear to be safe, although long-term studies on daily usage are still scarce, the final EU Colipa report noted that trace amounts may remain in the sc, in hair follicles and sweat glands potentially over several days after application and washing. They may have photocatalytic activity and need very stable coatings. Colipa noted: \"It is less clear how stable the coatings are in final formulations. The particles were also found to induce oxidative stress in the cells indicated by a significant depletion of glutathione, induction of lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species generation ([link](https://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/consumer_safety/docs/sccs_o_136.pdf)). “Part of the toxicity of nano ZnO is due to formation of reactive oxygen species, the impact in dermally applied cosmetic products is sofar unknown\" ([link](http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/consumer_safety/docs/sccs_o_103.pdf)). \n> \n>USA regulations are different than EU regulations. In the EU companies must declare if nano particles have been used on the ingredient list, where nano particles are defined as \"a natural, incidental or manufactured material containing particles, in an unbound state or as an aggregate or as an agglomerate and where, for 50% or more of the particles in the number size distribution, one or more external dimensions is in the size range 1nm – 100nm\". Thus a EU non-nano sunscreen can still contain a small percentage of nano particles. However in the US there is no definition of nano particles. Companies don't have to mention if they use nano particles, and are allowed to claim on their packaging what they want, they may refer to individual particles, agglomerates, different measurement techniques, since there are no guidelines or definitions for nano particles. Many \"non-nano\" USA sunscreens would have to be considered nano sunscreens according EU regulations.

    "body": "Biggest contributor to my skin one year ago was the fact that I was addicted to heroin. I was constantly scratching my skin and physically exfoliating because it makes you itch like crazy. Once I started recovery I got really into skincare but finding the right products for my skin was so hard. I have super sensitive combination skin. I reacted badly to almost every product | tried, either directly after applying or it would make me break out after 1-2 days. I wasted so much money on skincare items but at least it wasn't for nothing because I finally have a routine that my skin loves! :)\n\nStep one: Avene xeracalm oil cleanser\n\nStep two: Isana ultra sensitive calming serum\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Pentylene Glycol, Glycerin, Polyglycery -6 Stearate, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Coco-Caprylate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Hydrogenated Vegetable Glycerides, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Oenothera Biennis Oil, Panthenol, Ethylhexy|glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Citric Acid, Pantolactone\n\nRight now it's still hot where I live so it's hydrating enough but when it gets colder I use vaseline at night to look in the moisture.\n\nI also use tea tree oil as spot treatment for pimpler & Salicylic acid to exfoliate when I can tell mys v needs it (less than once a week, even that was tu-much for my sensitive skin, it caused break outs)\n\nI do also use sunscreen but I haven't found the right one yet. If someone with similar skin problems has any advice l'd appreciate it!",

I would say if you're a fan of the Avene  brand I would try their facial suncreen in the small bottle or their face and body sunscreen in the bigger bottle. Both are SPF 50 I believe and are mineral so there's less of a risk of irritation. My skin is like yours, I know how hard it can be for us to find products that work and ease irritation and sensitivity.",

    "body": "Hi Reddit,\n\nI realize this subreddit isn't \"a substitute for real legal or medical help\", but I don't know what else to do.  Since the week before Christmas, 2010 I have had a harrowing itch all over my entire body.  Not just \"I'm itchy\" but the kind of itch where I've considered going to the hospital several times because its so bad.  I itch so much that I develop bruises under my skin, and sores that take forever to heal.  It is almost impossible to go to sleep, and I frequently am woken up because I itch so bad.  In short: this is most beyond measure the worst thing I've ever experienced.\n\nI have been to see 7 dermatologists. They have given me every test (details below) they could think of, and my numbers look normal.  I've been to Dr. Gil Yosipovitch whom NPR bills as \"the Godfather of Itch.\"  For the last three dermatologists I visited, I compiled a *35 page* report of the tests that had been done, my symptoms, and theories about what it could be.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nUnder my skin I develop very tiny fluid filled sacs.  Not like a blister, they are deeper than blisters and smaller.  Everywhere I find one of these sacs, I find it because I'm itching there.  I assume that the ones I find are the \"big\" ones, and that my skin itches everywhere because these sacs are there, they just aren't all big enough for me to feel under my skin.  These sacs pop, and almost right away, the itching stops.  However, after it pops 1 of 2 things happens: 1) There is a small red dot on my skin or 2) The skin is now open and the fluid leaks out.  I have a picture of both below.\n\nThe itching is always worse at night, though I hear that is common amongst all cases of itch (and pain too).  Nothing else seems to affect it (chlorine made me more uncomfortable, but I couldn't tell if it was making the condition worse, or was just dry skin).\n\nThe only place I'm not itchy is on the front of my face.\n\n**Attempted Remedies**\n\n\t•\tChanged soaps, shampoos, detergents\n\t•\tBeen in sun, been out of sun\n\t•\tChanged mattress topper from foam, to feather, to none\n\t•\tUsed various lotions and Vaseline\n\t•\tI have taken baths\n\t•\tTaken vitamins including vitamin E\n\t•\tTried sleeping in different homes\n\t•\tShowered extra, showered less\n\t•\tItched extra, itched less\n\t•\tUsed ice packs (somewhat effective)\n\t•\tCreated a very humid environment, created a very dry environment\n\t•\tI have crushed up amoxicillin and mixed it with prescription cream and rubbed that on my skin\n\t•\tI have purposely tried to be very relaxed\n\t•\tI've experimented with drinking only beer or only liquor or only cider\n\t•\tI have tried a gluten-reduced diet\n\t•\tI have tried hot showers, I have tried cold showers\n\t•\tI have tried hydrocortisone cream\n\t•\tI have tried swimming, I have tried not swimming\n\t•\tI have tried consuming extra water\n\nNone of these have done anything.  The medicines Doxepin and Remeron have been slightly successful at improving things, but I still itch enough that its difficult to sleep.\n\n**Medicines**\n\n* Desoximetasone\n* Halcinonide \n* Clobetasol Proprionate\n* Hydroxyzine\n* Zyrtec\n* Doxepin\n* Remeron\n* Lyrica\n\n**Tests Performed**\n\n* Scabies\n* Blood Test\n* Chest X-Ray\n* Urine Test\n* Hepatitis Test\n* Thyroid Test\n* Sedimentation Rate\n* Immunofluorescence\n* Tissue Transglutiminase (they've cut skin off three parts of my body to test it)\n* HIV Test\n* Fecal Parasite\n\nI've gotten copies of the results of all these tests to show future doctors.  There is one test which I don't know the name of.\n\n**Personal Background**\n\nIn case context is of use: I'm male, in graduate school, live in southern east coast USA.\n\n**Photos**\n\n[Pic of my arm a couple days ago](http://i.imgur.com/QdMDi.jpg)\n\n\nI'm going to read every comment here, if you think it could possibly help please post it.  I am near my wits end, and don't know how much longer I can deal with this.\n\nEDIT1: I added the medicine section.\n\nEDIT2: Check [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyshidrosis) if you get blisters on your hands.  I've \"diagnosed\" several people tonight!\n\nEDIT3: Gotta get some sleep.  Thanks for all the support everyone.  My takeaway from tonight was that I need to see doctors other than dermatologists.\n\nEDIT4: Awake now! Also: There isn't a rash before I pop these things.  The skin *appears* fine, but is super itchy.  Its only after the things pop that there is anything to see.\n\nEDIT5: Not scabies.  I was negative for two tests and they treated me any way just in case.",

The rash looks the same as you've shown in your picture after initial scratching. This was insane itching, that no amount of scratching could help. I'd wake up with blood on my legs from scratching in my sleep and making the little blisters pop up and NOTHING seemed to help it, it just seemed to come and go randomly. It even got to the point when I'd be pressing a cheese-grater against the rash for the cold, sharp edges (but not scratching WITH the grater, i'm not a mentalist!).\n\n  Then luckily, the glass washer in the bar i worked at broke down and we had to do all the washing by hand for 2 weeks. I developed mild eczema on my hands, and my then boyfriend who suffered very bad eczema suggested I quit dairy products to see if my hands cleared up. They did, and so did my legs. Like magic. It was amazing.  \n\n  I did have to cut dairy out of my diet from everything. So (obviously) no cheese, milk, cream, ice-cream, whey powder (used in SO MANY THINGS), basically any product that had any hint of dairy, I didn't eat and my legs cleared up.  \n\n  This was about 3 years ago. I still eat dairy - love pizza too much to not - but I can limit the amount and stop altogether if the problem flares up too much again (like now, I haven't been watching what i've been eating/drinking in the last 2 months so it's been worse than usual). I no longer drink pints of milk though which I had been doing, this makes it noticeably worse, as does doritos (whey powder) and sour cream.  \n\n  My rash as of this morning: http://i.imgur.com/K0ZHj.jpg  \n\n  This is about 3 or 4 days after the initial mad scratching that makes the little blisters come up so they're scabbed over and healing.  \n\n  Incidentally, I don't think it's a specific allergy to dairy but an allergy to a by-product my body produces when digesting dairy, as there's usually a 5-12 hour delay in a reaction. I have a worse reaction to semi-skimmed milk than I do with full-fat.\n\n  tl;dr: same rash, caused by an allergy to dairy products. Can be managed.",

I don't have an official diagnosis either, but I do have a list of things that make it better or worse, and an explanation + pics so that you can decide if my assessment (that it's the same problem) is correct.  I'm also a grad student, and this is a time of repressed stress/anxiety for most people.  I too have been screened unsuccessfully for metabolic problems, diseases, viruses, STDs, immune disorders, allergies, etc, but have also been screened for psychological disorders (which you might want to check out as that seems to be the source of my problem.)\n\n\nThis post became longer than I intended (TL;DR - entirely psychosomatic), so I'll post the pics up top here.  These were taken this morning, on my inner left forearm (please note: freckles are awesome, not a disease).  I've had some low-level stress this week--I would normally not even register this level of it as a problem, just as easily ignorable pain/itching and good enough to wear short sleeves: http://imgur.com/a/2K2oa\n\n* First pic is of my left inner forearm, in sun for reduced visibility of inflammation.\n\n* Second pic is same, close-up in shade.  The picture is blurred (my phone can't focus that close-up) but they are discrete sores almost like folliculitis rather than the lumpy mess that is hives/eczema.\n\n* Same, in shade for increased visibility of inflammation.\n\n* For comparison, [my inner elbow of the same arm](http://i.imgur.com/ofn4c.jpg), almost healed from my last round of eczema (some scarring visible.)  You can see that this \"rash\" is not an extension of my normal eczema, nor triggered at the same time.\n\nEdit:  I removed the rest because it was like a fucking case-study write-up.  If you think this is your problem, I'll PM you the rest.  The source of this \"rash\" for me is completely and totally a psychological manifestation of stress/anxiety.  I am working on a PhD in genetics and have spent a long time searching the literature and performing mini-experiments on myself to determine the source/fix and can say with 95% certainty that the problem may exacerbated or permitted by genetic/environmental variables but is definitely *triggered* by psychosomatic factors.  I am heavily medicated for allergies, topical steroids don't work, diet is controlled, supplement with B-vitamins and DHA and this is different from my \"normal\" eczema/dry skin/hives problems.",

    "body": "# Background\n\nSkinceuticals CE Ferulic is considered the best vitamin c serum that money can buy in the skincare market today. In fact, many people have sweared by the Skinceuticals CE Ferulic, claiming that it makes a larger difference in their skin compared to other vitamin c alternatives. At $166 per oz, it's not as easily accessible by the average consumer. The reason why it's so expensive is because Skinceuticals currently holds the patent for the perfect ratio of vitamin c, vitamin e, and ferulic acid needed to optimize the effectiveness of vitamin c.\n\nThe \"golden ratio\" is **15% L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)**, **1% Vitamin E (Tocopherol)**, and **0.5% Ferulic Aced** with a pH level between **2.5 - 3.0**. Skinceuticals CE Ferulic is also **fungal acne safe**.\n\nGiven the price, there have been a lot of posts and comments asking for dupes of this product.\n\n**Disclaimer: This post is not sponsored. I used my own money to purchase Skinceuticals and Dr.Brenner for the advancement of skincare data.**\n\n## Why should I use Vitamin C?\n\nI'm not going to go into this too much since that's not really the focus of the post, but you can read more about the research behind Vitamin C here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/vitamin\\_c\\_recs](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/vitamin_c_recs)\n\n## Popular Dupes\n\nThere are some well known popular dupes of Skinceuticals out in the skincare market today. Keep in mind, none of the dupes listed will have the exact same formulation as Skinceuticals due to the patent. Below are some popular dupes and the differences it has with Skinceuticals.\n\n**Paula's Choice C15 Booster**\n\n[Link](https://www.paulaschoice.com/c15-super-booster/777.html)\n\nPrice: \\~$65/oz\n\nDisclaimer: I have not tried this product.\n\n|Skinceuticals Ingredients|Paula's Choice C15 Ingredients|\n|:-|:-|\n|Aqua/Water/Eau, Ethoxydiglycol,|Water (Aqua), Ascorbic Acid, Butylene|\n|Ascorbic Acid, Glycerin,|Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Glycerin,|\n|Propylene Glycol, Laureth-23,|PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated|\n|Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol,|Castor Oil, Pentylene Glycol, Tocopherol,|\n|Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate.|Norleucine Acetate, Lecithin, Ferulic|\n||Acid, Panthenol, Bisabolol, Oryza Sativa|\n||(Rice) Bran Extract, Propyl Gallate,|\n||Sodium Gluconate, Sodium Hydroxide,|\n||Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.|\n\nPaulas's Choice claims that this a **15% Vitamin C formula, 1% Vitamin E,** and **0.5% Ferulic Acid** at pH of **3.1**.

They also claim that it is at a pH of 2.5–3. NuFountain **is fungal acne safe**.\n\nMini Review: I did not see any difference using this vitamin c product for a few months, so I discontinued its use.\n\n# Skin(care) Background\n\nI have Asian, sensitive, combination hormonal/acne prone skin. I have lots of PIE due to old acne and lots of freckles and sun damage on my skin due to the fact that I've lived in Hawaii for most of my life.\n\n## Current Routine\n\nMorning:\n\n* ILLI Ceramide Ato Lotion\n* Hado Labo Tokyo Skin Plumping Gel Cream\n* Shiseido SPF40 Sunscreen\n\nNight:\n\n* La Roche Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Face Wash\n* Tretinoin 0.1% cream\n* ILLI Ceramide Ato Lotion\n* Hado Labo Tokyo Skin Plumping Gel Cream\n\nTret has made my skin extra sensitive. For example, my skin is now unable to use the Cerave hydrating cleanser due to how sensitive it is. The La Roche Posay cleanser is the only non irritating cleaner I can use now that I am on Tret.\n\nI have tried multiple Vitamin C products on my skin over the years. Specifically, I've tried Melano CC, NuFountain C20, The Ordinary Vitamin C Suspension, and Philosophy Vitamin C Powder.\n\nI have never been able to spot any visible improvement whenever I started using *any* brand of Vitamin C on my skin.\n\n# Review\n\nThere's quite a number of reviews between Skinceuticals CE Ferulic VS Timeless 20% Vitamin C and Paula's Choice C15 if you make a quick Google search. I didn't want to add to those stats as I think there's enough data there. This post is mainly going to review Skinceuticals CE Ferulic vs Dr.Brenner's 20% Vitamin C Serum. In my opinion, Dr.Brenner is the closest dupe, ingredients wise, to Skinceuticals CE Ferulic.\n\n## Packaging\n\n[Packaging](https://preview.redd.it/y21w3rkgcmi51.jpg?width=1433&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=440c465d015a4ab5b9a285ece3ca393f24c7b33a)\n\nSkinceuticals came in a blue paper box, wrapped in plastic. The actual bottle is pretty opaque, but would definitely still allow light through given that it's glass and I was able to see the serum line quite clearly.\n\nDr.Brenner's came with the glass bottle wrapped in plastic. The bottle was just as opaque as Skinceuticals, and I was also able to see the serum line quite clearly.\n\nThe general guidance for both is to store in a cool, dry place. I've also read online that Vitamin C should be exposed to as little light as possible. Given that, I think Skinceutical's does a better job protecting the product until it gets to the consumer's home given the paper casing. For Dr.Brenner, it's possible for it to be exposed to light while waiting for it to be packaged and sent. However, they do claim on Amazon that they create their Vitamin C serum every 2 weeks to make sure it's fresh.\n\nI stored both of mine in a cupboard, so they're both only exposed to light when I take it out and use it. However, I kept my Skinceuticals in the paper casing while I stored it in the cupboard.\n\n## Product\n\n**Dr. Brenner Vitamin C Serum**\n\n[Link](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-L-Ascorbic-Hyaluronic-Dr-Brenner/dp/B07ZG28M2S/)\n\nPrice: $24.99/oz\n\n|Skinceuticals Ingredients|Dr. Brenner Vitamin C Ingredients|\n|:-|:-|\n|Aqua/Water/Eau, Ethoxydiglycol,|Water, Ethoxydiglycol,|\n|Ascorbic Acid, Glycerin,|L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Propylene|\n|Propylene Glycol, Laureth-23,|Glycol, Glycerin, Laureth-23,|\n|Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol,|Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Sodium|\n|Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate.|Ferulic Acid, Panthenol,|\n||Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol|\n\nAs you can see, the ingredients used in Dr.Brenner is the same as Skinceuticals, although the ordering seems to be different. Dr.Brenner claims that the ratio is **20% Vitamin C, 1% Vitamin E, 1% Hyaluronic Acid,** and **0.5% Ferulic Acid**. Unfortunately, I do not know the pH nor do I have anything to find out the pH of Dr.Brenner. Dr.Brenner **is fungal acne safe**.\n\n## Method\n\nI applied Skinceuticals to the left side of my face, and Dr.Brenner to the right side of my face every morning for 1 month, adjusting for irritation. I also applied the same sunscreen to my entire face after applying the vitamin c serums.\n\n## Thoughts\n\n**Skinceuticals CE Ferulic**\n\nThis has a really strong hot dog smell. The reviews are spot on about this. It really does smell like I'm rubbing hot dog water on my face. The serum is a pale yellow. The texture is slightly more viscous than Dr.Brenner's. The best way I can describe it is that it has the texture of thick water.\n\n**Dr.Brenner Vitamin C Serum**\n\nThis has a faint hot dog smell, not as strong as Skinceuticals. The texture is not as thick as Skinceuticals, it's more runny and has a closer texture to water, possibly due to the higher hyaluronic acid content. The coloring is a lighter yellow than Skinceuticals.\n\nMy before pictures are from when I applied the Vitamin C serums for the first time on each side. My after pictures are 1 month after daily morning application of the Vitamin C serums.\n\nI found that the Dr.Brenner serum is more irritating on my skin than Skinceuticals. I found that the side where I usually apply the Dr.Brenner serum usually gets more red and irritable compared to the Skinceuticals side. However, this only happens when my skin needs a break from Tret, and the irritation usually goes away if I take a break from Tret for a day.\n\n## Final Verdict\n\n[Before Front](https://preview.redd.it/pu2biihlcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7fc6d699da9c03071fedefbf839616465bddf31b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Before Skinceuticals](https://preview.redd.it/pbx6am5ncmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8781476d62dbbf083a306021e119563fd226742)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Before Dr. Brenner](https://preview.redd.it/yr2ofgzocmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2be97af34e9328346fb0b41825bf547bce93c3c3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Front](https://preview.redd.it/b6v0kgoqcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c50ddcdda52d39e8b434fe78d1e0147ff35c41b7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Skinceuticals](https://preview.redd.it/wajzo5zrcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cee0f78bdf18dfe3bd284ed2406eb1b08e753b53)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Dr.Brenner](https://preview.redd.it/24ub6lbtcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a7c5406f55dd31b8823a9ff2a62cba875f2ce29)\n\nResults wise, both sides look pretty similar to me, with the Skinceuticals side looking a bit better. However, this could be due to the fact that I just had more acne scarring on the Dr.Brenner side than the Skinceuticals side. Given the fact that I don't think the difference between the two sides is all that large and my experience with them is mostly similar, I would go for the Dr.Brenner serum and probably apply it every other day. However, if you don't have sensitive skin like mine, I still would recommend Dr.Brenner's serum over Skinceuticals. The reason being that I just don't see *that* large of an improvement from Skinceuticals over Dr.Brenner to justify the 8x price tag. The ingredients are also *very* similar, with the only difference being that Dr.Brenner has more hyaluronic acid.",

    "body": "So for the past year I've been spending a huge amount of time on learning how to learn starting with Barbara Oakley's famous coursera course of the same name, to ultralearning from Scott Young, to Make It Stick by Peter C Brown, and from there I looked at papers on how to learn as well as sites and articles for anything else. This post is only a smidgen of what I've found, but I hope it is enough information for you to get started and hopefully find research yourself that you can look up to! I will link some recommended sources in the comments of this post so you can start with if you want to start digging deeper.\n\n# Introduction\n\nAre you struggling to learn new things effectively? Do you feel like you're not making progress despite putting in a lot of effort? Learning how to learn is a crucial skill that can help you overcome these challenges and achieve your goals. In this post, we'll discuss the science behind effective learning and memory, and explore various techniques and insights from books and sources to help you learn things deeply and quickly. Whether you're a student, professional, or anyone who wants to improve their learning skills, this post is for you. So let's dive in and learn how to learn!\n\nFirst, let's talk about why learning how to learn is so important. Many people approach learning as a chore, something they have to do to get good grades or advance in their career. But what if I told you that by mastering the science of learning, you can actually make learning more enjoyable and efficient?\n\nTo understand how to make learning easier and more effective, we need to dive into the science behind it. The brain is an incredibly complex device, with a million billion synapses where memories are stored. But how exactly do these memories get stored and retrieved?\n\n## How the Brain Works\n\nTo gain a better understanding of how memories are formed and retrieved, it is essential to delve into the intricacies of neurons and synapses. Neurons, as the fundamental building blocks of the brain, play a crucial role in the process of memory formation and retention. Synapses, on the other hand, are the interconnecting bridges that allow neurons to communicate with each other. When we learn something new, electrical signals are transmitted through these synapses, which in turn produce neurotransmitters responsible for the storage of memories\n\nHowever, the process of memory formation is not just about having more synapses. It is also about the manner in which they are connected to one another. Different areas of the brain are responsible for various aspects of learning and memory. The hippocampus and frontal cortex, for instance, are involved in analyzing perceptions and deciding what information to store, while the amygdala plays a vital role in integrating emotions and memory. It is through the complex interplay of these different neural regions that memories are formed, stored, and retrieved.\n\n## How Memory Works\n\nMemory is an intricate process that involves multiple stages. These stages are sensory, short-term, and long-term memory. Sensory memory is the first stage of memory that receives and processes fleeting impressions of your perceptions. It is responsible for holding raw information for a very short time, no more than a few seconds.\n\nShort-term memory is the second stage of memory and is like a storage unit that holds about four chunks of information and lasts for 20-30 seconds. During this stage, the brain processes and stores the information currently in use, such as a phone number, an address, or a short message.\n\nIt is long-term memory that we tend to think of when we talk about memory. This stage is responsible for storing and retrieving information for an extended period. The long-term memory capacity is vast, and it is where the most important and meaningful memories are stored.\n\nTo move information from short-term to long-term memory, you need to use a technique called spaced repetition. This involves repeating what you're trying to retain over several days to strengthen the synaptic connections between neurons. However, it's not just about repetition - it's about encoding, storage, and retrieval processes. Encoding is the process of transforming information into a meaningful code that can be stored in memory, while storage is the process of retaining that information over time. Lastly, retrieval is the process of accessing stored information when needed.\n\n## Common Misconceptions about Learning and Memory\n\nThere are a number of myths and misconceptions surrounding the processes of learning and memory that can unfortunately hinder one's progress. One common misconception is that intelligence is a fixed trait and that one's memory or learning abilities cannot be improved. However, the reality is that anyone can improve their memory and learning skills through deliberate and consistent practice.\n\nAnother popular myth is the belief that taking breaks during learning or studying is a waste of time. However, in truth, taking breaks is an essential component of effective learning. When you take a break, your brain's diffuse mode works in the background, creating new neural connections and allowing you to see things from different perspectives, leading to better and more comprehensive learning.\n\nBy understanding the science behind learning and memory, one can approach the process of learning with a more positive mindset and focus on utilizing effective strategies. With the right techniques, anyone can learn new information deeply and quickly, making the process of learning a more enjoyable and rewarding experience. In addition, there are many tools and resources available to help one improve their learning and memory abilities, including mind mapping, mnemonic devices, spaced repetition, and more.\n\n## Techniques for Effective Learning\n\nNow that we've busted some myths, it's time to explore some tried-and-true techniques for effective learning. These techniques involve taking advantage of the way our brains naturally process and store information. Let's dive in!\n\n## Recall\n\nRecall is an effective strategy for improving memory retention because it strengthens the synaptic connections between neurons. Essentially, when you actively retrieve information from memory, you are exercising your brain and making it easier to retrieve the information in the future. This technique can be thought of as lifting weights for your brain, and just like with physical exercise, consistent practice is key.\n\nTo effectively use recall in your study routine, start by actively testing yourself on the material you are trying to learn. For example, if you are studying for a history exam, try to recall important dates and events without looking at your notes. This will help to exercise the neural pathways associated with that information and make it easier to remember in the future. Another effective technique is to use flashcards, which allow you to actively retrieve information from memory and test yourself on specific concepts or terms.\n\nThe reason why recall is so effective for improving memory retention is because it strengthens the synaptic connections between neurons. When you repeatedly retrieve information from memory, you are essentially reinforcing the neural pathways associated with that information. This makes it easier to retrieve the information in the future, because the pathways have been strengthened and the information is easier to access.\n\nIn addition to recall, there are other strategies that can improve memory retention. Spaced repetition is one such strategy, which involves repeating what you're trying to retain over several days to strengthen synaptic connections. Chunking is another strategy, which involves piecing together bits of information through meaning and usage. This allows you to tie meaning to a concept or idea and make it more memorable. By incorporating these techniques into your study routine, you can optimize your learning and retain information more effectively.\n\n## Spaced Repetition\n\nSpaced repetition is a powerful technique that can be used to improve your ability to retain information. It involves repeating what you are trying to remember over several days to strengthen synaptic connections in your brain. The technique, much like watering a plant, requires the right amount of repetition at the right intervals to achieve optimal growth.\n\nTo effectively use spaced repetition, it is important to first create a schedule of when and how often to repeat the material. For example, if you are trying to memorize a list of vocabulary words in a foreign language, you might start by studying the words for a few minutes each day for a week. Then, you might repeat the list of words every other day for the next two weeks, and then once a week for the following month. This spaced repetition schedule allows for optimal growth of synaptic connections in your brain, improving your ability to retain the information.\n\nAnother example of spaced repetition in action is when learning to play a musical instrument. Instead of practicing for hours on end, it is often more effective to practice for shorter periods of time, with breaks in between to allow your brain to consolidate the new information. By spacing out your practice sessions and repeating the material over several days, you can improve your ability to retain the information and improve your overall skill level.\n\nSpaced repetition works because it takes advantage of the brain's natural learning processes. When you learn something new, your brain creates new synapses between neurons to store the information. However, these synapses are relatively weak at first and can easily be forgotten. By repeating the material over several days, the synapses become stronger and more permanent, making it easier to recall the information later on. This technique also helps to prevent forgetting by refreshing the memory at regular intervals, further strengthening the synaptic connections in your brain.\n\n## Interleaving\n\nInterleaving is a highly effective technique for learning and practicing skills or concepts. It involves mixing up different types of problems or materials, which can help you to better retain and apply the information. The key to effective interleaving is to ensure that you are constantly switching between different types of problems or materials in a way that allows your brain to make new connections between ideas and to think in a more flexible and adaptable way. This can lead to deeper understanding and more efficient learning.\n\nFor example, if you are trying to learn a new language, you might start by practicing basic vocabulary and grammar rules. However, instead of simply repeating the same exercises over and over again, you could try interleaving different types of exercises, such as practicing vocabulary, grammar, and reading comprehension in quick succession. This would force your brain to constantly switch between different types of problems, which would help you to better retain and apply the information.\n\nAnother example of interleaving is in sports training. Instead of performing the same drills over and over again, athletes can benefit from mixing up their training routine. For instance, a basketball player might practice shooting, dribbling, and passing in quick succession, rather than focusing on a single skill for an extended period of time. This would force the player to adjust to different types of challenges and think in a more flexible and adaptable way, which would ultimately improve their overall performance.\n\nThe reason why interleaving is so effective is that it forces your brain to constantly switch between different types of problems, which helps to build new neural connections and reinforce existing ones. By constantly challenging your brain to adapt to new situations, you are training it to be more flexible and adaptable, which can lead to deeper understanding and more efficient learning. Additionally, interleaving can help to prevent boredom and keep you engaged in the learning process, which can ultimately lead to better overall outcomes.\n\n## Mnemonics\n\nMnemonics are an effective memory aid that can help you remember information by creating associations between the information you want to remember and other things that you already know. This technique works because the brain is naturally wired to remember things that are meaningful and connected to other information.\n\nOne way to use mnemonics is to create a memorable sentence or acronym that represents a list of items. For example, to remember the colors of the rainbow in order, you can use the acronym ROYGBIV (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet). Another way to use mnemonics is to create a memorable image that represents a concept. For example, to remember the difference between weather and climate, you can imagine a man holding an umbrella (weather) while standing next to a tree (climate).\n\nTo use mnemonics effectively, it's important to create associations that are vivid, meaningful, and easy to remember. You should also try to use mnemonics in a way that makes sense to you personally. For example, if you have a strong association between a particular food and a memory, you can use that food in your mnemonic to help you remember the information.\n\nOverall, mnemonics are a powerful tool that can help you remember information more effectively. By creating associations between new information and things you already know, you can improve your memory and recall more easily.\n\n## Memory Palace\n\nThe Memory Palace technique is an excellent mnemonic strategy that can be utilized to improve memory. This technique involves creating a mental map of a familiar location, such as your home or workplace, and associating each item that you want to remember with a specific location in that place. By doing so, you can significantly improve your ability to remember things.\n\nTo effectively use this technique, start by selecting a location that you are familiar with and that has a specific structure, such as a house or a building. Next, imagine yourself walking through the location and identify specific objects or landmarks that stand out to you. For example, if you choose your apartment, you could associate the couch with the color red, the dining table with a vase of flowers, and the kitchen with the smell of coffee.\n\nOnce you have identified these landmarks, you can associate each item that you want to remember with a specific location in your mental map. For instance, if you want to remember a list of grocery items, you can associate each item with a specific location in your home. For example, you can associate apples with the fruit bowl on your kitchen counter, bread with the bread box on your kitchen shelf, and milk with the refrigerator in your kitchen. By doing so, when you need to recall the items, you can simply visualize your mental map of your home and recall the location of each item.\n\nThis technique is effective because it leverages the power of visualization and association. By associating each item with a specific location in your mental map, you create a visual and spatial representation of the information in your mind. This makes it easier for you to recall the information later because your brain has formed strong connections between the items and the locations. With practice, you can use this technique to remember even long lists of items, and impress your friends and colleagues with your newfound memory skills.\n\n## Chunking\n\nChunking is a technique for memorizing information by grouping it into smaller chunks, making it easier to remember. For example, if you need to memorize a phone number, you might chunk it into three groups of numbers, like 555-123-4567. This makes it easier to remember because it's easier to remember three smaller chunks than one long string of digits.\n\nAnother example of chunking is breaking down a larger concept into smaller, more manageable pieces. For instance, if you're trying to learn a new programming language, you might start by breaking it down into smaller components, such as syntax, data types, and control structures. Once you've mastered these smaller chunks, you can start piecing them together to gain a better understanding of the language as a whole.\n\nChunking is effective because it makes it easier for the brain to process and store information. When information is presented in smaller, more manageable chunks, it's easier for the brain to process and remember. Additionally, chunking helps to create meaningful connections between pieces of information, making it easier to recall them later.\n\nTo effectively use chunking, it's important to give the task your undivided attention and then find the overall big picture and key ideas. You can perform a quick picture walk-through of your material, and anything that stands out is usually important. You should then provide context for your ideas and concepts to know when to use them. Finally, you want to tie auditory hooks to your memory by speaking about it out loud with self-explanation.\n\nOverall, chunking is a powerful technique for learning and memorization because it makes information more manageable and easier to process. By breaking down larger concepts into smaller, more manageable chunks, you can make it easier for your brain to process and store information, making it easier to recall later on.\n\n## Self-Explanation\n\nSelf-explanation is a powerful learning technique that can be used in a variety of contexts. One way to effectively use self-explanation is to ask \"why\" questions when encountering a new concept. For example, if you are learning about the concept of photosynthesis, you might ask yourself, \"Why do plants need sunlight in order to produce energy?\" By asking and answering these types of questions, you are actively engaging with the material and promoting the formation of new connections between ideas.\n\nAnother way to use self-explanation is to relate new concepts to what you already know. For example, if you are learning a new language and come across a new word, you might try to relate it to a word in your native language that has a similar meaning. This can help you remember the new word and also reinforce your understanding of the concept it represents.\n\nFinally, self-explanation can be used to identify gaps in your understanding. For example, if you are reading a complex scientific article and come across a term or concept that you don't fully understand, you might try to explain it to yourself in your own words. If you can't explain it, that might be an indication that you need to go back and review the material or seek additional resources.\n\nThe reason why self-explanation is such an effective learning technique is that it encourages individuals to actively engage with the material and construct new knowledge by relating it to what they already know. By creating a dialogue with oneself, one is able to identify gaps in their understanding and clarify their thinking, leading to a more thorough and integrated understanding of the material. Essentially, self-explanation is like having a conversation with your own brain, which can be a powerful tool in the learning process.\n\n## Elaborative Interrogation\n\nElaborative interrogation is a powerful technique that can help you improve your learning process by asking yourself \"why\" questions and trying to come up with a detailed explanation. This process can be thought of as trying to be a detective in your own mind, where you are constantly trying to uncover new clues and piece together the information you already have. Here are a few examples of how to effectively use this technique:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* When studying history, ask yourself why certain events occurred and what factors led to them. Try to come up with a detailed explanation that takes into account all the relevant factors.\n* When learning a new concept in science, ask yourself why it works the way it does, and try to come up with a detailed explanation that includes all the relevant principles and laws.\n* When reading a novel, ask yourself why certain characters behave the way they do, and try to come up with a detailed explanation that considers their motivations and past experiences.\n\nThis technique works because it forces you to engage with the material on a deeper level and make connections with other ideas. By asking yourself why something is true, you are actively processing the information and creating new neural connections. This process helps you to remember the information better and understand it more deeply. Furthermore, the process of elaborative interrogation helps to overcome illusions of understanding by exposing gaps in knowledge and highlighting areas that need further clarification.\n\nMoreover, these techniques can make learning more effective and enjoyable. Whether you are trying to learn a new language, improve your math skills, or expand your knowledge, these techniques can help you achieve your goals. Not only do they allow you to think more critically and creatively, but they also stimulate your brain in new ways and encourage you to explore different perspectives and ideas.\n\nSo, if you haven't tried these techniques yet, give them a try! You might be surprised at how much they can improve your learning experience. Your brain will certainly thank you for it!\n\n## Beating Procrastination\n\nProcrastination is a fascinating phenomenon that affects all of us in some way or another. It's like a monster that lurks inside our brains, always ready to pounce when we need to get something done. When we're faced with a task that we don't want to do, our brain associates it with pain, discomfort and stress. It's like our brain is telling us that this task is going to be hard and that we're going to have to work really hard to get it done. This is because the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for decision-making and cognitive control, is in charge of regulating behavior associated with goals. When faced with a difficult task, the prefrontal cortex sends signals to the amygdala, the part of the brain associated with emotion, to initiate a stress response. This stress response activates the release of cortisol, a hormone that is associated with the body's response to stress, and creates physical discomfort in our body. This discomfort is what we perceive as pain, and it's what makes procrastination so difficult to overcome.\n\nTo make matters worse, our brains are wired to seek pleasure and avoid pain. When we procrastinate, we turn to activities that give us immediate pleasure, like scrolling through social media or watching TV. These activities release dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward. Our brains then begin to associate procrastination with pleasure, making it even harder to overcome.\n\nSo, how can we beat procrastination?\n\nTo beat procrastination, it's important to understand the habit loop consisting of a cue, routine, reward, and belief. Once you have identified the cues and rewards that drive your procrastination habits, you can develop strategies to override them. For example, if the cue for procrastination is checking social media, you can remove the social media app from your phone or block it during certain times of the day. If the reward for procrastination is watching TV, you can reward yourself with an episode of your favorite show after completing a task.\n\nThis technique works because it helps to rewire the neural pathways associated with procrastination. By changing the cues and rewards, you can change the behavior associated with the habit. Additionally, by developing new habits and routines, you can strengthen the neural pathways associated with those behaviors, making them more automatic and easier to perform over time. With practice, you can learn to override the procrastination habit and develop more productive habits that help you achieve your goals.\n\nThe Pomodoro technique is a time management method that involves breaking work into 25-minute intervals, called \"pomodoros,\" followed by a 5-minute break. After four pomodoros, take a longer break of around 15-30 minutes. However, it is important to note that you do not have to follow this exact timing and can adjust the intervals to fit your needs.\n\nThe Pomodoro technique works because it helps you stay focused and avoid distractions. By breaking work into manageable intervals, you are less likely to become overwhelmed or lose focus. Additionally, the breaks allow your brain to rest and recharge, making it easier to stay productive throughout the day.\n\nTo effectively use the Pomodoro technique, start by identifying the task you want to complete. Set a timer for 25 minutes and work on the task until the timer goes off. Take a 5-minute break, then repeat the process. After four pomodoros, take a longer break to recharge. It can also be helpful to track your progress and make adjustments as needed. If you find that 25-minute intervals are too long or too short, adjust the intervals to fit your needs.\n\nHere are a few concrete examples of how to use the Pomodoro technique:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* When studying for a test, break the material into manageable chunks and work on each chunk for 25 minutes at a time.\n* When writing a paper, work on one section for 25 minutes, then take a break before moving on to the next section.\n* When working on a project, break it down into smaller tasks and work on each task for 25 minutes at a time.\n\nOverall, the Pomodoro technique is a simple but effective way to manage your time and stay focused on your work. Of course, you don’t have to follow 25/5 pomodoro. You can do 50/10, 45/15, etc. I wouldn’t recommend letting yourself study for more than one hour at a time however.\n\nJournaling about your procrastination habits can help you identify triggers and develop strategies to overcome them. For example, if you find yourself procrastinating when faced with a difficult task, you could break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. By doing this, you can build momentum and gain a sense of accomplishment as you complete each step, which can help motivate you to continue working.\n\nTime blocking is another effective technique for combating procrastination. To use this technique, you can break up your day into specific time slots and dedicate each slot to a specific task. For instance, you could block out two hours for writing a report, followed by a 30-minute break, then another two-hour block for responding to emails. This can help you stay focused and prevent distractions from derailing your progress. By scheduling specific tasks at specific times, you can create a sense of urgency and hold yourself accountable for completing them.\n\nBoth journaling and time blocking work by helping you stay organized and focused on your goals. By identifying the triggers that lead to procrastination and breaking your day into manageable tasks, you can avoid feeling overwhelmed and build the momentum you need to achieve your goals. Additionally, these techniques can help you develop a sense of control over your time and reduce the anxiety and stress that often accompany procrastination.\n\n\"Eat your frogs first\" is a technique that involves tackling your most difficult or unpleasant task first thing in the morning when your willpower is at its strongest. This technique is effective because it helps to build momentum and make the rest of your day feel more manageable.\n\nFor example, if you have a project that you've been dreading, start your day by working on it for an hour or two. By doing so, you'll be able to make significant progress and feel a sense of accomplishment that will carry you through the rest of your day. Alternatively, if you have a difficult conversation that you've been putting off, schedule it for the beginning of your day when you're most alert and focused.\n\nAnother example of this technique in action is a writer who starts their day by writing their most challenging section first, such as the introduction or conclusion. By doing so, they build momentum and gain confidence that they can complete the rest of their work.\n\nOverall, eating your frogs first is an effective technique because it helps you to break through procrastination and build momentum towards your goals. By tackling your most difficult or unpleasant task first, you'll be able to make progress and build confidence that will carry you through the rest of your day.\n\nTo effectively remove environmental triggers that lead to procrastination, you can take a few concrete steps. For example, if you find yourself constantly checking your phone when you should be studying, you can put your phone in another room or turn off notifications during your study sessions. Another example is to create a designated study space that is free from distractions, such as a library or a quiet room in your house. This can help you stay focused and avoid interruptions. Additionally, you can make your environment clean and organized by removing clutter and creating a clear workspace. This can help you feel more motivated and focused on your goals.\n\nThe reason this technique works is that it helps reduce the distractions that can lead to procrastination. By removing environmental triggers, you are creating an environment that is conducive to studying and learning. This can help you stay focused on your tasks and avoid the temptations that can derail your progress. Additionally, by creating a clean and organized workspace, you are signaling to your brain that it is time to focus and be productive. This can help you get into the right mindset for learning and studying.\n\nIn summary, beating procrastination is all about understanding the habit loop, pomodoro, identifying your triggers, and developing strategies to override them. By using techniques like journaling, time blocking, and eating your frogs first, you can stay focused and make progress towards your learning goals. So the next time you find yourself procrastinating, remember that you have the power to take control of your habits and achieve your dreams. Your brain will thank you for it!\n\n## Lifestyle Choices That Improve Memory\n\nNow that we've covered some techniques for learning more deeply and efficiently, let's talk about some lifestyle choices that can help improve your memory even further. These tips are designed to help you take care of your brain and optimize its performance, so that you can learn and remember more effectively.\n\n## Exercise\n\nExercise has been shown to have numerous benefits for brain health and cognitive function, including improved memory. But how exactly does exercise help improve memory? One theory is that exercise increases blood flow and oxygen to the brain, which helps to nourish brain cells and promote the growth of new neurons. Additionally, exercise has been shown to increase the production of certain chemicals in the brain, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is important for the growth and survival of neurons.\n\nTo effectively use exercise to improve memory, it's important to engage in cardiovascular exercise that gets your heart rate up and increases blood flow to the brain. This can include activities such as running, cycling, swimming, or brisk walking. It's also important to make exercise a regular part of your routine. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week.\n\nFinally, it's important to stay motivated and make exercise a fun and enjoyable part of your routine. Find activities that you enjoy and that you look forward to, and try to make exercise a social activity by finding a workout buddy or joining a group fitness class. By making exercise a regular and enjoyable part of your routine, you can reap the many benefits it has to offer for both your body and your brain.\n\n## Meditation\n\nMeditation is a powerful tool for improving memory and cognitive function. This ancient practice has been used for centuries to help people calm their minds and improve their focus. Recent research has shown that meditation can actually change the structure of the brain, improving memory and attention span. To effectively use this technique, start by finding a quiet place where you won't be disturbed. Sit comfortably in a chair or on the floor, with your back straight and your eyes closed. Focus on your breath and try to clear your mind of all other thoughts. When your mind wanders, gently bring it back to your breath. Start with just a few minutes each day and gradually increase the time as you become more comfortable with the practice.\n\nOne reason why meditation can improve memory is that it helps reduce stress and anxiety, which are known to impair memory function. Additionally, meditation can increase the size of the hippocampus, the part of the brain that is critical for memory and learning. This can lead to better memory consolidation and recall.\n\nTo illustrate the effectiveness of meditation for memory improvement, a study conducted by researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara found that participants who meditated for just 10 minutes a day for two weeks showed significant improvements in working memory and executive function compared to a control group. Another study published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease found that a mindfulness meditation program improved memory, attention, and cognitive flexibility in older adults with mild cognitive impairment.\n\nIn conclusion, meditation is a simple yet powerful technique for improving memory and cognitive function. By reducing stress and anxiety, increasing the size of the hippocampus, and improving memory consolidation and recall, meditation can help you reach your learning goals and achieve success.\n\n## Brain-Boosting Foods\n\nEating certain foods can promote brain health and improve memory. For example, blueberries are high in antioxidants that protect brain cells from damage and inflammation, while salmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids that support brain function and improve memory. Nuts, such as almonds and walnuts, contain vitamin E that helps prevent cognitive decline and enhance memory recall. Additionally, dark chocolate contains flavonoids that improve blood flow to the brain, which can boost cognitive function.\n\nThese brain-boosting foods work by providing essential nutrients that nourish the brain and promote the growth of new neurons. Antioxidants, for example, protect the brain from damage and inflammation caused by free radicals, which are unstable molecules that can damage cells. Omega-3 fatty acids, on the other hand, are important for brain function and can improve memory by supporting the growth of new neurons and enhancing communication between brain cells. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant and can help prevent cognitive decline by protecting the brain from damage. Finally, flavonoids in dark chocolate can improve blood flow to the brain, which can boost cognitive function.\n\nTo effectively use this technique, it is important to incorporate brain-boosting foods into your diet regularly. Snack on a handful of almonds or blueberries, include salmon in your meals, and indulge in a square of dark chocolate every now and then. It is also important to maintain a balanced and healthy diet overall and to exercise regularly, as physical activity has been linked to improved brain function and memory.\n\n## Sleep\n\nGetting enough sleep is crucial for memory consolidation and cognitive function. To effectively use this technique, it's important to establish a regular sleep schedule and aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night. Avoiding caffeine and screens before bedtime and creating a relaxing sleep environment can also help you fall asleep more easily.\n\nOne concrete example of how to incorporate this technique into your routine is to set a specific bedtime and wake-up time, and stick to it every day. This will help regulate your body's internal clock and make it easier to fall asleep and wake up at the same time each day. Another example is to avoid stimulating activities before bedtime, such as watching TV or using electronic devices, which can interfere with your ability to fall asleep.\n\nThe reason why sleep is so important for memory consolidation is that during sleep, the brain processes and consolidates memories, making it easier to remember what you've learned and make connections between different pieces of information. Additionally, getting enough sleep can improve cognitive function, including attention, problem-solving, and decision-making abilities. In contrast, not getting enough sleep can lead to fatigue, poor memory retention, and decreased cognitive function.\n\n## Other Lifestyle Changes\n\nAdding new activities to your routine can be a great way to improve your memory and cognitive function. In fact, there are numerous activities that can be beneficial for your brain health and cognitive abilities.\n\nFor example, playing chess is a popular activity that can help to improve your problem-solving skills and strategic thinking abilities. It is a game that requires you to think ahead and anticipate your opponent's moves, which can help to challenge your brain in new ways. Similarly, learning a new instrument can be a great way to challenge your brain and promote the growth of new neurons. It requires you to learn new skills, such as reading music, playing different chords, and developing your sense of rhythm. All of these skills can help to stimulate your brain and improve cognitive function.\n\nIn summary, by making some simple lifestyle changes, you can improve your memory and cognitive function. Exercise, meditation, brain-boosting foods, sleep, and other activities can all help to promote brain health and improve memory. So, take care of your brain, and it will take care of you!",

    "body": "⚠️ **DISCLAIMER:** Since making this post, I've learned some new information that has changed my perception and usage of the term \"fungal-safe\". I've shared about this at length in my post [\"Fungal-safe\" skincare: unscientific BS?](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/IxvbUdN1jv) The TLDR of that post: there is no scientific proof showing that the ingredients excluded as not \"fungal-safe\"  actually cause problems for those with malassezia-related conditions. The concept of \"fungal-safe\" is something created purely based on the personal experiences of people on the internet. It is 100% anecdotal. I will no longer be perpetuating the concept of \"fungal-safe\" skincare, and all previous or future posts by me should not be considered advice, but merely recountings of my personal experience. **These are simply techniques and product choices that have worked for me, personally.**\n\n♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️\n\nIt's been over a year since I first made a list of fungal-safe products, for anyone dealing with malassezia follicutlitis (fungal acne), seb derm (seborrheic dermatitis) or similar conditions. Since then, more products have come on the market, reformulations have happened, I've used more products - plus I figured having just a list would be handy reference, since my first post was... really long 😂\n\n[My first list of fungal-safe products](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), with an in-depth guide to how I made my first fungal-safe skincare routine, and practical tips. Notable point is, since that post, I've learned that cetearyl alcohol is not fungal-safe, and switched to using https://folliculitisscout.com as an ingredient checker since I find it up to date, with that ingredient flagged. if any of you want to check if a product is fungal-safe - that's the website I personally use ☺️ If you want a detailed rundown of how and why these ingredients affect our skin, I highly reccomend the SimpleSkincareScience website - [Their Fungal Acne Treatment Bible post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) is very thorough and cites sources ❤️\n\n[My current routine in 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/uwmvkk/my_current_2022_fungalsafe_skincare_routine_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (more or less) with some haircare.\n\nThese are not recommendations, they're just useful information - some products have reviews linked, but please do use ✨️the search bar✨️ as well as other sources to check out other reviews, and make an informed purchase  ☺️\n\n**Disclaimer:** These products are not guaranteed to suit anybody. It's just that ingredients that are known triggers for seb derm or fungal acne - like plant oils, esters, fatty acids, etc. - are absent in these products. They may not suit your skin for other reasons. YMMV.\n\n**They will not treat malassezia related conditions**, they're intended as options for those who want to use a fungal-safe routine, to prevent flare-ups and maintain their skin.\n\nIF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU MAY BE SUFFERING FROM ONE OF THESE CONDITIONS, PLEASE SEEK MEDICAL GUIDANCE FROM A DERMATOLOGIST. These products are not a substitute for medical treatment.\n\n#✨️ First cleansers/makeup removers\n\n+ Solimo Micellar Water\n\n+ Garnier Naturals Micellar Water (the pink one)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil (plain pink original formula - does not emulsify, but can be used to dissolve and wipe off sunscreen/makeup, and followed up with a foaming cleanser)\n\n#✨️ Foaming cleansers\n\n+ Sebamed Clear Face Cleansing Foam\n\n+ Simple Kind to Skin Refreshing Face Wash\n\n+ Kaya Clinic Soothing Cleansing Gel\n\n+ Deconstruct Niacinamide Brightening Face Wash - 2% Niacinamide+2% Liquorice Root Extract\n\n+ Deconstruct Salicylic Acid Oil Control Face Wash - 0.5% Salicylic Acid +1% Niacinamide [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/y3ynhi/review_deconstruct_salicylic_acid_oil_control/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=2&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Deconstruct Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Face Wash - 0.5% Amino Acids + 0.1% Hyaluronic Acid\n\n+ Body Cupid Deep Clarifying Face Wash (with Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E) \n\n+ Body Cupid Tea Tree and Neem Anti Acne Face Wash (with Tea Tree Oil & Neem Extract) \n\n+ Body Cupid Vitamin C Brightening Face Wash (with Fruit Extract of Kakadu Plums) \n\nAll the Body Cupid face washes appear to be fungal-safe, but the ones I left out have \"menthol crystals\" and \"strawberry microbeads\" in, respectively, so... wouldn't recommend, even in theory 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\n+ Bliscent Lychee & Sea Buckthorn Face Wash\n\n+ Himalaya Purifying Neem Face Wash (tube, not foaming pump)\n\n+ Himalaya Tan Removal Orange Face Wash (not the scrub)\n\n+ DermaCo 2% Cica-Glow Daily Face Wash with Tranexamic Acid & Licorice Extract (contains something called \"Gillet-C\", which I cannot find as an ingredient anywhere, but seems to have something to do with vitamin C?)\n\n+ Mamaearth Charcoal Face Wash (with activated charcoal and coffee)\n\n+ Clean & Clear Natural Bright Face Wash\n\n+ Re'equil Fruit AHA Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Rejusure 2% Salicylic Acid Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/th4u4s/review_rejusure_2_salicylic_acid_face_wash/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Zitclin Zitcare Foam Face Wash (2% salicylic acid in a \"gel base q.s. containing aloe vera\".

Sugarcane squalane is considered fungal-safe. Olive squalane is variable - some people with malassezia use it with zero issues, some find it aggravates their condition. I've mentioned the source of the squalane in these products whenever I've been able to find that info.\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you are dealing with active seb derm/fungal acne and want to be on the safe side, best to avoid products containing mineral oil, liquid paraffin or Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather - even too much MCT oil - can lead to oil and heat building up and cause flare-ups. Less is more.\n\n+ Body Cupid 99% Pure Aloe Vera Gel (OG Aloe gel for me. Soothing and healing for skin, plus I use it every time I shampoo - I use the WOW one only if this is unavailable)\n\n+ Rahul Phate's lnnovations Hydra-smooth Hydrating Gel (contains urea.

It's more expensive that the Rahul Phate one, but on the pro side - it's vegan [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/sirkr3/review_of_fungalsafe_moisturiser_dr_sheths_aloe_1/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) \n\n+ Dr. Sheth’s Haldi & Hyaluronic Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer (contains \"haldi beads\")\n\n+ Dr. Sheth’s Hibiscus and Niacinamide Lotion (contains 5% niacinamide and allantoin, mentions lightweight but also contains occlusives like paraffin above the 5% niacinamide, so if ingredient order is reliable, this may be good for those with dryness)\n\n+ Dr. Sheth's Vitamin E & Ginseng Moisturizing Cream (contains light liquid paraffin as occlusive, so should help for drier skin)\n\n+ Earth Rhythm Sea Glow Gel\n\n+ Earth Rhythm Phyto Clear Oil-free Moisturiser (contains Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Extract) \n\n+ Earth Rhythm Depuff Undereye Gel (contains kojic acid,   botanical extracts)\n\n+ ONE THING Centella Soothing Cream ([my review here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/z72rrf/review_one_thing_centella_soothing_cream/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)]\n\n+ Zitmoist Gel (the [ingredients provided on the packaging](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/zitmoist-gel-50gm) are just 1% sodium hyaluronate and 0.3% allantoin, in an \"gel base containing aloe vera gel\" - incomplete list) \n\n+ e.l.f.

Yes. Do I appreciate that they clearly state when their products are malassezia safe? Also, yes 😂)\n\n+ It's Skin Aloe Relaxing Cream\n\n+ It's Skin Hyaluronic Acid Moisture Emulsion\n\n+ Aqualogica Glow+ Luminous Under Eye Gel (contains niacinamide, fragranced)\n\n+ CeraVe Healing Ointment (contains petrolatum, mineral oil, ceramides, hyaluronic acid and panthenol. Does also contain water, so I'd consider it a rich moisturizer rather than a balm/plain occlusive)\n\n+ Aveeno Daily Moisturizing  Body Lotion with SPF 15 (not the other variants, only the SPF 15 one)\n\n+ Nykaa SKINRX Ceramide Barrier Repair Deep Nourish Night Moisturizer For Oily Skin (contains ceramides 1, 2, 3, 4, 6II, cholesterol and oat extract)\n\n+ Nykaa SKINRX 5% Niacinamide Day Moisturiser with SPF 15 for Oily Skin (also contains alpha arbutin, ceramides 1, 2, 3, 4, 6II and cholesterol)\n\n+ Nykaa SKINRX Oil Free Vitamin C - Illuminate + Day Moisturizer with SPF 15 for Oily Skin (contains ethyl ascorbic acid)\n\n+ Nykaa SKINRX Hyaluronic Acid Hydra-X Night Moisturizer For Oily Skin (NOT the one of the same name for Dry Skin, that one contains olive oil)\n\n+ Truekind Daily Dew Hyaluronic & Squalane Water Crème \n\n+ Truekind Manjistha and Saffron Moisture Gel (contains botanicals, 1-2% niacinamide)\n\n+ Truekind Bio Exfoliant Brightening Sleeping Mask (contains botanicals, 1-2% niacinamide, less than 0.5% potassium azeloyl diglycinate)\n\n+ Truekind Acne Calming Herb Rescue Mask (gel mask with various botanical extracts - suggested use as sleeping mask/daytime moisturizer)\n\n+ Lakmé Sun Expert After Sun Cooling Gel\n\n+ Joy Hydra Refresh Ultra Light Gel (with glycerin, allantoin and D-panthenol.

People have asked me how I choose one, and having looked at the available brands on Amazon, I can say that the brands Sharrets, Carbamide Forte and Growfit appear to be C8+C10 only, so they're suitable. \n\nThe brands Laurin and Kayos, for example, also contain C12, which is lauric acid - NOT fungal-safe. The brand Simyl is available in chemists and very cheap, but it's meant to be a weight gain supplement for infants, and is not fungal-safe. That's about all there is to look out for when purchasing, the rest is trial, even for me ☺️\n\n+ Aiwo MCT C8 Oil (unfortunately the only C8 oil I can find, only available  in a 500ml bottle for around 2000 bucks)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil with Vitamin E (the original, plain one) - just mineral oil with vitamin E and added fragrance\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you want to be on the safe side, best to avoid mineral oil, liquid paraffin and Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather, even too much MCT oil, can lead to oil and heat building and cause flare-ups. Less is more, and if using mineral oil, a literal drop or two may be enough.\n\n+ Plain mineral oil/liquid paraffin - available at chemists. Not sure if it's less refined than the baby oil, but it's far cheaper (as it should be baby products are marked up like crazy) and has no fragrance\n\n+ Boroline/Boroline Night Repair Cream (waterless balm - same ingredients list, contains lanolin - not vegan - which may not suit some people's skin)\n\n+ Good old plain Vaseline \n\n+ Minimalist 100% Squalane (olive squalane, which works for some people with fungal issues and breaks some people out 🙃)\n\n+ Indulgeo Quench – 100% Sugarcane Squalane\n\n+ Indulgeo Squalane (70% olive, 30% sugarcane)\n\n+ PURITO Plainet Squalane Oil (sugarcane squalane, which is fungal-safe for sure. Will definitely be purchasing this myself, thank you u/imnumo!)\n\n+ The Ordinary 100% Plant-Derived Squalane [Edit: may be derived from different sources in different locations, will update if I find out details. From what I can find online, its derived from [sugarcane and beets](https://m.facebook.com/theordinary/photos/a.286843978083265/2326766210757688/?type=3)]\n\n+ Earth Rhythm Sugar squalane (ingredient list as 100% sugarcane derived)\n\n#🌤 Sunscreens \n\n+ Episoft AC moisturizer with microencapsulated sunscreen SPF 30 (water-based)\n\n+ Fixderma Shadow Spf 30+ PA+++ Gel (water based)\n\n+ Fixderma Shadow Sunscreen SPF 50+ PA+++ Gel (water based)\n\n+ Re'equil Ultra Matte Dry Touch Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA++++ (the blue one - silicone based) \n\n+ Brinton Healthcare UvDoux Face & Body Sunscreen gel with SPF 50 PA+++ (silicone based)\n\n+ IPCA Acne-UV Gel SPF 30 PA+++ (silicone based)\n\n+ IPCA Acne UV Gel SPF 50 PA+++ (silicone based)\n\n+ Missha All Around Safe Block Essence Sun Milk SPF50+/PA+++ - green (contains denatured alcohol as third ingredient, and various botanical extracts, water based)\n\n+ DermaCo 1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum SPF 50 PA++++ (has niacinamide - water based)\n\n+ DermaCo Hyaluronic Invisible Sunscreen Gel SPF50 PA+++ with Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E (silicone based)\n\n+ DermaCo Ultra Matte Sunscreen Gel SPF60 PA+++ (silicone based)\n\n+ Plum 2% Niacinamide & Rice Water SPF 50 PA+++ Hybrid Sunscreen (contains rice ferment filtrate.

    "body": "Hey everyone, \n\nI wanted to post about my experience on Tretinoin Gel 0.01% to hopefully help out some other skincare newbies like me! I've been a lurker on SCA for about 7 months and this is my first real post! Skip to the bottom for my routine.\n\n**Tips/Tricks for Tretinoin Use**\n\n1. Start with a low concentration - when I first started I was given 0.01% tretinoin gel. I asked for the gel because I know the cream has some comedogenic ingredients and my skin is very prone to clogging. First I was really worried because my dose was so low. This stuff is potent. Even at the lowest concentration (0.01%) my skin has improved a lot. Also, I didn't experience too much dryness or irritation and I was able to use the tretinoin every night.\n\n2. Start slow. The first week I used tretinoin every 2nd day and my skin reacted fine. The next week I went up to using it every night, as my doctor reacted. That being said, I take about one night off a week and my skin seems to like the break. Taking more than 1 night off a week doesn't seem to help for me. YMMV.\n\n3. Vaseline is your BEST FRIEND. It feels gross the first few times you slather your face in Vaseline at night but it is so worth it for how plump and soft your face feels the next morning. In order to help swelling of pimples during my purging, I mixed a TINY bit of tea tree oil into my vaseline. \n\n4. Try to find a routine that doesn't break you out BEFORE starting tretinoin. Once you start purging, it can be really tough to differentiate purging from a break out, so it's really helpful to be sure that your products aren't breaking you out. I switched rosehip oil brands during my purging state and the newer rosehip oil contained tocopheryl acetate which broke me out like crazy. It took almost a week for me to realize that it was the product breaking me out and not just purging.\n\n5. DO NOT PICK ON TRETINOIN. Seriously. I always found that pimples take much longer to go away if you don't extract them. Extraction seems to speed up the healing process. However this is NOT true on Tretinoin. Your skin is very fragile and pimples take much longer to disappear if you pick than if you just leave them. You also end up making a much bigger mess by picking because of how easily your skin will break.\n\n6. Your acne is severe enough. For years I never went to a doctor for my acne because I thought my acne was too mild. Thanks to SCA I asked my GP for Tretinoin. I really wish I had done this sooner.\n\n7. Purging is short (a few weeks to a few months). The better skin you will have at the end will last MUCH longer. It's worth it to push through the purge. :)\n\n**My Experience/Routine**\n\nMy skin type: Normal-Dry, Dehydrated, Clogs easily, Mild Acne\n\nWhen I first started tretinoin I looked everywhere for a timeline of how long it took it work. I'll post my timeline here to help everyone out. YMMV.\n\nWeek 1: My skin looked amazing. Pimples cleared up. I got super excited and thought maybe I would be lucky enough to skip purging. LOL.\n\nWeek 2: Started to see some mild purging. Closed comedones that were deep under the surface started to look larger as they came up to the surface. Skin was slightly red and sensitive.\n\nWeek 3: Purging got worse, especially on my cheeks (where I normally have the most pimples). More closed comedones surfaced. I was getting lots of dry skin coming off during OCM. Thankfully Vaseline prevented flaking skin. I was able to use makeup throughout the whole purge stage. A silicone-based moisturizer/primer helped makeup go on smoothly. It also got ridiculously cold where I live (-42 Celsius in Canada). The combination of purging and the extreme cold caused my skin to get a bit dry and red. Nothing too bad though.\n\nWeek 4: This is when the tocopherol acetate incident occured. Lots of new breakouts from this ingredient so hard to tell how severe my purging actually was.\n\nWeek 5: Started to see huge improvement! My cheeks cleared up a lot. I also noticed lots of improvements in skin texture (soft and smooth). \n\nWeek 6: Continuing to see improvement. I don't have any active pimples, my cheeks, nose and forehead look great. Deep closed comedones on my chin are just about to surface so I expect another small round of purging just on my chin.\n\n**My Routine**\n\nAM\n\n* Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Foaming Cleanser\n\n* Benton Snail Bee Essence\n\n* PureHeals Propolis Ampoule\n\n* The Face Shop Chia Seed Moisture Holding Cream\n\n* BB Cream and Makeup\n\nPM\n\n* OCM with pure mineral oil (In Canada at Loblaws you can buy Teddy's choice unscented mineral oil)\n\n* Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Foaming Cleanser\n\n* Wait 30 mins\n\n* Tretinoin 0.01% Gel\n\n* Wait 30 mins - 1 hr\n\n* Benton Snail Bee Essence\n\n* PureHeals Propolis Ampoule\n\n* The Face Shop Chia Seed Moisture Holding Cream\n\n* Vaseline (sometimes mixed with a tiny bit of TTO)",

My doctor gave me similar instructions to yours: every other night for 2 weeks, then switch to every night. I followed the instructions and had super flaky, red, hypersensitive skin for a while. I eventually scaled it back to about twice a week for a few months, then every other night once my moisture barrier had healed from that and other damage.

This was maybe 6 months ago and my face is a mess, I would say worse than it was before.  I'm in the situation as you described and I don't know whether I'm still purging (after 6 months) or it's my other products that I'm trying out.\n\nShould I drop the Tretinoin while I find the right routine for me?",

Cera Ve is not an occlusive, so Trent can still absorb into your skin, but the added moisture can w dryness.",

    "body": "Hello! After struggling for so long to find moisturizers for my extremely clog-prone skin that cannot handle fatty alcohols, I've created a list of moisturizers that are least likely to break out acne-prone skin out based on the lack of common pore-clogging ingredients and ingredients many want to stay away from just in case.\n\nProducts listed have NONE of the following ingredients:\n- cetearyl alcohol\n- cetyl alcohol\n- stearyl alcohol\n- myristyl alcohol\n- oleyl alcohol\n- cereareth-20\n- shea butter\n- mineral oil\n- petroleum\n- plant oils with comedogenic rating >1\n\nProducts are divided between fungal acne safe and unsafe. All products show whether or not they have silicones, too. \n\nNone of these products have ingredients with a comedogenic rating over 1, except some do contain tocopherol as the last or near last ingredient. The amount is so minimal that it's not likely to cause clogging. Still, *please note that comedogenic ratings are not the basis for how your skin will react!!!* Some of these products may break you out, just like some products with ingredients with higher comedogenic ratings may not break you out. Check all product ingredients before purchasing to check for your sensitivities!\n\nSo far, the list includes 57 moisturizers. If you know of any more or see a mistake I've made, please comment! I will update this list accordingly.\n\nThanks!\n\n[Link to spreadsheet is here!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dQy_YKHMEd8Nfhsr32wUMql6o4TuO9CnRNWyli8kLIA/edit?usp=sharing)\n",

    "body": "**EDIT: This is offered as an affordable alternative to a ramen diet for people on a ramen-level budget with ramen-level cooking skills and facilities, not as the One True Way that everyone should eat forever. I agree that there are healthier diets -- just not on $1/day.**\n\nThis is my basic recipe that I live off of when I need to spend as little on food as possible. It only costs ~$20/month more than living off cheap ramen but is WAY healthier.\n\nThis recipe is especially great for people without kitchen access because all you need is an electric rice cooker (~$20 new at Walmart, cheaper at thrift stores), a place to plug it in for 30-60 minutes, and a source of clean water. You do not even need a refrigerator because all the ingredients are shelf stable. You can cook once and eat from the pot all day because it takes a couple days to go bad at room temperature.\n\n\nCook in a rice cooker:\n\n- 1 cup rice\n\n- 1 cup lentils\n\n- 1/4 cup vegetable oil\n\n- ~5 1/2 cups water\n\n- Season with whatever you've got\n\n\nFurther instructions / tips:\n\nCost: My ~$1/day cost estimate is based on Walmart prices in the continental U.S. If you have access to an Indian grocery, you can probably save money by shopping there for rice and lentils. Indian groceries also offer a much wider variety of lentils, which they call \"dal.\" Be sure to calculate and compare per-unit prices (dollars per pound or ounce) to get the best deal.\n\nCalories: Use an online caloric needs calculator to estimate your personal daily caloric needs. Subtract calories from any other food sources (e.g. free food at work etc.). You can then adjust the basic recipe in ~350 calorie increments by adding or subtracting 1/2 cup rice and ~1 cup water. \n\nThe ~1,800 calories/day of the basic recipe meets my maintenance needs as a middle-aged woman with a desk job. When I've needed to lose weight, I halved the rice to drop down to ~1,450. If you have a physically-demanding job or otherwise get a lot of exercise then you will want to add rice to ensure sufficient energy to get you through your day.\n\nWater: Rice cookers and personal taste vary, so adjust the amount of water up or down each time you make it until you achieve the consistency (moist or dry) you prefer. \n\nFlavor: The basic recipe is very plain but this makes it a culinary blank canvas you can \"paint\" with different flavors each day for variety. So experiment with whatever you have on hand. I've used leftover sauces from other meals, fast food condiment packets, various spices and herbs, hot sauce, salsa, soy sauce, etc. Most tips for doctoring ramen should apply.\n\nUpgrades: If you can afford it, upgrade to brown rice for better nutrition and extra fiber (your poops will be amazing!). Upgrade from plain vegetable oil to other cooking oils (e.g. extra virgin olive oil etc.) to impart a different flavor. Experiment with different types of lentils/dal for variety.\n\nNutrition: This recipe is MACROnutritionally (carbs/protein/fat) balanced and the lentils/rice combo forms a complete protein, but it is not MICROnutritionally balanced. Here is the nutritional data for the basic recipe, to help you determine which nutrients you'll need to get elsewhere (click \"Total Nutrition Facts\" to get the summed values for the entire recipe):\nhttp://m.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+cup+uncooked+rice+1+cup+uncooked+lentils+1%2F4+cup+vegetable+oil\n\nA daily multivitamin/mineral will help but getting nutrients from food is best. So, whenever you can afford to spend a little more on food, you should add eggs (vitamin B12) and a wide variety of cheap in-season fruits and veggies for more complete nutrition. \n\nIf you are unable to buy/store/cook fresh foods, some good canned/jarred foods to supplement this with include sardines (vitamin B12, some calcium), tuna (vitamin D), sweet potatoes or spinach (vitamin A, some vitamin C), mandarin oranges or tomatoes (vitamin C), and sunflower seeds (vitamin E). Also, hard cheeses (calcium) don't necessarily have to be refrigerated to be safe to eat, they just get moldy faster at room temperature. \n\nI've spent several years tinkering around with a diet based on this basic recipe so please feel free to ask me any questions. Also, please share any ideas you may have for possible seasonings, upgrades, or modifications.\n\nI urge everyone to try my personal favorite variant of this recipe, which is a Lebanese dish called Mudajara. Upgrade to extra virgin olive oil and add carmelized onions, cumin, salt, and pepper. Mudajara is easily the highest deliciousness:cost dish I have ever eaten in my entire life!",

    "body": "I posted here before about large people (at the time I was 235) being able to ride large horses. Many people commented on his poor foot health. I am relatively new to horses and was relying on my farrier at the time to let me know what he needed and what was healthy or concerning, since he did not live on my property and I did not control his feed or hay. I took him to my trainer and my trainer said he was notably emaciated, like a 3 on the body score. I realized his body health was probably impacting his foot health. I spent a week fixing up a separate pasture for him (he doesn't live with the goats, even though he's a gentle giant he is a clumsy one) and brought him home ASAP. We are working through anxiety, he won't ride alone and I don't have other rideable horses, so we go for walks on foot. A lot. He's on a high quality grain, and a lot of it, plus vitamin E and is making very good progress with weight gain. I have a new farrier who specializes in drafts (and is also a dream with my problematic minis) and she's making an immediate difference in all 3 of my horses. \n\nAlso I lost another 20 lbs so I'm now 215 and have 18 lbs to go to a healthy bmi (because of my height) so there's even less weight on him. \n\nJust thought some of the concerned folks would like to know he's on the mend with 12lbs of grain a day (suggested by both the vet and the trainer) until we get him up to weight where we'll reassess his intake. He's much less anxious aside from the attempted rides where he flipped out and spun in circles until I dismounted. 🙄\n\nI don't have pictures of his feet, and the farrier is coming again this week so he's due (weather pushed it out) but he looks way better than previously, both in body score and hoof health. \n\nAlso he has equine friends here, a mini pony and a mini donkey, but they think he wants to kill them and he wants to play despite being late teens. So they're separated by fence line for now. ",

Like I mentioned the first time I commented, I know a lot of hoof care professionals have (understandably) strong feelings about working with drafts, so it's great you've got a specialist.

It can be really difficult to be told that you're mismanaging your horses and the health repercussions that mismanagement can have. It sounds like you're doing all the right things.\n\nThe only thing I would advise from your post is to take him off grain and put him on a ration balancer with alfalfa pellets. Supplement his calories with CoolStance Colpra and ground flaxseed or something along those lines. If his feet are in bad shape, then grain can make it worse, especially with a draft breed.

        "body": "Hi you! I am so glad you did these things <3 \n\nFellow draft rider and my girls definitely needed some rehab when I got them. These two things are resources I will never be without: \n\n1) You mentioned foot care. I love this book. LOVE it. I love it so much I bought one for my trainer, too. [The Essential Hoof Book](https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Hoof-Book-Diagnosis-Treatment/dp/1570767327/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.32FO_42EuoUPuTcVe3OhG_ZpfxiyLMfZGRnpOEsJtGQAQUSlRFh6JDWAFJEBZf2G1Ugepznao-Zk8K-tnXCgvM6TThIyh1aMASoAKCVplRlAy5vcpiMIvlknZngpp_VpYaadVssyO6O9hmYo6b8mNxhrfwCHYF31gSjtNiwX1bLyKCn4Dx1TiQ_FGv8V0BMcM3QhZuvCIiLOS5KPIj7Ohm-LYOEwa0WmaF6DFpeOzwgbCX1MjM13LwL54VfdCY1dPT2OdvX9JKm03jBZJjp4CA2lpx9pJWq93hi8q0CQGag.4mkG3quXRJ0O8WVi8otsANQGGNCEXdUiFA1t3BEZ3gk&dib_tag=se&gad_source=1&hvadid=694461107252&hvdev=c&hvexpln=67&hvlocphy=9015837&hvnetw=g&hvocijid=10403898623486966075--&hvqmt=e&hvrand=10403898623486966075&hvtargid=kwd-333836027665&hydadcr=22563_13493224&keywords=the+essential+hoof+book&qid=1724000633&sr=8-1). It breaks down hoof anatomy, care, and health in a way that you do not have to be a farrier to understand, but does make it a hell of a lot easier to understand what your farrier is talking about. I have been known to break it out with my farrier and have him show me exactly what he's talking about or highlight words that he wants me to go back and study. It's worth every penny of the $19 for the Kindle and $25 for the hardcover, both of which I have. \n\n2) Madbarn's diet evaluation. [https://madbarn.com/analyze-diet/](https://madbarn.com/analyze-diet/) The thing I love about MB is that they don't push you to one feed or another like doing this on the Tribute or whatever website. They give you the science breakdown of the nutrition you're giving, and help you formulate a feed plan to meet your needs, and do it in ways that help you understand *why* you are doing what you are doing. AND it's free. While they do sell various supplements, they never push you towards their own products. If you do this, ask in the notes for this to go to Sophie Stratton. My girls are seniors with dental issues and some other health concerns. She's worked with us to get my girls up to health in such a way that she's considered part of my care team in the same way that my chiro, dental, trainer, vet, and farrier are. I am sure all of their nutritionists are great, but she has a masters degree in equine nutrition and really just gets it. Do prepared to actually give them the information to work with, pictures of your horse, and be really honest about what's going on. She won't judge you. \n\nKeep sharing the pictures as you progress! <3 \n\n#",

It can be in hay or pellet form, whichever is most economical and convenient for you.\n\nMy concern with the 12lbs/day grain without added forage or alfalfa would be ulcers. Particularly if the grain is high in sugars/carbs. Alfalfa helps buffer stomach acid from that much grain. Horses are incredibly prone to ulcers and if he has them or develops them it will make getting weight on him doubly hard (in addition to causing him a lot of pain).\n\nHave you had his teeth checked?\n\nGood on you for getting him on a regular trim schedule!

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

I sure hope people are buying it so it doesn't get discontinued. I got it for maybe 6000 KRW for the 50 ml tube and it's such a nice moisturizing vehicle with Tinosorb S and Uvinul A Plus. So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

    "body": "So, I'd be lying if I said I didn't deal with depression a little bit most days, and anxiety most days. But I've been throwing myself fully into exercise and lifestyle changes to claw back as much control of my brain as I can, and now my energy levels are better than they have been since I was a teenager. I haven't had coffee in months.\n\nExercise\n\n-Get a step counter and walk at least 8k steps a day. Try for 10k. this seriously does so much. If you live in a place with bad weather or walking infrastructure, get a walking pad.\n\n-lift weights. Legs, chest, back, arms. I have a spare room where I stuck a cheap craigslist weight bench and about 200 bucks of barbells and dumbbells. Sure, getting a gym membership is more practical for some people, but for me I know I will work out more with a set at home. It's a nice feeling when I stick some protein in the oven and can just pump out a few sets by the time my food is ready.\n\n-hike/spend time in nature. Aromatic turpentines in forests are shown to have massive positive benefits on emotional regulation.\n\nDiet/lifestyle\n\n-cut out alch, nictotine, weed, processed foods, soda, processed sugar as much as you can. For me, weed was fucking up my mental state, memory, and sleep cycle. I feel way more energy and mental clarity without it. And i can breathe easier without smoking. It's maybe made more of a difference for me than anything.\n\n-focus your diet around getting as wide of a range of micronutrients as possible. Vitamin A (carrots/squash), Vitamin Bs (too much to go into for me rn) Vitamin C (citrus or lots of other fruit), Vitamin E (nuts), Vitamin K (lots of vegetables). Foods like kale are great bc they knock out a lot of your vitamin needs at once (it has A, C, and K I believe).\n\n-avoid plastic if possible. Don't drink out of cans and plastic bottles, don't eat canned food (plastic apoxy). Ironically frozen vegetables in plastic packagaing often have less plastic in them than canned food.\n\n  \n-spoonful of ginger and spoonful of chia every day\n\n-incorporate antioxidant rich superfoods whenever possible. I especially recommend purple (skin and flesh) Japanese sweet potatoes, blueberries, kale, avocado. Moringa is the healthiest plant I know of (and I am a horticulturalist by training), you might find it at a farmer's market but i buy it dried and drink it as tea.\n\n-if you eat meat, supplement protein needs with plant protein like chickpeas.\n\n-if you are going to eat processed foods, there is a big difference between pasta/bread/hummus vs. twinkees/hohos/etc\n\nSupplements\n\n-magensium glycinate for sleep\n\n-b12\n\n-d3 (maybe take half doses if you get decent amounts of sun, I tested a little high last time I did bloodwork)\n\nSleep\n\n-find the gentlest lighting possible\n\n-wear blue light glasses as much as possible\n\n-get an essential oil diffuser with tree oils to lower your heartrate\n\n-exercise will make things much easier\n\n-air purifier\n\n-black out curtains\n\nSkincare\n\n-sunscreen every day. avoid it out of plastic if possible bc plastic is not good for your skin\n\n-wear a hat outside\n\n-I make an aloe vera gel harvested from the plant and mix with green tea/moringa/Macha. Then i take the leftover stalks, soak them in warm water and pour it over my head in the bath. Did away with my dandruff overnight.\n\n-ricewater, for skin and hair\n\n-retinol\n\nHair\n\n-gugo bark shampoo if you can get it is said to fight hair loss\n\n-rosemary oil encourages hair growth\n\n-rice water\n\n-I wash my hair with squash water (yes, water I boiled squash in) before shampooing with gugo bark shampoo. Vitamin A contains retinol. After I did that my girlfriend said my hair had never looked shinier.\n\nTea\n\n-for caffeine I go with green tea or yerba mate\n\n-non caffeine mix (which I add to the green tea/yerb sometimes as well) is moringa, nettle, and stevia leaf\n\n-if you have a sweet tooth, stevia leaf can be a great sugar replacement.\n\nlmk what you think or if you think of anything",
