    "body": "EDIT: I didn’t realize how large a conversational piece this would become. I learned a few things from others about silicone sensitivities and that some people don’t have to deal with them. Not only do i need to start checking my sunscreens but allll topical products! shampoo, conditioner, face masks, sheet masks, setting mists etc. i would LOVE to hear from you if you see results from omitting cyclopentasiloxane. feel free to dm me! i’m not new to skincare but i’m new to having clear skin. \n—\n\nHi! i’ve posted before a few months ago but i wanted to share. if you started developing painful cystic acne, check the ingredients of the products you’re using. i discovered that i have a bad reaction to the ingredient cyclopentasiloxane that causes cystic acne near my mouth and jawline. i got rid of all my products that had it (foundations, primers, lotions) and my skin cleared right up in two weeks. (i had clearish skin to start before these breakouts but started using new makeup products).\n\nrecently with it being hot out and i like running in the mornings, i decided to get a face sunscreen to help protect my skin. i started getting cystic acne again slowly over the course of two weeks. i figured out that the sunscreen i bought had cyclopentasiloxane (the missha pink bottle). the crazy thing is that i checked the missha green bottle’s ingredients and it didn’t have cyclopentasiloxane in it, i opted for the pink bottle just bc of the price and didnt check.\n\nanyways, i wanted to post that even though we may have our routine down, sometimes we forget to check ingredients and sometimes it’s sneaky. you might not have the same issue as me but if this one ingredient is keeping you from clear skin like it did for me, try omitting it for two weeks.\n\ni found that TO azelaic acid helped manage the flare ups and redness and vitamin c helped with the scars as my skin got back to its clearish state.

It could have been a combo of other ingredients that broke you out.",

Yes, for most people, this ingredient won’t be a problem, but for the unfortunate few, it causes horrible cysts! I don’t subscribe to green beauty philosophy and have no problem with the safety of silicones, but I am tired of this ingredient’s cyst-causing potential being invalidated because COSDNA says it’s not acne-triggering. I did a lengthy ingredient exclusion trial and found that when I excluded cyclopentasiloxane, I stopped getting cysts. I shared this information with my mother, she stopped using products with cyclopentasiloxane, and she stopped getting cysts.",

Over the last 5 days it went from terrible to meh to ok. Thankfully I'm not going out and my laptop camera quality isn't good enough to show the gunk on my chin!\n\nI stopped using the ordinary sunscreen yesterday and switched to Aveeno's sunscreen SPF 45 - surprisingly not a visible white cast and I love the smell. Personally a big fan of their products and it was on sales at Shoppers!\n\nI'll try to update this in a week to let you know if it was the suncreen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT after 16 days: so it seems like it was the culprit! my skin has cleared up but i do think some of it is because of Effaclar Duo | Acne Spot Treatment | La Roche-Posay too!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthanks so much for your psa!! really saved my skin from more heartache",

I’m just going to go back to using curology since my skin responded well to their 8% azelaic formula (but my skin got worse when I went up to 10% azelaic which had an increased silicone texture which makes me think silicone is the problem). For a while I was trying to replace curology by finding my own products and I have had really bad luck because my skin hates so many things which through trial and error I’ve discovered include tea tree oil, salicylic acid, and probably silicones... thanks for your post!",

If I've missed any brands out or included any products I shouldn't have please let me know and I'd love to hear reviews if you've tried any. (Also this is my first post, I hope the formatting is okay, please be kind, thanks)\n\nNote: the criteria for inclusion here are no nano zinc oxide or nano titanium dioxide, and no oxybenzone, octinoxate, octocrylene, PABA, enzacamene, octisalate, homosalate or avobenzone. And I've tried to mention if a sunscreen contains silicones as these may potentially be a problem for marine life. As with everything, we each have to weigh up a variety of concerns, and I'm not trying to suggest that there's no point in using sunscreens containing silicones, just as I'm not trying to tell anyone that they should feel guilty if they can't use reef-safe sunscreens for any reason.\n\nHere are the brands I've looked at so far:  \n- **[Alba Botanica](https://www.albabotanica.com/en/products/#/category=body&sub-category=sun-protection&worry=all)** (mineral formulations only, SPF 45, 7% TiO2, 9% ZnO, $2.24/oz at Whole Foods, also available at Walmart, some locations in store, otherwise online)  \n- **[All Good Products](https://allgoodproducts.com/)** (SPF 50, 25% ZnO, $9.99/oz, SPF 30, 12% ZnO, $3.66/oz, can currently get 30% off with code ALLGOODMAMA)  \n- **[Attitude Living](https://www.attitudeliving.com/Sun-Care-s/2023.htm)** (SPF 30, 20% ZnO, $4.80/oz, $10 off first order via referral link)  \n- **[Australian Gold Botanical](https://www.target.com/s?searchTerm=australian+gold+botanical)** *(available at a Target and Ulta, contains silicones)*  \n- **[Babo Botanicals](https://www.babobotanicals.com/)** (SPF 30, 19% ZnO, $6.70/oz, use NEWS25 for 20% off or $10 off $10+ orders w code HAPPYMOM10)  \n- **[Badger Balm](https://www.badgerbalm.com/c-24-natural-sunscreen.aspx)** (SPF 35, 22% ZnO, $4.34/oz, promo code with newsletter signup)  \n- [Bare Republic](https://www.gobareoutside.com/) some formulations are non-nano - includes all baby and spray products.

It also has ceramides and hyaluronic acid but no petrolatum.\n\n[**Cerave AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/am-facial-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a small pump bottle and has a thick, creamy (slightly greasy) texture. It is SPF 30 and contains the following active suncare ingredients: Homosalate (12% - for UVB protection), Octinoxate (7.5% - for UVB protection), Octocrylene (2% - for UVB protection), Zinc Oxide (3.5% - for UVA protection). It also contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/pm-facial-moisturizing-lotion) (my fave) comes in a small pump bottle and is a silky/gel texture. It contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and places more focus on chemical exfoliation. Notable ingredients are mineral oil, ammonium lactate (similar to lactic acid), salicyclic acid, ceramides and a lower concentration of hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-cream) comes in a tub and is a thicker version of the SA lotion and contains similar ingredients with the addition of niacinamide.\n\n[**Cerave Skin Renewing Night Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/skin-renewing-night-cream) comes in a tub and contains shea butter, ceramides, niacinamide, peptides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and contains niacinamide, ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and allantoin (an anti-irritant derived from urea). \n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-cream) comes in a tub and contains glycerin, petrolatum, ceramides and hyaluronic acid. No niacinamide or allantoin in this one.\n\n**Notable Ingredient Overview**\n\n**Ceramides**: Naturally occurring, long chains of skin lipids (fats) that are major structural components of the skin’s outer layers. Skin as a barrier system inhibits water movement via its extracellular matrix, which has a unique composition of 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% free fatty acids. Together, these lipids form what researchers refer to as \"crystalline lamellar structures\". Ceramides are necessary for the skin’s water-retention capacity as well as for barrier repair and cell regulation. Adding ceramides to skin-care products can help to restore the skin’s barrier system.\n\n**Hyaluronic acid**: Component of skin tissue that is used in skin-care products as a good skin-identical ingredient. Hyaluronic acid can boost skin's moisture content, reduce inflammation, have cell-communicating abilities, and help prevent moisture loss.\n\n**Niacinamide**: Also known as vitamin B3 and nicotinic acid, niacinamide is a potent cell-communicating ingredient that offers multiple benefits for aging skin. Assuming skin is being protected from sun exposure, niacinamide can improve skin's elasticity, dramatically enhance its barrier function, help erase discolorations, and revive skin's healthy tone and texture.\n\n**Ammonium Lactate:** Ammonium lactate is a mix of lactic acid and ammonium hydroxide. It is used as a skin moisturizer lotion to treat dry, scaly, itchy skin. Those who are using it should avoid exposure to sunlight or artificial UV rays, such as sunlamps or tanning beds. Ammonium lactate makes skin more sensitive to sunlight. Skin is more likely to sunburn. Use sunblock and wear clothes when exposed to sunlight.\n\n**Salicylic acid**: Referred to as beta hydroxy acid (BHA), it is a multifunctional ingredient that addresses many of the systemic causes of blemishes. For decades dermatologists have been prescribing salicylic acid as an exceedingly effective keratolytic (exfoliant), but it also is an anti-irritant This is because salicylic acid is a derivative of aspirin (both are salicylates—aspirin’s technical name is acetylsalicylic acid), and so it also functions as an anti-inflammatory.\n\n**Shea butter**: A plant lipid extracted from the karite tree that is used as an emollient in cosmetics.

I was chatting over at the /r/beautyguruchatter Discord when NoSpelledWithAK said that she thought that the formula was changed and that no one said anything.

Probably the one everyone is going to latch onto is that Subculture shadows are based on talc, whereas MR shadows are based on mica, but it looks like the entire formula got changed between the two palettes. This likely explains why people are having problems with Subculture not blending in as well as MR, as well as some major kickback issues.\n\nInterestingly enough, the ingredients for MR aren't [listed on the ABH website](http://www.anastasiabeverlyhills.com/modern-renaissance-palette/ABH01-18170.html). I wonder why.",

So, from that standpoint, this switch is ethical. But, you know, the brand wasn't sitting there making this decision because of ethical mica concerns.  \n\nI guess what I'm saying is that ABH could have announced this and made it a good thing. If they partnered up with a children's rights org, and put out this palette as a first step toward using less mica. There was a way to have spun it.  \n\nBut even if they had spun it and we were sitting on this website gushing over how ABH supports human rights, the reality is that they did this to make their shadows cheaper. Lower quality. And that's a bummer. I definitely have been channeling my inner Kimberly Clark on this one. Don't need it, not gonna buy it.",

I personally would go for the Be Plain when it's available because it has a simplified formula without the unnecessary plant extracts and flower oils. I think the Be Plain one would be better for oily skin than the Round Lab one. Both of the Hyggee sunscreens look promising, but I'm gravitating towards the Vegan Sun Cream because it is a chemical sunscreen and I have a tan complexion, I don't want to risk a white cast. However, the Real Sun Cream does have an interesting ingredient list and whipped texture (as I can see on Yesstyle)  and I will be looking out for reviews to see whether it leaves a white cast or not and make my decision accordingly. What I love about the Hyggee sunscreens is that they are fragrance/essential oil free, but they still contain alcohol. I prefer alcohol because it allows the sunscreen to set better and be less tacky. If you have oily skin, I would think that one of the Hyggee sunscreens would work better for you because I have a Kolmar sunscreen (Isntree Watery Sun Gel) that is similar to the new Round Lab and Be Plain sunscreens and I definitely wouldn't recommend it for oily skin as it is way too shiny.\n\nEdit: I just noticed that the Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream has beet root extract, which made me think of the Krave Beet Shield. Get this, the Beet Shield was also made in Cosmax, same as this new Hyggee one. So I did some digging and found out that the Beet Shield has the SAME exact 5 filters as this new Hyggee sunscreens in the same order. The rest of ingredients are not too similar though, so I do not think they are the same exact sunscreen, as opposed to how I feel about the Be Plain and Round Lab sunscreens, which I do think are almost identical. I do think this Vegan Sun Cream is inspired by the Beet Shield, with maybe an improved formula, since the Beet Shield did not pass SPF tests. So if you are looking for a replacement of the Krave Beauty Beet Shield but with verified SPF protection, get the new Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream!",

Anyway, Biore claims that these products stay on evenly in severely hot and humid weather. This gets me very excited as I live in a very hot and humid area (75% - 85% and 30°C to 37°C during day time) so I would like to test this ~~or these~~ as soon as I get my hands on them. Will be sold from 9th February 2019 in-store with limited availability on Japanese online stores at an earlier date priced at [1944 JPY RRP](https://www.amazon.co.jp/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?__mk_ja_JP=カタカナ&url=search-alias%3Dbeauty&field-keywords=ビオレ+UV+アスリズム+スキンプロテクト). ~~internal cries and gasp~~ but to be fair it has more grammes. \n\n**Ingredients**:\n\n~~Again, hasn't been released but mentioned:~~\n\n* ~~Hyaluronic Acid, Royal Jelly extract, and Butelyne Glycol (moisturising ingredients).~~\n* ~~White floral scent (made from natural fragrances), Citrus, Musky Wood.~~\n\nEssence: \n\nWater, ethanol, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, ethylhexyl triazone, isopropyl palmitate, (lauryl methacrylate / sodium methacrylate) cross-polymer, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate (Uvinul A Plus), hydrogenated polyisobutene, sodium acrylates copolymer, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine (Tinosorb S), dextrin palmitate, BG, (acrylates / C10-30 alkyl acrylate) crosspolymer, alkyl benzoate (C12-15), glycerin, propanediol, potassium hydroxide, glyceryl behenate, hydroxyethylcellulose, (vinyl dimethicone / methicone silsesquioxane) crosspolymer,  pullulan,  cetyl alcohol , sorbitan distearate, stearoyl glutamic acid, arginine, EDTA-2Na,BHT, royal jelly extract, sodium hyaluronic acid, phenoxyethanol, fragrance.\n\nMilk: \n\nCyclopentasiloxane, zinc oxide, ethanol, water, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, (lauryl methacrylate / sodium methacrylate) cross-polymer, dimethicone, hydrogenated polyisobutene, isopropyl palmitate, talc, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate (Uvinul A Plus), titanium oxide, alkyl (C30-45) dimethylsilyl polypropylsilsesquioxane, polymethylsilsesquioxane, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine (Tinosorb S), Butelyne Glycol, PEG-12 dimethicone, triethoxycaprilsilane, PEG-3 dimethicone, Aluminium hydroxide, stearic acid, methicone, BHT, royal jelly extract, sodium hyaluronate, phenoxyethanol, fragrance.\n\n**So, what are their claims?**\n\n* **Unique durable \"Tough Boost\" technology:**\n   * Supposedly stays on skin even during hot and humid conditions of 40°C and 75% humidity even when skin perspires or sweats.\n   * Super waterproof which lasts 80 minutes through water resistance tests but easily cleansed.\n   * Usable as a makeup base (so...white cast? primer?)\n* **Two versions**:\n   * Water-based essence (70 g): fresh and moist feeling that leaves the skin with a smooth sensation.\n   * Oil-based milk (65 ml): silky touch that glides on the skin with a light-weight sensation, no stickiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ii2mnvhve8621.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=3215d1e3ed7e8e9b5eabc5a3b78bcdbe9f3553f6\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that Biore UV SaraSara Line (so, Perfect Milk, Bright Milk, Face Milk and Spray) is repackaged but no reformulation. Only the cardboard packagings seem to change to my eyes.\n\n[Here if you want to see the complete list of Biore UV lines (in Japanese).](https://www.kao.co.jp/bioreuv/itemcheck/) On the table there are star ratings. The first one is its suitability for children and the second is how well it interacts with makeup (whether makeup slip or not).",

    "body": "Hi! Panibagong sunscreen na naman ang irereview ko ngayon. Itong Ecran De Luxe Silicone Sunscreen Gel na ito ay pino-promote nung brand owner bilang isang mineral sunscreen. Pero mineral ba talaga? Alamin natin yan sa review na ito. \n\nBilang panimula, binili ko itong sunscreen na ito sa Tiktok, sa halagang 574 pesos. Mas mahal ito sa ibang local sunscreens na naglipana ngayon sa Tiktok. Malalaman nyo kung bakit kapag tumungo na tayo sa ingredient list nitong sunscreen na ito. \n\nSimulan ko muna sa user experience. Kung ikaw ay gumagamit ng makeup primer, lalo na yung silicone-based, yun ang unang mong maiisip kapag ginamit mo tong product na ito. Sa skin feel pa lang, ramdam dito yung silicone elastomer na ginamit, na madalas ding ginagamit sa mga silicone-based na makeup primers. Kulay dilaw yung sunscreen at may kalakasan yung floral powdery fragrance. Kung nakaka experience ka ng adverse reaction sa fragrance,  gamit ka na lang ng ibang sunscreen. May tatlong oras din ang itinagal nung fragrance nitong sunscreen sa mukha ko bago mawala yung amoy. Sa kabilang banda, wala naman akong na-experience na white cast habang inaapply ko ito sa mukha ko. Nagustuhan ko yung lapat nito sa balat ko, since matte ang finish nito at hindi nangintab ang mukha ko sa sunscreen na to. \n\nNgayon tumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list. Eto ang ingredients ng sunscreen na ito:\n\nEthylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Avobenzone, Zinc Oxide, Belsil EG2 (Cyclopentasiloxane and Dimethicone), Belsil EG5 (Cyclopentasiloxane and Dimethicone), Perfume\n\nSuriin natin ang mga UV Filters na ginamit:\n\n* Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (OMC) : UVB Filter\n\n* Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (DHHB; Uvinul A Plus; Parasol DHHB) : UVA Filter\n\n* Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (BEMT; Tinosorb S; Parsol Shield) : UVA/UVB Filter\n\n* Ethylhexyl Triazine (EHT; Uvinul T-150; Parsol EHT) : UVB Filter\n\n* Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane (Avobenzone): UVA Filter\n\n* Zinc Oxide: UVA/UVB Filter\n\nSa UV Filter pa lang, natuwa na sana ako dito, kasi halos puro new generation UV filter ang ginamit, a first for a local sunscreen. Balanse ang mix ng UVA and UVB filters. Kung ganyan nga ang UV filters na ginamit, hindi malayong pumalo ng SPF 50 or higher ito e. \n\nMaliban sa mga UV filters na ginamit, andito din ang pet peeve ko sa mga local cosmetic products: ang hindi maayos at compliant na ingredient list. Una na dito e yung Avobenzone. Ang correct INCI name nyan ay Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane. Next, hindi nilalagay ang trade name ng ingredient na ginamit sa product. INCI Name ang inilalagay. So yung Belsil EG2 at Belsil EG5 ay hindi dapat nakasulat jan, kundi yung INCI name ng ingredients na yan. \n\nAt tutal nasa Belsil EG2 at Belsil EG5 tayo, mali yung mga nasa parenthesis na katabi nyang dalawang trade names na yan. Ang INCI name ng Belsil EG2 at Belsil EG5 ay Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer. And yes, iisa ang INCI Name nyang dalawang yan, pero magkaibang grade, meaning magkaiba ang performance nyang 2 ingredient na iyan. Nabanggit ko kanina na parang silicone-based makeup primer yung skin feel nitong sunscreen na ito. Dahil yan sa Belsil EG2 at Belsil EG5 na silicone elastomer. Yan yung nagbibigay ng silky, pero non-greasy na skin feel, at matte finish. \n\nAng isa ko pang napansin sa ingredient list ng product na ito, bakit ang pinaka unang ingredient ay Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate? Tandaan na ang maximum allowed % ng  OMC, DHHB, at BEMT ay 10% lang. Imbes na yang tatlong UV filter ang nasa unahan ng IL, dapat yung ingredient na nagsisilbing solvent  o diluent ang nasa pinakaunahan dapat. Na sa tingin ko e yung Belsil EG2 at Belsil EG5.Tingin ko talaga mali ang arrangement ng mga ingredients na ito sa ingredient list e. \n\nTumungo naman tayo sa product claims nitong sunscreen na ito:\n\n* SPF 30 PA++++\n\n* Non greasy No white cast\n\n* Non-comedogenic matte finish\n\n* Water resistant\n\n* Broad spectrum ultra protection\n\nSa claim nito na SPF 30 PA++++, may pinakita sa product listing nito sa Tiktok nung signed na SPF test report, na tumutugma sa claim na ito. Makikita din sa report na ito na may Critical wavelength ito na 376.07 nm. Para makapagclaim ng broad spectrum, kinakailangan na magkaroon ang isang sunscreen ng critical wavelength na 370 nm o higit pa. Dahil higit sa 370 nm ang critical wavelength ng sunscreen na ito kaya ito nakapag claim ng broad spectrum protection. \n\nSa claim naman nito na non greasy at no white cast, wala akong issue dito, since wala akong naramdaman na greasiness at wala ding white cast nung ginamit ko ito. \n\nSa claim na non-comedogenic, sana na nag-conduct ng in-vivo comedogenicity test sa tao itong brand para sana mapangatawanan nila itong claim na ito. Same sa claim nito na water resistant, dapat nag-conduct ang brand ng water resistance test para may substantiation sila para sa claim na ito, at para malaman na din kung up to ilang minutes ito water resistant (40 o 80 mins.). Sa claim na matte finish, yes matte ang finish nito base sa kinalabasan ng balat ko pagkatapos mag-apply nito. \n\nNgayon, may isa pang claim itong sunscreen na ito na hindi mababasa sa product label. Base sa mga nakita ko sa Tiktok, naka-position itong sunscreen na ito as a mineral sunscreen. Gumawa pa nga ng Tiktok video ang brand owner tungkol dito dahil may isang user na nagtanong kung bakit kine-claim ng brand na mineral sunscreen ito gayong may kahalo itong chemical UV filters (naka pin ito sa kanyang account). Maari n'yo itong panuorin dito:\n\nhttps://vt.tiktok.com/ZSrTMFqCD/\n\nNapanuod mo na ang video? Tara himayin natin yung mga binanggit ng brand owner\nsa video. \n\nReason #1: \n\nSabi ng R&D team na nagdevelop ng sunscreen na ito for the brand owner, predominantly na mineral sunscreen daw ito. Naglagay lang daw sila ng minute proportions ng chemical UV filters to make the formulation stable. Sa klima daw kasi sa Pilipinas, mahirap daw magkaroon ng stable na gel sunscreen kagaya nitong product na ito. At dahil sa FDA guidelines, kaya nila isinulat sa IL yung mga chemical UV filters, kahit na close to zero lang daw yung ginamit nila. \n\nIsang malaking kalokohan itong tugon na ito nung R&D sa brand owner. Kung close to zero ang ginamit na chemical UV filter, anong ginagawa nung tatlong chemical UV filter (OMC, DHHB, BEMT) sa pinakaunahan ng IL? Ibig sabihin ba nito, since close to zero ang ginamit na chemical UV filters, in increasing order ang ginawa nyong paglilista ng ingredient list? Taliwas yata ito sa ASEAN Cosmetic Labeling Guideline na sinusunod dito sa Pilipinas ng mga cosmetic manufacturers at traders na IN DECREASING ORDER  ang paglilista ng ingredients sa IL.\n\nIkalawa,, kesehodang inilagay ang mga chemical UV filters na yan para i-stabilize ang formulation, magfa-function pa din yan as UV filters. Kapag tinamaan yang mga yan ng UV rays, kesehodang 10% o 0.1% ang inilagay jan, mag-aabsorb pa din yan ng UV rays. \n\nAt ikatlo, kung talagang close to zero yang mga ginamit na chemical UV filters sa product na yan, bakit madilaw yung sunscreen? Sa lahat ng ingredients nitong sunscreen, ang madilaw lang jan yung BEMT. Ang BEMT ay nag-eexist as yellow powder, tulad ng nakikita nyo sa pic sa itaas. Kapag ginamit itong UV filter na ito sa significant levels, nagiging madilaw yung finished product. Sa dilaw ng sunscreen na ito, malabong near zero ang usage rate ng UV filter na ito. \n\nReason #2:\n\nMineral sunscreen daw itong product na ito kasi gumamit daw ito ng Advanced Encapsulation Technology para daw mapigil ang absorption ng chemical UV filters sa ating balat para hindi daw magwork as UV filters ung mga chemical UV filters. Na pinapanatili daw ng Advanced Encapsulation Technology yung sunscreen sa ibabaw lamang ng balat. \n\nIsa na namang malaking kalokohan ito. Kesehodang naka encapsulate ang chemical UV filters o hindi, mag-aabsorb at mag-aabsorb yan ng UV, dahil yan ang idinidikta ng chemistry ng mga chemical compounds na iyan. And yes, yang mga new generation UV filters, dahil sa kanilang malaking molecular weight, hindi talaga yan mag absorb sa balat, dahil mas mataas ang molecular weight, mas mahaba ang penetration sa balat. \n\nReason #3:\n\nAng main UV filter daw na ginamit sa product na ito ay Zinc Oxide. Ito daw yung nagba-block nung UVA at UVB rays sa product na ito. Itong Zinc Oxide daw ang pinakanagtatrabaho sa product na ito para protektahan ang balat laban sa UVA at UVB. \n\nKung Zinc Oxide ang main UV filter ng sunscreen na ito, bakit hindi nito yung nasa pinakaunahan? Bakit nasa bandang gitna lang? E kung sinasabi na lang nila na HYBRID SUNSCREEN itong product na ito, e di mas ok pa sana. Wala namang masama kung hybrid sunscreen ito, kasi totoo naman. Pag pinagsama ang mineral at chemical UV filters sa isang sunscreen, antemano Hybrid Sunscreen talaga yan. Wag na kasing ipilit na mineral, wala namang masama kung hindi mineral sunscreen yang product nyo e. \n\nFinal Words:\n\nMaganda sana itong sunscreen na ito e. Kauna unahang silicone gel na sunscreen. Ang gaganda pa ng UV filters na ginamit, karamihan new generation pa. Maganda din ang performance during use, hindi greasy, walang white cast, medyo matapang lang ang fragrance. \n\nPero as usual, may red flags ang product na ito. Yung mga sablay sa ingredient list. Formulated in the USA daw, pero di marunong gumawa ng IL na compliant. Yung pag-claim ng water resistant at non-comedogenic, kahit hindi naman nag-conduct ng test. \n\nPero yung claim na mineral sunscreen daw kahit kita naman sa ingredient list na hindi, ang pinakamalaking red flag. Lalong lalo na yung mga binanggit na reasons dun sa video nung brand owner. May pagbanggit banggit pa ng advanced encapsulation technology, as if naman may bilang yan sa usapan kung mineral sunscreen ba yung product o hindi. \n\nAyun lang. Tulad ng lagi kong sinasabi, maging mapanuri sa mga binibili at ginagamit nyong produkto. Maraming salamat sa pagbabasa.",

    "body": "**Hwahae:** It's a review/ranking app for Koreans for beauty-related things. This list is for people who can't read Korean/don't use the app.\n\n***SORRY THIS TOOK SO LONG. It took much longer than other lists because of all the info I had to gather. That and me rage quitting for a while after computer decided to delete all the ingredient lists I typed out.  :I***\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**General Info (That I got questions about):**\n\n*The reason I typed out some of the ingredient lists is bc I can't find the list in English online that I can easily copy and paste, or the ingredients aren't up to date.*\n\n*I bolded some ingredients that are helpful for skin/skin-identical for healthy skin barrier.*\n\n*The dollar cost is the converted retail price of what it would cost in Korea, without sale/promo.*\n\n*I also looked up all the common plant names from their scientific names because it annoys me when I look at ingredients and I have no idea what that plant is..*\n\n***PEG -*** *something* *means something has been altered or made to be water soluble. It is useful for that but some people avoid it due to microplastics (I don't know a whole lot about it, but have heard people say this).*\n\n[***You don't need to be SUPER DUPER concerned about visible light/blue light protection***](https://labmuffin.com/blue-light-computers-phones-damage-skin/) ***and whatnot, even though some of these products claim to protect against them.***\n\n***TINTED sunscreens are lightly tinted usually in beige or peach color. Peachy shades cancel dark/brown-ish tones (like dark spots, dark undereyes), making skin appear brighter/more awake than normal.***\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**FOR SENSITIVE SKINNED FOLKS ONLY:**\n\n*There is* ***fragrance*** *in the form of natural* ***essential oils*** *and synthetic oils in some of these products. Contrary to popular belief,* **synthetic** ***fragrance*** *isn't worse than essential oils as they can be modified to have less skin-sensitizing components.*\n\n*While fragrance can be* ***perfectly fine*** *for some if you have* ***healthy skin*** *and don't mind the actual smell,* **VERY** ***sensitive*** *skin types may want to* ***avoid it*** *as we don't know exactly what it's made up of. There's another camp that says* ***long term exposure*** *fragrance/essential oils on healthy skin can make it more likely for your skin to* ***develop*** *problems/sensitivity later on. As always,* ***YMMV.***\n\n*Many of these companies* ***claim*** *that their product is the* ***gentlest*** *for the most sensitive skin because of EWG (Environmental Working Group) rating of 1, but* ***EWG is NOT a reliable source, especially for sensitive skinned folks***\\*\\*, *as they can be very biased and promote skin-sensitizing things just because an ingredient sounds more \"natural\".\\** ***Natural*** *things usually contain much more possible* ***skin triggers*** *than lab-isolated,* ***single*** *ingredients.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Potentially Irritating Filters (From Lab Muffin Beauty Science Blog)***\n\n>**Avobenzone** is a common irritant and allergen, so it tends to be unsuitable for sensitive skin, and you’re left with inorganic sunscreens only.  \n>  \n>If you’re elsewhere in the world, the newer UVA1 filters aren’t particularly irritating or allergenic.  \n>  \n>A few other organic sunscreens also tend to cause allergic and irritant reactions: **octocrylene, oxybenzone, avobenzone, PABA, Padimate O and enzacamene.**\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SUNSCREEN**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1.\\[A24\\] Premium Sun Protection Cream -

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

Apply sparingly and only where it's needed.

    "body": "Companies sometimes share the percentage retinol they use, but it's good to realize this is sometimes not the percentage of the pure retinol, but of a mixture.\n\nPhrases like \"1% coated retinol\" , \"a 1% retinol complex serum\" or we use \"0.5% slow release retinol\" are indicications they could be referring to a mixture/complex. Percentages like 2.5% or 3% are very unlikely pure retinol. There are also products that mention retinol in the product name, while the products doesn't contain retinol, but a derivative like Retinyl Palmitate.\n\nCompanies may list everything below 1% in random order, so often they try to get that 1% line high up on the ingredient list, and then list the actives first to make it look more potent. You could try to spot that 1% line, it can be helpful to determine wether the % is referring to a mixture or to the actual pure retinol. You can also look for ingredients on the inci list that are used in these standard retinol mixtures, commonly used coated/mixture forms can for example be found here:\n\n[https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1)\n\nSome ingredients that are commonly used at or below 1%:  Phenoxyethanol, Parabens, Levulinic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, EDTA's, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Carbomer,  Hyaluronic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Ubiquinone, Peptides, Retinoids, Ceramides, Fragrance, most plant extracts in powder form etc.\n\n\n\n**First example, M. Asam Retinol 1% Intense:**\n\n* Claim: 1% retinol in encapsulated form\n* Indications it's not 1%: Retinyl Palmitate is usually used below 0.3%. Polyurethane Crosspolymer-1 and Glycine Soja Oil are part of RetiCap PF, most likely this serum contains 0.08% Retinol.\n* Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, **Retinyl Palmitate, Retinol,** Panthenol, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, **Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil**, Tocopherol, Lauroyl Lysine, Dipentaerythrityl Pentaisononanoate, Carbomer, Polyglyceryl- 10 Laurate, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, **Polyurethane Crosspolymer- 1,** Caprylyl Glycol, Bht, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Second example, Inkey List Retinol Serum:**\n\n* Claim: 1% stable retinol and 0.5% granactive retinoid\n* Indications it's not 1%: Tocopherol, Carbomer in general are not used above 1%. Caprylyl Glycol in combination with other preservatives is in general not used above 1%, this means there's less than 1% Dimethyl Isosorbide (part of) Granactive Retinoid, which contains 10% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, so 0.05% in this formula. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (and) Sodium Ascorbate (and) Tocopherol (and) retinol is called RetiSTAR. This contains 5% Retinol, so at 1%, there's 0.05% retinol in this formula. So 1.5% total retinoid, no not really, more likely it's 0.1% max.\n* Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Caprylyl Glycol,** Phospholipids, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Squalane, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Extract, **Carbomer**, Sodium Ascorbate, **Tocopherol,** Polysorbate 60, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycolipids, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol,** Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Third example,**[Dr Brandt 2% Retinol serum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26OFz0DakQc&t=0m13s)**:**\n\n* claim 2% Retinol Complex\n* Why it's not 2%: Tocopherol and Phenoxyethanol are not used above 1%. Could be  \"Retinol C50 by Amcol\" or \"Iuvenesens® B-15\". So most likely 0.3% at most. Think about how the fancy packaging and marketing makes you think this is really worth $70. With all the fragrance ingredients lie Limonene, Grapefruit Oil and Lavender Oil it's best to skip this product.\n* Water, Glycerine, Dicaprylylcarbonaat, Isoamyl Lauraat, Cyclopentasiloxaan, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Boter, Shea Butter Cetyl Esters, Triheptanoin, **Tocoferol, Phenoxyethanol,** Behenyl Alcohol, Methylpropaandiol, Glycerylstearaatcitraat, Polysorbaat 20, Natriumacrylaten Copolymeer, **Retinol,** Glycerylstearaat , Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Limonene, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, etc...\n\n**Fourth example, Sunday Riley A+ High Dose 6.5% Retinoid :**\n\n* Claim: 5% retinoid ester, 1% liposomal-encapsulated retinol, 0.5% blue-green algea\n* Probably the 5% refers to Granactive Retinoid, you can't use 50% of this, so that means there's 0.5% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Which seems correct since the 1% line is around Diheptyl Succinate, and Dimethyl Isosorbide is the 3th ingredient. The Retinol is less than 1%, it's liposomal encapsulated, so this could be \"Iuvenesens® B-15\" as well, probably this means there's about 0.2% Retinol at most. So instead of the claimed 6.5% Retinoid, for $85 you are actually getting 0.2% retinol, 0.5% HPR with no indepedant studies on it's anti aging properties, and some unproven plant extract.\n* Water/Eau/Agua, Propanediol, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Triheptanoin, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Hexyldecanol, Disiloxane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Diheptyl Succinate, Propylene Carbonate, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate**, PPG-24-Glycereth-24, Phenyl Trimethicone, **Retinol, Ubiquinone (CoQ10),** Honey Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Algae Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Opuntia Ficus-indica Fruit Extract, Bisabolol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Phospholipids**, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Lecithin, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, 4-t- Butylcyclohexanol, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Helianthus Annuss (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitol, Cetylhydroxyproline Palmitamide, Polysilicone-11, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Polysorbate, Hydroxyphenyl Propamidobenzoic Acid, Stearic Acid, Brassica Campestris Sterols, PVP, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Alcohol, Potassium Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, **Tocopherol**\n\n**Fifth example: Indeed labs Retinol Reface:**\n\n* Claim 1% retinoid fluid, 1% retinol time release complex encapsulated, 3% retinol like peptides\n* Looking at the position of Dimethyl Isosorbide, there's most likely 1% Granactive Retinoid, so 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Retinol is under the 1% line, I'm not completely sure which form is used but could be Retinol 10S, so this means 0.1% final concentration. Xanthan Gum in normal viscosity products is usually something like 0.2%. Peptides at 3%, this mixture contains 100ppm and 50ppm, so 0.0003% and 0.00015% respectively. So instead of thinking to get 5% pure actives, you are getting something like 0.2%.\n* Water, Dimethicone, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Cetearyl Glucoside, Peg-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, **Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol**, Sodium Acrylate/sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, **Xanthan Gum**, Glycine **Soja (Soybean) Oil, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,** Polysorbate 80, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, **Retinol**, **Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Acacia Senegal Gum, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Tocopherol\n\n**Cerave Skin Renewing Retinol Serum**\n\n* Claim: encapsulated Retinol\n* They don't mention any percentage, but it is below 1%. They could have used ROVISOME Retinol Moist,  Water (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Alcohol (and) **Retinol** (and) Polysorbate 20 (and) Potassium Phosphate. This contains 3% retinol, most likely used at 1-2%, there's 0.03-0.06% actual retinol. So if that is correct I think this is more a beginners retinol.\n* Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, **Polysorbate 20**, Peg-40 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, **Potassium Phosphate,** **Ceramide Np**, Ceramide Ap, Ceramide Eop, Carbomer, Niacinamide, Isoceteth-10, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Triethanolamine**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cichorium Intybus Root Extract / Chicory Root Extract, **Lecithin**, **Retinol,** Silica, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, **Alcohol,** Hydroxyacetophenone, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, **Pentylene Glycol,** Xanthan Gum, Phytosphingosine, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter / Shea Butter, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**The Ordinary Granactive 2% Emulsion**\n\n* uses [InuMax Advanced Retinol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/la/PersonalCare/Detail/2163/637871/InuMax-Advanced-Retinol)\n\nAnd to add one more thing besides the vague percentage marketing, remember that Retinol is very, very unstable. It's very difficult to formulate with pure retinol. So it's understandable companies work with premixed complexes. Though even with these complexes as a consumers you can't be 100% sure it stays stable during the whole shelf life. Some products use dropper bottles or tubes that allow air in formula, and products may have been stored for months in warehouses and stores. It can be fine, but as a consumer it's difficult to know for sure. Remember that for PAO and shelf life stability, tests are done to measure things like bacterial/yeast growth, shifting, pH fluctuations. Doing a stability assay to determine the degradation of specific actives in a formula is **not** a mandatory part of that. PAO and shelf life are thus not a 100% guarantee the actual actives remain stable and effective. If you want something OTC, adapalene is much more stable and you don't have to worry wether you are getting the right percentage, it's a standardized proven formula. It doesn't bind to all receptors and is mainly proven for it's anti acne benefits, but the results for it's anti-aging benefits are promising. Other option could be a Retinaldehyde or a Retinol product that is formulated by a larger well known company, is in airless packaging, and which you store in a fridge at home. \n\n\"It can be difficult to discern the concentrations of OTC retinol and retinaldehyde in a given product as there is no labeling requirement in the  USA to list these concentrations. In general, irritation is a biomarker of efficacy, and formulations that do not produce irriation are unlikely to have significant effects. In addition it is advisable to steer patients toward larger, well-established cosmetics companies with a good reputation. Brandname products from companies that have rigorous quality control and regulations are preferred over products from small manufacturers. Because retinol is a fairly unstable compound and requires proper packaging and storage conditions to maintain efficiency, there can be great variability among preparations.[Cutaneous Photoaging, Watson,  Griffiths, 2019](https://books.google.nl/books?id=6reqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=adapalene+photo+aging&source=bl&ots=AkWsbaI5qq&sig=ACfU3U1l2wWZkLfx3P1VHkbLM_ZyfdoopQ&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjahICuw_znAhXDzaQKHS13DLI4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=adapalene%20photo%20aging&f=false)\" --> to add one thing to this, some studies also indicate that when retinol degrades it becomes more irritating to skin, so irritation is not always a good marker.\n\n\nPersonally I think if you want to be sure, go for prescription tretinoin, that is proven and effective, and often more affordable than retinol as well. Otherwise some options below. \n\n* UK: Dermatica - \"otc\" tretinoin\n\n* US: Curology - \"otc\" tretinoin or Adapalene\n\n* [Paula's Choice 1% Retinol Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice.com/clinical-1pct-retinol-treatment/801.html) - $58/30mL\n\n* [Avene RetrinAl 0.1% Retinaldehyde](https://www.aveneusa.com/retrinal-intensive-cream) - $70/30mL\n\n* [Geek&Gorgeous 0.05% Retinaldehyde](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/a-game-5) $13.50/30mL",

        "body": "So I was looking into [Physiogel Calming Relief AI cream](https://incidecoder.com/products/physiogel-calming-relief-ai-cream) in more depth, and I'm so confused about the ingredient Palmitamide MEA aka PEA aka Palmitoylethanolamide. Because with a brief look earlier I saw the Palmitamide MEA in it and thought it's one of the ceramides (the names are so similar haha!). However, today I saw incidecoder mentioning it as just a viscosity controlling ingredient (and I usually find them quite accurate), but more things came up where I saw something from mdedge [here](https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/74188_main.pdf) stating \"Palmitamide MEA (PEA) is an important component of MimyX nonsteroidal cream, Dr. Smith said. PEA is an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties\" but this doctor has a consulting agreement with Stiefel Labs, which manufactures Physiogel. Also came across this [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/) but it's testing a synthetic ceramide PC-104 in combination with other things like Palmitamide MEA, grapeseed extract etc. Plus, I remember reading an AMA from kindofstephen where he said \" I think most cosmetic companies would attribute patents as a marketing cost. Most novel patents I've seen in the cosmetic industry are to deal with delivery vehicles (like an airless soft container, etc)\". My takeaway is things can be patented even if they're not doing too much, because to consumers it seems like it's doing a lot? And now idk if this ingredient/Physiogel is any good as a ceramide cream or it's just a good plain heavy moisturiser.\n\nEdit: Realised this ingredient is present in Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume, along with SK-Influx, where it's described as \"Atoderm Intensive Baume quickly stops itching and reduces the urge to scratch thanks to its anti-itching dermatological active ingredient PEA\"\n\nMy understanding is Physiogel doesn't have any ceramides or cholesterol/phytosterols (looks like Zeroid uses phytosterols in place of cholesterol?), but has PEA as a fatty acid (skin similar ingredient), so it must be a good moisturiser but not an ideal-ratio ceramide moisturiser.",

    "body": "For the purposes of this review of multiple products, I’ll be *categorizing items by routine placement* rather than when it was introduced.  These items are very much YMMV but I thought it may be helpful for some who are newer to AB (seen with the large influx of newbie questions I’ve seen in the DHT) or even those wondering about products generally.  Also **this isn’t a particular look at my routine(s)** or how my routine has transformed as I’ve learned more about my skin; rather, this review is of products used to target particular concerns.  This mega-review really came about after a response comment from /u/theCuriousAmerican (whom I thank for keeping me and much of the board in the loop regarding newer products/ lesser known brands in Korea).  I am over 30 but I haven’t started picking out my coffin lining just yet (rose gold silk, plz) so be aware this isn’t really an anti-aging post as I don’t consider myself having “mature” skin (whatever that means).  As I go through reviews, I’ll also include my rational as to why I purchased a product if it wasn’t impulse and link any relevant posts from the sub that informed my purchase. \n\nI've decided to break up this review and present categories like a series.  This post will be centered around 1st cleansers, hydrating toners, and serums.  The second post will be centered around oils, moisturizers/occlusives, and masks. *Also, I will only discuss AB/ sub-related products*. While I went through a smattering of samples, they will not be discussed. All products discussed were used for at least 2-3 months, if not longer. \n\nAbout my skin prior to developing a skincare routine: \n\n- extremely oily\n\n- flaky under makeup (my makeup would separate in hours and have dry patches)\n\n- riddled with closed comedones (whiteheads)\n\n- bumpy skin texture (under the skin pimples)\n\n- uneven skin tone, hyperpigmentation (PIH)\n\n- icepick scars\n\n\n**1st Cleanser**:\n\n\n*Heimish All Clean Balm*\n\n- Ingredients: [Posted from CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2186231803.html) so take with a grain of salt as anyone can add or delete ingredients. \n\n\nI've been using this balm since February. My initial impression was satisfaction. It melted well (not as well as Clinique's Take The Day Off), a slight herbal/citrus smell which didn't bother me, and a lower price point than TTDO. The price is really the main positive of this product. I don't find it cleans as well as TTDO so I have to use more product to make sure everything is eliminated. Nowadays I don't even wear a full face or any makeup at all really except Heroine waterproof mascara and Beauty People Lip Tattoo. I usually let this balm sit on my face for a minute or two before going at it and it does remove most of these products. Into May, I'm still satisfied with this product. Sometimes I only use this cleanser at night if I wasn't wearing anything but sunscreen since it does the job and I've worn a full face and it does remove base makeup well enough (even though I need to use more of it). It'll also last a bit longer, I'm thinking 2-3 more months, so at least 6 months of use for me. I also like that this comes in travel size (I got a few from a Ohlolly.com promo).\n\n\nRepurchase? I'd likely repurchase TTDO if choosing between the two, yes TTDO is more expensive but I liked that it removed makeup easier, it melted better as well. \n\n\nFor my next 1st cleanser, I'll likely repurchase TTDO or make my own cleanser as a way to dupe Tatcha's oil cleanser (beautiful cleanser, only had a sample but loved the feeling). \n\n\n**Hydrating Toners**\n\n\n*Kikusamusane High Moist Lotion* (30 mL decant)\n\n- Ingredients: [From CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_5173202878.html)\n\n\nRemember mid-2016 when kikumasamune was on everyone's lips? I purchased a decant of this hydrator partially on the [buzz](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3tgula/a_letter_to_kikumasamune_high_moist_lotion/?st=j2jobol7&sh=17239e4e) created by the sub and other blogs.  This product seemed like a good way to target PIH and increase hydration for my dehydrated skin.  It took me about 2 months to get through my decant. I'm not gonna go through my use of this product because it's been discussed by this sub so much (do a google search). \n\n\nRather, I'll discuss why I ended up not purchasing a full size of this product. I ended up not purchasing a full size because by then I felt my skin didn't need what the Kiku was offering. I didn't get any significant lightening of PIH, brightening yes but I felt I could get brightening from other products. I could get hydration from other products as well.  And I suppose I just wasn't *impressed* enough to want to purchase it. This was also when I realized I get bored of products and the thought of purchasing a 500 ml product seemed so daunting to finish. LOL. \n\n\n*Hada Labo Albutin Lotion Moist*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Arbutin, Disodium Succinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Methylparaben, PPG-10 Methyl Glucose Ether, Sodium Hyaluronate, Styrene/VP Copolymer, Succinic Acid, Tremella Fuciformis Polysaccharide (from hadalabousa)\n\n\nI recently finished this product (mid-April) and I'm so happy I never have to use this product again. LOL. I purchased this product in December on ABX. I primarily purchased it because of its ingredient list and was interested in using a product with MAP and Arbutin to see if it could attack my PIH in anyway. Also, I felt it would be another good addition for my skin that leans perma-dehydrated. Little to no smell, watery texture, and economical. \n\n**Performance**: Overall, I was significantly disappointed by this product and the longer my time away from this product the more I'm able to realize why I'm disappointed.  It just didn't do anything. It felt like I was throwing cloudy water on my face most of the time. Cloudy water that wasn't even showing a difference in my skin. I would take days off from using this product and saw no difference in brightness to my face. I also saw no lightening of PIH. I expect my toners to hydrate *at least* and it seemingly failed on this front as well. I added another toner to back up this one but I don't like wasting product so I finished it. I found it as a good way to give myself lotion masks and to hydrate my legs. Essentially, this may be the most boring product I've ever tried. \n\n\n*Meishoku Extra Moisturizing Lotion Moist* \n\n- Ingredients: [From cosdna](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_f35b176780.html)\n\n\nI purchased this toner around December from the r/abx with the Hada Labo moist.  I didn’t know what to expect purchasing this product but I did based on the ingredients. I was searching for a product that had ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids. I should also add that I was searching for a product that had the 3-1-1 ratio because my face does best with a pretty constant use of acids and I needed something that would deliver on the moisture front. \n\n\n**Performance**: I can't actually say much about this product which I don't know if that's good or bad. It's slightly thicker than the HL moist, it's more moisturizing than HL and I feel like it does more than HL ever did. I still enjoy using it after all this time and I may even repurchase. It absorbs quickly, has no discernible smell, and is pretty economical for the amount you receive vs how long it lasts. If the product ingredient listing is correct and I understand how each ingredient fits, this product may have the 3-1-1 ratio (plz, correct me if I'm wrong as I'd love to know for sure!).\n\n\n*PyunKyang Yul Essence Toner*\n\n- Ingredients: Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\nMy newest toner purchase.  I’ve been using this toner for about 3 weeks so I can only give a first impression.  My main interest in this toner was sparked by [Gothamista’s YT review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9_mJoK4gr4) of this product when she covered the 7 skin layer method.  I was interested in finding another hydrating toner to try out the method as I felt that HL was too thin and really felt more like I was patting ‘cloudy water’ on my face every day. \n\n\nAbout the PKY line: The PKY line was developed by the Pyunkang Oriental Medicine Clinic (info provided by Ohlolly.com).  It boasts a list of ingredients commonly found in these types of products but I was especially interested in milk vecht root extract, which is an extract that I haven’t come across much in products. (NOTE: I've been searching high and low for any clue of what this ingredient does topically, can't find anything.) I’m a bit of a lover for simpler aesthetics.  I like it when bottles are plainly labeled and look like they belong in an apothecary.  In this sense, PKY hits all my wants; sleek and simplistic design, electric blue bottle (hard plastic), and **no** dropper. \n\n\n**Performance**: What I expected from this product was hydration and I can say this toner delivered.  The liquid is slightly thicker than HL lotion moist but not too much.  I live in a high humidity area and we’re going into summer but I don’t expect to rotate this toner out of my routine.  I tend to only need 2-3 layers for the skin method when I’m using this toner. I’ve tried doing up to 7 but my skin calls it quits in absorption around layer 5. But I'm also wondering if this product just isn't as easily absorbed as meishoku. I think this product would be a great skin soother, since it comes across as so ...mild and inoffensive (if that makes sense). \n\n\nHave I seen a discernible difference in my skin using this product?  I don’t think so. I would notice more if my skin didn’t get the proper hydration it needed from this product but I haven’t seen that. \n\n\nMISC: There is no discernible smell but I’m not sensitive to smells.  The bottle is 6.7 oz which is a lot of product and likely this bottle will last me at least 8 months, making the price ($19) very economical. \n\n\nIf I didn’t think I’d have another toner waiting to be purchased, I’d say I’d repurchase this but I already have my sights set on toners by kyotosilk and swanicoco.  \n\n\n**Serums**\n\n\n*OST20*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Ascorbic Acid, Alcohol, Sodium Lactate, Butylene Glycol, Glucose, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Xanthan Gum, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Flower Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Glycerin, Zinc PCA, Panthenol, Niacinamide, t-Butyl Alcohol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ubiquinone, Diisopropyl Adipate (from Wishtrend)\n\n\nI'm going to be honest, I won't say much about this product because this sub seems to have a love+hate relationship with it. But I feel like a complete *sucker* for using this product when Timeless's Vit C formula exists. Reviews by [Holysnails](http://www.holysnails.com/2015/03/a-rant-on-osts-c20-and-c215-serums-and.html) and [Fiddy](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2017/01/04/vitamin-c-serum-101-timeless-vitamin-c-serum-review/) and [sub reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4edywb/timeless_vitamin_c_e_ferulic_serum_review_with/?st=j2joba2v&sh=f554f12e) should have had me clicking to Timeless's site. \n\n\nBut no, I tried OST20 first (at least I don't have to wonder) came away disappointed (easily oxidized, serum-like feeling, faint smell, and a bit tacky on the skin). If I regretted purchases this would likely be the ONE I regret most, especially after using Timeless (water-like feel to the skin, subtle scent, stabilized with vit E and ferulic acid, great pricing). NOTE: Please purchase from Timeless's site, while offered on Amazon I can't say for sure that is Timeless's vendor. \n\n\n*Stratia Rewind*\n\n- Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Ethoxydiglycol, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, 2-Dimethylamino Ethanol (DMAE), Panthenol, Hydrolized Rice Protein, N-Acetyl Glucosamine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Tamarindus Indica (Tamarind) Seed Extract, Hydrocotyl (Centella Asiatica) Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA\n\n\nAgain, this is another product that is known enough in the sub that I don't really feel like I need to say much. I purchased this product based on the ingredients. I wanted something with niacinamide + nag and licorice. Also, I wanted to support an independent maker who I know was knowledgeable about skincare. I was really interested to see what this product would do for my skin. NOTE: I purchased before stratia dropped the use of biokelp ferment so I've never tried the newest formulation. \n\n\nFor skin feel, this product was slightly oily but sank in well enough. I found it slightly hydrating/moisturizing but not heavy. It really did help with providing a boost of moisture to my skin while being soothing. \n\n\n**Performance**: Overall, I didn't see any significant change in my skin except for moisture/hydration. My PIH was not lightened and I didn't see significant brightening and really that's what I wanted. \n\n\n*Hungarian Water Essence*/*Mizon Hyaluronic 100 Serum*\n\n- Ingredients (BELIF): Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Officinalis(Sage) Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Peucedanum Graveolens (Dill) Extract, Alchemilla Vulgaris Extract, Rose Extract, Poncirus Trifoliata Fruit Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, *Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, *Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, *Nepeta Cataria Extract, *Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Leaf Extract, *Baptisia Tinctoria Root Extract, *Stellaria Media (Chickweed) Extract, +Alchemilla Vulgaris Leaf Extract, **Equisetum Arvense Leaf Extract, **Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Leaf Extract, **Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Triethylhexanoin, Tromethamine, Sclerotium Gum, Ammonium Acryloyldimethltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Trisodium EDTA, ***Fragrance, Citronnellol, Limonene. *Napiers Original Formula. **Napiers Aqua Formula. ***Fragrances of Natural Origin.\n\n- Ingredients (MIZON): Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Copper Tripeptide-1, Butylene Glycol, Sclerotium Gum, 1,2-octanediol, Ethylhexyl-glycerin, Tropolone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Carppyl/capric Triglyceride,Hydrogenated Lecithin, Stearic Acid, C12-c20alkyl Glucoside, C13-22 Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Cholesteryl Hydroxystearate, Cholesterol, Ceramid 3, Triethanolamine, Carbomer, Betula Platpyhlla Japonica Juice, Portaluca Oleracea Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, Amica Montana Flower Extract, Artemisia Absinthium Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Gentiana Lutea Root Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Rasberry) Fruit Extract, Beta-Glucan, Adenosine, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA\n\n\n**Performance**: I'm putting these two together because I felt like they acted as similar products. Very inoffensive serums with little to no scent. I couldn't pinpoint to their overall effect but I will say that when I started mixing them together before application I saw a def increase in the ...bouncy-ness of my skin. I can't explain it and I'm little miffed that separately they didn't perform but together I loved the effect. I refuse to purchase extract water as I got a deluxe sample size from Sephora (Belif got me on the moisturizer train already) and Mizon did very little for my skin alone so both were a dud in my opinion. \n\n\n******\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nI suppose I should discuss my skin now. Overall, I'm pretty happy with where my skin is although I think I'm gonna need laser work for some PIH or start on tret. I don't get flakes even in the face of all the actives I through at my skin. I barely purge (except for retinol) and I don't break out really. When I do breakout, it's usually from products/ environmental, not hormonal. I guess I have a semi-glow, although IRL I just look semi-sweaty or really shiny with makeup on. I'm not as oily and I usually don't get oily until about 4PM now and my makeup no longer separates. \n\n\nI think what's made the largest difference is introducing a hydrating toner. Before this I cleansed and moisturized but hydration was a key element that I wasn't getting. Adding hydration was such a wonderful step towards aiding my skin and I really think that in those who are new to AB, learning the importance of hydration is critical in understanding your skin. ",

What I have found to work the most for me  has been a monthly Glycolic peel (20%) coupled with regular (2-3 times a week) exfoliating and of course niacinamide and Alpha arbutin and sunscreen that blocks against HEV and IR  to stop new pigmentation from forming. It's a nightmare to maintain  but it was the only thing that works. I did try tret, the 0.5 one but it was really really drying on my skin and darkened my pigmentation unless I exfoliated which made it more dry. Such a pita.",

I have issues with my makeup separating/flakes becoming more visible as well :( and I have yet to find a satisfying solution for it. \n\nI'm normal, but lean dry and I feel like I've never seen my moisture barrier fully restored, which is probably leading to the separation of my makeup.. Do you think the hydrating toner made the difference for your makeup as well? Have you been using the same face makeup throughout the usage of these products?",

I know I always appreciate finding affordable products with niacinamide so I thought I'd share, ulta has it for $9.99/1 oz.

I used to use UV Doux before this for as long as I can remember, but had to stop using it as my skin got really sensitive and I had damaged my skin barrier. \n\nYou definitely cannot use the recommended two fingers of sunscreen with this one as it gets really heavy and suffocating. I tried layering it in small amounts (maybe just one fingertip at a time), let that settle and then apply another fingertip. I could only do two fingertips with this one. It did work for my extremely sensitive skin at that time and miraculously it was even calming and healing for my active acne and the PIH post acne was really minimal. The texture is in between a cream and a gel as can be seen in the picture. I totally understand why people detest it so much, the heavy suffocating feeling is a put off. I am not going to lie, it is heavy, feels like a suffocating layer on your face and is uncomfortable but you get used to the feeling once you see that its actually working for your extremely sensitive skin when nothing else does. You have to properly blend it in, take a minute or two to actually spread it on the skin. I have tried to photograph the white cast this one gives immediately post application. but once it settles in 30 minutes or so, the white cast is almost negligible and gives a primer finish (I am NC 43-45 for reference). I don't use makeup so I don't know how it would perform under makeup. The reapplication is difficult. I blot my face a lil before I apply this and again it takes a while to settle which is irritating if you are out and about. I could never reapply this more than once. It is sweat proof, tested it in peak of summer. This is the only zinc oxide based sunscreen that did not dry out my cheeks. \n\nAll said and done, I can't seem to make it work as my stand alone sunscreen as two fingertip amount is just not going to cut it when you are on all sorts of actives. Hence, since I have healed my skin barrier now and can use chemical sunscreens again, I use it over my cheeks (an area where my PIH is the worst) layered over my chemical sunscreen, after it completely dries. It's the perfect sweet spot for me and helps with PIH.\n\nRepurchase Status: Holy Grail (HG). Already repurchased twice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **Bello Photostable Emugel Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rave ❤\n\nAvailability in India: Easily available offline and online.\n\nIngredient list:\n\nKey Ingredients: Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol, Ethylhexyltriazone Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyltriazine, Diethyl amino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate.\n\nOther ingredients: Purified water, Dimethicone and Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicetyl phosphate, Ceteth-10 phosphate, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Myristyl Myristate, Octyldodecanol, Caprylic Triglyceride, Pentaerythirtyl distearate, Phenyl trimethicone, Vitamin E acetate, Carbomer copolymer, Disodium Edetate, Trolamine, Sodium polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Methyparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben, Isobutylparaben\n\nSunscreen type: Chemical\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dr24pvoaknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f726d323339bee404855990ab043e2a3b051acc2\n\nExperience & opinion: I have been using it everyday since approximately 4 months. The texture is creamy and you have to work it in for like 2 minutes into the skin. Immediately post-application, the sunscreen feels greasy to touch and looks oily but it gets absorbed into the skin in about 10 minutes and leaves a dewy finish which never goes away. I really like the dewy healthy glow it gives me. I can actually use 2 finger amount of sunscreen and it doesn't leave a white cast on my dark skin tone. If it gets into your eyes, it does sting. I can assume that dry skinned people would loooooove this in the winters. If you are combination or oily, I feel you can completely skip the moisturiser step when using this in summers. Would be perfect for inclusion in a minimal routine in the AM. On reapplication, it does leave a little bit of white cast on the sides of the face where we tend to have the peach-fuzz which will go away with a little bit of rubbing. Overall, this is the best budget sunscreen easily available in India which doesn't make us look like we have dressed up for a meme.\n\nRepurchase Status: HG, WRP. Already repurchased thrice. I will be trying out Photostable Gold SPF 55 in the summer, maybe it will replace this one. If not, I will always come back to this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **Biore UV Smooth Kids Milk Spf 50 PA++++**\n\nReview Type: Rave ❤\n\nAvailability in India: Availability is a serious issue. Used to get it from Dokodemo pre-pandemic. Haven't been able to source since.\n\nIngredient list: Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Glyceryl Behenate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Sorbitan Distearate, Sodium Acrylate/​Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Paraffin, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Ceresin, Isohexadecane, Arginine, Lauryl Methacrylate/​Sodium Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polysorbate 80, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Dextrin Palmitate, Agar, Petrolatum, Succinic Acid, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Methylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, BHT.\n\nSunscreen type: Chemical\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gjsnx8acknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e3e74e3ba70e6471b63c4d83bd3d41c2e876eab\n\nExperience & opinion: I had been using it everyday in dry summer days. Where I live is not very humid and that's why I think this one works so well for me. The texture is very aptly described as milk since it feels like a thick emulsion and spreads into nothingness into the skin. I can use the recommended amount of sunscreen with this one and it doesn't leave a white cast at all. It gets absorbed into the skin within 2 minutes and leaves behind a comfortable breathable layer of moisture on your skin. It does not dry down matte. It doesn't irritate my eyes. Its just so perfect for my combination skin even on my oily T-zone in peak summer days.  Reapplication is such a breeze. I have reapplied it in a taxi, in my office, before a meeting without any downtime. I just absolutely love everything about this sunscreen except that I think it has been discontinued and I am crying over the loss of my only true HG sunscreen. If anyone from Biore is reading this, please accept my plea and bring this back into production!!!!!\n\nRepurchase Status: HG forever. Although on the look out yet again for something that would match this one's status!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **The Blessing Tree Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50 PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rant\n\nAvailability in India: Available on Amazon.\n\nIngredient list: \n\nKey Ingredients: Octyl Methoxy Cinnamate, Oxybenzone, Titanium Dioxide, Octocrylene, Avobenzone, Zinc Oxide.\n\nOther ingredients: Aqua, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Diisopropyl Adipate, 1, 3, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Acrylates /​ C10-30 Alkyl Acrylare Cross Polymer, Propanediol, Diethylhexyl Sryngylidene Melonate, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Xylitylglucoside (and) Anhydroxylitol (and) Xylitol, Niacinamide, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexyl Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Perfume.  That was a task to type!!!!!\n\nSunscreen type: Hybrid\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/52ec0gwdknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8dd848f71d4a3939aa1b3ea6f13df4428170a9b\n\nExperience & opinion: I have had this for around 1 1/2 years now. But I never had the courage to put it on my face due to the infamous \"perfume\" in the inci list as I had a compromised barrier and could tolerate only physical sunscreens. All said and done, this has served well as an excellent body sunscreen which doesn't break the bank and provides me excellent protection. It is non-greasy unlike the other body sunscreens on the market. The white cast disappears within 5-10 minutes and you are good to get dressed and head out of the house. I apply it on all the exposed areas of my body - neck, upper shoulders, arms, hands (I don't feel guilty reapplying it even with the frequent hand washing as its relatively affordable + acts as a moisturiser for me) and feet. \n\nHowever for the sake of this review, I mustered all the courage I had to try it on the face but alas it did not suit me and caused me CC's by evening. It spreads well, leaves a white cast on skin which disappears in about 5-10 minutes, although the white residue along the hairline just doesn't disappear. I had to rub it excessively, almost rubbed it out to get it out of my peach fuzz! The finish on this sunscreen is not ultra matte and nor is it dewy to touch, its almost in between which is comfortable for combination and oily skin types. I was worried that this might get drying on my cheeks as the day progressed due to the zinc oxide content but it did not get dried at all. While I was typing the inci list, I realised it has Niacinamide in it!!! Yet another amazing ingredient to be present in this sunscreen. All in all, I would say if you don't have sensitive/sensitized skin and are okay with the \"O\" sunscreen filters, this is an excellent sunscreen.  \n\nRepurchase Status: Might repurchase for body. Not suitable for my face.\n\nThis review took me almost a month to write and photograph, but I am ultimately happy with the final write-up. I sincerely hope you enjoy reading this! I have tried to include everything based on the rules of this sub, but still if you have any questions, do hit me up.\n\nI will make another post of the sunscreens which didn't work for me and would include the likes of Cipla Rivela tint sunscreen, Hada Labo UV Perfect Gel, Skin Aqua UV Moisture Gel, Photostable Insta,  Aroma Magic Mineral Sunscreen and The Mom's Co. Mineral Based Sunscreen.",

All of these do not have fragrance. Both Isntree creams are great for daytime use (gel cream in the summer and moist cream in the winter). The Illiyoon Ato Lotion is for the body and even face if you prefer a little more occlusivity with a balanced moisture and has been a great all-arounder and extremely economical. Innisfree Ato Cream is a great choice is you really want to lock it all in overnight.***\n\n**My Skin: c-c-c-c-c-COMBO. My skin is drier in the winter and oily in the summer.**\n\nThe hyperlinked ingredients will take you to CosDNA analysis of each product.\n\n***PRODUCTS: ALL DO NOT HAVE FRAGRANCE ❤***\n\n***Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Aqua Gel Cream:***\n\n* Store: Jolse\n* Price: $10 (sale)\n* Size: 100 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_fe18517608.html) Water, Methylpropanediol, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Betaine, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Trehalose, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Centella Asiatica Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Sodium PCA, Phytosqualane, Isostearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol Cocoate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Jojoba Esters, Hydrogenated Olive Oil Unsaponifiables, Butylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Ethylcellulose, Propanediol, Phenyl Trimethicone, Pentylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n* **Review:** *I have used this for the past 6 months, and I can say this gel-cream really shines in the summer for daytime use. It is extremely hydrating, but  in the winter, it really lacks in the 'locking in water' department. I'd say this texture and performance is really similar to the cult-fave Belif Aqua Bomb and is a lot cheaper. It gives a burst of hydration with a hint of moisture, does not have any stickiness, and does not pill with sun protection layer. Has not caused any breakouts for me, but of course, avoid if you have a HA sensitivity or live in dry climate. People with pure oily skin will have more longevity in using this throughout the year. I probably will not repurchase because I love to try new products, but I have enjoyed using it and it practical price. Overall a great no-frills gel-cream.*\n\n***Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Moist Cream:***\n\n* Store: Jolse\n* Price: $10 (sale)\n* Size: 100 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_d36c550998.html) Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Dipropylene Glycol, Cyclohexasiloxane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Betaine, Behenyl Alcohol, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Water, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Cynara Scolymus (Artichoke) Leaf Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Eclipta Prostrata Leaf Extract, Pteris Multifida Extract, Beta-Glucan, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Methylpropanediol, Fructooligosaccharides, Raffinose, Ceramide NP, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Pentaerythrityl Distearate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Cholesterol, Folic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Polyquaternium-51, Tromethamine, Ammonium-Acryloyldimethyltaurate-Vp-Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium EDTA\n* **Review:** *I also used this cream for 6 months, and this is a great daytime cream for the winter. The texture here is more reminescent of Belif Moisturizing Bomb and is even more economical! This cream gives alot of moisture and balances a little bit of hydration and emollience. It takes in a bit more time to rub in and it is slightly sticky after application but that feeling goes away fast especailly when layering with sun protection. I have had zero breakouts using this cream and I recomend this for combination skin that gets drier in the winter. I have also used this at night, but I prefer a little more occlusiveness. It may be good for oily or combo skin at night if you prefer a lighter cream. I probably will not repurchase because I love to try new products, but I have also enjoyed using it and it practical price. Overall a great no-frills moisturizer and I look forward to try other products from Isntree.*\n\n***Illiyoon Ato Ceramide Lotion***\n\n* Store: Olive Young\n* Price: $37 (1+1 deal)\n* Size: 2x 528 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2f20551004.html) Purified Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Shea Butter, Cyclopentasiloxane, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Hydrogenated Poly (C6-14 Olefin), Clohexasiloxane, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Perilla Frutescens Sprout Extract, Magnolia Kobus Flower Extract, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA (Ceramide PC-104 32.75ppm), Mannitol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Caprylate, Dimethicone, Diisostearyl Malate, Lauric Acid, Myristic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Stearic Acid, Silica, Arachidyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Alcohol, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cholesterol, Palmitic Acid, Propanediol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Disodium EDTA\n* **Review:** *I have used this for a month on both my body and my face, and I think out of all of these this is my favorite. I think some may not like that it leaves thin film of occlusiveness, but for me that is a plus. Locking in moisture is critical for me. It truly excels as a body cream because it does not feel sticky. This lotion is filled with so much goodness such as ferments, ginseng (korean antiaging plant), shea butter, and a bit of ceramide. It melts in to your skin and moisturizes it well. In the winter, I also enjoy it as a both a day and night face cream too since it is more emmolient and occlusive than the Isntree HA Moist Cream. Out of all the purchases, this has been a must purchase forever for my body and has an added bonus that I can use it on my face when I want to mix up routine.* \n\n***Innisfree Ato Soothing Cream***\n\n* Store: Jolse \n* Price: $23 (sale)\n* Size: 150 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_bdc7551007.html) Purified Water, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Glycerin, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Panthenol, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, C14-22 Alcohols, Behenyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Bislauramide MEA, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Arachidyl Alcohol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Cholesterol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Glucoside, Tromethamine, Propanediol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Xanthan Gum, Sorbitan Isostearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium EDTA, Madecassoside, Glucose, Arachidic Acid, Myristic Acid, Acorus Calamus Extract, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Tocopherol.\n* **Review:** *I have also been using this cream for a month, and it is a very impressive barrier cream. It is buttery and harder to rub in, but this will 100% lock in your routine. Judging by its formulations and comparing to Innisfree Derma Formula Green Tea Probiotics Cream, I can guess that it is about 3% cermamide. This cream does not give much moisturzation, but if you are using a layering a routine it will seal all of the steps in, especially layering an emulsion before it. I feel like with this cream, it has an antiaging effect because my fine lines has redued probably due to its effectiveness as a barrier cream formulated with the ceramide and centella antioxidants! This one will be loved by those with dry, sensitive, or combo skin that loves a good barrier cream. I will probably repurchase, but I know there are other products to try in a similar catagory!*\n\nEdit: Added details addressing fragrance :)",

    "body": "A lot of other topics have been covered very well here on SCA, but I was asked where I thought there might be gaps in knowledge.\n\nRecently, there’s been a lot of interest in inorganic (mineral) sunscreens. As a result, I often see questions like:\n\n“Sunscreen A uses 20% zinc oxide but only has an SPF of 30, while Sunscreen B uses only 5% zinc oxide and 6% titanium dioxide, yet has an SPF of 50. Why?” \n\nAnswering this involves discussing different sunscreen technologies. I’ll try to be succinct, but bear with me.\n\n**TL;DR** \\- Mineral filters can vary in particle size, which will change the relationship between % used and resulting SPF. Companies are often somewhat deceptive about their use of nano-sized mineral particles. There are a number of SPF-boosting technologies that can be employed that generally work by dispersing sunscreen filters, absorbing UV themselves, making sunscreen filters more efficient, helping to create an even/protective film on skin, or providing antioxidant protection, or reducing redness.\n\n**Inorganic Sunscreen Filters - Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide**\n\nIn the past few years, there’s been a lot of interest in these two filters because of a number of reasons. Some users find that these filters are less likely to produce irritation or other negative effects than sunscreens with organic (“chemical”) filters. Others are concerned about the safety of organic filters. Yet others believe that these filters are better for the environment and coral reefs (not necessarily true). Whatever the reason, more people seem to be considering using mineral sunscreens, which has resulted in a number of questions. One of the main ones is, “why do percentages of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide not always seem to correlate with higher SPF and PPD/PA ratings?” To answer that question, we have to look at a few things.\n\n**Particle sizes**\n\nZinc oxide and titanium dioxide are a naturally white solid, and need to be micronized (ground up) into fine particles in order to be suspended in sunscreen products to ensure even coverage on the skin without excessive whiteness. Naturally, that means that you can micronize it to be coarser or finer, resulting in larger or smaller particle sizes. Changing the particle size of these filters seems to slightly change the spectra of UV radiation they are able to (mostly) absorb and (to a lesser degree) scatter. Generally, the smaller the particle size, the more efficient the UVB absorption becomes, but at the expense of UVA absorption. So this is the first variable that can affect final SPF and PPD/PA ratings. Hypothetically, two sunscreens could both have 10% zinc oxide, for example, but use different average particle sizes, with one resulting in SPF 8 and the other with SPF 15. Further complicating things is that a sunscreen can use two blends of the same mineral filter with different average particle sizes in order to balance out the UV absorption curves. \n\n**Deception around nano-particles**\n\nOne of the more dubious things that I see in the industry, particularly in the US, is companies saying that they do not use “nano particles”. There is no standard definition of “nano” in the US as there is in the EU or Australia, so many companies feel free to simply say “no, we don’t use nano particles” without mentioning the fact that by EU or Australian standards, they may well be. \n\nCompanies also sometimes justify saying they do not use “nano particles” because the particles are coated in a secondary ingredient (often to provide better performance by preventing clumping of particles or protecting skin from the free radicals that are released when UV radiation hits these particles). Although the average primary particle size (just the mineral) is less than 100 nm, the average *total* particle size, including the coating, is often larger than that, so they use this reasoning to tell consumers they are not using “nano particles”. \n\nBecause the EU is stricter about this, you’ll sometimes see US companies telling a US customer that their sunscreen is “non-nano” when the same product, when sold in the EU, is clearly labeled as “nano” in the ingredients list. It could possibly be the case that they are using a different average particle size for the two products, but there are definitely cases of straightforward deception as well.\n\nA secondary point, which is perhaps even more interesting, is that when you grind up zinc oxide and titanium dioxide into fine dust in order to micronize it, you are creating particles of VARIOUS sizes, with some portion of it almost always being less than 100 nm, aka “nano”. This is why “average” particle size is given, since the particles are of many different sizes. \n\nIn fact, because of this, the EU’s standard for labeling a sunscreen filter as “nano” or “non-nano” is relative, not absolute - less than 50% of the particles must have a diameter 100 nm or less. (Australia’s standard is more stringent, requiring either less than 10% of the particles have  diameter of 100nm or less, OR less than 10% of the particles “exhibiting unique properties”.) \n\nWhat this means it that even “non-nano”-labeled sunscreens in the EU (and Australia) likely contain particles that are less than 100nm. So good luck to consumers looking for mineral sunscreens but who want to completely avoid “nano particles”!\n\nI understand that companies feel pressured by consumer fears of “nano particles” and therefore resort to somewhat deceptive tactics, but that creates a vicious cycle of fear-mongering, paranoia, and misinformation that ends up helping no one. (By the way, I use sunscreens with micronized zinc, likely with particles less than 100 nm in diameter, and I do not have any intention of stopping. That is what works for my skin and I haven’t seen any research that strikes fear into my heart of “nano” zinc oxide, while I am quite concerned about the effects of unmitigated UV exposure. But this is my personal stance, not a prescription.)\n\n**SPF-Boosting Technologies**\n\nThere are a number of ways to boost the SPF of mineral sunscreen formulations. The first is to use ingredients that help further disperse the sunscreen filter particles. Ingredients such as butyloctyl salicylate, ethylhexyl methoxycrylene, undecylcrylene dimethicone, amongst others fall into this category. Depending on which ingredient is used at what concentration, SPF can be reportedly increased by 50% or more. \n\nMore rarely, there are SPF-boosters that actually have UV-absorbing ability of their own, though they’re not classified as sunscreen agents. Amongst these are methoxycinnamidopropyl hydroxysultaine and methoxycinnamidopropyl laurdimonium tosylate. (There is sometimes some overlap between this category and the one above - for example, some believe that butyloctyl salicylate may actually have some weak UV-absorption properties of its own, though this is not usually advertised by the manufacturers). Some other minerals, such as talc and iron oxides also absorb UV radiation to a degree, though they are not officially recognized as sunscreen agents.\n\nThe next is ingredients that interact with or affect the film of sunscreen that is left after application and drying of the product. Sunspheres, for example, are hollow spheres of styrene/acrylates copolymer. These spheres are distributed throughout the film of dried sunscreen on skin (along with the sunscreen filters). By refracting light, they increase the chances of UV radiation coming into contact with the filters in the sunscreen film, thereby increasing the efficiency of the sunscreen without increasing the % of sunscreen filters. It’s not a new technology, but it really is quite brilliant. Sunspheres can reportedly increase SPF 50% or more depending on the concentration used and in what formulation. Other film-forming agents, such as silicone resins (often used in rub-proof foundations), silicone acrylates, and various other polymers, help sunscreen set into an even, tenacious layer on skin, and can, depending on the material used and at what %, can increase SPF by 20% or more.\n\nIt’s useful to note that silicone-dominant emulsions, depending on how they are formulated, can also be quite effective at forming an even, tenacious layer of sunscreen on the skin upon drying that doesn’t slip around and cause streaky protection. These formulations are often helped by the use of ethanol (alcohol) to help the formula adhere to skin. This is in part why you see so many Asian milk-type sunscreens that heavily use cyclopentasiloxane (a volatile silicone oil) also include ethanol. Personally, I’ve noticed that Skin Aqua Super Moisture Milk SPF 50+, which many love because it feels comfortable on skin and does not have ethanol, slips around on my skin much more than some other Japanese milk SS’s that do include ethanol. This is in part what makes the Super Moisture Milk feel so comfortable on skin (like a face lotion, which don’t typically need to form an even, static film), but concerns me when I see zinc oxide particles collecting in folds and creating patchiness after a few hours of wear, since this probably also translates to uneven protection.\n\nThe last category is what I personally label as “miscellaneous” SPF boosters, and are usually antioxidant compounds or extracts that reduce skin redness. In the case of some antioxidants, there is some research that they can somewhat boost SPF through antioxidant ability (ascorbic acid and alpha tocopherol, for example) and/or acting as a weak absorber of UV radiation themselves (ferulic acid). However, some other boosters in this category seem merely to boost SPF ratings by suppressing skin redness, which I find to be a bit ethically dubious, since this theoretically is not actually lessening the free radical damage caused by UV radiation (at least to any meaningful degree).\n\nYou can imagine that, barring patent limitations (and there are many in this space), that a company could combine and employ any number of these strategies in one formula to maximize SPF. An example of that would be Skinceuticals’ Physical Fusion SPF 50, which has a relatively low % of sunscreen filters (about 6% titanium dioxide and 5% zinc oxide), yet a high SPF rating and a reported PPD of 21, due to the use of butyloctyl salicylate, sunspheres, talc, iron oxide and an antioxidant extract.\n\nI hope this useful in your quest to find a sunscreen that you're happy with, and good luck!",

My skin can only handle mineral filters, but it’s been so tough trying to find “the one” between all the different components... I.e. a sunscreen might be super cosmetically elegant but have a low percent of zinc making me wonder about its UVA protection vs a sunscreen might have a super high percentage of zinc but be super drying and mattifying on my already dehydrated skin. \n\nSo, to be clear, there’s really no way for me to gauge the level of UVA protection in US sunscreens without seeing if the company will divulge it?? I always thought that you need at least 15-20 percent zinc to get sufficient UVA protection in a physical sunscreen, but it’s been hard as heck to find one with that much zinc that I can stand wearing (and if I understand what you’re saying, the filter percentages don’t really tell you the full story of protection afforded in a sunscreen). But, I can’t really trust the label “broad spectrum” to mean I’m getting superior UVA protection right?\n\nI don’t want to bother you with helping me figure out my sunscreen of choice cause I know you got bombarded with that in the last post, but would love to know if you have any suggestions for figuring out the UVA protection of a sunscreen if a company won’t say. I’ve been worried about my 6 percent zinc, 5 percent titanium dioxide sunscreen, even though it says it offers good broad spectrum protection (that’s so general of a statement!)",

This is a topic I've been wondering about a bit but haven't really seen anything on it! I'm guessing this is how Australian Gold Botanicals markets their tinted sunscreen as SPF 50 and a somewhat high PA++++ rating, though I didn't recognize any of the boosters you mentioned on the ingredients list. \n\nSomething I've been wondering is that I see a lot of professionals (e.g. derms) claim that Zinc Oxide is an excellent UVA filter. However, previous absorbance spectra plots I've seen of Zinc Oxide always have pretty low absorbance, e.g. <1, though they are broad spectrum in the range of UV wavelength that they cover. I don't know much about sunscreen and UV science, but I would imagine you'd generally want at least 1 for the absorbance spectra for it to be of much use if you end up having prolonged UV exposure. I've certainly seen this for UVB filters.  The only time I've seen a high absorbance spectra for Zinc Oxide is from the Neutrogena data with their Sheer Zinc sunscreen, but it also has a much higher percentage (yes I know now that isn't everything! ;-)) of Zinc Oxide than I've ever seen in another mineral sunscreen. \n\nIn my mind, it doesn't seem that helpful if you have broad spectrum coverage that has low absorption - but maybe I'm way off the mark? \n\nAlso, just curious, but any idea why companies haven't yet formulated a mineral sunscreen like the Neutrogena one that is tinted so it has less of a cast? I feel like this would potentially be a pretty decent gap in the market but so far the main tinted ones I've seen are the Australian Gold Botanicals and the Elta MD Sport. I assume it must be pretty hard to get a tint and adequate UV protection? \n\nIf you have time to answer any of these questions, I'd be super grateful but regardless, you're AWESOME for sharing your knowledge on this stuff with us.

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin.

True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans:

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

    "body": "Garmi aaa gayi haiiii\\~ dhoop badh hui hai aur heatwaves pardhaar chuke hai 🥵🥵 obviously we need sunscreens! I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae](https://preview.redd.it/04x8cx1jvsy81.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db29ff28ad9fbcd3ff56a158d60e872ed63cb538)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\nand that's all from my side! I know its not much but then again kangaal haalaat mein kharidaari mushkil hai 💀. anyway, here's a list ss that I do want to try once this lot is finished:\n\n* sunscoop sunscreen serum (only if dermaco doesnt work lmao. really intrigued)\n* Face shop sunscreens (itne variants . ek try karne ka mann hai 😖)\n* beauty of joseon rice ss (stock mein aaja bhai 😫)\n* missha sun aqua gel and essence (bas aise hi lol)\n\nI've also tried the neutrogena ultra sheer, episoft , a few banana boat ones but way long ago so I don't clearly remember them to give the verdict on them. just if I haven't repurchased them, consider that they didn't work well for me.\n\nhope this was informational and you guys enjoyed! if you still have any other questions related to the product above, feel free to comment!",

Climate: hot and humid (SC, USA).\n\n**Product info:** Japanese, SPF 50+ PA+++, free of alcohol, fragrance, essential oils, and niacinamide. Truly a milky texture. Combination sunscreen (meaning both mineral and chemical filters).\n\n**Ingredient list:** Cyclopentasiloxane, Water, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, BG, Diethylhexyl Succinate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Hydrated Silica, Lauryl PEG-9 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Lauroyl Lysine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogen Dimethicone, Triethoxysilylethyl Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Hexyl Dimethicone, Methylparaben, EDTA-2Na, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Arginine, Bis-Ethylhexyl Hydroxydimethoxy Benzylmalonate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Acrylates Copolymer, CI 73360, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Talc, Ethanol, Iron Oxides, Tin Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Tocopherol, Mica \n\n**My experience with it:** This is the best SPF I've ever tried! I've tried quite a few in my search of the perfect SPF, and nothing has been able to beat this. No white cast on me. I've never experienced pilling or any sort of irritation from it. It wears beautifully under makeup. Easy to blend as it is a truly milky texture. This is truly fragrance free - smells like nothing to me. Natural finish on me but I've read some people have a matte finish with it. I have used this since January of this year (2023). \n\n**Potential con:** I've read some people anecdotally notice getting sun with this product. I haven't noticed this, but I honestly avoid the sun as much as possible. I'd love to hear from those who experience this!\n\n**A true con:** the wimpy size of the bottle. 40 mL is so small! Alas, I'll continue to repurchase. The price is affordable for me (\\~$11 a bottle).\n\n**Another SPF I also love:** Canmake Mermaid Skin UV Gel SPF 50+ PA++++.",

    "body": "Hello Everyone!\n\nI wanted to share a few short reviews of some AB Hair products. I don't see a lot of hair talk on here, so thought I would add some reviews. I would love to see other people's reviews on hair products. :)\n\n[Deep Conditioner, Shampoo Brush, Scalp Essence, and Styling Wax](https://preview.redd.it/jxsbjdmqg7811.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8fa1e18447c09eb79feb82246301255d9da84e7b)\n\n**My Hair Background**\n\nHair texture: Wavy, Fine\n\nHair Type: *Dry*\n\nHair Health: *I am starting to get gray hair. I got my first one not too long ago. Split Ends are taking over my hair. I used a temporary color over 6 months ago that has washed out. My hair was virgin before the temporary color, but I don't know if I can still call it virgin since the color wash.*\n\nScalp Concerns: *Extra dry and sensitive, psoriasis.*\n\n**Too Cool For School Egg Remedy Hair Pack**\n\n[Too Cool for School Egg Remedy Hair Pack](https://preview.redd.it/igz4eiczg7811.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8aa9cee3e449a134de056a38e76ba904e542f03f)\n\nI bought this for the protein. It was $10.99 on Amazon.  It is a deep conditioner treatment meant to be used 1-2 times a week. It is for repairing hair. It not recommended for normal hair, or protein sensitive hair.\n\nScent: *Sweet like milk and honey*\n\nTexture: *Thick and creamy*\n\nCurly Girl Method Approved?: *No*\n\nSilicone Free?: *Nope, contains* *Dimethicone, Amodimethicone, and Cyclopentasiloxane*\n\nAlcohol Free? : *No, contains Isopropyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, and Stearyl Alcohol*\n\nAfter one use, my hair is softer and feels smoother. After using it, I put my hair in a microfiber hair cap to air dry. My hair dried straight, instead of wavy. My hair looked more shiny and healthier than before. If you are looking to keep your natural hair texture, I don't recommend this product.\n\nSee full Curly Girl Method Ingredient Breakdown [here](https://isitcg.herokuapp.com/Home/Results/9TayIxixVkeoUwqp7FYTgw).\n\n**Shampoo Brush**\n\n[Shampoo Brush](https://preview.redd.it/ny21b01hl7811.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dd0af98c4e7cf87aa0286fa46ad5ad045b6c42de)\n\nI bought this, because I do a lot of co-washes. I wanted to still be able to scrub my scalp clean, even though I don't use shampoo daily. I picked it up at Daiso for $1.50.\n\nThe bristles are made out of a rubber. It doesn't snag my hair, and I am able to brush through without issues. The handle is comfortable. It looks questionable, but for brushing your scalp it is perfect.\n\nMy scalp feels great when I use it. Using it feels like a little scalp massage. I have been using it for a few weeks now. I have noticed that my scalp doesn't feel as \"tight\" anymore. I really think it is helping, and I am glad I purchased it. I love using it, and will continue to use it.\n\n**Edit:** I forgot to mention that the shampoo brush is easier on my arthritic hands. It gives my scrubbing a little more power and doesn't hurt so much. \n\n**A'PIEU Healthy Scalp Doctor Tonic**\n\n[Hair Essence](https://preview.redd.it/1553s3nrm7811.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3eef80ce12cd882561d123de6c0b13fdbc61d116)\n\nI bought this for my dry scalp. I got it from Jolse for less than $10.\n\nI have been using it for a few months. It is used to treat over-oiled, itchy, dry scalp, and hair loss prevention. It contains Salicylic Acid, Peppermint, Rosemary, Menthol, and Allantoin. It is meant to be used after drying hair every other day. The bottle has a misting cap on it . You mist it directly to your scalp and massage throughout.\n\nOnce applied, it instantly feels cool, probably from the menthol. It does help keep the build up down, and my scalp doesn't have as much dander fallout.\n\nI think this would be better for oily skin. I won't be repurchasing, because I feel like I can find a better product suited for myself. I will use it up, and then try a mist from Innisfree.\n\nI was not able to find the full list of ingredients in English.\n\n**TONYMOLY Make HD Hair Wax - Super Hard Matte**\n\n[Tonymoly make HD Hair Wax - Super Hard Matte](https://preview.redd.it/n5i87lbxq7811.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1dceca026f002ac0b7f8e0c10a3433cfd1462733)\n\nI bought this for my husband. He has short fine black hair. He has some thinning and grays. His scalp is oily, and he has dandruff. I purchased this from Jolse for less than $5.\n\nHe does not care for it, but he says it isn't so bad that he will throw it away without finishing it. It doesn't hold as long as it suggests. It holds hair for about four hours. It dries matte. It doesn't leave a white cast, or white flakes. The color of the product is slightly gray. It has a strong scent of talcum. I will not be repurchasing this one, because the hold wasn't strong enough.",

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F18 (umar badh gayi but dimaag nahi 💀)**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , acne (pustules, fungal and cystic) pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae ](https://preview.redd.it/fnjipguox9ma1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d880ff6b482ade3f03237375ef02cdd64fb4e3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl  Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a  fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\n* **The Derma Co.** **1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum** \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\]\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 30 ml (bought from amazon)\n\n**For skin type** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid. fragrance free. really watery and leaves a dewy-shiny finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredient list** : Purified Water, Glycerin, Avena Strigosa Seed Extract, Lecithin, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Silica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Decyl Glucoside, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7 & Disodium EDTA.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was....okay-ish? idk but I was really excited for this since their HA sun gel is one of my HGs. This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less 😖 if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would  get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation. I found this really mediocre.\n\n* **Axis-Y Complete No-Stress Physical Sunscreen \\[SPF 50+ PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1450 for 50ml (bought for Rs.999 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily combo skin types. those with dry skin like mine, might find it a bit more drying. good one for sensitive skins since it has a lot of calming ingredients as well!\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick white cream. fragrance free but has very strong ayurvedic smell. matte finish. physical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Zinc Oxide, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propanediol, Titanium Dioxide, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Caprylyl Methicone, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Disiloxane, Niacinamide, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Water, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Stearic Acid, Aluminum Hydroxide, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Copaifera Officinalis (Balsam Copaiba) Resin, Tocopherol, Squalane, Allantoin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5\n\n**filters** :\n\n* zinc oxide (mineral filter)\n* titanium dioxide (mineral filter)\n\nthis had been on my 'to buy' list for such a long time! and I finally got it during a march beauty barn sale! when I first tried it, I was really skeptical since it gave me a pretty bad whitecast and smelt so weird. I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop 😭. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :(  but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nupdate : this ones a hard no for me. is it calming? yes. but the whitecast is too much. and when i sweat it literally looks like I'm secreting milk from my skin  (~~nipple)😭😭~~\n\n**rating** : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/​PPG-10/​1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is 🔥🔥🔥. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool 🤤 only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure! in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty 😖 I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao 😌 so you can guess I go out a lot heheh. I feel like this one is getting over sooner than others in my ss ki theli 😫 but either way, if you find a good deal on it, blindly add this to your cart and order it. you wont be dissappointed!\n\nrating : 5/5 and WRP on reduced mrp only.\n\n* **Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun : Rice + Probiotics (SPF50+ PA++++)**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1530 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1200 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : dry, sensitive, acne prone and combination\n\n**texture and appearance** : creamy white lotion (ya nasty-). unscented ( ha, ha , aur socho ashleel cheeze 🤡)\n\n**ingredients list :**   Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Water, Glycerin, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Behenyl Alcohol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Sodium Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Water, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/​VP Copolymer, Polyisobutene, Silica, Caprylyl/​Capryl Glucoside, Sorbitan Oleate, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Bifida Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacillus Ferment,Streptococcus Thermophilus Ferment\n\n**filters :**\n\n* uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nthis deserves all the hype it gets on the net. my current and forever HG sunscreen (unless they change formulation). seriously this ticks all the boxes . no whitecast? check. great filters? check. doesn't make you face look like you rub pan grease on it? check. it absorbs so well and is more moisturizing than some of the moisturizers out there. obviously, wished we would get more quantity for the price paid but itna criticise karne ke baad bhi, brands toh behre hai 😔and on reapplication, doesnt feel like im doing the 100 layers challenge lol. plus , I don't feel regret when applying it these days, cuz no fear of sunscreen melting during winters (#rajailife) . *taareef karu kya uski, jisneee tujhe banayaaaa✨\\~*\n\n**rating :** 5/5 and forever HG\n\n* **Benton Mineral Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 15g (haalat kharab biros). got it at 30% on beauty barn\n\n**For skin types** : normal and sensitive skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : a white stick. that's it. kind of a really thick lotion like texture. unscented and smol. mineral sunstick.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Coco-caprylate/caprate, sunflower seed wax, propylene glycol dicaprylate, H-di/trimethylol hexyllactone cross polymer, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, titanium dioxide, dicaprylyl carbonate, Synthetic fluorphlogopite, vinyl dimethicone, microcrystalline wax, aluminum stearate, polyhydroxystearic acid, purslane extract, centella extract, sodium hyaluronate, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, sodium Acetylated hyaluronate, caprylic/capric triglyceride, polyglyceryl-4diisostearate/polyhydroxystearate/sebacate, silica, alumina, pentylene glycol, allantoin, panthenol, Glycerin, Madecassic Acid, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Xylyl Glucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Glucose, Glyceryl Caprylate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Stearic Acid, Tocopherol, Purified Water, 1, 2-hexanediol, ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**filters** :\n\n* titanium dioxide\n\nthis one came around the same time as the tocobo sunstick on beauty barn so being the ✨phisool kharchi wala baccha✨, I bought both of them. unfortunately , this one was a big letdown. how tf can a sunstick leave a whitecast? this one is a great example. first off, it requires a lot of pressing and dragging across the face to dispense , so not fond of that, especially when I have active acne. secondly, it legit looks like someone rubbed fair and lovely mixed with water on my face 💀. its not waterproof, expensive for the quantity you get and gives a disappointing finish and result. I'm not particularly sure about protection against sun on this one but oh well. also piddu si stick hai so kind of cute but lootne wala hai lmao\n\n**rating** : 2/5 and WNRP\n\n* **Tocobo** **Cotton Soft Airy Sun Stick SPF50 Pa++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1550 for 20g (bought at 1100 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily, combination, acne prone skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale blue long cylinderical like stick. has a really pleasant and soft floral fragrance . leaves a matte fininsh and doesnt feel greasy on apllication. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list :**  Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Niacinamide, Tromethamine, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Pentylene Glycol, Polysilicone-15, Vigna Radiata Seed Extract, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Extract, Sophora Flavescens Root Extract, Rheum Palmatum Root/Stalk Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Oenothera Biennis (evening primrose) Flower Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Seed Oil, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Fragrance\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* titanium dioxide (physical filter)\n\nprobably the only sun stick that comes even close to the isntree sun stick. this gives such a good matte finish without any greasy feel . plus has cute floral smell to it that doesn't transfer to your skin or anything. and damn what a bang for a buck. probably the closest dupe for the isntree one. the only con is that it kind of pills after the 3rd application and rubs of oily after a while. if you are a person who touches their face every once in a while (like my dumbass), you might find it a bit uncomfortable. that being said, most of the times I just blot the grease away after 3-4hrs of application and apply another layer afterwards. sun protection wise, it does a good job! my forehead is the area that is the most prone to getting tan and it looked quite even toned after 3 weeks of consecutive use. one of my most favorite sticks (😏)\n\n**rating** : 4.5/5 and lets seeee\n\n* **Neutrogena beach defense sun stick water + sun protection SPF 50+**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs 1260 for 42 g (got it at Rs. 900 from amazon)\n\n**for skin types** : honestly, none lmao. I used it as a body stick most of the time with how oily this was. but can be used by anyone ig\n\n**texture and appearance** : whitish yellow stick. has a fruity kind of smell. really oily and greasy on first application that doesn't absorb or goes away after a while.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Polyethylene, Isohexadecane, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Ozokerite, Paraffin, Synthetic Beeswax, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Neopentyl Glycol Diisostearate, Dimethicone, Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Fragrance, BHT\n\n**filters** :\n\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n\noof this was an impulse purchase that I regretted later on. mind you, this is a great sunstick for your body but definitely not for your face . not to mention its waterproof . but the tapti garmi really just melts everything in its way and this is no exception. bhai itna chip chipa lagta hai i dont even feel like putting this on just because of the MoIsT feeling it gives. unless you're going to a pool or beach (as it suggests duh) , if you're okay with feeling like [that peanut butter baby](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.ie%2Flife%2Ffamily%2Fthis-peanut-butter-baby-is-sure-to-brighten-up-your-day-31499579.html&psig=AOvVaw0Qc7SXcD436wP5Ywrn_yJv&ust=1678212392776000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCIDzt77yx_0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) , then you can give it a try. it  does provide a good amount of product for the price and is a solid waterproof one fosho. but nahi jhela jata for some reason 😣😣😫\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\nme after buying and trying all of these to find my HG\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zzjpjrbly9ma1.gif\n\nbut it was fun doing this in a span of a few years and I finally got one that fits all my boxes . the BOJ one is seriously godsent for me ✨✨~~lets just ignore that it makes my wallet cry every time I buy it .~~ But id rather spend more on stuff that works than just hit and trials lmao. also I've gone past my obsession on using sun sticks as a whole since they require quite a lot of pressing while applying and the application just irritates my acne a lot 😫 imma finish the ones I have but I have no intentions on buying anymore from any brands (even though the minimalist and earth rhythm ones look good 🤡)more reviews to come! ill be doing one on stuff my dad will be bringing from the U.S in the next few weeks so do let me know if you'd like a follow up on those too! (~~why do i treat my posts like a sitcom😭).~~  and as always, any other questions, comments are always welcomed and so are dms!\n\nbyeeee 💖💖",

        "body": "also my post exceeded the word limit so here's some more lmao :\n\n   \n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF      50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n   \n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte      Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable      UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB      filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV      filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB      mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change",

Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n🐳 **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\n🐳 **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ✨ *manifestion* ✨ and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured. [I brought mine from this one.](https://instagram.com/_vivanka_chennai?igshid=5brie36vc4w2)\n\n\n\n🔵 **TONER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **DermaFique All Important Toner** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260\n\n🐳 **Application** : I got this transferred into a mist spray bottle because I quite enjoy the feeling of being spring irrigated. So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\n🐳 **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\n🔵 **SERUM** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (⚠️ensure the dropper doesn't touch your face⚠️) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n🐳 **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\n🐳 **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\n🔵 **MOISTURIZER** 🔵\n\n🔹**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice; Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\n🐳 **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\n🔹 **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\n🐳 **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔵 **SUNSCREEN** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\n🐳 **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\n🐳 **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\n🐳 **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you!

    "body": "Hwahae: It's a review/ranking app for Koreans for beauty-related things. I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!\n\nIngredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm really excited about this section. I'm not happy that Korea is and has been for years, swamped in pollution from the winds carrying it over. There is a lot of microdust and even people with resilient skin reported getting redness & severe irritation from the pollution. Everyone has to wear these giant masks, sometimes special ones, and limit their exposure to the world outside of their homes.*\n\n*So there has been a lot of push for soothing, calming products and \"clean\" ingredients. A lot more focus on repairing the skin barrier. So I'm excited about those, but not the fact that people have to suffer.*\n\n*I'll be bolding some of the soothing, repairing and/or skin-identical ingredients in the ingredient lists. I don't know every good ingredient, but I will bold the ones that I do know of. Some other beneficial ingredients as well.*\n\n*\\*Also got random pictures of the textures of the creams and the users who posted it.*\n\n*If you're interested in barrier repairing/replenishing as I am, here are some good quotes from Susan, from Swift Crafty Monkey blog:*\n\n>**Natural moisturizing factor (NMF)** is found within the corneocytes, and makes up 20% to 30% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum. It **consists of amino acids (40%), sodium PCA (12%), lactate (12%), urea (7%), ions (18.5%), sugars (like glycerol – 8.5%)**, and a few other things. These are water soluble [humectants](https://swiftcraftymonkey.blog/better-crafting-through-chemistry/) (meaning they draw water out of the atmosphere to our skin) that have a huge impact on the biochemical and mechanical properties of our skin. Having an adequate NMF level in our skin can prevent or reduce skin tightness, cracking, scaling, and flaking. It improves our skin’s plasticity (thanks to the interactions of the amino acids with keratin) and helps maintain skin’s barrier properties.  \n>  \n>**Filaggrin** is a really important protein found in our skin! ...When we are in more arid climates, the filaggrin breakdown increases to produce more NMF. More NMF is a good thing!  \n>  \n>The contents of the NMF do more than act as humectants. The lactate and potassium can affect the pH and stiffness of the stratum corneum. The lactic acid stimulates ceramide biosynthesis and improves barrier function. The [hyaluronic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan) (HA – picture to the left) maintains hydration and structural integrity of our skin. It also interacts with intercellular lipids and regulates the mechanical properties of the stratum corneum.  \n>  \n>\\[The strateum corneum lipids\\] make up about 15% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum, and contain about **40% to 50% ceramides, 20% to 25% cholesterol, 15% to 25% fatty acids** (those with C16 to C30 chain lengths, with C24 to C28 being the most common), and **5% to 10% cholesterol sulfate**.  \n>  \n>Oils with **linoleic or gamma-linoleic acid** are always welcomed by our skin (like sunflower, sesame seed, borage, evening primrose, rice bran, and others), especially in the winter.\n\n**Squalane, beeswax, lecithin, lanolin** are also good skin replenishing ingredients. Shea butter is very soothing and moisturizing, as well as having a lot of antioxidants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TOP CREAMS**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. \\[Dr. G\\] Red Blemish Clear Soothing Cream - 4.22/5 (9,894 Reviews)**\n\n70ml/36,000 KRW - $31.29\n\nWater (Aqua/Eau), **Glycerin**, Butylene Glycol, C 13-16 Isoparaffin, **Niacinamide**, C 12-14 Isoparaffin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Pentylene Glycol, Vinyl Dimethicone, Caprylyl Methicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Panthenol**, Acrylates/C 10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Tromethamine, **Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate,** Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, **Beta-Glucan, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside,** Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Epigallocatechin Gallate, **Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid.**\n\n*This line from this brand is extremely well-known and popular in Korea.

But ever since getting some high end Western skin care as gifts, I noticed that many of them actually have a lot of fermented/yeasty ingredients in them.\n\nBut I can't find much on the \\~science\\~ or evidence behind why ferments can be good for your skin. But I also wonder, since ferments aren't really a thing that majority of consumers in the Western market are looking out for (like fragrance, rose water, coconut water, rosehip oil, fruit/veggie extracts that have label/experience appeal, but aren't necessarily good for skin), why would these huge companies bother putting ferments in their expensive skin care if they didn't have evidence that they do SOMETHING?\n\nI especially am curious because AB/Korean beauty are sometimes looked down upon as just being trendy and not using ingredients that are scientifically proven to be truly beneficial for skin.\n\nDo you think ferments are legit?

Fermenting antioxidant rich ingredients such as ginseng, green tea etc. breaks down the antioxidants/complex molecules that are beneficial to our skin into smaller molecules, which allows it to be absorbed into the skin easily. Not only that, yeast/bacteria ferments produce additional metabolites (AHAs, peptides) that provide additional benefits such as whitening, hydration, skin repair, you name it!\n\nEdit: forgot to put my favorite fermented product!! I love the Manyo Factory Galactomyces Niacin Special treatment. :) \n\n2nd Edit: here are the links to some scientific literature articles on fermented cosmetics which were found through PubMed! You do need access to the database if you want to read them in its entirety, but you can get some brief information on the topic just through the abstract.\n\nFermenting red ginseng enhances its safety and efficacy as a novel skin care anti-aging ingredient: in vitro and animal study.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23126662\n \nEvaluation of tyrosinase inhibitory and antioxidant activities of Angelica dahurica root extracts for four different probiotic bacteria fermentations.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254340\n\nSkin resistance to UVB-induced oxidative stress and hyperpigmentation by the topical use of Lactobacillus helveticus NS8-fermented milk supernatant.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28598022\n\nBifidobacterium-fermented soy milk extract stimulates hyaluronic acid production in human skin cells and hairless mouse skin.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12637786",

Easy to spread texture for a natural, hydrated, shine-free finish leaving no white cast.\n\n*Fragrance free • Non-comedogenic • 50ml*  \nPrice- $499  \n \n\n**Ingredients**\n\n**Uvinul A Plus**\n\nThis Modern filter excels in protecting your skin from free radical and skin damage. Its Photostable nature provides continuous defence against the sun, while its excellent safety profile makes it perfect for all skin types, including the most sensitive. In the formula it not only promises potent UVA protection but also enhances the formula for broad-spectrum protection.\n\n**Tinosorb M**\n\nTinosorb M is an UV filter that revolutionises sun protection with its broad-spectrum coverage against both UVA and UVB rays, also provides even protection into visible (blue) light, Its dual-action mechanism not only absorbs but also scatters sunlight, offering unparalleled defence against the sun's harmful effects. Renowned for its photostability, it ensures long-lasting protection, maintaining its efficacy even under direct sunlight.\n\n**Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate**\n\nIt stands out as a UVB filter that effectively shields your skin from the sun rays. It's popular for its ability to prevent sunburn and protect against UV-induced damage. This UV filter is prized for its lightweight feel making daily application enjoyable without the greasiness.\n\nWater/Aqua, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Dimethicone, Ethoxydiglycol, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Diisopropyl Adipate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Isododecane, Pentylene Glycol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Acrylates/Polytrimethylsiloxymethacrylate Copolymer, Decyl Glucoside, Triethanolamine, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Propylene Glycol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Xanthan Gum  \n\n\n**Review**  \nSkin Type: Combination (Oily in T-zone), acne-prone, currently a bit dry due to acne medication  \nWeather: Pleasant, not hot enough to test sweat resistance  \nAge 25-30  \nTexture: Super watery in texture, close to the new Neutrogena Dry-Touch sunscreen.  \nApplication: for my skin, it blended easily, like a dream.  \nWhite Cast: My face is slightly darker than NC42 and most sunscreens leave a white cast including Minimalist SPF50. This left no white cast at all, I was pleasantly surprised.  \nWent out in the sun for an hour, no stinging/burning/tanning observed but that is too soon to judge.\n\nOverall: After application, it forms a slightly tight film which gives a glow to the face. I had slight barrier damage on my chin, it did not sting when I applied the sunscreen there but pilled after a while only in that area. I usually get sweaty on my nose post sunscreen application but that did not happen, it might be due to the pleasant weather. My skin feels slightly stretchy right now and lightly oily on my forehead  \nAM Routine today: Simple Moisturizing face wash-->.Cosrx propolis synergy toner-->Cosrx Vitamin C 23%-->Simple hydrating light moisturizer-->wait 5 minutes then sunscreen\n\n  \n**TL;DR**: I think I will repurchase this, it has great lab and human testing results, the texture and application seems great for summers for my skin and this is the first sunscreen which truly has no white cast for me. The last sunscreen to do this was Aqualogica which tanned me. (I don't mind tanning but it proved that it did not protect my skin). \n\nObviously YMMV but I hope this works for you. Feel free to ask any questions.",

Types of Hair Problems (3 Main Areas)\n\nAll common hair problems fall into one of these:\n\n1. **Hair Roots (Hair Below the Scalp)** – Hair fall, thinning, reduced density\n2. **Hair Strands (Hair Above the Scalp)** – Dryness, breakage, roughness\n3. **Scalp Issues** – Dandruff, oiliness, itching, inflammation\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# 🧠 2. Hair Root Care – Stop Hair Fall & Grow Stronger Hair\n\nHair fall starts when hair roots weaken or hair becomes thinner. If ignored, it leads to visible scalp and low density.\n\n🛑 **Step 1: Block DHT**\n\n* **Finasteride 1 mg/day** (tablet or topical): Blocks DHT (main reason for male hair loss).\n* Recommended if hair loss is **Stage 2 or more** on Norwood scale.\n\n**💉 Step 2: Improve Blood Flow to Hair Roots**\n\n* **Minoxidil 5%**: Increases blood supply to hair follicles, delivering more nutrients.\n* Apply once or twice daily.\n* For very early hair fall (Stage 1–2), some doctors prefer starting with **caffeine-based or peptide serums** first.\n\n**💊 Step 3: Provide Proper Nutrients**\n\nEven if blood supply increases, without the right nutrients, hair won’t grow strong. Include:\n\n|Supplement|Benefit|\n|:-|:-|\n|**Biotin**|Strengthens hair strands|\n|**Multivitamin (with Zinc, Vitamin D, and B-complex)**|Fixes hidden deficiencies|\n|**Omega-3 or Fish Oil**|Reduces inflammation, nourishes follicles|\n\n**🧪 Step 4: Peptide-Based Serums (for Root Stimulation)**\n\nThese serums contain **plant-based peptides and natural growth factors** that help activate weak or resting follicles without the side effects of stronger medications.\n\n|Serum|Key Ingredients|Benefits|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Redensyl**|DHQG + EGCG2|Activates hair stem cells, reduces hair fall|\n|**Capixyl**|Biomimetic peptide + red clover|Strengthens follicles, reduces inflammation|\n|**Anagain**|Pea sprout extract|Extends hair growth phase (anagen)|\n|**The Ordinary Multi-Peptide Hair Serum**|Blend of multiple peptides|Boosts density, nourishes scalp|\n\n✅ Best used **once daily** on a dry scalp. Can be combined with microneedling (1–2x/week) for better absorption.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# 💇‍♀️ 3. Hair Strand Care – Improve Hair Texture, Strength & Shine\n\nThis is the visible part of hair above the scalp. You need to:\n\n**🧴 Use Hair Oil (Carefully)**\n\n* Oil gives moisture and reduces breakage.\n* But **avoid putting oil on the scalp** too often — it can cause dandruff or feed fungus.\n* Apply oil **only on the hair length**, 1–2 times a week, and **wash off properly**.\n\n**🧼 Use Conditioner (Not on Scalp)**\n\n* After shampoo, apply conditioner **only on hair strands** to reduce dryness and tangles.\n\n**💆 Use Hair Mask (Deep Conditioning Treatment)**\n\nHair masks are like super-conditioners. Use them 1–2 times a week to:\n\n* Deeply moisturize dry hair\n* Make hair soft, smooth, and shiny\n* Reduce frizz and split ends\n\n🧴 Choose masks with ingredients like coconut oil, argan oil, shea butter, keratin, or aloe vera.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# 🧴 4.

Hard Water vs Soft Water\n\n# 🔹 Hard Water (contains high levels of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals):\n\n* **Effects on Hair:**\n   * Leaves behind mineral deposits on hair strands.\n   * Causes **dry, rough, dull, and brittle hair**.\n   * Can lead to **more hair breakage and tangling**.\n* **Effects on Scalp:**\n   * **Clogs scalp pores**, leading to dandruff or scalp acne.\n   * May cause **itching or irritation**.\n   * Reduces the effectiveness of shampoo and conditioner (hair doesn’t feel clean).\n\n# 🔹 Soft Water (low mineral content):\n\n* **Effects on Hair:**\n   * Makes hair feel **softer and smoother**.\n   * Helps shampoos and conditioners work better.\n   * Prevents mineral buildup, making hair **shinier and more manageable**.\n* **Effects on Scalp:**\n   * Gentle on the scalp.\n   * Helps maintain **natural oil balance**.\n\n# 🌡️ 2. Water Temperature\n\n* **Hot Water:**\n   * Strips natural oils from hair and scalp.\n   * Can cause **dryness, itching, and frizz**.\n   * May weaken hair roots over time.\n* **Cold or Lukewarm Water:**\n   * Retains natural oils.\n   * Helps **seal the hair cuticle**, making hair shinier and smoother.\n   * Best for the final rinse.\n\n# 🧪 3. Chlorinated Water (Swimming Pools)\n\n* Damages the hair shaft.\n* Causes **dryness, discoloration (especially in colored hair), and split ends**.\n* Irritates the scalp and worsens **scalp sensitivity or dandruff**.\n\n# ✅ Solutions if You Have Hard Water\n\n* Install a **shower filter** that removes minerals and chlorine. (or use filtered water from water purifier only for hair wash)\n* Use **chelating or clarifying shampoos** once a week (they remove mineral buildup).\n* Rinse with **apple cider vinegar + water (1:4 ratio)** to remove residue.\n* Apply **deep conditioning masks** to restore moisture.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# # Is Finasteride Safe? Can You Take It Without Doctor Consultation?\n\n**Finasteride** (commonly used for male pattern baldness at **1 mg/day**) is generally **effective and relatively safe** when taken correctly - but **it should NOT be taken without a doctor’s consultation**, especially for long-term use.\n\n# 🔍 Why You Need Doctor Consultation\n\nFinasteride changes your **hormone levels** by reducing DHT (dihydrotestosterone), the hormone responsible for hair loss. Since it alters your body's chemistry, a doctor should:\n\n* Assess if it’s safe based on your medical history\n* Decide the right **dose** and **form** (oral vs. topical)\n* Monitor side effects and hormone balance\n\n# ✅ Is Low-Dose Finasteride (1 mg/day) Safe?\n\nYes, **low-dose Finasteride (1 mg/day)** is considered **relatively safe for most healthy adult men**, especially under medical guidance. In fact, this is the **standard dose** used to treat androgenetic alopecia (male pattern baldness).\n\nBut even low doses **can have side effects**—though not everyone experiences them.\n\n# ⚠️ Common Side Effects (in 1–10% of users)\n\n* Low libido (reduced sexual desire)\n* Erectile dysfunction\n* Reduced semen volume\n* Breast tenderness or enlargement\n* Depression or mood changes\n\nThese are often **mild and reversible** if the drug is stopped.\n\n# ⚠️ Rare but Serious Risks\n\n* **Post-Finasteride Syndrome (PFS)** – Persistent sexual, neurological, or psychological symptoms after stopping (very rare, still debated)\n* Gynecomastia (male breast growth)\n* Severe depression or anxiety (in rare cases)\n\n# 👨‍⚕️ Who Should Avoid Finasteride Without Supervision\n\n* People with **liver issues**\n* History of **depression or sexual dysfunction**\n* **Those planning to conceive soon** (Finasteride may affect sperm in rare cases)\n* **Women and children** (especially pregnant women)\n\n# 🔍 Monitoring Required If You Take It\n\n* **DHT levels** (optional, but helpful)\n* **Liver function tests**\n* **Prostate exam** (PSA levels can be falsely lowered)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n#

This comprehensive guide is the result of that effort. I hope it helps you in your hair care journey.)\n\n(used gpt for help)\n\n(let me know if I have missed anything, I am trying to make a complete guide for hair care)",

Allow me to correct it from using what is proven and in accordance with my knowledge. \n\nA) In section 1. Types of Hair problems. The root cause of both hairloss, hair thinning, breakage and Density is all causes by DHT. DHT is a useless harmone in adults which is converted from testosterone (good harmone) with an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase (5AR). So all those problems are solved by Finasteride which is 5AR1 inhibitor.\nRegarding scalp with dandruff and flaking problem - 1% ketoconazole is enough. \nAnd that is all \n\nReferences:\n\n1) Shin J, Chung E, Kim M, Kim T, Kim W, Huh C. Evaluation of long‐term efficacy of finasteride in Korean men with androgenetic alopecia using the basic and specific classification system.

Journal of Dermatological Treatment. 2022;33(4):1938-1946. doi:10.1080/09546634.2021.1959506\n\nAnd here you go. This is all you need to solve all the problems mentioned in section 1. \n\nB) Bloodflow Theory - This theory stated a century ago that bludflow restriction caused by wearing tight hats and creating tension in scalp is the reason for male pattern baldness. this theory has been overused till this day to sell Nonsense products. This theory has been debunked over century ago (1916) by Dorothy Osborn. \n\nReferences : \n1) Osborn D. INHERITANCE OF BALDNESS. Journal of Heredity. 1916;7(8):347-355. doi:10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a110746\n\n2) Nor does wearing Hats or Helmets cause any damage to hair. Here is the study : \nTellez-Segura R. Involvement of Mechanical Stress in Androgenetic Alopecia. Int J Trichology. 2015;7(3):95-99. doi:10.4103/0974-7753.167468 \n\n3) Shoemaker JK, Tiidus PM, Mader R.

Med Sci Sports Exerc. 1997;29(5):610-614. doi:10.1097/00005768-199705000-00004\n\nConclusion : Never drive bike without Helmet and caps when going out in sun without any worries of Bludflow. \n\nC) Supplements are called supplements because they are not FDA approved. When it is not FDA approved, companies can put anything in it without having to disclose the proper composition. So it's best to avoid them or take FDA approved vitamins. Imo just finasteride is enough to solve all hairloss problems. \n\nD) Microneedling does not work as a standalone treatment nor is it safe as a long term usage. it is observed in 3 studies that Microneedling combined with  topical 5%minoxidil has more efficacy than just standalone microneedling and topical minoxidil. This is because the efficacy of minoxidil increases due to channels in epidermis caused by microneedling. \nThere is no standardized protocol for microneedling, so anyone can just dismiss the ineffectiveness of microneedling using No-true Scotsman falacy even when there is compelling evidence to prove otherwise. \nBasically Microneedling is causing inflammation in the scalp and in long term it will become chronic inflammation. Ultimately creating Scar tissue in scalp resulting in a similar situation to what androgenetic alopecia does to scalp. \nI.e back to square one.\nApplying Tretinoin is better than microneedling along with minoxidil to give maximum benefits to hair growth.\n\nReferences: \n1) Chronic inflammation in the etiology of disease across the life span\nDavid Furman et al. Nat Med. 2019 Dec.\n\n2) Unusual Presentation of Tinea Corporis Associated With the Use of a Microneedling Device\nNélia Margarida Martins da Cunha et al. Aesthet Surg J. 2017.\n\nE) Stop using oils if your scalp is already oily. Adding more oils will not benifit in any way. It may even create more grounds for fungal infections.",

        "body": "Please for the love of Hairs, stop asking GPT and Reddit on hair care routine. It never ends well. Consult a proper Dermat (not someone who says to rub oil) and monitor your scalp condition. \n\nWhat has worked for me : \n1. 1mg finasteride orally per day keeps the hair transplant doctor away. ( Only Finasteride/Dutasteride will cure your hairfall issue which is caused by DHT- a useless harmone in adults (useful until puberty passes). \n\n2. Ketoconazole %1 shampoo (%1 is already most effective and strong. Using 2% is overkill unless you suffer from severe case of seborrheic dermatitis. I use it once or twice a week.\n\n3. Never needed topical Minoxidil but it helps only in compliment with Finasteride. Never used minoxidil alone as it does not solve the hairloss issue.\n\n4. I use Tresemme sulphate free shampoo + conditioner for regular use. \n\n5. When I don't use conditioner, I use Kraves wax for styling along with a cold air blower.(Only occasionally)\n\n6. I don't use any oils because my scalp is oily. Applying more will worsen the dandruff problem. \n\n\nThings to Note : \n1. No other serum works unless it does have proper clinical trials and meta analysis studies on it.\n\n2. Never fall for all natural and organic scams. They do not work. be skeptical. Never be blinded by a brand and Fake doctors who claim ridiculous 'CURES'. They do so because people fear drugs and they don't have any evidence or proof of the efficacy. \n\n3. Depending on food and diet as your only way to fight the Slap head curse is a bad idea. Food is food not a medicine. Just because our ancestors used it, does not mean it's good. Our ancestors did not have knowledge nor the protocols for developing cures and conducting clinical trials. \nThe most heinous diseases like TB black death, Hairloss etc have been cured by Pharmaceuticals. So don't fear drugs.\n\n4. DON'T use microneedling. It will cause scar tissue in your scalp which will permanently remove any chance of you growing new hair in that area.\n\n5. Exercise is a must. Never skip a leg day.",

    "body": " This is my first review on here, so I'm still trying to find my style and all that but I hope to post more reviews in the future!\n\nAnyway, onto the product.\n\n**WHY I BOUGHT IT**\n\nI bought this based upon recommendations from this sub, where I have heard people rave about it, as well as over on r/SkincareAddiction as well. This was also recommended by Cyrille Laurent - he absolutely adores this moisturiser and constantly raves about it. If you don't know who he is, he's still fairly small on Youtube and Instagram and he has a Biology PhD, so his videos and content tends to focus on what is supported by science. I find him a really valuable source of information alongside LabMuffin, Dr Ginza, The Eco Well and Skinchemy. I was looking for a new moisturiser at the time and this seemed to fit the bill really well.\n\n**MY SKIN TYPE/CONCERNS**\n\nI have pretty dry skin, and I do tend to get quite sweaty from exercise as well. I'm prone to blackheads and clogged pores on my nose, and I also get some closed comedones on my chin. I'm sensitive to fragrance and essential oils as they tend to cause some stinging and and cause acne.\n\n**HOW/WHERE I BOUGHT IT**\n\nAs I live in the UK, this is available at Boots (basically a drugstore) for £19.50 for 40g, which is a little pricey but honestly not too bad as I didn't have to pay shipping.\n\n**HOW LONG I'VE BEEN USING IT FOR**\n\nI've been using this for 3 1/2 weeks, which I think is pretty much long enough for a moisturiser. I patch-tested this first as well.\n\n**INGREDIENTS LIST**\n\n*Water/Aqua, Glycerin, Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide, Cyclopentasiloxane, Squalane, Trisiloxane, Dimethicone, PEG-3 Dimethicone, Allantoin, Magnesium Sulfate, Butylene Glycol, Isostearyl Glyceryl Ether, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Succinic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Bis-Methoxypropylamido Isodocosane, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Tocopherol, Methylparaben*\n\nIt does contain eucalyptus extract, which could contain some fragrant components, however it is low down on the ingredients list - just something to be aware of if you have very sensitive skin and tend to avoid all fragrant extracts and hydrosols.\n\nThe eucalyptus extract is [reported by the manufacturer KAO](https://web.kao.com/sg/curel/ceramide_care/) as being able to boost the skin's production of ceramides.\n\nIt contains a pseudoceramide (*Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide),* which tbh I trust more than improperly formulated ceramides, as well as allantoin, a great soothing ingredient at a concentration of 0.5%. Squalane and tocopherol as well as the classic humectant glycerin are also included. This does contain silicones, which is something to be mindful of, however my skin really enjoys the texture of silicone-containing products and the smoothing effect.\n\n**SCENT**\n\nAs one should expect, not much scent aside from a slight chemical-ish scent which disappears extremely quickly.\n\n**TEXTURE**\n\nThe texture of this is very light and fluffy, yet slightly wet. Not liquid at all, so it is very easy to scoop out from the packaging. On your skin, as you apply it it quickly sinks in very smoothly and feels invisible on the skin. Not sticky at all (yay!)\n\n**EXPERIENCE/EFFECTS**\n\nI have seen a massive difference in the plumpness and hydration since using this cream. My skin is so much plumper and less dehydrated. When I wake up in the morning, my skin feels smooth and soft, practically glowing. Honestly, I'm not sure I could wish for more in a moisturiser - it goes above and beyond to do the job and keep your skin hydrated.\n\nIt hasn't broken me out, irritated my skin OR clogged my pores (a win in my book!)\n\n**OVERALL THOUGHTS**\n\nHonestly, I couldn't rave about this moisturiser any more. My skin has never felt so good - I didn't even realise how dry and dehydrated my skin was until I started using this.\n\nI would probably suggest this to dry and normal skin types looking for good hydration but a light and elegant texture. This might work for combo skin in the colder/drier months as well.\n\nThis is definitely a HG product for me - I'm not sure what other moisturisers could top this, but maybe I'll try some more one day.\n\n**10/10 - I recommend this product if you want a light and fluffy texture, fragrance-free, very hydrating, overall plumping effect!**",

The answer will be in the comments.  \n\nHopefully I got enough pictures with different lighting. These are all different stages of my routine in the morning.\n\n\nSCENT:\n\nIt has been mentioned in this sub that the DT serum smells like pee. For me it has a clean, neutral scent. I would assume those were bad batches. \n\nIf I were to compare the two, I think Kérastase smells better. It also has a pleasant scent that lingers on my hair for a couple hours. DT does not linger, probably because it’s so neutral.\n\nSecond opinion: \nI asked my boyfriend to smell it too without context, he has a more sensitive nose than me. He stated that it doesn’t smell bad, I asked him if it reminded him of anything and he said it doesn’t. I told him that it smells like a clean scent to me and he agreed. \n\nThen I explained the rumor about it on Reddit and he said:\n“No, it doesn’t smell like urine. I am well acquainted” (referencing my dogs lol)\n\nSo do with that information what you will, maybe he’s just being agreeable 😂 but rest assured, you now have two more opinions on the scent. I would say to smell yours before applying to the hair just in case. I’ll update this post if there are any changes as I use it.\n\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\nDollar Tree (from the bottle):\nWATER, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, GLYCERIN, PHENOXYETHANOL, POLYQUATERNIUM-37,\nPROPYLENE GLYCOL, CYCLOHEXASILOXANE, DIMETHICONE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, PEG-20 STEARATE, STEARTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, FRAGRANCE, C13-16 ISOPARAFFIN, TRIDECETH-6 ACOHOL, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) OIL, DIMETHYL STEARANINE, HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN, ARGANIA SPINOSA KERNEL OIL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, PANTHENOL\n\nKérastase (from their website):\nAqua / Water / Eau ● Dimethicone ● C13-16 Isoalkane ● Niacinamide ● Glycerin ● Polyacrylamide ● Phenoxyethanol ● C13-14 Isoalkane ● Laureth-7 ● Panthenol ● Ascorbyl Glucoside ● Butylene Glycol ● Linalool ● Hydroxycitronellal ● Benzyl Salicylate ● Benzyl Alcohol ● Hexyl Cinnamal ● Citronellol ● Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein ● Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone ● Coumarin ● Hydrolyzed Corn Protein ● Hydrolyzed Soy Protein ● Limonene ● Iris Florentina Root Extract ● Citric Acid ● Ci 19140 / Yellow 5 ● Ci 14700 / Red 4 ● Parfum / Fragrance\n\nOne notable difference in the ingredients is the addition of niacinamide in the Kérastase. Niacinamide is supposed to promote hair growth when used on the scalp. But if you are anything like me, I don’t apply serums all the way to the scalp, I start them from about the middle of my hair through the ends. \n\nBased on this, I do not believe niacinamide is especially helpful in the Kérastase. Niacinamide is probably more helpful in shampoos and scalp products (And now I’m tempted to use a certain DT niacinamide/squalane serum in my hair instead of on my face 🤣)\n\n\nPRICE:\n\nKérastase: $60/3.04 fluid oz, or $19/oz\n\nDollar Tree: $1.25/4 fluid oz, or 31¢/oz\n\n\nTEXTURE:\n\nI put these next to each other on the back of my hand. Kérastase has more of a serum feel, it’s clear/yellow upon application, and it has a little more of an oily texture. DT starts out a little thicker and looks white/creamy at first, then it blends out to be sheer. With both products, I rub them between my hands before applying to hair. \n\n\nMETHOD:\n\nLast night I did my normal shower routine, including a clarifying shampoo and a moisturizing conditioner. I’ve been using this particular duo of products for about 6 months. \n\nI let my hair dry for a couple of hours and applied one serum on each side, washing my hands between applications. Then I put my hair in braids for the night. I didn’t use any other leave-in products before taking pictures.\n\nIn the morning I took out the braids, hand-combed them, brushed through them, and then did some touch-ups to the ends with my curling iron, taking pictures throughout every step. \n\nSo let me know what you think and I’ll put my final thoughts in the comments!

Both sides of my hair look shiny and hydrated. The ends feel great. They are equally manageable. The dollar tree side MIGHT have a little more shine to it, or it could be the angle of my camera.\n\nI seriously can’t tell a difference besides the fragrance (I had to keep smelling each side to make sure I had them right) and the fragrance is not worth $58.25 to me. So you know where I’ll be spending my money.",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

    "body": "Sharing my post here as well. Recently, I had posted requesting dupes for Bite's Agave Lip Mask as it is now being discontinued. This stuff is ride or die lip salvation for me. I live somewhere super dry, work in a dry environment, take meds that dry me out, you get the picture. I'm a moisture junkie. I gathered the piece that works is the lanolin in it so I tried some similar products and wrote some reviews of them.\n\n[Here](https://imgur.com/kV6xjSG) are the products I've tried. Not pictured is the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, which I emptied and tossed the container.  From left to right I have the Bite lip mask, Lanolips Lanostick, Lanolips 101 ointment, Glossier Balm Dotcom in 3 flavors (original, birthday cake, and rose), Go-To Lips, Jack Black, Aquaphor, and Vaseline.\n\n**Bite Agave Lip Mask** 10/10\n\n    Ingredients: Trans-Resveratrol, Lanolin (Pharma Grade), Organic Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Organic Butyrospermum, Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Rosinate, Organic Agave Tequilana (Blue Agave) Nectar, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil Unsaponifiables, Organic Cera Alba (Beeswax), Flavor, Vanillin, Siraitia Grosvernori (Monk Fruit), Vanilla Tahitensis (Vanilla) Fruit Extract, Organic Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Trans-resveratrol, Vitis Vinefera (Grape) Oil, Tocopherol Acetate, Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, and Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, +/- May Contain: Mica (CI 77019), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Carmine (CI 75470).\n\nI think what has done it for me with this one is the occlusive elements as well as moisturizers. I can see it has oils and lanolin plus beeswax. I like the thick texture which is almost sticky as well as the tube packaging. I personally like the absence of SPF as when I am really chapped those can sting/burn my lips. I also really like the smell/taste of the original. The small tube lasts a long time and it saves me a lot of discomfort in the dry winters, especially working in a hospital with all the recycled air. \n\n**Lanolips Lanostick** 8/10\n\n    Lanolin*, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil*, capryloyl glycerin/sebacic acid copolymer*, cera alba (beeswax)*, caprylic/capric triglyceride*, persea gratissima (avocado) oil*, jojoba esters (simmondsia chinensis)*, aroma (nat flavour)*, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter*, euphorbia cerifera (candelilla) cera*, magnifera indica (mango) seed butter*, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil*, copernicia cerifera (carnauba) cera*, tocopherol (vit E)* *100% natural/naturel\n    \nI feel like this one on the lips is very similar in feel to the Bite. It is probably my favorite of the dupes that I've tried. It has a lot of similar ingredients such as the lanolin, castor oil, beeswax, shea butter, and some other oils. It has a different flavor/scent than the Bite mask. It is almost citrus in nature? I think I can see myself using this one once I go through my stash of Bite (thanks to the redditor who messaged me saying Sephora kept restocking, I was able to snag some). My complaint? The fact it is a stick and not a tube! I haven't lost the cap of this in my pocket yet but that happens to me with regular sticks. I also worry the stick will break because it gets too soft from being stored in my pocket. All in all the best dupe so far.  It also got me through days at the hospital without wanting to rip my lips off my face so win.\n\n**Lanolips 101 Ointment** 7/10\n\n    Ingredients: Lanolin, lanolin oil. *naturally derived/*Dérivé naturellement.\n\nI got this one because I was already ordering from Ulta and was able to use a coupon and my points, I imagine it is basically the same as the nipple creams and other straight up lanolin out there. It is good. Tube is nice. Cap doesn't stay on super great. No color or flavor so I can use it for my cuticles and other dry patches. I can't complain but I'm not gonna sing out from the rooftops or anything like that. You can get lanolin only products much cheaper for much more product elsewhere. It does do its job locking in moisture though.\n\n**Glossier Balm Dotcom** 8/10\n\n    Ingredients: Petrolatum, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Beeswax/Cera Alba/Cire d’Abeille, Lanolin, Theobroma Grandiflorum Seed Butter, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, BHT, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol.\n\nI know I originally wanted to avoid petroleum based products but I did have a sample of it that I liked well enough so I got the 3 pack on Glossier's site to try the other flavors. Original seems to be more sticky than the other flavors and feels more like the Bite mask. It does a good enough job, the flavors are fun. I like the tube packaging. The rose is so much better than the perfume co. rose balm which is rose flavored vaseline. I feel like it did a good job moisturizing and lasting to lock in the moisture while I was at work too.\n\n**Go-to Lips** 4/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tUltra Medical Grade Lanolin, Shea Butter, Apricot Kernel Oil, Beeswax, Sweet Almond Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Vitamin E, Fragrance (Pure Pomegranate), Pomegranate Seed Oil, Calendula Oil, Jojoba Oil, Avocado Oil.\n\nI think I might be rating this lower because I had higher expectations for it. The ingredients sound great. Its in a nice tube. But its so slippery, it feels like a lip oil on the lips instead of a balm or sticky mask. It has a strong scent/flavor but it isn't unpleasant. Its so messy out of the tube though because it is so slick! I wasn't looking for an oil so I'm a little bummed. I can't say it doesn't moisturize my lips though but it doesn't have the staying power to make use of the occlusives in it. \n\n**Jack Black Lip Balm** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tBeeswax, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, C 18-38 Alkyl Hydroxystearol Stearate, Camellia Sinenesis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Flavor, Lanolin, Microcrystalline Wax, Ozokerite, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Polyglyceryl 3 Beeswax, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n\nPretty middle of the road chapstick. Theres some beeswax, some lanolin, some shea butter. It has SPF though which is a negative for me for a day to day balm. I guess there isn't a lot wrong with it, it doesn't dry me out but if I am dry it stings. Its a little slicker than Bite too. I got it awhile ago as a sample and it just didn't wow me but it is a popular item.\n\n**Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy** 5/10\n\n    Active ingredient: Petrolatum (41%) – Skin protectant Inactive ingredients: Mineral Oil, Ceresin, Lanolin Alcohol, Panthenol, Glycerin, Bisabolol\n\nI use this at work when I leave chapstick at home because we have samples of it everywhere. It's good for prevention of radiation dermatitis if you're into that sort of thing. It has no flavor, no taste. Its slippery and greasy feeling due to the high petroleum content. It's a solid product in general just not for my dream chapstick replacement. Good stuff though. Will continue to have on hand.\n\n**Vaseline Lip Therapy Advanced Healing** 2/10\n\n    Active ingredient: White Petroleum, USP 100%. Inactive ingredient: Flavor.\n\nLiterally marked up vaseline. What makes it more advanced than regular Vaseline?? Doesn't do much for me but vaseline never did. I bought it from the pharmacy at work when I left my chapstick at home. I do like the tube so I guess it isn't pointless. \n\n**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tDiisostearyl Malate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytosteryl / Isostearyl / Cetyl / Stearyl / Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polybutene, Microcrystalline Wax / Cera Microcristallina / Cire Microcristalline, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Synthetic Wax, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax / Candelilla Cera / Cire de Candelilla, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Butylene / Ethylene / Styrene Copolymer, Ethylene / Propylene / Styrene Copolymer, Mica (CI 77019), Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Dimethicone, Fragrance / Parfum, Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Methicone, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax / Cera Carnauba / Cire de Carnauba, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Yellow 6 Lake (CI 15985), Red 6 (CI 15850), Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Water, Potassium Alginate, Propanediol, Glycerin, Alcohol, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Sapindus Mukorossi Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Chamaemorus Seed Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Chenopodium Quinoa Seed Extract, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Beta-Glucan, Manganese Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Ascorbyl Glucoside.\n\nOk at the risk of sounding crunchy granola AF what the hell is some of the stuff in this? Why does there need to be a million things in this? Theres some shea butter, some synthetic wax, other wax, silicones, and other stuff in it. No lanolin or petroleum. If you're allergic to lanolin its probably good. It's not bad. It's a little too slippery for my likes in a lip product. It doesn't stay on a long time. It doesn't seem to moisturize better than any other product. It doesn't seem to hurt my lips. I don't like the little tub it comes in because I don't want to wash my hands every time I wanna put lip balm on. It costs a little much for what it is for me. \n\n\n**Closing Arguments** *TL;DR*\n\nWhile Bite may be my ride or die, it's going the way of the dinosaur. Lanolips has good products, the lanostick might be the most similar in terms of ingredients/feel although the packaging is different. Glossier's balm is suitable too although it does have petroleum in it. Most of these products do have lanolin and/or beeswax in them so they aren't suitable for vegans. \n\nI'd love to hear if there are any I missed trying, despite having tons of chapstick I am a chapstick junkie so I'd be interested to hear!",

        "body": "First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair lip balm is my HG for dry lips. It’s a very thick, almost sticky, balm-mask. I usually have to warm a little of the product on my finger before applying it because it is so thick. It has a very slightly minty scent and a slight cooling sensation on application. It comes in a small tin, and one tin lasts me approximately a year of twice daily use. I also work in a hospital environment, and this is the only balm that has ever adequately protected my lips from the dry hospital air. It’s also currently $10 (half off) on their website. Thanks to you, I looked it up so I could post the ingredients and saw the sale so I’ll probably stock up on a little more!\n\n\nThe ingredients are: Cera Alba (Beeswax, Cire d'abeille), Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Water/Aqua/Eau, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Lecithin, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Glycerin, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Colloidal Oatmeal, Dimethicone, Aroma (Flavor), Urea, Mel (Honey, Miel), Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Propolis Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Allantoin, Vanilla Planifolia Fruit Extract, Butylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Sodium Hydroxide, EDTA, Eugenol.",

I usually use whatever face lotion I'm using at night on my lips and then put my lanolips on. If my lips are really dry (I just got a crack today so will do tonight) I'll use some First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair cream on my lips then the Lanolips. This helps SO MUCH!

    "body": "First of all, these are a list of products available in Boots that I've found, so they're non-exhaustive. Apart from some Neutrogena products and No7 Beautiful Skin Blemish Defence Serum, they contain \"alcohol denat.\", which is a dealbreaker for me as I try to avoid drying alcohols as much as I can. \n\nBHAs are few and very far in between, in addition to not being labelled as such and most probably without the percentage of salicylic acid contained or whether it's in the right pH to be effective. \n\nI haven't done a price comparison, and since I found them in Boots I've used the online site's price point. Prices are only as a guide, they may be cheaper/more expensive elsewhere. Ingredients are highlighted to point out the position of salicylic acid, as well as presence of drying alcohols and parfum for those irritated by them. \n\nAdditional suggestions, opinions and reviews are very welcome!\n\n* PRODUCT: Boots Skin Clear Deep Blackhead Cleansing Lotion\n\nPRICE: £2.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua (Water), **Alcohol denat.**, **Salicylic acid**, PPG-1-PEG-9 lauryl glycol ether, Butylene glycol, Potassium hydroxide, Ammonium glycyrrhizate, **Parfum (Fragrance)**, Dipropylene glycol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Deep Cleansing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.29 for 65 exfoliating pads\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat., Salicylic Acid,** Isoceteth-20, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Hydroxide, Triethanolamine, Allantoin, **Parfum**, **Menthol**, Benzyl Salicylate, Disodium EDTA, Limonene, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Pads\n\nPRICE: 5.39 for 65 pads\n\nINGREDIENTS:Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, **Salicylic Acid**, Hydrogen Peroxide, **Parfum**, Sodium Hydroxide, Dextrin, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben.\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Superfruits Refreshing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.07\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, Glycerin, **Salicylic Acid**, **Parfum**, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Sodium Hydroxide, Propylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Citric Acid, Limonene, Citronellol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Hexyl Cinnamal, Rubus Idaeus Juice, Trideceth-9, Vaccinium Macrocarpon Fruit Juice, Geraniol, Bisabolol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Garnier Pure Active line (various)\n\nPRICE: from £4.99 to £7.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: I can't find an ingredients list anywhere, which is frustrating but as a guide, I remember putting all the Garnier products down because they contain \"Alcohol Denat.\" The packaging lists 2% salicylic acid. No info on pH level. \n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: No7 Beautiful Skin Blemish Defence Serum\n\nPRICE: £16.00\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua (Water), Glycerin, **Salix Nigra (Willow) Bark Extract**, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Citric Acid, Butylene Glycol, Propylene Glycol, Methylparaben, Sodium Citrate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Lupinus Albus Seed Extract, Tetrasodium EDTA, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, Butylparaben, Ethylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Propylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7.\n\nNOTE: As far as I know, willowback extract works as a weaker form of salicylic acid, so I really can't comment on whether there's enough of it to be effective (or if it's in the right pH!), but hey, no alcohols as far as I can see! \n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: No7 Beautiful Skin Pore Minimising Serum\n\nPRICE: £16.00\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua(Water), **Alcohol denat.**, Cyclopentasiloxane, Glycerin, HDI/trimethylol hexyliactone cross polymer, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, Dimethicone crosspolymer, Octyldodecanol, Acrylamide/ammonium acrylate copolymer, **Alcohol, Salicylic acid**, Butylene glycol, Polyisobutene, Phenoxyethanol, PEG-30 dipolyhydroxtstearate, Octyldodecylxyloside, Hamamelis virginiana (Witch hazel) water, **Parfum (Fragrance)**, Lens esculenta fruit extract, Sodium PCA, Tocopheryl acetate, Retinyl palmitate, Sorbitan isostearate, Polysorbate 20, Ascorbyl glucoside, Silica, Tetrasodium EDTA, Magnesium PCA, Dipropylene glycol, Spiraea ulmaria extract, Zinc PCA, Potassium hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Manganese PCA, Potassium sorbate, Tocopherol.\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Neutrogena Visibly Clear Oil-Free Moisturiser\n\nPRICE: £4.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, Propylene Glycol, Clycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, **Salicylic Acid**, AloeBarbadensis, Chamomilla Recutita, Menthyl Lactate, Glyceryl Stearate, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, PEG-100 Stearate, Sodium Isostearoyl Lactylate, Propylene Glycol Isostearate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Carbomer, Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Probylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, **Parfum**.\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Neutrogena Visibly Clear Spot Stress Control 3-in-1 Daily Cleansing Lotion\n\nPRICE: £3.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Butylene Glycol, **Salicylic Acid**, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract, Cucumis Sativus Fruit Extract, C12-15 Alkyl Lactate, Cetyl Lactate, Glycerin, Potassium Lactate, **Isopropyl Alcohol**, Sodium Benzotriazolyl Butylphenol Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Sodium Citrate, Lactic Acid, Sodium Chloride, Disodium EDTA, Benzalkonium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, **Parfum**, Cl 17200, Cl 19140, Cl 42090.\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Neutrogena VISIBLY CLEAR Blackhead Eliminating Cleansing Lotion\n\nPRICE: £3.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, Glycerin, **Salicylic Acid**, Menthyl Lactate, **Parfum**\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Neutrogena VISIBLY CLEAR Pink Grapefruit Oil-Free Moisturiser\n\nPRICE: £4.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Cetyl Alcohol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Stearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, **Salicylic Acid**, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Cetyl Lactate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, C12-15 Alkyl Lactate, Dimethicone, Sodium Isostearoyl Lactylate, Propylene Glycol Isostearate, **Alcohol Denat.**, **Isopropyl Alcohol**, Myristyl Alcohol, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Chloride, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Lactic Acid, Benzalkonium Chloride, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, **Parfum**.\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Neutrogena Visibly Clear Spot Stress Control Hydrating Spot Treatment (note: currently using this as my BHA, tell me if you want a review.

While I could see the improvements, it would feel like my skin was burning. I'm not sure if it's due to the age of the bottle, or just the ingredients, but I discontinued use.\n\nThen I bought *Boots Skin Clear Deep Cleansing Lotion* which is exactly the same as the Blackhead version just with an extra word on the front. It feels just like[ L'Occitaine's Shea Butter Toner](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8adf20777.html) that's alcohol free, but a month in and I don't really feel like it's doing anything.\n\nI used to use Neutrogena a lot and I really liked their grapefruit range, but the *Neutrogena VISIBLY CLEAR Pink Grapefruit Oil-Free Moisturiser* stopped being effective far too quickly. It goes on really light which I like, but after a while my skin either feels dry, or really oily. I felt it was super hit and miss.\n\nWith the Neutrogena Visibly Clear Spot Stress Control Hydrating Spot Treatment, is that just on acne, do you put it on under moisturiser or as a moisturiser?",

I'm a lurker on this sub reddit ever since my skin started breaking out again (late 20s - my skin hasn't been this bad in a long time, hopefully just pre-wedding stress!), largely because I can't comment on/get hold of most of the products. \n\nI quite like the Boots Clear Skin range - their face scrub is something I've actually used until the dregs at the end. I accidentally bought their face wash instead of replacing my scrub, and haven't tried it as yet. Hoping it'll be as good as the scrub is - think it really helped my break outs. Will definitely try the lotion! \n\nI only tend to by No 7 stuff when they do their vouchers, or when it's in the sale, so might hold out until then!",

    "body": "As the title suggests, this is my current sunscreen collection, and I'll be reviewing the products and mentioning the ones I love and the ones I don't ! (This post might be half cooked, not very organised and all over the place, but it's my first time, so bear with me :P) \n\nSo as I mentioned, this is my first post here (eeep! :D) and initially I thought of sharing my entire shelfie, but I realised that being the junkie/hoarder I am, it'd end up being a terribly long post , hence after much deliberation I decided to post different categories of products separately  (sunscreens, moisturisers, serums etc) and after I'm done with that, I shall be making a post with only the products I use in my  current skincare routine!\n\nWithout further adieu let's get started! Please do like, share,  subscribe and don't forget to hit the bell icon!... lmao jk\n\n**Skin Type** : Oily - Combination, Comedonal Acne Prone, Rosacea Prone,\n\n**Major skin concerns** : Hypersensitivity, Non inflammatory acne, Sebum Production. \n\n**Age** : Early - Mid 20s, F\n\n**Current Climatic Conditions** : Semi- Arid, Dry winter \n\nSpecie : Homo Sapien\n\nHeight : wait.. I'm not supposed to divulge all these details! \n\n**Product reviews** :\n\n*Note* : None of these products have been used by me on a strictly daily basis, except for a week (or two) in a row during vacations, as I rarely step out of the house (lockdown, duh!) and don't apply sunscreen indoors (\\*gaasp\\* 😨)   \n Rest assured, I've reapplied some when out, and have used them on and off in a span of 6 months. \n\nFrom L-R \n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/s2C99g0N/IMG-20211119-184403.jpg\n\n\n**1-  Nivea Sun Protect And Moisture, moisturising sun and collagen protection SPF 50+ PA++++** \n\n**Quantity** **- Price** : 125 ml - ₹495 MRP\n\n(bought on Amazon for ₹396)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua, Octocrylene, Glycerin, Titanium Dioxide, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Alcohol Denat, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Panthenol, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Myristyl Myristate, Silica, Cetyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Stearyl Alcohol, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Methylparaben, Dimethicone, Trisodium EDTA, Ethylparaben, Sodium Citrate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Citric Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hydroxide, Linalool, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Eugenol, Coumarin, Methyl Benzoate, Benzoic Acid, BHT, Parfum/Fragrance\n\n**Texture** : White - Chalky Color. Medium - Thick Consistency   \n , you have to rub it in for a while for it to get completely absorbed, medium drying speed. Kinda greasy, semi matte finish. Leaves a moderate white cast, not a ghastly one though. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. Smells mostly of Alcohol! (it's one of the ingredients, so obviously..), fragrance is definitely not unnoticeable, but I don't mind it for my body, lingers around for a while. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : Hell yeah! It won't wear off unless you bathe, it survives water splashes and friction from clothes. Be careful while applying it on your feet though, I slip a lot while walking, esp when there's a rush and I put on sandals right after applying it. Give it ample time to dry before stepping out. \n\n**Reapplication** : Since the lotion sits thick on the skin, reapplication is not a bliss, the white cast becomes more noticeable after reapplication, and if you sweat after, oh god it feels a heavy /sticky mess lol, also tends to attract dust, but it's for the body, so I can compromise. 🤷‍♀️\n\n**Overall experience** : It's the best body sunscreen I've tried so far, with the highest protection and I think the brand can be trusted for its spf claims. \n\nI tried using it on my face once, oh nooo, I will never do that again! it kept moving around and just wouldn't get absorbed, plus it stung like hell because of the alcohol, and I literally felt like I was applying fevicol!   \n For my body, yep a thumbs up! \n\n\\*But\\*, if you get acne on your arms  (my arms have a tendency to break out / get textured if I use the wrong product) it wouldn't be the best choice, it seals and chokes the pores, I'd prefer something lighter. I usually wear tops/suits with long sleeves, so not much of the arm is exposed. below the elbow it feels comfortable enough. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WRP**, Hit! (for the body) \n\n**2- Iba Halal Invisible Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++**   \n **Quantity - Price** : 80 ml - ₹395 MRP\n\n(I bought it on Amazon for ₹ 337)\n\n**Ingredients** : WATER CONTAINING EXTRACTS OF ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) EXTRACT & HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) WATER, WATER & ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE & BENZOPHENONE-3 & BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE & PHOSPHOLIPIDS & 1,3-BUTYLENE GLYCOL & PHENOXYETHANOL, GLYCERINE, AMMONIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE/BEHENETH-25 METHACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL AND TRIETHYLENE GLYCOL, ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE, ALUMINIUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE, NIACINAMIDE (VITAMIN B3), TITANIUM DIOXIDE, PERFUME, DISODIUM EDTA, SODIUM HYDROXIDE\n\n**Texture** : White color. Light lotion - cream consistency, very lightweight and water like, kind of runny, it trickles down when you place a dallop on the palm and tilt it.   \n The Best consistency of a sunscreen I've used so far! Not at all heavy, takes some time to dry, esp when using larger amounts (I use 2-3 finger lengths) and still it doesn't feel too much on my face, easy to work with, requires a lot of gentle massaging because it's watery and takes some time to dry and settle in. High dry time.   \n It contains no silicones! My oily skin loves it! Doesn't give a matte finish though, on the glossy (satin?) side, but nothing bothersome.  \n Doesn't leave a white cast! On the Low I'd say, because of the presence of Titanium Dioxide. Absolutely love the texture. Skin feels very hydrated and plump and non greasy. (taaza nikhaar 😆) \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Has a \"fresh\" smell, (bamboo room freshener? idk something like that), moderate level, doesn't linger a lot. I haven't found a \\*good\\* fragrance free budget (\\*my\\* budget) friendly sunscreen yet. So I'm okay with this for now. Sometimes I'm guilty of enjoying the fragrance 😅 because all other products I use are strictly fragrance free. \n\n**Water Resistant?** :  Nope, doesn't survive water splashes or sweat (it won't come off completely in a single splash though, will wash off when sweating profusely) white colored droplets roll down the face if out in the sun for long. (the survival time is slightly more than the La Shield urban protection mineral sunscreen gel though) \n\n**Reapplication** : Breezy! Since it's lightweight, although, you might experience some moving around if there's a \\*lot\\* of product, I'd suggest applying pea by pea instead of taking a finger length at one go, I squeezed out a good amount once while in the car and kept massaging it in for a couple minutes (or more) and felt embarrassed at the weird looks my family and people outside the car gave me.. So yeah.. lol.  It doesn't feel uncomfortable after layers have been built up. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I love it! Although I'm not sure if the sunscreen has undergone the required tests to justify the actual sun protection claims, but that's all I got so far, it fits my requirements of no silicones, negligible white cast, high declared protection, non oily texture, and most importantly budget! \n\nOne important point, it stings when used after physical / chemical exfoliation. So you may want to avoid it after threading / waxing / scrubbing / masking / exfoliating.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Hit! **WRP** (for face) \n\n**3- La Shield Pollution Protect Mineral Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹280 MRP\n\n(bought it on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Purified Water, Octinoxate, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Caprylyl Methicone, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Diisopropyl Adipate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetearyl Alcohol, Brassica Campestris/Aleurites Fordi Oil Copolymer, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Phenoxyethanol, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, C20-22 Alcohols, Isohexadecane, Fragrances, Aluminium Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 60, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trolamine, Disodium Edetate, Sorbitan Isostearate\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Light - Medium gel - cream consistency. Lightweight. Doesn't require a lot of rubbing in. Doesn't move around a lot. Leaves a Low- Moderate white cast. Not the kind typical to mineral sunscreens, but more than the Iba Halal sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Lingers.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Naah, it melts away almost instantly if you happen to sweat while applying it, just a spray (accidental rain drop for example) on the face and it wears off from that spot, minor sweating and it rolls down the cheeks, doesn't adhere to the skin. \n\n**Reapplication** : Medium ease. Moves around, kind of sticky when built up. Medium White cast (visibly noticeable) after reapplication. \n\n**Overall Experience** : Um, I had expected a better performance from this one, looking at the ingredients and all, but it stings around the eyes, and on the face, makes my face somewhat tacky, my face becomes oily by afternoon (if applied in the morning). Personally I didn't like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Miss. **WNRP**.\n\n**4-  La Shield Fisico Matte Sunscreen Gel SPF 50+ PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹630 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹441)\n\n**Ingredients** : Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate\n\n**Texture** : White color, pasty. Very thick, \\*very\\* silicone-y (it's silicone based.. So), chokes the skin, spreadability is good, doesn't require a lot of massaging in, quick dry time. Moderate - slightly high white cast. Makes my face sweat! \n\n**Fragrance** : No. Silicone like.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Definitely. Strong staying power. Survives sweating and water splashes too well. Requires double cleanse or a heavy duty face wash to remove. \n\n**Reapplication** : Hahaha! Go ahead and try it if you want to look like a freshly frosted cake! Don't even \\*think\\* about it. Unless you plan to scare people with your literal white walker look. Been there, done that. I'm forever terrified, and will \\*never\\* do it again.\n\n**Overall Experience** : It's a thick paste, Stings around the eyes, which was surprising it being a physical sunscreen (probably because the zinc is micronized? idk) Reapplication is painful, can't apply more than 2 pea sized amount in the first application. Attracts dirt, Chokes my pores, I can't afford to apply something so pore clogging and then strip my facial skin away to remove it.   \n For me, it's not worth the price performance wise.   \n I'm finishing it off as a primer for occasions, smoothes out the face surface, my face gleamed during diwali :P\n\n**Repurchase status** : Miss! **WNRP**.\n\n**5- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Mineral Sunscreen, SPF 50+ PA++++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹295 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹236)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Silica, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Sodium Chloride, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Perfume, Magnesium Sulphate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Thick cream. Low - medium effort required for blending in the skin. Doesn't move around a lot. Medium - High Dry time. Low white cast (for a mineral sunscreen), medium matte finish. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : No, doesn't survive low- medium sweating. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I haven't used this sunscreen much. My mom used it a few times, and the moment I saw it melting down her face I didn't want to use it. Could have been a great affordable mineral sunscreen, but it's not even mildly water resistant, so I instantly passed on it. Might give it a try in the future. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WNRP**. \n\n**6- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Sunblock and Anti Tan Lotion Tinted Sunscreen, SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 60 ml - ₹245 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water,Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Propylene Glycol, Glyceryl Monostearate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Kaolin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Sodium Sulfite, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Extract, Saxifraga Sarmentosa Extract, Acetyl Tyrosine, Arbutin, Glutathione, Aminopropyl Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dimethiconol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Triethanolamine, Perfume, Disodium EDTA, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Ci 77492, Ci 77491, Ci 77499\n\n**Texture** : Orange color (literally). Medium consistency lotion like. Lightweight. Medium matte finish. Easy application. Doesn't require much effort to blend in. But the color is a literal disaster, it's impossible to apply a full finger length of this sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. On the Higher side. \n\n**Water Resistant** : Maybe a bit more than the mineral sunscreen variant? Not sure, rubs off on the mask \\*very\\* readily. Haven't noticed orange sweat yet, maybe because I haven't worn it enough. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. But I'm pretty sure it's not possible provided the intense color. \n\n**Overall Experience** : It could have been a good,  affordable tinted sunscreen, but the tint is just a disaster.. It dulls my face overall, and it doesn't even work as a bb cream (or sorts) although I don't expect to provide any coverage as per se (which it doesn't anyhow), but I can't find a way to finish it off other than applying it on my hands. Maybe color corrector?? Omg what'd I just come up with 😃💡. Let's see lol \n\n**Repurchase status** : Nope. **WNRP**. \n\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/RVccCB01/IMG-20211119-173651.jpg\n\n**7-** **Malibu LipCare Balm, SPF 30, UVA/UVB** (watermelon variant) \n\n**Quantity - Price** : 5 gm - ₹249-₹299\n\n(bought 2 on amazon for ₹199 each )\n\n**Ingredients** (watermelon) : Petrolatum, Paraffinum Liquidum (Mineral Oil), Paraffin Wax, Ozokerite Wax, Homosalate, Octocrylene, Carnauba Wax, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Flavor  \n May Contain: Limonene, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Citral, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol\n\n**Texture** : Ultra Rich, stiff stick, application is not smooth and breezy, tugs and pulls on the lips if you rush it, tightly press it against the surface, let the balm melt and glide on slowly. Makes lips very soft though. Staying power is great! \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Watermelon. Strong. \n\n**Taste** : Bitter Af! Avoid applying it on the insides and corners to keep it from seeping in. \n\n**Water resistant?** : Definitely! Survives liquids (tea, water, juice for me) not very heavy meals. Apply a thick layer to fight the mask rubbing off. Stays on for hours, afternoon - evening, for example. Keeps lips very soft and supple, no stinging sensation. \n\n**Overall Experience** : The only lip balm with spf 30 (plus uva/uvb protection) that has all the ingredients disclosed. Can't ask for more.   \n The only issue is, I can't use it with my waterproof /transferproof matte lipsticks. It makes them water loving and easily transferable, need to figure something out for that.. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : Unless I find some other lip balm with spf 30 mentioning all the ingredients, in a more affordable range, with no bitter taste, and better sunscreen filters. I **WRP** this. \n\nThats about it! Congrats for making it this far! Thanks!\n\n*Edited to add links to images, since I couldn't upload them with the post*",

    "body": "Skin type: 30. Dehydrated. Dry. Sensitive to external factors.\n\n**1. Muji brightening moisturizing milk spf 41 PA+++**. Previously reviewed in a prior post about trying Muji travel size skincare. Milky texture. Its drying and smells like citrus due to the essential oil. WNR. Feels drying on my skin. Maybe someone with oily skin would like it more.\n\nIngredients: Water, 1, 3-propanediol, fine titanium oxide, talc, dimethicone, concentrated glycerin, sugar squalane, 2-pentanediol, lipophilic glyceryl stearate, behenyl alcohol, PEG stearate, POE (20) sorbitan oleate, PEG (80), lavender extract-1, chamomilla extract-1, calendula officinalis extract, tangerine peel extract, kiwi extract, oleoyl phytosphingosine, alanine, Arginine, sodium L-glutamate, serine, proline, sodium hyaluronate-2, dipentaerythrityl hexaoxystearate, POP methyl glucoside, BG, ethylhexyl glycerin, beeswax, polyhydroxystearic acid, isostearic acid, aluminum hydroxide, hydrated silicic acid, potassium hydroxide, xanthan gum, starch-sodium acrylate graft polymer, sodium alginate, citric acid, sodium citrate, natural vitamin E, fragrance\n\n**2. Rohto Mentholatum - Hada Labo Koi-Gokujyun Perfect Gel.** Travel size that I got at a random convenience store while in Japan. Soft gel-like texture. Good in humid weather. Not moisturizing enough for my dry skin. Its a decent moisturizer for me in the daytime in the summer. WNR. Again, maybe someone with oily skin may benefit more from this gel.\n\nIngreditents: Water, BG, glycerin, hydroxyethyl urea, pentylene glycol, PPG-10 methyl glucose, triethyl hexanoin, squalane, (acryloyl dimethyl taurine ammonium / VP) copolymer, behenyl alcohol, acetyl hyaluronic acid Na (super hyaluronic acid), hyaluronic acid Na, hydrolysed hyaluronic acid (nano-ized hyaluronic acid), hyaluronic acid hydroxypropyl trimonium (skin-adsorbed hyaluronic acid), hydrolyzed collagen, glucosylceramide (ceramide), suizenzino-polysaccharide (Sakuran), dimethicone, PPG-17 butes -17, triethyl citrate, cyclopentasiloxane, phenoxyethanol, succinic acid 2Na, dimethicone crosspolymer, agarten, EDTA-2Na, succinic acid, α-glucan, acrylate copolymer ammonium , Methyl paraben\n\n**3. Kansosan Medical Highly Moisturizing Cream.** A buttery and moisturizing cream. While shopping at Donki, I googled what is the best Japanese cream for dry and sensitive skin and Kansosan was suggested so I bought it to try. \n\nIts fantastic on my dry skin. It sinks in upon application but also coats my skin with a layer of moisturizing protection. Ive been using it for 2 days now and all I can think about is how amazing this would be for winters. Im gonna stock up when I go back to Japan. I think I found my holy grail moisturizer. I need to try other products from this brand. \n\nThis cream is like the better formulated version of the Kikumasamune sake cream and the Purito Dermide sleeping pack. Plus Kansosan doesnt smell bad. People who enjoy thick moisturizers like the Illiyoon and Aestura would like this cream.\n\nIngredients: Heparin-like substance\\*, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizinate\\*, Purified Water, Glycerin, Methylphenyl Polysiloxane, Cross-linked Methyl Polysiloxane, Decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, 1,3-Butanediol, Methyl Polysiloxane, Polyethylene Glycol-Methyl Polysiloxane Copolymer, 2-Ethylhexyl Dodecanol, 1,2-Pentanediol, Poly(Oxyethylene-Oxypropylene) Methyl Polysiloxane Copolymer, Isostearic Acid Hardened Oil, Anhydrous Magnesium Sulfate, α-Olefin Oligomer, Sodium Citrate, Glycerol Mono-2-Ethylhexyl Ether, Sodium Metabisulfite, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Citric Acid, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, dl-Alpha Tocopheryl Sodium Phosphate, Vaseline, Glycosyl Squalane, L-Arginine, Hydrogenated Soybean Phospholipid, Plant Sterols, N-Hydroxysuccinimide, Water Soluble Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Polyethylene Glycol Octyl Dodecyl Ether, Plant Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate (2), \n\n\\*denotes \"Active Ingredient\", no symbol denotes \"Other Ingredients\"  \n",

The About Me Be Clean seems to be alcohol and fragrance-free (non sure if rosemary leaf oil is an essential oil and fragrant??). I would probably go with the Innifree though because I prefer alcohol in my sunscreen, otherwise they are too too dewy and greasy looking, and the ingredient list is rather simple. If only it didn't have fragrance, but I can compromise with that. The Dr. G has too many unnecessary ingredients and many comedogenic ingredients like myristic acid, so I would stay away from it.",

    "body": "So I spotted the above-named product at the grocery store while meandering past the grooming section.  I picked it up and wondered if it was as good for a primer, as it's neighbor, Nivea Post Shave Balm, has been known to be.  I compared the two products' ingredient lists, and noticed some big differences.\n\n> **Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm**: Water, Glycerin, Isopropyl Palmitate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Bark/Leaf Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tapioca Starch, Triceteareth-4 Phosphate, Maltodextrin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol , Piroctone Olamine, Fragrance.\n\n> **Dove Men+Care Post Shave Balm Hydrating+**: Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 MA Crosspolymer, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, DMDM Hydantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Stearic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Panthenol, Sodium Lactate, Triethanolamine, Sodium PCA, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Ceramide 3, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Ceramide 6 II, Ceramide 1\n\nThe first thing that jumped out at me was the inclusion of silicone compounds in the Dove shave balm.  It contains cyclopentasiloxane and dimethicone.  Silicones are absent from the Nivea balm.  This is a pro or a con, depending on your skin type and the base of your foundation.  \n\nThe second thing I noticed that I liked was the inclusion of ceramides in the Dove balm.  However, they're mostly on the tail end of the list, so it's hard to say how much is actually in the products, and if it is present enough to do any good.  Certainly can't hurt.\n\nThe Nivea balm has the benefit of having tapioca starch in it's formulation, which can be good for oil, and it has Witch Hazel extract.  Both balms have pretty good ingredients.  Neither contains drying alcohol.\n\nSo I purchased it.  When I got home, I washed my face, moisturized as normal, then put the Dove balm on the left side of my face and the Nivea balm on the right side.  I eschewed all other primers.  I dabbed a little Maybelline FitMe concealer under my eyes, and used a RT sponge to apply some L'Oreal Infallible Pro-Matte.  The foundation went on very smoothly and did not cake up or pill.  I set it with NYC loose powder.  I added some blush and bronzer for some depth, then I went about my day.\n\nSix hours later, I surveyed the first round of results.  Aside from my foundation being rubbed off of the tip and bottom of my nose (got the flu), both sides looked okay.  I did noticed, however, that the foundation on the right side of my face was more textured.  I could see my pores way clearer than the other side of my face.  Both sides were moderately oily.  The left side of my face was holding up somewhat better than the right side.  I noticed fewer flakes around the dry spots of my face on the left side.  At eight hours, all of these observations were more pronounced.  I noticed more oil on the right side, enough that my pores were \"shining\" with oil.  It was odd.  Neither side looked bad, however.  But for me, the left side (Dove) was winning out in the overall appearance category.  \n\nSo, for my initial testing, Dove Men+Care Post Shave Balm Hydrating did better than Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm, as a foundation primer.  Both have pretty good ingredients, both are alcohol free, and each can serve certain skin types better than the other.  Cheers! ",

    "body": "**CoTZ Sunscreen Review (Part One?)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ogkbnjalmbc51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74541de92caf8a4ccb74b007f922509d62a1848b\n\nWell hey there!\n\nAfter striking out with a number of Supergoop! face sunscreens (more reviews coming soon)…I decided to incorporate a new brand into my routine in hopes to give my skin a chance to recover. I really dove into ‘Best Mineral Sunscreens For Dark Skin” videos/posts and ended up purchasing a number of recommendations. The CoTZ Flawless Complexion Tinted Sunscreen came up a few times. So, I grabbed that along with their Sensitive Non-Tinted Sunscreen.\n\nBoth products are 100% mineral based sunscreens with 20% Zinc Oxide as the UV protector. The tinted version contains Mica and Iron Oxides for color but outside of that the formulations are nearly identical. Various silicones, preservatives, and texturizes make the list for both products.\n\nCoTZ focuses on mineral based sunscreens that are relatively “clean” and suitable for sensitive skin. No dyes, fragrance, or essential oils are here which is nice to see (and a nice change from the potpourri bowl that is Supergoop!). The brand name itself stands for Contains Only Titanium Zinc…a nod to the focus on physical SPF.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/er2a827mmbc51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=03a682918bc1a5e6fca56553c0f80811ed71ed0c\n\nBoth sunscreens have a rather thick/creamy texture that in turn applies a bit heavy as well. But, this heaviness absorbs down within a couple of minutes with a “residue” that I don’t have an issue with. Those that have kept up with my reviews (LOL) know that I really like that K-Beauty glow/near shiny look. These sunscreens from CoTZ provide that for sure without being greasy (for me).\n\nBut aside from the application and feel…the white cast (or lack of) from these mineral sunscreens is really what sets them apart. The very minimal white cast from the non-tinted version and the total lack of white cast from the tinted is something I have not experienced from a Zinc Oxide based product before. Seriously…I was ready to grab every other SPF in my stash and give it all away. “This is all I need for the rest of my life!” I thought LOL!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qm8hmunmbc51.jpg?width=2316&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0981a2fd35f82b034386bb64e24973b9264ef8d\n\nThe Sensitive Non-Tinted Sunscreen does start to show its mineral roots after a few layers throughout the day (especially when exercising/sweating). But still, the white cast is minimal compared to other products I have used. As for the Flawless Complexion Tinted Sunscreen…I could just layer and layer that stuff on. I think this particular tint is just a really, really good match to my skin tone. It totally masks any white cast and disappears into my skin. CoTZ isn’t kidding with their “Vanishing Zinc Oxide” marketing.\n\nI won’t throw out my other sunscreens just yet LOL…and will keep testing/reviewing mineral sunscreens from brands like Australian Gold, Elta MD, and Versed. Hopefully there will be some more winners in the bunch but for now I am happy to say I have found my new favorite sunscreen brand. The tinted version would be my overall go-to but with the tint liking to transfer to my face masks…I find myself reaching for the non-tinted version just as often.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jwzwmadpmbc51.jpg?width=2316&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3a59f1d13f6e5e23331ac0775bed47c48cfe860b\n\nHonestly, I think anyone who has struggled with finding a decent mineral sunscreen should give these a try. My only hesitations in recommending them would be if you have particularly oily skin, need something that can stand up to a good workout, or really prefer a matte finish SPF. These two products will range from dewy to rather heavy depending on your skin type and neither really “dry-down” all the way. CoTZ makes some primer/matte style sunscreens and I am tempted to give them a go.\n\nI’m so happy to have stumbled across these two sunscreens as they were a much needed reprieve from Supergoop! (not everything has been a miss so far from that brand…but most everything LOL). Part of me wishes I would have invested in the entire CoTZ product range and reviewed that vs. Supergoop!…ah well.\n\nNeedless to say I’ll be keeping a couple of bottles of CoTZ sunscreens in my stash going forward. \n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nSensitive Skin Non-Tinted Sunscreen: **Active Ingredients:** Zinc Oxide 20% **Purpose:** Sunscreen **Inactive Ingredients:** C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Cetyl PEG/PPG 10/1 Dimethicone, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Disodium EDTA, Glycerin, Hydrogen Dimethicone, Microcrystalline Wax, PEG-10 Dimethicone, PEG-30 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Chloride, Stearyl Dimethicone, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Water\n\nFlawless Complexion Tinted Sunscreen: **Active Ingredients:** Zinc Oxide 20% **Purpose:** Sunscreen **Inactive Ingredients:** Bismuth Oxychloride, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Cetyl PEG/PPG 10/1 Dimethicone, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Disodium EDTA, Glycerin, Hydrogen Dimethicone, Iron Oxides, Mica, Microcrystalline Wax, PEG-10 Dimethicone, PEG-30 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Chloride, Stearyl Dimethicone, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Water\n\nWhere To Buy (Link To CoTZ Site - Prices Vary Depending On Product/Size): [https://cotzskincare.com/mineral-sunscreens/](https://cotzskincare.com/mineral-sunscreens/)",

I’m looking for a hydrating mineral sunscreen with no white cast for the winter. I actually have good luck with supergoop in the summer, so I think this may be a good fit for my dry and dehydrated winter skin. I’m also considering Biossance, Elta MD’s UV restore/replenish/elements/active/pure, Josie Maran, Versed, and Isdin.",

They don't always appear as \"ceramide \\_\\_\", there are other names for them, such as:\n\nHydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, Myristoyl/​Palmitoyl Oxostearamide/​Arachamide MEA, Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide, Hydroxypalmitoyl Sphinganine, [Safflower Oil/​Palm Oil Aminopropanediol Esters](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/safflower-oil-palm-oil-aminopropanediol-esters), etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo today I wanted to make a list of products that are easily overlooked when searching for ceramide skincare, because many people are only looking for the word \"ceramide\".

So my Physicians Formula booster and Olay Luminous booster came in the mail today!\n\nI'm just really excited to share because I searched HIGH AND LOW for affordable niacinamide products that have a high % of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLINK TO MY PICTURES:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/7ab5NZ8](https://imgur.com/a/7ab5NZ8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe PF I have not used before. But it's the FIRST affordable product that I came across that has high % of niacinamide AND  Acetyl glucosamine ---- not just those, but a small amount of supposedly the most powerful vitamin c derivative!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Niacinamide and NAG work synergistically together](https://lotioncrafter.com/products/n-acetyl-glucosamine-nag) to be a brightening powerhouse as well as repairing your skin barrier. They help boost your ceramide production and NAG is skin-identical.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**PHYSICIANS FORMULA SKIN BOOSTER - BRIGHTENING**](https://www.target.com/p/physicians-formula-skin-booster-vitamin-shot-brightening-1-fl-oz/-/A-75569193)  **$7.99/1 oz or 30ml**\n\n*Water, Butylene Glycol,* ***Niacinamide***\\*, Glycerin,\\* ***Acetyl Glucosamine***\\*, Pentylene Glycol, 1, 2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Disodium Edta, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Phenylethyl Resorcinol, Caesalpinia Spinosa Fruit Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Sodium Benzotriazolyl Butylphenol Sulfonate,\\* ***3-0-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid***\\*, Iron Oxides (Ci 77492), Tocopheryl Acetate, Phenoxyethanol, Vegetable Collagen, Agar, Calcium Alginate, Xanthan Gum, Kappaphycus Alvarezii Extract, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tropolone, Gluconolactone, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cynara Scolymus (Artichoke) Leaf Extract, Red 30 (Ci 73360), Sodium Benzoate.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like it's an \"inspired\" product of [**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**](https://www.paulaschoice.com/10pct-niacinamide-booster/798.html)**:**\n\n*Water (Aqua),* ***Niacinamide*** *(vitamin B3, skin-restoring ),* ***Acetyl Glucosamine*** *(skin replenishing/antioxidant),* ***Ascorbyl Glucoside*** *(vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative).*\n\nThe Paula's Choice obviously has more beneficial ingredients and higher % but still, it's **$44 for 0.67oz/20ml**.

Probably because Olay developed it. But it works great on its own as a brightener, and even better combined with vitamin c (which is why you see ascorbyl glucoside here, a stable derivative of ascorbic acid). The miracle boost USED to contain n-acetyl glucosamine (which is the one I used) as well the other ones listed here. But I guess it got too expensive or whatever.\n\nThis also has some other great ingredients, like xylitol, gylcerin, panthenol, zinc and copper gluconate for soothing and healing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used this booster in conjunction with the Luminous cream, which has niacinamide and NAG. My skin looked so much brighter and prettier. The texture was really smoothed out and my skin started getting a more like.. translucent ?? quality? You DO need to give brightening ingredients *at least 3 months* to work their magic though, especially for things like arbutin/hydroquinone. (Arbutin breaks down into hydroquinone.) But for niacinamide, I saw results for skin texture/overall brightening before that.\n\nI honestly couldn't believe the price Target was selling it for, because I got it for a much higher price elsewhere before. I couldn't keep affording it so I let it go, sadly. :'(\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe [**Luminous Tone Perfecting Treatment ($24.99)**](https://www.olay.com/en-us/skin-care-products/regenerist-luminous-tone-perfecting-treatment) is a simpler formula, but still has the same active ingredients.\n\n*Water,* ***Niacinamide\\*****, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Dimethicone,* ***Undecylenoyl Phenylalanine***\\*, Silica, Boron Nitride,\\* ***Ascorbyl Glucoside***\\*, Polyglyceryl-2 Oleate, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Dimethiconol, Aminomethyl Propanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Oleate, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium EDTA, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, \\*Vitamin B3\\*\n\nBut ironically, it costs more than the more complex booster if you purchase at Target online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DIY:**\n\nI have made DIY niacinamide NAG serums before. But because I'm too lazy to make it properly, they really lack penetration power. I'm really into cosmetic science and have read from professional cosmetic chemists that a simple DIY isn't effective if you don't do it right. You gotta keep the powders dissolved right and STAY dissolved instead of them recrystallizing on your skin and not penetrating your skin/being useless. I experimented for months with the DIY but I DEFINITELY noticed a difference as soon as I started using well-formulated, commercially available niacinamide serums.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy personal experience with certain products:\n\n\\- [**Eva Naturals 5% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-Niacinamide-Serum-Eva-Naturals/dp/B0147PDMYY/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=eva+naturals+niacinamide&amp;qid=1561763684&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-3)**:** Pretty awesome, works well, you get 2 oz. But it has avocado oil and such, and may break some people out. (This is definitely a private-label product and you can find the same exact formula for cheaper on DIY sites - which is why you see like 324982394 bottles of the same formula of everything from niacinamide to vitamin c serums on amazon.) I get the same sort of overall brightening and translucency I get with Olay. Better results with my other products, Benton 0.5% salicylic acid (very gentle) aloe BHA toner, Purito green level centella buffet serum (also has niacinamide, like 2%), and Naturie Hatomugi gel essence. Bright, translucent skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Cerave PM:** Supposedly has 4% niacinamide. Loved this as a lightweight moisturizer, but did NOT see the results I got with other niacinamide products. Makes me feel skeptical. Or perhaps there's a pretty big difference for my skin with 4% and 5%. I doubt it, but you know. Maybe it's just cuz it's formulated for skin-replenishing and not for brightening. But you'd think same ingredient will have same effects, y'know?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- [**Skinlex 10% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.skinlex.com/product/10-niacinamide-serum-60ml/)**:** Ingredient list looks GREAT and some others seem to love it, but I saw absolutely zero niacinamide benefits for my skin. Penetration issue?\n\nI have other products I've used with niacinamide, but these are the main ones I can remember on the top of my head. La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+ baume has it as well, but I do not know the %. Very good moisturizer for the body.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther commercial products you can find SEPIWHITE in:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- [**Black Opal skin care products**](https://blackopalbeauty.com/collections/skincare): They have multiple.

    "body": "My foray into skincare began around July last year when I decided I wasn't happy with my skin and wanted to do something about it. Initially I researched foundations, but none of the products I tried evened my skin to my satisfaction, which is when I found /r/SkincareAddiction. Here, I learned that my skin was dehydrated, more than likely due to using Dove bar soap and BP on my face and zero moisturizer every day. :) My skin has changed so much since I started and I am finally ready to review some products I have been using and maybe help others find their way.  \n**Disclaimer** This is my first Reddit text post, I'm really hoping the formatting turns out the way I anticipated.  \n\n**Where we started:**  \n* 25/F/FL; combo/oily dehydrated skin with mild acne, some PIE, sporadic CCs and occasionally painful nodules usually on my forehead, chin, or temples. Noteworthy: I have been on oral contraceptives since I was a teenager and switched to Skyla in 2015. I don't believe my acne is hormonal, but since I've always had some sort of hormonal birth control it's hard to tell how much it has affected my skin.  \n\n\n* No real routine, just washing my face with bar soap in the (scalding hot) shower, using a Neutrogena BP mask to annihilate acne. I was under the (false) impression that since my face was oily I certainly wouldn't want to add moisturizer!  \n\n\n* Mostly concerned with the nodules I was getting because they were big and painful and took forever to heal. Admittedly, I am a skin picker and just recently I realized this is probably the cause of the nodules because the two that I have dealt with recently developed in spots that I had messed with just a few days before.  \n\n\n**Level one: Build a routine.**  \n* At this point, I read everything. EVERYTHING. I spent a couple of months just researching products, learning about skin types, and poring through threads on SCA. I put down the BP mask and bought Neutrogena foaming face wash and CeraVe PM. This was around September when Irma hit and I was without power for a few days, but still managed to keep my fledgling routine. \\o/\n\n* Unfortunately, I felt that CeraVe PM was contributing to a new outbreak of whiteheads around my mouth, where I don't normally get whiteheads. I wound up replacing it with Peach Slices Citrus Honey Aqua Glow which I LOVE. More on that later.\n\n* I also incorporated Neutrogena Sheer Touch sunscreen around this time, but that gave me small breakouts as well and I just didn't like the way that it sat on my skin so I decided to put sunscreen on hold while I did more research.\n\n* While incorporating these products into my routine I tried my best to follow SCA's advice and start slow, one product at a time, and patch test first. I don't really feel that patch testing helped me determine if a product would break me out, as I wouldn't notice any difference in the area I patch tested but then within a few days of trying a new product on my whole face I would see an increase in whiteheads in strange areas. It sucked, but it's alright since the breakouts were mild and didn't take long to appear so I knew fairly quickly that a product wasn't working for me. I still recommend patch testing for sensitivity purposes.\n\n**Level 2: Sunscreen and acids.**  \n* Finally, after months of reading, I felt ready to take on an acid. I settled on CosRX BHA Blackhead Power liquid because it was purportedly more mild (and less expensive!) than other options and I felt that I should start gentle. I picked this up from Ulta in early December and used it every three days for 4 weeks. During that period I don't feel like I had a purge; I kind of expected my acne to go into overdrive but it didn't really get any worse. After the 4 weeks I started using it MWF. \n\n* I also bought Skinfood's Aloe Watery Sun Water Gel from Amazon, but shipping took about a month so I was able to incorporate it well after the BHA.\n\n**Level 3: Skincare God.**  \n* *Just kidding.* So here we are in mid April and I have repurchased the Neutrogena cleanser once (although I switched to hydrating instead of foaming), Peach Slices moisturizer three (!!!) times, Skinfood sunscreen once, and am 1/3 of the way through the CosRX BHA. Let me tell you, I am SO much happier with my skin. \n\n* My skin is more bright and even and I have had much fewer blemishes than I used to, which I would attribute equally to a marked decrease in picking. Taking better care of my skin and working towards a goal makes it easier to keep myself from messing up my progress, although I still have setbacks during times when I am very stressed out, but I try not to let that discourage me.\n\n* Oil production WAS down, but a couple of weeks ago I tried to incorporate Cosrx Ultimate Moisturizing Honey Overnight Mask at night for added hydration, but it wound up drying me out? Additionally, I am running dangerously low on Peach Slices Moisturizer and could not find it at any of my local CVS locations so I have been rationing it while I wait for more to come in the mail. :'( \n\n* From here, I want to try to find a more hydrating cream for nighttime and an easily accessible drugstore sunscreen because currently it takes the Skinfood 2-4 weeks to come in so I have to make sure I order it in advance. I also REALLY want to try Krave Beauty Kale-lalu-yAHA, but I am waiting until I get back from vacation next month before I incorporate a new exfoliant. Finally, someone talk me out of buying something from the Dr Jart Cicapair line because I'm not quite sure what it's for but I really want it.\n\nI hope this will be helpful for those still figuring out what works for their skin, as I know I felt completely overwhelmed when I first started. I am still interested in experimenting with new products but I feel that I have a really solid routine as it is so I am content to wait until I am in a better situation financially to mix things up.\n\n**Current routine**  \nAM: splash with water  \nPeach Slices moisturizer  \nSkinfood sunscreen  \n\nPM: cleanse with Neutrogena  \nCosRX BHA MWF  \nPeach Slices moisturizer  \nSometimes a sheet mask when I'm feeling fancy (I really like Ariul Seven Days masks)  \nVaseline (not so much lately after I read a thread here about Vaseline potentially trapping bacteria if your face isn't cleansed properly)\n\n**Reviews**  \n* Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser: Not much to say here, but from what I have read that is good to say about a cleanser. It took a little time to get used to not having that tight, \"squeaky clean\" feeling that I got using the foaming cleanser, but ultimately I think this has been better for my skin. I have had my eye on Glossier's Milky Jelly cleanser for MONTHS but I can't bring myself to buy it when I am pretty satisfied with how this has been for my skin.\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Glucoside, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol*\n\n* Peach Slices Citrus Honey Aqua Glow: Light gel formula, sinks into my skin really well. I am still a bit oily toward the end of the day, but I have kind of resigned myself to the fact that that may not fully go away. Maybe when I start incorporating a more hydrating night cream it will help. Either way the slight oil doesn't bother me much and I really like this moisturizer.\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Polysorbate 60, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Honey Extract, Ceramide NP, Sorbitan Stearate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Isohexadecane, Tromethamine, Hydroxyacetophenone, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Polysorbate 80, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitan Oleate, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Oil, Disodium EDTA, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Butylene Glycol, Bixa Orellana Seed Oil, Tocopherol*\n\n* Skinfood Aloe Watery Sun Water Gel 50+ PA+++: Very happy with this sunscreen, although the oil control is hit or miss. Some days when I apply it after moisturizer it has a nice, almost powdery finish and I forget it's even there. Some days I'm more oily but I'm still figuring out what the cause of that might be. I don't wear foundation so I can't speak to how this sits under makeup but I do wear a little blush and I can still see it at the end of the day. When I apply it I pat it around my face and then rub it in, there is a slight white cast at first but for me it disappears very quickly, however, I am fair skinned.\n\n*Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Octyl Methoxycinnamate, Octyl Salicylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Peg/Ppg-10/1 Dimethicone, Lauryl Peg-9 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Stearalkonium Hectorite, Titanium Dioxide, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Propylene Carbonate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Fragrance, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Tocopherol*\n\n* CosRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid: I use three pumps MWF and occasionally a tiny amount to spot treat nodules. Overall I feel like it helps existing acne heal more quickly and keeps it from getting to that huge, inflammatory state. It applies and dries down very nicely and I typically wait 15-20 minutes after application to apply moisturizer. I didn't realize until recently that it has niacinamide, which I had thought didn't agree with my skin because it was also in CeraVe PM, but I think it has really helped lighten my PIE, particularly a spot on my forehead that I really went to town on last year and it was a pain in the ass to heal.\n\n*Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Water, Butylene Glycol, Betaine Salicylate, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Arginine, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol*\n\n**Links that I found helpful along the way**  \n[Try a gentle hydrating cleanser -- even if you have oily skin.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/7j6juf/psa_try_a_gentle_hydrating_cleanser_even_if_you/)\n\n[Routines which involve inadequate cleansing, high moisture, and heavy occlusion are risky...](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/86twai/psa_routines_which_involve_inadequate_cleansing/)",

    "body": "In my opinion the only way ascorbic acid may potentially work topically is when it's used fresh, and applied at night in the absence of UV exposure. Personally I don't believe in preformulated water based ascorbic acid products. Even when it's fresh the amount of studies that prove that vitamin c really works topically is quite limited. Vitamin c penetrates skin rather poorly. There simply is no standardization to prove the effectiveness of a specific formula, unlike sunscreens and retinoic acid. Shelf life is no indication of the stability of actives and doesn't say anything about it's stability on skin. Ascorbic acid is simply notoriously unstable, it's more likely to degrade on skin and be irritating. From all the research available today, the best efficient way to get ascorbic acid in skin is to just take it orally.\n\nBeneficial actives in bold, potential irritants in italic/stripethrough\n\n**Water based products**: below pH3.5 the ionic charge of AA is removed ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5605218/)), improving skin penetration and stability, but water based products remain extremely unstable ([ref](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/7291637/stability-of-vitamin-c-derivatives-in-solution-and-topical-formulations/3),[ref](https://skinelegance.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/CSBM_-Skincare-theories-busted-Dec-2014.pdf)), most companies don't store their product in fridges in warehouses, it isn't unlikely products are severely oxidized by the time they arrive at your home\n\n* [€18/50mL - Skinlex 20%](https://www.skinlex.com/product/20-vitamin-c-serum-30ml/)\n  * **pH:** 3-3.3\n  * **Pros:** simple irritant free formula, right pH, pump is convenient compared to pipet, light serum, inexpensive\n  * **Cons:**  pump is not airless, concentration other actives unknown, instability, the look and feel of website and adress of company make me doubt if it's really formulated by a well educated cosmetic chemist\n  * **INCI:** Water, **20% L-Ascorbic Acid**, Butylene Glycol, **Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin**, *Triethanolamine*, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol.\n\n* [€28/50mL - SkinPep C15](https://skinpep.com/super-c15-serum/)\n * **pH:** 4.3\n  * **Pros:** Great blend of actives, light serum, shared concentrations\n  * **Cons:** pH is too high, dropper, instability, incorrect ingredient order (Propylene Glycol)\n  * **INCI:** Aqua, **15% l- Ascorbic Acid, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-3, Panthenol**, Hydrolyzed Collagen, **1% Alpha Tocopherol, 0.5% Ferulic Acid**, Glycerin , *Triethanolamine*, Phenoxyethanol, *2% Propylene Glycol*, Ethoxydiglycol, Laureth-23\n\n* [€34/50mL -Wishtrend 21.5 Advanced Serum](http://www.wishtrend.com/skin-care/1215-pure-vitamin-c215-advanced-serum-by-wishtrend.html)\n * **pH:** unknown\n  * **Pros:** Simple irritant free formula\n  * **Cons:** concentration is a bit high, dropper bottle, lack of stabilizers, not many actives \n  * **INCI:** Hippophae Rhamnoides Water (70%), **Ascorbic Acid** (21.5%), Sodium Lactate, 1,2-Hexanediol, **Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol**, Cassia Obtusifolia Seed Extract, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol\n\n* [€41.60/50mL - SkinActives 15%](http://www.skinactives.com/Vitamin-C-Serum-Ascorbic-Acid-L.html)\n * **pH:** 1.5-2.5\n  * **Pros:** Airless pump!, great blend of actives, not very expensive, no propylene glycol, ph is low enough for penetration, skinactives is busy with a reformulation without the citrus extracts.\n  * **Cons:** ph is irritating, according skinactives not suited for daily use, lack of stabilizers like water reducing agents, recrystalizes quickly.

I've been debating with myself wether to put this on the good or bad list. In my opinion there are a lot of uncertainties about the stability of diy formulas, especially if you start mixing it through existing products. Even destilled water contains impurities that will react with ascorbic Acid, and many people don't use water reducing agents, or stabilizers like propyl gallate, sodium metabisulfite, chelators etc. A low pH, vitamin E, Ferulic acid help of course, but I don't think many people really understand the exact chemical reactions going on and don't have analyzers like they do in labs, so how certain can you be about your own creation. Most often DIY formulas also just recrystallize on skin. Formulating an ascorbic acid serum really is difficult, it is more than just dissolving some ingredients in water. Dissolving in TO Ferulic Acid will be difficult since maximum solubility in Propanediol is just 5%, in contrast to 33% in water. The key here is to make it fresh every 1-3 days I guess.\n  * [€5.80/20g TO Powder](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-100pct-l-ascorbic-acid-powder-20g?redir=1)\n  * [€89 /20mL Philosophy Turbo C booster](https://www.sephora.com/product/turbo-booster-c-powder-P204606)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Anhydrous formulas**: best stability, but not much research on penetration\n\n* [€9.60/50mL - The Ordinary C23](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-vitamin-c-suspension-23pct-ha-spheres-2pct-30ml?redir=1)\n  * **Pros:** Cheap, anhydrous (stable), together with TO Ferulic+Resveratrol a very affordable good combo\n  * **Cons:** No other actives,  no vitamin E, relatively unpleasant texture, stinging, for me too thick/greasy for daytime use.

The reviews on Sephora have been fantastic and it has 20% THD ascorbate (which they call a mega-potent, ultra stable form of vitamin c. They claim that the THD ascorbate is 50x more powerful than traditional vitamin c (I am skeptical and what are they referring to with “traditional vit c”).  Also has 3% vitamin E and 2% ferulic acid. The only negative I read in the reviews is people saying it was not ideal for dry skin types. Do you have any experience with this? \n\nPS- thank you so much for your comprehensive list, it is much appreciated!!

        "body": "Wow, nice post! I'll be shopping around later, love trying new products. Did you make a mistake on the Skinlex one btw? It doesn't use a dropper, I have a bottle and it's an airless pump.\n____\n\nAlso about The Ordinary, I have information about its penetration ability if you'd like:\n\n\nA quote from Brandon Truaxe:\n> In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.\n\nThat means that with TO Vit C 23%, your skin is only using about 2%, while L-AA's max absorption rate is 20%.",

Sorry the image isn't super aesthetic but I wanted to write the post asap!\n\n**About me:** 24F\n\n**Climate:** Between 35-39 degrees this summer, slightly humid but really dry most times.\n\n**Skin type:** My body's skin is dehydrated and always needs to be moisturised; however, even slightly heavy lotions make me sweat.\n\n**Texture of this lotion:** Looks like any regular lotion, bFraut when rubbed in it literally disappears into my skin in a good way. It spreads like a serum/water lotion.\n\n**Fragrance:** Light but pleasant scent, very similar to other Vaseline lotions. \n\n**Cost:** MRP 300\n\n**WRP/WNRP:** WRP\n\nIngredients list: Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Glutathione, Sodium Hyaluronate, Retinyl Palmitate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Glycine, Cystine, Sodium PCA, Petrolatum, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Perfume, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Styrene/​Acrylates Copolymer, Disodium EDTA, Coco-Glucoside, BHT, Benzoic Acid, Citric Acid, Potassium Hydroxide\n\n*Moisturisers I've already tried and mini reviews (note:* ***reviews are only for summers, otherwise I love all of these lotions and they work perfectly during winter***\\*):\\*\n\n* *Vaseline Aloe lotion* \\- Too light and not moisturising enough.\n* *Vaseline Restoring variant in the yellow bottle* \\- Makes me sweat in summer.\n* *Parachute Blue Bottle* \\- heavy and makes me sweat in summer.\n* *Vaseline Aloe Gel tube* \\- I really like this one for summer, gets absorbed super fast and gives a cooling feeling. However, I don't know if it helped with my dehydrated skin.\n* *Vaseline Daily Bright & Calming Body Serum -* I love this one. Though it's slightly less moisturising it's actually good for really hot and humid days.\n* I've also used the *Neutrogena hydro-boost gel* and *Cosrx All-in-one cream*s on my body because my face skin reacted badly to them - I honestly loved these for my body during summers because of how light but hydrating they are but obviously they're too expensive to be purchased to use on the body.\n* Lastly, I've tried to dilute every regular lotion with some water; *Minimalist 5% Niacinamide Lotion*, *Vaseline advanced repair* and one of the *Nivea dark blue bottle*s (all my HGs for winter). All of them still made me sweat after the water dried down.\n\nI have tried the *Vaseline Gluta-hya Serum-in-lotion* for about 1 week now and love it already!\n\nThis one looked like any other lotion but when applied, it literally turns into a watery serum consistency and gets absorbed by my skin within minutes. It doesn't feel heavy at all but moisturises very well for quite a few hours.\n\nI had to reapply on some really dry parts of my body within 4 hours but I'd take that any day over the sweaty feeling I get from using regular lotions in summer.\n\nIts scent is very similar to the Yellow Vaseline lotion however, it's slightly different and it's quite pleasant.\n\nIf anyone of you had used the Vaseline spray-on lotion/serum thing, this Gluta-hya thing is a more moisturising version of that product which is great because I also like the spray lotion despite it being slightly less moisturising.\n\nI don't know if it's really new in the market or if I've just found it but it's a good find!\n\nAlso, at the back of the tube, it says that this specific variant has *'Dual UV Filters'* i.e. UVA and UVB filters but obviously, I doubt if it's good enough protection, so I won't stop using my body sunscreen yet.\n\nThey also have another variant called [Dewy Radiance Serum-in-Lotion](https://www.myntra.com/body-lotion/vaseline/vaseline-non-sticky-gluta-hya-dewy-radiance-serum-in-lotion---200-ml/22580648/buy?gclid=Cj0KCQjwi46iBhDyARIsAE3nVrZg5uLe88lcJQxcHA5kivV2zWTXKHmiQ3ZT1v1Twhhmqj53tFr9twIaAu3lEALw_wcB) if anyone's interested!\n\nApologies if my format/writing isn't that great!",

These restrictions for leave on products (like makeup) will be at max 0.1% as of 2026, but they aren’t required to now. Many makeup brands have already begun to reformulate their foundations that contained Cyclopentasiloxane so while they aren’t required to for several years, I’m not surprised Glossier is choosing to do it now. I suspect the timing is because a) they wanted to consolidate packaging (since it’ll have the Ultralip packaging) b) recently opened up international shipping. Anyone else have thoughts?",

    "body": "Hey all!! I had posted not too long ago requesting help finding a dupe for my now discontinued lip balm, the Bite Agave Lip Mask. I took recommendations and compromised on some of my wishlist for ingredients, as I realized no one else makes a balm with an identical ingredient list. I figured in case anyone else is struggling with replacing this, I'd share what I found. \n\n[Here](https://imgur.com/kV6xjSG) are the products I've tried. Not pictured is the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, which I emptied and tossed the container.  From left to right I have the Bite lip mask, Lanolips Lanostick, Lanolips 101 ointment, Glossier Balm Dotcom in 3 flavors (original, birthday cake, and rose), Go-To Lips, Jack Black, Aquaphor, and Vaseline.\n\n**Bite Agave Lip Mask** 10/10\n\n    Ingredients: Trans-Resveratrol, Lanolin (Pharma Grade), Organic Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Organic Butyrospermum, Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Rosinate, Organic Agave Tequilana (Blue Agave) Nectar, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil Unsaponifiables, Organic Cera Alba (Beeswax), Flavor, Vanillin, Siraitia Grosvernori (Monk Fruit), Vanilla Tahitensis (Vanilla) Fruit Extract, Organic Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Trans-resveratrol, Vitis Vinefera (Grape) Oil, Tocopherol Acetate, Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, and Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, +/- May Contain: Mica (CI 77019), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Carmine (CI 75470).\n\nI think what has done it for me with this one is the occlusive elements as well as moisturizers. I can see it has oils and lanolin plus beeswax. I like the thick texture which is almost sticky as well as the tube packaging. I personally like the absence of SPF as when I am really chapped those can sting/burn my lips. I also really like the smell/taste of the original. The small tube lasts a long time and it saves me a lot of discomfort in the dry winters, especially working in a hospital with all the recycled air. \n\n**Lanolips Lanostick** 8/10\n\n    Lanolin*, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil*, capryloyl glycerin/sebacic acid copolymer*, cera alba (beeswax)*, caprylic/capric triglyceride*, persea gratissima (avocado) oil*, jojoba esters (simmondsia chinensis)*, aroma (nat flavour)*, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter*, euphorbia cerifera (candelilla) cera*, magnifera indica (mango) seed butter*, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil*, copernicia cerifera (carnauba) cera*, tocopherol (vit E)* *100% natural/naturel\n    \nI feel like this one on the lips is very similar in feel to the Bite. It is probably my favorite of the dupes that I've tried. It has a lot of similar ingredients such as the lanolin, castor oil, beeswax, shea butter, and some other oils. It has a different flavor/scent than the Bite mask. It is almost citrus in nature? I think I can see myself using this one once I go through my stash of Bite (thanks to the redditor who messaged me saying Sephora kept restocking, I was able to snag some). My complaint? The fact it is a stick and not a tube! I haven't lost the cap of this in my pocket yet but that happens to me with regular sticks. I also worry the stick will break because it gets too soft from being stored in my pocket. All in all the best dupe so far.  It too got me through days at the hospital without wanting to rip my lips off my face so win.\n\n**Lanolips 101 Ointment** 7/10\n\n    Ingredients: Lanolin, lanolin oil. *naturally derived/*Dérivé naturellement.\n\nI got this one because I was already ordering from Ulta and was able to use a coupon and my points, I imagine it is basically the same as the nipple creams and other straight up lanolin out there. It is good. Tube is nice. Cap doesn't stay on super great. No color or flavor so I can use it for my cuticles and other dry patches. I can't complain but I'm not gonna sing out from the rooftops or anything like that. You can get lanolin only products much cheaper for much more product elsewhere. It does do its job locking in moisture though.\n\n**Glossier Balm Dotcom** 8/10\n\n    Ingredients: Petrolatum, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Beeswax/Cera Alba/Cire d’Abeille, Lanolin, Theobroma Grandiflorum Seed Butter, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, BHT, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol.\n\nI know I originally wanted to avoid petroleum based products but I did have a sample of it that I liked well enough so I got the 3 pack on Glossier's site to try the other flavors. Original seems to be more sticky than the other flavors and feels more like the Bite mask. It does a good enough job, the flavors are fun. I like the tube packaging. The rose is so much better than the perfume co. rose balm which is rose flavored vaseline. I feel like it did a good job moisturizing and lasting to lock in the moisture while I was at work too.\n\n**Go-to Lips** 4/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tUltra Medical Grade Lanolin, Shea Butter, Apricot Kernel Oil, Beeswax, Sweet Almond Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Vitamin E, Fragrance (Pure Pomegranate), Pomegranate Seed Oil, Calendula Oil, Jojoba Oil, Avocado Oil.\n\nI think I might be rating this lower because I had higher expectations for it. The ingredients sound great. Its in a nice tube. But its so slippery, it feels like a lip oil on the lips instead of a balm or sticky mask. It has a strong scent/flavor but it isn't unpleasant. Its so messy out of the tube though because it is so slick! I wasn't looking for an oil so I'm a little bummed. I can't say it doesn't moisturize my lips though but it doesn't have the staying power to make use of the occlusives in it. \n\n**Jack Black Lip Balm** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tBeeswax, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, C 18-38 Alkyl Hydroxystearol Stearate, Camellia Sinenesis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Flavor, Lanolin, Microcrystalline Wax, Ozokerite, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Polyglyceryl 3 Beeswax, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n\nPretty middle of the road chapstick. Theres some beeswax, some lanolin, some shea butter. It has SPF though which is a negative for me for a day to day balm. I guess there isn't a lot wrong with it, it doesn't dry me out but if I am dry it stings. Its a little slicker than Bite too. I got it awhile ago as a sample and it just didn't wow me but it is a popular item.\n\n**Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy** 5/10\n\n    Active ingredient: Petrolatum (41%) – Skin protectant Inactive ingredients: Mineral Oil, Ceresin, Lanolin Alcohol, Panthenol, Glycerin, Bisabolol\n\nI use this at work when I leave chapstick at home because we have samples of it everywhere. Its good for prevention of radiation dermatitis if you're into that sort of thing. It has no flavor, no taste. Its slippery and greasy feeling due to the high petroleum content. Its a solid product in general just not for my dream chapstick replacement. Good stuff though. Will continue to have on hand.\n\n**Vaseline Lip Therapy Advanced Healing** 2/10\n\n    Active ingredient: White Petroleum, USP 100%. Inactive ingredient: Flavor.\n\nLiterally marked up vaseline. What makes it more advanced than regular Vaseline?? Doesn't do much for me but vaseline never did. I bought it from the pharmacy at work when I left my chapstick at home. I do like the tube so I guess it isn't pointless. \n\n**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tDiisostearyl Malate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytosteryl / Isostearyl / Cetyl / Stearyl / Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polybutene, Microcrystalline Wax / Cera Microcristallina / Cire Microcristalline, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Synthetic Wax, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax / Candelilla Cera / Cire de Candelilla, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Butylene / Ethylene / Styrene Copolymer, Ethylene / Propylene / Styrene Copolymer, Mica (CI 77019), Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Dimethicone, Fragrance / Parfum, Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Methicone, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax / Cera Carnauba / Cire de Carnauba, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Yellow 6 Lake (CI 15985), Red 6 (CI 15850), Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Water, Potassium Alginate, Propanediol, Glycerin, Alcohol, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Sapindus Mukorossi Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Chamaemorus Seed Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Chenopodium Quinoa Seed Extract, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Beta-Glucan, Manganese Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Ascorbyl Glucoside.\n\nOk at the risk of sounding crunchy granola AF what the hell is some of the stuff in this? Why does there need to be a million things in this? Theres some shea butter, some synthetic wax, other wax, silicones, and other stuff in it. No lanolin or petroleum. If you're allergic to lanolin its probably good. It's not bad. Its a little too slippery for my likes in a lip product. It doesn't stay on a long time. It doesn't seem to moisturize better than any other product. It doesn't seem to hurt my lips. I don't like the little tub it comes in because I don't want to wash my hands every time I wanna put lip balm on. It costs a little much for what it is for me. \n\n\n**Closing Arguments** *TL;DR*\n\nWhile Bite may be my ride or die, its going the way of the dinosaur. Lanolips has good products, the lanostick might be the most similar in terms of ingredients/feel although the packaging is different. Glossier's balm is suitable too although it does have petroleum in it. Most of these products do have lanolin and/or beeswax in them so they aren't suitable for vegans. \n\nI'd love to hear if there are any I missed trying, despite having tons of chapstick I am a chapstick junkie so I'd be interested to hear!!",

    "body": "[Here](https://imgur.com/a/Mnijy) are some pictures of the goods! \n\nWhen you get a haul, even a mini one, there is always at least one thing that doesn't work out the way you thought it would. For my finicky skin, it's usually several things. So I was ***shocked*** when not only did everything from my recent AB haul work for me, but it all worked ***really*** well. So well that I wanted to share my excitement with all of you! I'm still mildly in disbelief right now, this never happens. \n\nCVS was having a BOGO 50% off sale so I decided to try a couple things that I’ve had my eye on. I thought these reviews might be helpful for those in this sub that aren’t very familiar with AB products. My routine is a mix of different types of brands (I do love my French pharmacy products) but I’ve had a lot more luck finding things that work for my skin type in the AB world. Some people get scared off at the idea of ordering things from overseas - either because of shipping cost or the length of shipping times. Since these are all products carried at CVS, they are a lot more accessible for those in the US. \n\n**Skin type:** Oily, dehydration-prone, sometimes sensitive (depends on its mood that day), with a very low tolerance for silicones. \n\n**Holika Holika Aloe Cleansing Foam -** I've had rough luck with foaming cleansers as they all seem to strip my skin (other than my HG LRP Toleraine but it's fun to switch it up sometimes). Not this guy! My skin loves anything aloe and this did not disappoint (aloe is the best humectant for oily skin imo). It has a very dense, thick foam that feels very nice on my skin. The scent is very fresh, it almost reminds me of fresh-cut watermelon and aloe mixed together. It leaves my skin very soft and not remotely stripped. No squeaky-clean feeling here! I'm not positive of the pH but it does contain potassium hydroxide (a pH adjuster) so I'm assuming it's in the normal range and not on the higher end. I think this is going to make a great AM cleanser since it's so gentle. \n\nIngredients: \nAloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Water, Lauryl Hydroxysultaine, Myristic Acid, Lauric Acid, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Chlorphenesin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Palmitic Acid, Capric Acid, Butylene Glycol, Betula Platyphylla Japonica Juice, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Potassium Sorbate.\n\n(*Ah-ha! I just saw the watermelon extract as I was adding this, so that explains the lovely scent.)\n\n**Peach Slices Citrus-Honey Aqua Glow Hydrating Moisture Gel -** Holy shit you guys, this is ***everything*** I've been looking for in a winter moisturizer. It's lightweight, a gel, has ceramides, is hydrating *and* moisturizing and doesn't make me oily. The search is over! Seriously, I've been trying to find the perfect moisturizer for about 8 months now. I thought I had the perfect one (Etude House Moistfull Collagen Water Jelly Cream) but turns out it was perfect *for summer*. Once winters cold, dry air came it just wasn't enough. I've desperately wanted to add ceramides to my routine with no luck (Rosette Ceramide Gel was a greasy disaster). The inclusion of ceramides is what originally caught my eye and also the lack of any -cones. My skin is sensitive to silicones and finding a heavier winter moisturizer without any has been virtually impossible. This does include a couple -anes so I was skeptical at first but they don’t seem to bother me as much as straight up dimethicone. Dimethicone + my skin = a greasy mess and lots of clogged pores (and fun little whiteheads all over). The first time I used it, I squeezed out too much but thought 'what the heck, I'll see what happens'. As I began to spread it around, I realized that it was *way* too much product and figured I was doomed for an oily face that night. Cut to a few minutes later, when I was shocked to find that it had ***all*** absorbed. It dries down quickly to a soft, almost-matte finish. It legit gives my skin a healthy glow without making it oily, something that I didn't think was possible. The first time I wore it to work, I was ***incredibly*** impressed by the fact that my skin was still matte at the end of the day. My work's super dry air usually drives my dehydrated skin nuts and by the end of the day, it's over-produced a ton of oil to compensate. But not with this!! It gives my skin the hydration it always needs with just enough moisture to seal it all in. I am absolutely over-the-moon in love with this product and I can't recommend it enough! \n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Polysorbate 60, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Honey Extract, Ceramide Np, Sorbitan Stearate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, 1, 2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Isohexadecane, Tromethamine, Hydroxyacetophenone, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Polysorbate 80, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitan Oleate, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Oil, Disodium EDTA, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Butylene Glycol, Bixa Orellana Seed Oil, Tocopherol.\n\n**The Saem Iceland Hydrating Soothing Gel -** The name pretty much says it all and it lives up to those claims. It's very hydrating, soothing and feels very refreshing. The fascinating thing about this product is how it dries down. It leaves an almost undetectable finish. I've never had anything disappear into my skin before - and I say that in the best way possible. It doesn't leave a tacky film the way most gels do. I use the Skinfood aloe gel daily (which does leave a bit of stickiness) and out of curiosity, I applied this on top of it. The combo dried down to almost nothing! It took away the stickiness all together. I am highly impressed with this gel! It is definitely a staple in my routine now and (*gasp*) may just replace my beloved Skinfood aloe (at least in the AM).\n\nIngredients: Water, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate 20, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Perfume, Sodium Acrylates Crosspolymer-2, Potassium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Disodium EDTA, Silica, Betaine, Heptane, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Propylene Glycol, Butylene glycol, Cetraria Islandica Extract, Sorbitol, Citric acid, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Prunus Mume Fruit Extract, Lactic acid.\n\n**Elisha Coy Refreshing Ampoule Solution Sheet Mask -** Another product that lives up to its name. I was nervous because these are on the cheaper side and usually the quality reflects that. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised! The mask itself fit very well. It's on the thinner side and it reminds me a lot of my fav sheet masks, the Etude House 0.2mm Air Therapy. It stayed in place and despite the essence being very watery, it didn't drip everywhere. The mask really seemed to hold onto the essence. After I took it off, I patted in the remaining essence from the pouch and it all absorbed completely. I was able to continue my routine with no issues. My skin was left hydrated, soothed and happy. \n\nIngredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Magnolia Kobus Bark Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Betula Alba Juice, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower Extract, Chrysanthellum Indicum Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Fragrance.\n\nI haven’t had the chance yet to try the rest of the sheet masks yet but I am very excited to do so!! If anyone has any questions, I’m happy to help! :)\n",

Biore UV Kids Milk SPF 50 PA++++ is alcohol-free, fragrance-free, water-proof, sweat-proof, coloring-free, zero white cast, and free of all common irritants/unnecessary ingredients. It's one of the only sunscreens that doesn't annoy my very sensitive, acne-prone, easily reddened, and (currently) badly dehydrated face. It's never caused me to break out. Despite being water-resistant it washes off easily at the end of the day with a mild cleanser (I use Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser) which I really appreciate due to the fact that any kind of scrubbing of my face stings and burns while it's in this dehydrated state. This sunscreen does contain petrolatum, so if that's a sensitivity of yours or an ingredient that you prefer to avoid, you may want to avoid this sunscreen. Personally, I don't find that it makes the sunscreen feel greasy or heavy and it's never cause me to break out. It leaves a delicate dewy coating on my face that I really like (for reference, it has a slightly thicker consistency than Neutrogena's Hydroboost Gel Cream). The addition of petrolatum is invaluable for my dehydrated skin as I feel that it forms a slight occlusive barrier over my morning moisturizer (Cerave Moisturizing Cream or Hada Labo Skin Plumping Gel) to prevent TEWL along with protecting my skin from the sun.  \nIt's available on Amazon in a cheerful-looking 90g yellow bottle. It does take a while to arrive because of how far it has to ship, but it's well worth the wait. I personally adore this sunscreen and will never be without it. I never thought I'd be able to say that I look forward to applying sunscreen every day!  \n\n\nUV filters used:  Octinoxate, Tinosorb S, Uvinul A Plus, and Uvinul T 150    \n\n\nIngredients:  Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, C12-15 Akyl Benzoate,  Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol  Mehtoxyphenyl Triazine, Glyceryl Behenate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl  Hexyl Benzoate, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Sorbitan Distearate, Sodium  Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Stearoyl Glutamic  Acid, Paraffin, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Ceresin, Isohexadecane, Arginine,  Lauryl Methacrylate/Sodium Methacrylate Crosspolymer, PEG-12  Dimethicone, Polysorbate 80, Dextrin Palmitate, Disodium EDTA, Agar,  Succinic Acid, BHT, Petrolatum, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol,  Methylparaben, Sodium Dehydroacetate",

And yes, it's still super moisturising.\n\nOh, and my previous indie hair oils that I had to stop using because they're too oily? This trick saved them. I love love love /u/Dorian_Gray_ guys!",

I have no idea how these products perform, what their full shade range is like, nor the value in buying them.  Nor do I take into account whether these are liquid, pencil, or cream pot type formulas.  This is purely my quest for Silicone-Free stuff. \n\n\n\n**Resources:**  I used the website of Sephora, Ulta, Walmart, as well as some independent brands to locate and research products. other brands that I looked at (to no avail): windy lux, missha, beauty bakerie, L.A. Colors, innisfree, thefaceshop, KKW Beauty, CoulourPop.  They’re all just oozing with silicones.\n\n\n\n\nFor ingredient lists: [cosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/) .  For a comprehensive (NOT exhaustive) list of silicones found in cosmetics: [Paula's Choice Ingredient Dictionary](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/silicones).  I will say, that Paula’s Choice labels these all as “good”.  Ignore that.  Only your skin can tell you whether silicones are great for you, neutral, or literally the devil.  Also, they are missing some big ones, like polysilsesquioxane, silsesquioxane, etc.  Still, I believe it to be a good resource.  CosDNA is overall a wonderful tool if you’re looking for ANY ingredient in either Western OR Asian beauty products, not just silicone in concealers. Ok, that’s enough of that.  Below, I listed the concealers by price in US dollars.  As of mid November 2018, they were available for purchase.  I know that there are constantly new releases and reformulations, so this list will not be relevant forever. So it goes.  \n\n\n**Silicone FREE**\n\n* AOA Wonder Cover Concealer - $1 \n* ESSENCE Coverstick - $3 \n* NYX Concealer Jar - $4\n* MAYBELLINE Cover Stick Corrector Concealer - $5\n* NYX Gotcha Covered Concealer Pencil - $5\n* E.L.F.

Still, I hope this helps someone else in their silicone free quest!",

    "body": "I was on Sephora.com last week about to order some Kat Von D makeup removing wipes (I was hoping to find something that would take off waterproof everything and I recall the sample of hers doing the trick, as in being ridiculously oily.) when I came across something brand new: [Urban Decay's Makeup Removing Wipes](http://www.sephora.com/meltdown-makeup-remover-wipes-P409954?skuId=1850403&icid2=D=c6:products%20grid:p409954). I can literally not find these anywhere else, not a review, nothing. Or at least I couldn't prior to Friday. I was trying to find an ingredient list before ordering, but it was as though they did not exist other than the listing on Sephora.com to buy.  Since they were really reasonably priced (ETA: reasonable by Sephora standards.) and you get 100 wipes in the pack, I figured what the hell. I seem to have no self control when it comes to anything makeup related and just buy it like it's nothin'. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/b2kCl2Z\n\nThey arrived today and even though it's only 530 pm, and I really don't normally take my makeup off this early so as not to scare small children or offend their sensibilities (my niece has some pretty strong opinions about me going out without makeup on: she \"doesn't prefer it.\") I could not wait to test them out and see if they worked better than the [Aveeno ones](http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod5600049)  (shit, yo, Ulta charges way more, get em at Target or Drugstore.com or something!) I'd been using or if they burned any less. (FYI--they still burn but not as badly, but I have ridiculously sensitive skin, plus retinoids. So, everything burns.) \n\n\n\n*Sizing, and about the wipe:*\n\nThe sheets themselves are bit smaller (6.5\" x 4.5\") than the Aveeno ones (7.4\" x7.2\" per the package, so a little over 7\" square), but compared to the Aveeno ones were slightly damper--not as wet as I would like though and not as wet as I recall the Aveeno ones being in the past--and certainly not as damp as the Simple Micellar Wipes are.  I've had several packs of Aveeno ones that have been really dry lately from the start, and dried out before the pack was even half done. \n\nThe wipes themselves are texturally similar. The Aveeno ones are slightly thicker, and stronger than the UD ones, but the UD ones are labeled as biodegradable. \n\nA used UD wipe:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/tcuMw6M\n\n\n\n*Efficacy/Usage:*\n\nI usually use one Aveeno wipe (out of a 25 wipe pack) at a time, and that will take off most or all of my waterproof eye makeup (yknow, assuming it is wet enough) and then will go over my whole face with one of the Simple Micellar wipes to make sure any oiliness is gone. There are still times where I don't get all of the eye makeup off, because I pile it on. Often what is left is mascara, and I either give up, or will go over my lashes with another wipe OR use one of the Ocusoft scrub pads to get it off. \n\nI felt due to the size of the Urban Decay wipes that I needed two. I probably didn't, but for the sake of comfort, I did use two. Given that 100 come in the pack, even if I use two at a time, I will still get twice as much out of this pack assuming it doesn't dry out before I run out.  I still used the Simple wipe afterward, because again, oily.  I did not really have anything left on my eyes or lashes afterwards, and didn't feel like I needed to go over my lashes or eyes at all. There might be a tiny bit of something still on there, but not enough that I feel like I need to worry about it. I'd go to bed like this.   Tonight I have boxing, so I will still shower, so I don't care--I'll be washing my face again.\n\nBefore/After photos, try not to have nightmares:\n\nB:  http://imgur.com/P4MOMdb\n\nB:  http://imgur.com/qmJiPAq\n\nA:  http://imgur.com/1BbCxIF\n\n\n\n*Pricing:*\n\nThe price difference is significant, but I felt worthwhile.  The Aveeno wipes are around $6.99 (at Target) for a pack of 25. The Urban Decay were $20 for a pack of 100. So basically to get as many Aveeno wipes as UD wipes, you'd pay $27.96 assuming you didn't find them on sale/coupon deal. Though, I guess considering you're using two UD wipes, it's really half that, so $13.98, given I need one Aveeno for every two UD wipes (need...maybe. Used, yes.) And again, that assumes the Aveeno ones are not dried out. \n\n\n\n*Ingredients:*\n\nI took a photo of the package, it's not great. \nhttp://imgur.com/Gqw4mWc\n\nList is:\n\nWater, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Ethyl Macadamiate, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Citrate, Gluconolactone, Polyglyceryl-3 Polyricinoleate, Sunflower Seed Oil, Sodium Benzoate, Olive Oil, Lavender Oil, Jojoba Seed Oil, Sodium Laurylglucosides Hydroxypropylsulfonate, Calcium Gluconate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Chloride, Rice Bran Extract, Tocopheryl, Malic Acid, Sunflower Extract, Rosemary Leaf Extract\n\n\nBut this product has five natural oils in it, vs none in the Aveeno.  Here's the list from Ulta on the Aveeno:\n\nWater, Isononyl Isononanoate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Isostearyl Palmitate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hexylene Glycol, PEG-6, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Phenoxyethanol, Sucrose Cocoate, Fragrance, Carbomer, PEG-4 Laurate, Sodium Hydroxide, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Chrysanthemum Parthenium(Feverfew) Flower/Leaf/Stem Juice, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Glycerin, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract.  The package says there's a 3 month shelf life, which I think given the ingredient list is interesting, though, it's heavy on the natural oils, and maybe they're less stable?  Compared to the Aveeno list, it's significantly more natural. \n\n\n\n*Bottom Line:*\n\nI am pretty impressed after one use. I will see how I feel after several more. I want to see if they dry out and how quickly they dry out if they do.   But efficacy in the first use made them worth my while. \n\nedited to correct stupid typo\n\n\n**24 hours later update:**\n\nI just did my second use today and I was able to use ONE wipe this time (well that was my requirement of myself this time), and it worked just fine, both eyes completely clean. I followed with the Simple Micellar wipe all over and briefly around my eyes, bec I am just that anal, and my face is spiffy.  Then I just applied my serums and all that after like normal.  *Fingers crossed* that my face doesn't lose it's marbles with all the natural oils. ",

    "body": "I recently had yet another Bobbi Brown Gel Eyeliner dry out on me and in my frustration, began the google search for how to rehydrate it. I found a lot of suggestions, which I will review below, but none of them involved replacing the ingredient that had actually evaporated. Here is the ingredients list:\n\n\nIsododecane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Polyethylene, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Propylene Carbonate, Lecithin, Phenyl Trimethicone, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Methicone, Barium Sulfate, BHT, Phenoxyethanol. May contain: Iron Oxides, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Blue 1 Lake, Carmine, Chromium Oxide Greens, Manganese Violet, Yellow 5 Lake, Chromium Hydroxide Green, Bismuth Oxychloride, Ultramarines, Ferric Ferrocyanide\n\n\nRestoration Methods:\n\n* Visine: Safe around the eyes, but uses water to rehydrate. As you can see, this product does not contain water, so adding water to reliquify it, while functional, does not actually recreate the formula. Of the recommendations I encountered, I think this (or another uncontaminated water-based product, like distilled water, saline solution -- do not use tap water, as it might contain microorganisms you really don't want near your eye!) is the best if you're not going to use cyclomethicones.\n* Glycerin: Similar to the water suggestion (glycerin is a humectant which absorbs water) this will be somewhat functional, but actually is less preferable to visine because glycerin may add a bit of a sticky/tacky sensation because it does not evaporate... rather it retains water :)\n* Microwave: This softens the product in a similar way that the microwave softens bread, but ultimately the formula is never the same and will be more drying long term by causing further evaporation.\n* Oil: This will remove the long-wear and stay in place aspects, making it smudgy and will never set... because oil does not evaporate.\n\n\nThe real magic is in the first two ingredients: Isododecane and Cyclopentasiloxane. The former is a solvent, while the latter is a volatile silicone that evaporates. While they sound obscure, you stand a good chance of already owning something that is composed of these ingredients!\n\n\nMakeup removers are good bet. Neutrogena's Oil-Free Eye Makeup Remover and Walmart Equate's dupe are great budget options, especially as the cyclomethicone layer is floating on the top and separate from the water-based formula. /u/QualityLeaf wrote a [wonderful comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/3vm4v5/psa_restore_your_driedout_gel_eye_liner_or_eye/cxqtr30) with a photo demonstration -- thank you so much for that!\n\n\nYou might also have a silicone serum that is mainly composed of this product. For example, Peter Thomas Roth Retinol Fusion PM. Ingredients: Cyclopentasiloxane, Squalane, Retinol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Water (Aqua), Pentylene Glycol, Polysorbate 20, Lechitin, Bisabolol, Alcohol. This is what I used, and it works like a dream, but some may be sensitive to retinol.\n\nYou could also source a cyclomethicone in its pure form -- might come in handy for DIY!\n\nHow to actually apply the cyclomethicone to the product? Because the product I use comes in a dropper bottle, I literally just applied one drop to the top and let it sink in by itself. No mixing, easy as pie!\n\nHope this was helpful to someone :)",

Of course, as an azelaic acid devotee, my interest was piqued. I flipped through the ingredients and quickly realized I had used this product before, shipped and sold to me from the EU in the silver packaging of the [RESIST Skin Transforming Multi-Correction Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice-eu.com/resist-anti-aging-skin-transforming-multi-correction-treatment-with-azelaic-acid-bha-m7750.html#2). \n\nUp until recently, you could have this product shipped to you from the EU, but as someone pointed out to me about a month back, you can no longer have this product imported into the US. This was fairly upsetting, as the product works quite well (better than The Ordinary's Azelaic Acid suspension, in my experience) and combines AzA (10%), BHA (2%), _and_ skin-brightening licorice root - a wonderful combination for fighting acne and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation at the same time. I've already seen some people asking about this new product, so I figured I'd so a quick review on it in case you are considering taking the plunge!\n\n* * *\n\n##Product Overview\n\n================\n\n[PHOTOS OF THE PRODUCT](https://imgur.com/a/1Hge05D)\n\nFirst off, I wanted to show the ingredient list alongside the new ingredient list for the Azelaic Acid Booster, [which is now being sold on the US Paula's Choice website](https://www.paulaschoice.com/10pct-azelaic-acid-booster/775.html?ftlt=branded&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc_branded&amp;utm_campaign=sitelink_azelaic&amp;adid=277156189668&amp;addisttype=g&amp;c3apidt=20868919338&amp;CASLID=120196850000133286&amp;CATRK=SPFID-1&amp;CAAGID=21602268800&amp;CATCI=kwd-9808655660&amp;CAPCID=277156189668&amp;CADevice=c&amp;gclid=CPGw8Kmjp9wCFcFMgQodftUMig&amp;gclsrc=ds). \n\n\n**US - Azelaic Acid Booster Ingredients**\n\n&gt;_Water (Aqua), Azelaic Acid (skin-soothing, antioxidant, exfoliant), C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate (emollient), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (skin-replenishing), Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate (emollient), Glycerin (skin-replenishing), Cetearyl Alcohol (texture enhancer), Glyceryl Stearate (texture enhancer), Dimethicone (hydration/texture enhancer), Salicylic Acid (exfoliant), Adenosine (skin-restoring), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Bisabolol (skin-soothing), Cyclopentasiloxane (texture enhancer), Xanthan Gum (stabilizer), Sclerotium Gum (stabilizer), Propanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n\n**EU - RESIST Skin Transforming Multi-Correction Treatment Ingredients**\n\n&gt;_Aqua, Azelaic Acid (skin brightener/antioxidant), C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate (texture-enhancing), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (hydration/skin replenishing), Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate (texture-enhancing), Glycerine (hydration/skin replenishing), Cetearyl Alcohol (texture-enhancing), Glyceryl Stearate (texture-enhancing), Dimethicone (hydration), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Propanediol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (Beta Hydroxy Acid, exfoliant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Sclerotium Gum (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Bisabolol (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Adenosine (skin-restoring), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\nThe ingredients are exactly the same, just arranged differently past a certain point. This is probably due to the FDA's packaging requirements (specifically the Fair Packaging and Label Act of 1967), which requires that all ingredients in order of concentrations up to 1% be listed in order of concentration, rather than the actual formula. Similarly, the EU regulates that ingredients must be listed in descending order by weight, up to 1%. \n\nAdmittedly, I have not purchased a tube of the Azelaic Acid Booster, so I can't tell you for certain that it has the identical feel and results, but I do feel pretty confident in assuming that it is the same product formula for both.    \n\n* * *\n\n##Ingredient Breakdown\n\n\nThere are extensive benefits to azelaic acid (AzA), but in general, AzA is an anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial ingredient that is frequently used in acne and rosacea treatments, especially with sensitive skin types that are more prone to irritation from ingredients like benzoyl peroxide (BP) and tretinoin (Retin-A). In one study I cited, 20% AzA combined with glycolid acid (AHA) has been shown to be just as efficacious in treating mild-to-moderate acne as .025% tretinoin. In another study, it was shown to be as effective as 5% BP as well as 1% clindamycin. \n\nIt is also bacteriostatic, repressing the ability of bacteria to reproduce, which may be why it is anti-inflammatory. In addition to these characteristics, it is also a tyrosinase inhibitor, with a special affinity for abnormal melanocytes, making it ideal in treatment of melasma or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). In fact, it is much safer and typically more preferred to hydroquinone, which is a skin lightener that tends to target all skin cells and has created concerns due to potentially causing tumors in mice. In an open study comparing 20% AzA twice daily to 4% hydroquinone, it showed to be just as effective if not more effective than the hydroquinone in reducing mild melasma. \n\nThis formula also contains 2% salicylic acid (BHA), a derivative of salicin. It is oil-soluable, making it more effective at penetrating to the areas most effected by acne. Like it's cousin, AHA (frequently found in the forms of glycolic or lactic acid), it helps to break apart the corneocytes that do not shed properly, which ideally prevents breakouts from occurring. It is not as photo-sensitizing as an AHA and in many people it is not nearly as irritating, even being characterized as \"soothing\" or \"anti-inflammatory\" (perhaps due to the fact that it serves as an active metabolite of asprin). Unfortunately, according to the 2016 \"[Guidelines of Care for the Management of Acne Vulgaris](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26897386)\" from the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, \"clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of salicylic acid in acne are limited.\" \n\nThis product also contains licorice root extract, which I talked a bit about [in my review of Kikumasamune Sake Skin Lotion](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8vxh46/review_review_and_ingredient_breakdown/). Licorice root extract is similarly a tyrosinase inhibitor as well as an anti-irritant – with some studies signalling that it may be able to absorb UVA and UVB rays. It is more effective than kojic acid and some studies put it at 75x more effective than ascorbic acid ([though Dr Dray raises some interesting points regarding the efficacy of L-AA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JxO6sVMJzM)). “The chief constituent of licorice root is glycyrrhizin, present in concentrations that range from 5 to 24 percent depending on the variety of licorice used.” It should be noted that in the US packaging, licorice root appears after Salicylic Acid in the ingredient listing, which is 2% of the formula, so we can assume that the licorice content is less than 2%.\n\n* * *\n\n##My Experience\n\n\nI went through about half of the tube of this product before shelving it, as I felt like it aggravated the erythema in my rosacea, as most BHA products do. I've always avoided the areas around my nose, where I get the most flushed, and with this product I did have to apply the product there to deliver the benefits of AzA to my rosacean-prone areas. \n\nIt does have the exact same side effects as Finacea, tingling and itching upon first use (this eventually goes away, but is much worse if you are new to AzA), but this felt very assuring to me that it contained the amount of AzA that it is advertising (10%). \n\nIt also feels quite similar to Finacea Gel, but perhaps a bit smoother and spreads a touch easier. It also has a very Finacea-esc scent that is difficult to describe if you've never used azelaic acid products before. It is not strong by any means, nor does it linger, but I am very attuned to the scent after years of using Finacea. \n\nUnfortunately, I don't have much acne these days to tell you whether or not it is ideal for acne, but I did feel like my pores looked a bit clearer and smoother while I was using it, though not markedly better than when I use 2% BHA Liquid. Nor do I have much scarring and hyperpigmentation to be able to say for sure whether this formula helped with lightening any dark spots. \n\nOther than the erythema, my skin did not have any issues with the formulation, and felt no more hydrated or irritated than when I use my regular Finacea. It did feel much more efficacious than the Ordinary's Azelaic Acid 10%, which I used briefly a couple of months back. To compare, the Ordinary's AzA is suspended in a very powdery, primer-like silicone formula, which I wasn't the biggest fan of. I also didn't feel like it really _did_ much, and I didn't feel any of the itchy tingle of the AzA on application. \n\nAll-in-all though, if you do well with BHA and are looking to add AzA to your routine, I think this is a wonderful product. \n\n\n* [To Purchase in the US](https://www.paulaschoice.com/10pct-azelaic-acid-booster/775.html?ftlt=branded&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc_branded&amp;utm_campaign=sitelink_azelaic&amp;adid=277156189668&amp;addisttype=g&amp;c3apidt=20868919338&amp;CASLID=120196850000133286&amp;CATRK=SPFID-1&amp;CAAGID=21602268800&amp;CATCI=kwd-9808655660&amp;CAPCID=277156189668&amp;CADevice=c&amp;gclid=CPGw8Kmjp9wCFcFMgQodftUMig&amp;gclsrc=ds) \\- $36 USD + Shipping for 1 fl. oz\n\n* [To Purchase in the EU](https://www.paulaschoice-eu.com/resist-anti-aging-skin-transforming-multi-correction-treatment-with-azelaic-acid-bha-m7750.html) - € 36,00 ($41.97 USD) + Shipping for 1 fl. oz.\n\n* * *\n\n## Sources\n\n*   [Disruption of the transmembrane pH gradient--a possible mechanism for the antibacterial action of azelaic acid in Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/)\n*   [Induction of Renal Cell Tumors in Rats and Mice, and Enhancement of Hepatocellular Tumor Development in Mice after Long‐term Hydroquinone Treatment](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1349-7006.1991.tb01783.x)\n*   [A Guide to the Ingredients and Potential Benefits of Over-the-Counter Cleansers and Moisturizers for Rosacea Patients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3168246/)\n*   [Dr Dray - Azelaic Acid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARIK9RdXPJ0)\n*  [Milady Skin Care and Cosmetic Ingredients Dictionary,  2014, M.

This review will be mainly overall experience, with some recent insights. I have more products that I have used in the past, but I decided to only review ones I have a lot of experience with so far. The only product I don't have reviewed from my routine is the Advanced Retinoid - as I just reintroduced that back into my routine in the last week.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**My current routine:**\n\n*AM*\n\n1.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n2.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n3.\tTO Niacinamide over whole face\n4.\tApply TO Caffeine to under eye\n5.\tFormula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free moisturizer over whole face\n6.\tIf using sunscreen, use Etude House Sunprise\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*PM*\n\n1.\tIf wearing makeup, I use baby oil to remove\n2.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n3.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n4.\tPaula’s Choice 2% BHA Gel to whole face – wait ~20 mins to sink in\n5.\tTO Retinoid Advanced Retinoid 2% over whole face\n6.\tMoisturize with Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Info about my skin/general experience trying out products:**\n\n* VERY oily t-zone, normal cheeks, normal-to-dry jaw line and around mouth; light-to-medium skin tone\n* VERY VERY CC-prone, mainly on my forehead (some on chin). This is mainly due to not being consistent with my routine (especially simply washing my face with a cleanser, which is the minimum I need). This can also occur from moisturizer.\n* No issues with acne, except a few whiteheads around my menstrual cycle\n* Most cleansers I have tried are either a) not strong enough or b) too strong\n* Main skin concerns: Oil control, reducing appearance of giant nose pores, preventing CCs, even skin tone, healthy aging\n* Slowly trying to reduce the number of products I use for all the things (not just skin care) that contain fragrances\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser](https://imgur.com/a/uAvebDj)\n\n***Product Type:*** Cleanser; specifically purchased because it is **sulfate free** (my body hates sulfates)\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Juice, Coco-Betaine, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Peg-50 Shea Butter, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Lycium Barbarum Fruit Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Morinda Citrifolia Fruit Extract, Punica Granatum Juice Extract, Garcinia Mangostana Fruit Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Fragrance, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Benzoic Acid, Sorbic Acid, Red 33\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance free**; **Sulfate free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; AM: use with konjac sponge; Fragrance is actually pleasant, doesn’t linger; consistency starts off creamy, but foams very easily\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is amazing, and has been a major game-changer for me when it comes to cleansers. I’ve never found a cleanser that worked long-term before this one. A little goes a long way with this stuff – it is a very efficient clean. My face feels so soft afterwards. While it is strong enough to get rid of all my oil, it’s not so harsh that it makes my skin tight.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** In terms of function, none that I can think of. Only downfall (IMO) is it is not fragrance-free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4.5/5 stars, I’ve gone through over 4-5 bottles of this stuff and I will keep it in rotation until I can find a functionally similar product that is fragrance-free\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Thayer’s Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner](https://imgur.com/a/OwCREGs)\n\n***Product Type:*** Toner; purchased because of how many people liked it on ScA\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~0.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Purified Water, Certified Organic Witch Hazel Ext Blend (Hamamelis Virginiana Extract (Witch Hazel*), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (Filet of Aloe Vera*)), Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Water, Fragrance (Natural Rose), Citric Acid, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Seed Extract\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** ***Not fragrance-free***; Liquid consistency; potentially irritating, depending on your skins relationship with witch hazel\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Despite the smell (see below), this stuff works pretty well. I always feel like this enhances my *clean* feel following my cleanse, but it also leaves my skin feeling refreshed and moisturized. I always follow-up with moisturizer, but I can definitely tell when I don’t use it, especially in my dry areas.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** **I HATE THE SMELL OF THIS STUFF!** Come to find out, I hate the smell of roses (I’m weird, I know…) but seriously. This stuff smells like a rose pooped in some water and then sold it on the side of the road on a hot sunny day. It’s terrible. If you are remotely disinterested in the smell of rose, do not buy this.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5 due to smell. Will repurchase the fragrance-free version in the future\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%](https://imgur.com/a/Tuo5otO)\n\n***Product Type:*** Purchased to reduce redness/even skin tone and to control oil; side-benefits: helps prevent CCs\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mild medicinal smell**, doesn’t linger; Somewhat-sticky consistency; Absorbs quickly\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** I keep this in rotation mainly because it helps control my oil. Even if I use this stuff without my mattifying moisturizer, it helps prevent the massive amounts of oil that my skin normally produces. It helps keep my skin an even texture and tone, as well. I’m not 100% sure if this is solely responsible for preventing my CC (doubt it, since I use BHA), but I’m almost certain it’s contributing at the least. This product has been one that I have been most consistent with besides my cleanser and what little redness I sometimes develop (mainly due to allergies or weather) has been under control.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Functionally, none. This stuff does what it’s supposed to. I just hate the dropper packaging, personally, of most TO products. It’s hard to get the little bits out of the bottom!!\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, have repurchased 2+ times; will be replacing with skinlex’s version to avoid buying more products from Deciem.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG](https://imgur.com/a/roT93Vy)\n\n***Product Type:*** Active for reducing appearance of eye contour pigmentation\n\n***Cost:*** **$* - ~$7.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Caffeine, Maltodextrin, Glycerin, Propanediol, Epigallocatechin Gallatyl Glucoside, Gallyl Glucoside, Hyaluronic Acid, Oxidized Glutathione, Melanin, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Seed Extract, Urea, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Xanthan gum, Lactic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Propyl Gallate, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Benzyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; Watery-to-thick consistency (from the glycerin, probably); no noticeable smell; yellow-ish in color\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I’ve been using this stuff for a little over a year, and honestly it does absolutely nothing for my eye contour. I don’t have much puffiness, but I do have decent enough under eye darkness where I wanted something to help. This does not. It does help reduce the appearance with some small, visible blood vessels around my nose, but it’s only a temporary effect thereby reducing redness. \n\n***Bad stuff:*** It doesn’t really work for what I wanted it to work for.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 1/5, WNRP.\n\n*Does anyone have any suggestions of what I can do with what I have leftover? I’d love to use it for something else if it’s functional!*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free Mattifying Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/rQeCSUV)\n\n***Product Type:*** Daytime moisturizer; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Propylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethicone, Ceteareth-20, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Silica Silylate, Behenyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Salicylic Acid, Panthenol, Fragrance, Boron Nitride, Bambusa Arundinacea (Bamboo) Stem Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Maltodextrin, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance-free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; very thick consistency; absorbs quickly; powdery/soft finish\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** Another game-changer with my oily skin. Using this moisturizer during the day saves my face from producing oil. Even if I sweat a little bit, it controls oil. Normally, without it, I’ll start producing oil within a few hours of cleansing. If I use this moisturizer, I’m relatively oil-free all day, except around my nostrils. This is also a strong enough moisturizer to keep my dryness at bay, even during the wintertime (and where I live gets very cold during the winter).\n\n***Bad stuff:*** The smell is pretty bad (probably the bamboo), but honestly I get used to it and the smell goes away quickly. My friend said it smells like wet dog... haha but I don't notice it anymore since I've been using it for so long.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, only because it’s not fragrance-free. Will continue to repurchase until I can find a fragrance-free alternative.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish Sun Milk SPF50+/PA+++](https://imgur.com/a/kXZLXCa)\n\n***Product Type:*** Sunscreen; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.40 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dipropylene Glycol, Titanium Dioxide, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Viscum Album (Mistletoe) Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Carex Humillis Root Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Pinus Sylvestris Leaf Oil, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Malpighia Emarginata (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract, Echium Plantagineum Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Peg-10 Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Magnesium Sulfate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Methicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Aluminum Hydroxide, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Octyldodecanol, Dimethicone, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate, Polyglyceryl-6 Polyricinoleate, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Butylene Glycol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Cellulose Gum\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mineral sunscreen**; **Not fragrance-free**; **Mild whitecast**, but absorbs well; **Drying**; mattifying/oil-control like a boss; pleasant scent; not waterproof\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Due to drying my skin out, I only use this product when I have to. I don’t wear SPF most days (work inside, very little exposure to sun during the day), but I do wear this when I’m running errands and/or trying to control my oil more than I can with the moisturizer mentioned previously. This stuff works really well to control oil – the best of any product I’ve tried so far. Wears well under makeup, as long as my dry skin is kept controlled. Some minor white cast, but with my skin it absorbs and isn’t visible (even when I’m tanner) – but may not be the same on someone with a darker than medium skin tone.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** This product is very drying. It works SO WELL on controlling oil, but it zaps any amount of moisture out of my dry spots. To the point where I have to counteract the dryness in my PM routine. Do not recommend for people with sensitive skin, or dry skin.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 3/5, due to drying and not being fragrance-free; Will continue to repurchase until I find an alternative that controls my oil as well as this does, if ever.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Paula’s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Gel Exfoliant](https://imgur.com/a/X9YEexN)\n\n***Product Type:*** Chemical exfoliant; meant to prevent/reduce CCs and help with overall skin texture\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$8.80 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, (hydration), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Phytosphingosine (skin-renewing), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Vitis Vinifera Seed Extract (grape extract/antioxidant), Camellia Sinensis Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (green tea/antioxidant) Epilobium Angustifolium Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (willow herb/skin-soothing), Bisabolol (skin-soothing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH-adjusting), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; **BHA**; thick consistency, absorbs slowly\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is AMAZING! It attacks any signs of CCs overnight, and can easily clear my CC-prone forehead within a day or two. I use it almost every day as a preventative. My face has been noticeably clearer and smoother thanks to this product. Also, it visibly reduces the appearances of pores - this combined with the retinol I use has been an amazing in reducing their appearance.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Smells chemical, so may be off-putting to some people. Absorbs slowly, so you should leave room in your routine for that.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, WRP. I am going to be trying to the liquid version (I got it on sale), but if this works better for me over the liquid I will come back to it\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/BDGVfpd)\n\n***Product Type:*** PM moisturizer; light-weight\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$9.50 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Dimethicone/vinyl Dimenticone Crosspolymer, Phenoxyethaqnol, Polyacrylamide, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Dimethiconol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Laureth-7, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, C12-14 Pareth -12, Sodium Hydroxide, Blue 1\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **NOT Fragrance-free**; **Contains silicones**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; **Contains hyaluronic acid**; Very light-weight moisturizer.\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I love this product. It was the first moisturizer I tried when I embarked on my skincare journey, and I am so thankful I found it. This is the first moisturizer I used every in my life that didn’t break me out or lead to a forehead full of CCs. I’m in love with this stuff! It is light enough for my super oily spots (which is not due to being dry, it’s just oily…) and is strong enough for my dry spots. In the winter I use a little extra HA serum over my whole face and it works like a charm. I’ve been dabbling with some oils as well, but so far I haven’t found it necessary in the summer because this moisturizer works so well!\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Nothing, just that it’s not fragrance free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, because of fragrance. Will continue to RP until I can find an alternative that I can afford and is fragrance free.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading, everyone! I hope this is helpful, as I use some products that you don't see a lot around here (as well as some you do...). This is definitely a more simplified version of my routine, but that may be a good thing, as I'm noticing the same effects as to what I was seeing before despite reducing the number of products I use!",

I guess 2 days?\n\nIt only partly works in the middle part of the hair, and doesn't really soften the split ends. \nAfter 2 days, hair's back to dry and starts flying away vehemently, and i have to take the help of serums which I don't like since they weigh my hair down. \n\nThe only pro is that the smell remains till the next wash, and every time I open my hair, my room gets filled with floral fragrance.\nBut it's still not enough to pay for this tub.\n\nIt might be good for someone with not too much of a frizz problem and thick hair (people with already smooth hair you know🙃).\n\nI got it for 199 with a coupon a few months back, so for that price, it's okay.\nBut I wouldn't repurchase, and would like to try some other hair mask.",

I wanted a shampoo that would cleanse without making my hair dry . So that’s when BA ultra smoothening shampoo came into play & it’s been the only one I have been using since back then . The ultra smoothening hair mask is also my HG if u have ultra rough + fine hair . Probably not the best for thicker hair types . I have seen considerable improvement in my scalp health cz the shampoo would cleanse without stripping moisture . Also , if you sweat a lot or use lot of products & theres buildup on ur scalp , this won’t be enough. You might have to add a clarifying shampoo once in 2 weeks or a month . I have used their smoothening hair serum but unfortunately that didn’t work . Their hair growth serum seemed promising cz it did reduce my hair fall considerably. Their anti-dandruff range is bad , my brother used it & got more dandruff instead .",

    "body": "*Moisturisers seem to be the most boring and ignored category in a skincare regime but I have learnt over the years that they actually play the most important role. Sometimes actives are not what your skin is looking for and a good moisturiser can be the game-changer.*\n\n[Just a pic](https://preview.redd.it/p39fzjc4kx661.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=027cc219d95e8947525507a3beec33a9d459f961)\n\nBefore I review the products, these are my expectations from my moisturiser.\n\n1. ***Hydrate:*** Bring water/moisture to my skin\n2. ***Emolliate:*** Thanks to kindofstephen (google his blog or insta if you haven't) for providing a term to my feelings. Make my skin soft and supple by nourishing my stratum corneum with nourishing lipids without clogging my pores.\n3. ***Strengthen my barrier:*** To reduce TEWL by strengthening my barrier so that my skin stays hydrated and supple for longer. This also means I want the moisturiser to have slight occlusive properties.\n4. ***Repair:*** To help my damaged/sensitised skin by repairing my skin barrier.\n5. ***Extras/added benefits:*** Would like if the moisturiser additionally helps to deliver certain ingredients that help with targetted issues like ageing, hyperpigmentation etc. This is not a must though.\n\n\\---\n\n***1. Avene Skin Recover Cream -*** ₹*1500 (depends on discounts); Cost Per gm: ₹30/gm*\n\nThis is my go-to skin-emergency product. I do not use it on daily basis. The texture is cloudlike but not mousse-y. It is a lightweight cream. Nevertheless, it packs a punch. I have gone through 8+ tubes of this stuff. It is the only cream that does not aggravate any sensitised areas (burning/redness/dry patches/peeling patches) and absolutely calms my skin. This cream is true to its name. Repairs compromised flaking, sensitised skin in two days with twice/thrice a day usage. The ingredient list is very minimalistic. It is expensive and the sterile patented packaging kind of sucks because you will most definitely have face squirts if you are not careful. However, I can rely on this cream to fix my skin mistakes.\n\n* Hydrate: 4/5\n* Emmoliate: 4/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 4.5/5\n* Extras: 0/5\n* Status: HG, It is easily available in India but shit is expensive.\n\n***Perfect for: All skin types, Sensitive skin***\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene Aqua), Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Squalane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Serine, Carbomer, Tetrasodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, Water (Aqua)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***2. Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream -*** *$10/* ₹*1300 (with shipping/customs); Cost per gm* ₹6.5/gm\n\nI tried this product a month back and I am in love. This cream is perfectly balanced. It adequately hydrates and emolliates my skin. My skin feels supple and bouncy without being too greasy and the moisture lasts. I did not see noticeable calming benefits but as a moisturiser it is lovely. The tube is huge and a little goes a long way. This has a slight cooling effect when applied to the skin. Also uses a patented encapsulation delivery mechanism to delivery pseudo-ceramides (lab-made) which help to strengthen your skin barrier. In short, it is a simple no frill moisturiser that is easy to use - not too thick, not too thin, not too heavy, not too light, doesn't sensitize, not too silicone-y, doesn't pill, value for money.\n\n* Hydrate: 4/5\n* Emmoliate: 4/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 3.5/5\n* Extras: 0/5\n* Status: will repurchase.\n\n***Perfect for: All skin types***\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Stearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Palmitic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide Mea, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Magnolia Biondii Flower Extract, Cholesterol, Perilla Ocymoides Seed Extract, Lactobacillus/​Soybean Ferment Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohols, Glyceryl Caprylate, Dimethiconol, Mannitol, Cyclohexasiloxane, Silica, Arachidyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Alcohol, Acrylates/​Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polysorbate 20, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Propanediol*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***3. Eucerin Q10 Anti Wrinkle Face Cream -*** *$9*\n\nThis is my third tub of this cream. This cream is richer than any cream in the lot. It has a thick emollient texture without being too greasy. It absorbs easily in the skin. It also contains shea butter, SAP and Ubiquinone (Q10). This cream has helped me transition into tretinoin. Do not recommend it for day time use (especially in summers) but for night time/winters it is perfect. It keeps my face moisturised through the night and it has a soft blurring effect on fine lines/skin texture. It did not sensitize peeling skin but helped repair my barrier. I use this regularly at night and it helped to fix the acute dryness that comes with tretinoin. I use it around my eyes and it hasn't given me milia/ clogged my pores. My mom loves and swears by it. She finds it makes her wrinkles look softer.\n\n* Hydrate: 3.5/5\n* Emmoliate: 4.5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 4/5\n* Extras: 3/5\n* Status: HG but not readily available in India. Will stock up when relatives come post covid.\n\n***Perfect for:*** *Combo-dehydrated/Dry/ Mature skin*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Cocoate, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Stearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Octyldodecanol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ubiquinone, Biotin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Zea Mays (Corn) Oil, Beta-Carotene, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Trisodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Phenoxyethanol*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***4. Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume -*** ₹*1300 (with shipping/customs); Cost per gm* ₹6.5/gm\n\nThis cream is unique. As the name suggests it is a cream-balm hybrid but the texture is surprisingly lightweight. Highly emollient with occlusive properties. It absorbs quickly into the skin as the texture is not too heavy. Sadly, it leaves a greasy feeling/film on my skin. I can not use it the day time and worry that it will clog my pores if I use it on my face. I love it for the body especially my Sahara hands. It seriously brings life to my hands and I do not need to reapply often. I did notice a calming effect. Many of my friends from the community love to use it on their face. It is a little too heavy for my face. If your face is very dry, I think you may like this.\n\n* Hydrate: 3/5\n* Emmoliate: 5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 3.5/5\n* Extras: 0\n* Status: WNRP at least for my face.\n\n***Perfect for:***  *Extremely Dry Skin*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Aqua/​Water/​Eau, Glycerin, Paraffinum Liquidum /​ Mineral Oil /​ Huile Minerale, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Behenyl Alcohol, Sucrose Stearate, Canola /​ Canola Oil /​ Huile De Colza, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Pentylene Glycol, Beta-Sitosterol, Xylitol, Zinc Gluconate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Palmitamide Mea, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Rhamnose, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 60, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Phytosphingosine, Ceramide Np, Mannitol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceramide Ap, Cholesterol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Ceramide EOP*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***5. Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream -*** ₹2700 *(estimated); Cost per gm* ₹45/gm\n\nI was sort of disappointed with this product. It is not a bad product but it is not necessarily better. The soft blue colour deceives your mind to think the cream texture may be light. It is actually slightly thick with a silicone-y feel. It has a cooling effect on the skin when you first apply it which tricks the calming feeling. While it is hydrating when you first apply it but compared to others I feel the moisture does not last as long. Also, it makes the sensitised area skin sort of burn. The feeling is not intense but very much against claims. I did not notice any calming/repairing benefits. It may also not be enough moisturisation for the winters. The colour is aesthetically pleasing and silicone-y texture + cooling feel can outwit you into enjoying application but I do not see many real benefits.\n\n* Hydrate: 3/5\n* Emmoliate: 2.5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 3/5\n* Repair: 3/5\n* Extras: 1?\n* Status: WNRP, Expensive.\n\n***Perfect for:***  *Oily/ Combo Dehydrated Skin?*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Centella Asiatica Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Glyceryl Stearate, Stearic Acid, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Polysorbate 60, Bees Wax, Chlorphenesin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Morus Alba Root Extract, Tromethamine, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Guaiazulene, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Lecithin, Acetyl Glutamine, SH-Oligopeptide-1, SH-Oligopeptide-2, SH-Polypeptide-1, SH-Polypeptide-9, SH-Polypeptide-11, Bacillus/​Soybean/​Folic Acid Ferment Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol*\n\n&#x200B;",

The last tab of this app has the annual best ranking for each category. \n\n* I learned from one of the previous posts that products at full price in physical store often cost as much as you buy them from our frequent websites (bnk, roseroseshop, or jolse, etc) so I had a spreadsheet to show at what sale (20%, 30% or 1+1) it would be worth it.\n\n* My skin reacts to cyclopentasiloxane so that rules out a lot of serum/emulsion/cream/sunscreen so I need to cross check the purchase list to remove any products with this ingredient. None of us wants our new exciting product to result in a breakout :)\n\n* I'm very lucky to visit during Chuseok so there are quite a lot on sale. At least all the websites said so. Hwahae also has a weekly post on current sales so I visited all the brands mentioned in this post to see if any products are good value to bring back.\n\n* The lesson I learned very quickly is that sale in store is different from sale on the website. The only brand whose sale is consistent with the website is Innisfree. \n\n* Not only that, sale in different stores is different from each other as well. I usually find that stores elsewhere have better sale than ones in Myeongdong. My theory is because they know tourist will buy the product anyways sometimes regardless if the product is on sale or not, but who knows. That's why don't feel disheartened when you visit the stores in Myeongdong and you feel like you are going to exceed your budget because none of the products you want is 50% instore. Just walk out and go to different area like Hongdae, Gangnam or Ehwa uni, etc\n\n* Samples: this is not something that I will fret over but it's what makes the shopping experience in Korea complete. Just like a previous post mentioned here, the big Innisfree stores in Myeongdong are very skimpy with sample, regardless how much you spend. I bought 20 masks, a Green tea balancing gift set and a no sebum powder and I didn't get any sample at all. Meanwhile, at the same spend level, A’pieu (Myeongdong) gave me a box of cotton pad and 3 more cleansing samples. Too Cool for School at Gangnam underground shopping centre give me like 7 different samples for a purchase of a single  sunscreen.\n\n* Language: do all your research about your purchase because none of the stores I went to in Myeongdong can answer any of my questions about sales, product and what not. I feel like they’re better in Chinese than English.\n\n**Tax refund:** \n\nSince Jan 2016, Korea has introduced Immediate Tax Refund which makes things so much easier. The store needs to have a logo of any of the 6 Tax Refund companies. Make sure to bring your passport with you and provide it at the counter when you make a purchase of minimum 30000 KRW. If you shop at Lotte Duty Free stores downtown, make sure to exclude these tax free items from your total. At the counter, the cashier will apply Tax Refund before swiping your credit card. The tax refund amount will not be 10% but it is in tier. For ex: if you spend between 30000 - 40000 KRW, you will have 2000 tax refund deducted from your total. You can do some quick google on this. And that’s it, you don’t need to get any stamps at the airport either. \n\n\n**Non beauty related takeaways:**\n\n* Transportation: A’REX airport train to downtown is so much cheaper than the bus. The bus to Myeongdong or Gangnam is about 15000 - 16000 KRW. The train ticket is on discount at 8000KRW (but it’s been on discount for about 2 years now). I don’t know when this discount will end. If you fly with Korean Air, Singapore Air, China Southern or Cathay Pacific, you can get another 1100KRW discount which makes the train ticket 6900KRW. This ticket will include the fare from airport to Seoul station plus a free transfer to subway line 1 and 4 (Myeongdong station is on line 4 by the way)\n\n* Keep the receipt of this train ticket purchase and present it when buying the train ticket to go back to the airport within 15 days and you will have the same discount 1100KRW to make the train ticket 6900KRW.\n\n* Currency exchange: exchange rate downtown is much better than at the airport because it’s very competitive. Technically, you don’t have to exchange at the airport because you can purchase your train ticket with credit card. Just get to the hotel first and you can exchange after check in.\n\n* Clothes shopping in Gangnam Shopping Centre (or Bus Terminal Underground) is awesome. 5000-10000KRW for a dress, shirt or skirt is everywhere. A cheap hat is hard though. I was looking for a bucket hat and they are all over 17000KRW for a hat, why? I find it’s kinda hard to bargain though. I did try to bargain in Korean but failed :”)\n\n\nIf you haven’t seen my haul from the Friday random chat, here it is: [https://imgur.com/58xmC81](https://imgur.com/58xmC81) \n\nThis is all I can remember for now but any questions, fire away :)\n",

        "body": "Very helpful! To add...\n\nI was in Seoul in June on a 7 hour layover, so I took the train into the city and went to Myeongdong for some shopping. It’s nuts in the side streets, it’s like one big Asian beauty carnival and there are multiple stores for every brand on the same block. And there are hundreds of tourists roaming around. \n\nThe hardcore shoppers all had small roller bags that they were filling up, which I didn’t understand until I bought stuff at an innisfree and got the smallest bag ever. I’ve had bigger sandwich bags than the tiny sack the girl handed me.  I finally bought a small suitcase too (for like $20) because there were no larger bags to be had. \n\nI’m American, and very clearly not Asian, so a lot of the street touts (teenagers handing out samples) were a little unsure about me. If I made eye contact and held out my hand a little bit, they gave me extra samples to shove in my minuscule shopping bag.\n\nI had an easier time in stores where the clerks spoke English (or were willing to practice on me). The A’pieu staff was particularly helpful, the Holika Holika girls actually backed away when I walked in. \n\nThe Myeongdong Olive Young is worth a visit; I’m not hugely into masks but they had racks and racks of them, plus skincare brands I hadn’t seen anywhere else. They also had a gigantic wall of feminine products. \n\nI was looking for a light BB cream but had no luck; all I could find was 21 or 23. (I ended up getting a La Neige BB in 11C when I got home.) I didn’t realize how few shades there are, but when I started paying attention I noticed that a lot of Korean women were wearing foundation that was obviously wrong for their skin tone.\n\nIf you’re already in Myeongdong, Lotte department store is a few blocks away and has even more shopping plus an excellent food court. \n\nBasically Seoul is awesome and everybody should go if they get a chance.",

It’s incredibly lightweight and doesn’t live shiny finish, it’s semi-matte. It has a light creamy gel texture. It is very easy to reapply. It contains fragrance, but it’s very subtle and goes away quickly. It never makes me look like a greasy mess, there i salso no pilling under makeup! Most importantly, it never irritates my skin. There was no irritation, I noticed that it actually calms down the redness and helps with healing my acne scars.\n\nI can confidently say that it quickly become my HG sunscreen!",

    "body": "**1) Minimalist UV Protection Invisible Sunscreen SPF 40+++**\n\n**Price:** Rs. 499 for 50gm. I got it for free from Myntra App along with their Vitamin C Serum.\n\n**Ingredients:** Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Octocrylene, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Diisopropyl Adipate, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Isododecane, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Silica, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Squalane, Solanum Lycopersicum (Tomato) Fruit Extract, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Microcrystalline Wax, Tocopheryl Acetate, Silica Silylate, Quaternium-90 Sepiolite, Quaternium-90 Montmorillonite, BHT\n\n**Packaging:** Tube \n\n**Texture:** White P\nOpaque Gel\n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\n**My Experience:** I didn't use this regularly, it was mostly kept in my office bag for applying during evenings while leaving work. \n\nAs the name suggests, there was never an issue of white cast due to its texture and colour. With invisible sunscreen, you gotta know till when you to massage the sunscreen. I feel with other sunscreens, you've an idea on how long to blend or massage. With invisible sunscreen, if not applied properly, it starts pilling off.\n\nThe texture was matte, so probably it felt on my face for a while post application. My biggest issue with this was that it irritated my eyes if I accidentally brushed over anywhere near my eye area (I didn't directly touch my eyes). And seeing as it happened multiple times, I think i was turned off this product, wanting to never purchase it.\n\nWhich won't be an issue coz I don't see this product anywhere. It's probably discontinued.\n\n**(2)Cosiq Airgel Nmf-15% Moisturiser For Oily Skin**\n\n**Price:** Rs. 599/- for 100 ml\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Aloe Vera Leaf Extract, Bacillus/Carrot Root Ferment Filtrate, Glycerine, Sorbitol, Propanediol, Hyaluronic Acid, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Sodium Lactate, Sodium Gluconate, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Betaine, Sodium Carbomer, Allantoin, Betaine, Sodium PCA, Sodium Lactate, Pca, Serine, Alanine, Glycine, Glutamic Acid, Lysine Hcl, Threonine, Arginine, Proline, Water, Saccharide Isomerate, Sodium PCA, Vitamin E, Sodium Gluconate, Menthyl Lactate, Menthol\n\n**Packaging:** Airpump in a Tube\n\n**Texture:** Lightweight Airy gel.\n\n**My Experience:** I was influenced to buy this from this Oily Moisturizer guide of one of the IG influencers. \n\nPros - Very affordable and comes in good quantity. It's a steal for its price. Very lightweight, blends easily , gives a matte finish but doesn't feel that it's sitting on your skin (like many matte products). \n\nIf your skin type is combination leaning to dry side, this won't be sufficient for you. As it states, it's great for oily skin as it feels nothing when you apply, and works wonderfully for Summers. \n\nCons: Tbh, None. It's not as great as some other moisturizers that I've used, but for the price, it's a great product.\n\nI might repurchase it again unless I get some k-beauty products on good discount.\n\n**3)Vaseline Gluta Hya Antioxidant SPF 50 PA+++ Sunscreen**\n\n**Price:** 699/- for 175ml\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Disodium Phenyl Dibenzimidazole Tetrasulfonate, Triethanolamine, Dimethicone, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Hydroxide, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Cystine, Glycine, Sodium PCA, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glutathione, Cyclopentasiloxane, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Polysorbate 20, Perfume, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Cyclomethicone, Petrolatum, BHT, Tocopherol\n\n**Texture:** Serum like lotion\n\n**Fragrance:** Yes\n\n**My Experience:** It's a wonderful sunscreen at a very decent price. \n\nPros are that it's  very lightweight, has a serum like texture that blends in seconds. It's claim of serum bursting into water and absorbing quickly, is true. It always gives a very dewy and shiny finish.\n\nCons - Very sticky, though it does feels normal after a few minutes. \nIt doesn't prevent tanning. My hands are quite tanned, and since its texture is like a serum, I did use quite a lot of product while applying it on my hands. There was no pilling, but no saving from tan.\n\nI would repurchase it for other seasons like winters or monsoons. For now, I've purchased Nivea sunscreen again, my HG for body sunscreen.\n\nDo share your experiences if you've tried these or similar products.\n\n",

    "body": "What are your thoughts on brands who through the years alter their ingredients into a product that no longer resembles their original.\n\nWhen Bare Minerals came out, they touted themselves as a healthy makeup, no toxins, “so healthy you can sleep in it” and all that stuff.\nAll their products were just minerals and no fillers. Powder products only. I didn’t like them - but I respected their vision.\n\nThey sold to Shisedo and then they came out with Bare Skin. A liquid foundation that was fitting in with their theme.\n\nBare Skin Ingredients \nActive Ingredients: Titanium dioxide 11.0%. Inactive Ingredients: Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Coconut Alkanes, Silica, Stearalkonium Hectorite, Lecithin, Glycerin, Maltodextrin, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Jojoba Esters, Propylene Carbonate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Soil Minerals/Syringa Vulgaris (Lilac) Leaf Cell Culture Extract, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol. May Contain: Mica, Iron Oxides, Titanium Dioxide.\n\nThen they released Complexion Protection, another liquid\n\nComplexion Protection Ingredients \n\nACTIVE INGREDIENTS: Titanium dioxide 6.2%\nINACTIVE INGREDIENTS: water, coconut alkanes, propanediol, squalane,\ntrehalose, isostearic acid, glycerin, silica, agar, caprylic/capric\ntriglyceride, globularia cordifolia callus culture extract, salicornia\nherbacea extract, melilotus officinalis extract, coco-caprylate/caprate,\nbutylene glycol, lauroyl lysine, sodium hyaluronate, succinoglycan,\npolysorbate 60, cellulose gum, polyglyceryl-4 laurate/succinate,\nsorbitan sesquiisostearate, magnesium stearate, magnesium hydroxide,\nmagnesium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, potassium\nsorbate, phenoxyethanol. may contain: titanium dioxide, iron oxides.\n\nTHEN most recently they released Bare Pro -sigh-\nWater, Cyclopentasiloxane , Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Butylene Glycol, Silica, Peg-10 Dimethicone, Bis-Butyldimethicone Polyglyceryl-3, Bambusa Arundinacea Stem Extract, Sodium Glutamate, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Sorbitan Sesquiisostearate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Methicone, Papain, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Algin, Tocopherol, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Phenoxyethanol. May Contain: Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxides.\n\nNot terrible, but I feel like this is totally the opposite of what Leslie intended for her brand.\n\nWhat prompted this entire thing, was they just released a new Blush called Gen Nude and it felt soooo different from Bare. I turn it over and look at the ingredients. I was shocked!  All of us in the store working were so surprised to see Bare release this.\n\nMy ingredient lists go from their original blush - 4 ingredients. To the Ready Blush which is still pretty good and then we go to Gen Nude!\n\nLoose Blush Ingredients \n\nBismuth Oxychloride (CI 77163), Mica (CI 77019), Carmine (CI 75470),\nIron Oxide (CI 77491)\n\nReady Blush Ingredients \n\nMica, Lauroyl Lysine, Boron Nitride, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate,\nCaprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Corallina Officinalis Extract,\nOctyldodecyl Stearoyl Stearate, Alaria Esculenta Extract, Tocopherol,\nCamellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Calcium\nKetogluconate, Silica, Carmine (Ci 75470). May Contain: Titanium Dioxide\n(Ci 77891), Iron Oxides (Ci 77491, 77492, 77499), Manganese Violet (Ci\n77742).\n\nGen Nude Blush Ingredients \n\nSynthetic Fluorphlogopite, Diisostearyl Malate, Dipentaerythrityl Hexahydroxystearate, Lauroyl Lysine, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Triethylhexanoin, Sorbitan Sesquiisostearate, Hydrogen Dimethicone, Dimethicone, Tocopherol, Barium Sulfate, Silica, Alumina, Tin Oxide, Chlorphenesin. May Contain (+/-): Mica, Carmine (Ci 75470), Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891), Iron Oxides (Ci 77491, Ci 77492, Ci 77499), Red 7 Lake (Ci 15850).\n\n4 Dimethicones/Polymers\n\nThey started on QVC saying they would never use synthetic ingredients - and here we are.\n\nI will say the blush looks beautiful on the skin and could compete with any blush out there. So I can understand why they made these changes. However, they haven’t adjusted their marketing and image for these new changes.  They have clientele who have been using Bare since the first day and who refuse to use anything else because Bare is the only thing that won’t bother their skin/is natural/is safe....etc. \n\nThis isn’t a post about Bare, but I am using them as a example as the blush really threw me for a loop. \n\nHow do you feel about brands who not only evolve (as all brands must) but also change what appear to be their core values to remain relevant?",

Even that felt like a sell-out to me...and to see how far they've come now is a whole different level of disappointment. I loved that they had a focus and \"priorities,\" and now that they've done a 180 on those I feel like they've really sold out. Personally I refuse to buy anything other than the loose powder products from them on principle (lol...maybe that belongs on the \"petty\" thread but I don't care).\n\nHonestly I can't think of another brand that had such strong guiding principles to begin with and then tossed them all to the side in pursuit of profit. I don't have a problem with brands changing their focus somewhat (like how UD used to be more alternative makeup and now they're very mainstream), but when your focus is based on \"principle\" and you abandon it completely I really lose respect for you as a brand.",

I've been in my own acne battle for a long, lonnnng time, and a big part of it has been figuring out which ingredients trigger breakouts for me -- even if the product's name or label *claims* it's great for oily or acne-prone skin. The worst offenders for me are cyclomethicones (cyclopentasiloxane, hexasiloxane, etc), polysilicones, actually most silicone derivatives except dimethicones, and stearic/myristic/palmitic acids. Whether in foundation, primer, treatment, or cleanser, these are pretty much guaranteed to give me a cystic breakout -- and they're in SO MUCH STUFF. :(\n\nThis makes finding a new foundation *really* challenging. So, I went through literally every foundation available on Sephora and Ulta, and plunked 'em all down in a spreadsheet with the full ingredients list for everything. The spreadsheet also includes brand, product name, price, number of shades, and a quick-reference \":(\" column with a \"YES\" if it contains ingredients I know or suspect to be problematic for me; problem ingredients are bolded in the list. \n\nANYWAY. If you have the same sensitivities, would like to search the ingredients for 213 foundations all in one place, or would otherwise find this helpful, the public GoogleDoc sheet is [right here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qRrsJmwPvG6-btIdF9jhP4566JzDVVp8Lw6h4OGD9mo/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n**NOTE :** this is only cream/liquid foundations -- I didn't include anything that's primarily a BB/CC cream, tinted moisturizer, or \"treatment.\" I also ditched anything I knew or suspected was discontinued.",

This was my first sunscreen I bought after leaning about photoaging! My first baby! And we were off to a good start. It’s a white watery gel-like texture, light weight, invisible, but quite shiny (some might call this a dewy finish, but I prefer a skin-like finish). A good poster child for the typical Asian sunscreen, I guess. It is not water resistant, and you'll notice this as you sweat throughout the day: It’s like your sweat becomes heavier since it mixes with the sunscreen (you can’t see this of course, but it sure feels like it). I was also worried about touching my face throughout the day, because I felt I might rub the sunscreen off. I can’t remember it ever stinging my eyes, but I’m not entirely sure. The biggest drawback for me was the prize and how inaccessible it is in my country. At this point in time, I also hadn’t learnt about the proper amount of sunscreen you have to use, so I was probably underapplying, and the sunscreen can therefore have appeared lighter-textured in my memory. It contains a lot of fragrance and many ingredients, in general, so that could be irritating. A little bit of science: If you look at the UV filters, there are several UVB filters; many UVB (290-320 wavelength/nm) filters also “bleed into” and filter some UVA II (320-340) as well. The Uvinul A plus filters both UVA II and I (340-400), but it’s also the only UVA filter in this sunscreen, and it’s also the last ranking UV filter on the ingredient list, even though I’ve read that the upper limit for Uvinul A plus is 10% (of the total product). So, is there enough UVA protection? I don’t know, but it’s probably okay since the Pa is four pluses, so I wouldn’t worry too much about it. Packaging is nice and it has a pump, and you get 75 ml, not only the standard 50 ml.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Avène Hydrance OPTIMALE UV RICHE Rich hydrating cream**\n\n* \\- **SPF 20, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **40 ml/1.35 Fl.OZ**\n* \\- **Probably suitable for darker skin tones**\n* \\- **France**\n* \\- **Ingredients:** AVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA).

It does not have high enough UV protection, and it is not designed to be used as a sunscreen, and therefore you will end up underapplying. I bought it because I was looking for a day cream at the time. I wanted something for my dry skin and this day cream worked in that regard. But never did I ever apply close to the amount of sunscreen you have to apply to get the labelled SPF and UVA protection. It is on the heavier side, so applying a quarter teaspoon to your face would not feel nice. Trust me. And even then, you’d only get SPF 20. I would not recommend anyone to use this product as a daily SPF product. It also contains fragrance even though it says it’s suitable for sensitive skin.\n* \\- **Score:** 2/5\n\n**NIVEA SUN UV FACE ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS SPF 30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

I must have gone though three of these. It has a lot in common with the MAKE P:REM one, and it also shares some of the same problems. It has a similar texture: white watery-gel, which turns translucent on top of the skin. It’s like a glycerine-rich moisturiser. I think it’s less shiny as well – more skin-like finish. The problem arises when you sweat: your sweat starts feeling even heavier than normal. I think I experienced some eye stinging with this sunscreen (nothing major), largely caused by it not being water resistant. It’s important to note that the reason it is so cosmetically elegant is also why it’s not water resistant. I was also scared to touch my face and accidently rub it off while wearing this one, too. It’s smells like sunscreen. If you’ve ever purchased a NIVEA sunscreen, you’ll know what I mean. And the fragrance doesn’t go away immediately either. My biggest problem at the time, was also that I wanted to find a SPF 50 sunscreen, and this one is only SPF 30. I think I’ve recently seen a SPF 50 version of this since, so if you live in Europe, I guess it’s worth giving it a shot. Looking at the ingredient list now, I see that it contains a lot of avobenzone. Avobenzone has a bad rep, but you cannot deny how effectively it protects against UVA when photostable. Avobenzone on its own is not photostable and will start degrading (and be used up) when exposed to the sun or UV light. In this sunscreen, however, (and most non-American sunscreens) it has been stabilised by another UV filter: In this case by Tinosorb S. I think this sunscreen might have much higher UVA protection than the EU requirement, which makes sense since it’s advertised as “ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS”.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Piz Buin Ultra Light Dry Touch Face Fluid SPF 30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Sweat and water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

This sunscreen survived me walking all around Madrid for a week in the middle of summer. Boom. What a trooper. The texture is a thick liquid, not a cream, so the opening is narrow so you can pour some into your hand or tilt your head backwards and pour it directly on your face. It dries to an almost powdery finish – it truly is dry touch. If you have dry skin, you should probably moisturise beforehand. It was also easy enough to reapply when I was out and about in Madrid; So, layering it wasn’t a chore. If you don’t apply it evenly it might dry down with some flakes even – that’s how dry it is. But I didn’t feel like it dried out my skin in the process, but that is of course a very personal observation. I would have been perfect if it was SPF 50, a little less expensive, and fragrance free. If you’ve ever tried a Piz Buin sunscreen, you’ll recognise their trademark fragrance at once: masculine and sunscreen-like. It does bring back good memories of summer and beaches for me personally, though.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**THE BODY SHOP Vitamin E Day Lotion SPF30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

I could barely open them in broad daylight, and I had to go back home and wash my face to get it off. Do not, under any circumstances apply this close to your eyes.

I have very pale skin (and am therefore really scared of “universal tints”), but it blended perfectly into my skin tone, perhaps with the slightest bit of coverage. Since it’s a mineral sunscreen, I’m sceptical if it’ll blend into darker skin, even with the tint, so that’s something to keep in mind. It might also have photo flashback, you have been warned. Even though it is silicone based, I wouldn’t describe it as “silicone-y”, if you know what I mean; it has a skin like finish. However, I don’t think I ever applied enough of it to truly know what its finish is like… First and foremost: the packaging. When I bought it, they still used a dropper – I repeat a dropper. This did not work, as the product would spill over, clump up at the inner edges of the bottle’s mouth, etc. And since it clumped up at the sides, I honestly don’t know if I’ve lost some of the UV protection of the product, since it’s no longer a completely homogenous liquid. They later changed the dropper to a pump, but it’s still embarrassing that they ever sold it with a dropper. What were they thinking? You also spend quite a bit of time applying it evenly on your skin, due to its consistency and tint. You kind of have to apply it like a foundation. Since it’s only 30 ml, it means that you should be finishing one of these in less than a month – and only if you’re just applying it to your face. At least it doesn’t have any fragrance! It does have an iffy smell to it, which goes away. Taking into consideration the cost, the packaging (even though it has improved) the fact that it’s not a SPF 50, PA++++ product, you’re left with a very mediocre sunscreen. It could however serve as a daily serum on top of your sunscreen, if you’re very extra.\n* \\- **Score:** 3/5\n\n**Altruist Dermatologist Sunscreen SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I had really high expectations for Altruist, same as many others, and I was let down. It isn’t that bad of a sunscreen, but it’s also not that good. At this point in my quest for the Holy grail sunscreen, I realised I had to up my UV game. SPF 30 wasn’t enough, and I wanted as high of an UVA protection as possible. With the EU’s regulation of UVA protection (in a nutshell the UVA protection has to be 1/3 of the SPF), you could, in theory, end up with SPF 30 sunscreens that had higher UVA protection than your SPF 50 sunscreen. And as a consumer, you simply wouldn’t know the difference. Anyway, Altruist SPF 50, has perfect UV protection, and no fragrance and such. In theory it’s the perfect sunscreen. I mean, look at all those filters (seriously why are there so many, did the chemists make a bet or something?) But in practice? Not so much. First and foremost, if you have darker skin, this might leave a white cast due to the titanium dioxide. Some people have mentioned this in their reviews and some people have also mentioned it stinging their eyes (I can’t remember noticing this). Secondly, the reason I didn’t like it, is because of the texture. It’s the same sort of texture as the MAKE P:REM and NIVEA mentioned above, just less cosmetically elegant. I thought it would dry down or sink into my face, but it never did. I would wait for 20 minutes, and I would still be sticky and a little bit shiny. What worked was putting a lot of translucent powder on top, then I would finally achieve a more skin like finish. Pro tip: Translucent powder can actually make most sunscreens bearable. Since it didn’t dry down, I felt as I would rub it off if my face touched anything. Maybe this sunscreen would work for people with dry skin? Since applying this sunscreen, waiting, applying powder, would take such a long time, I ended up just using a different sunscreen. And I guess that says it all. It also has a “chemical” smell to it, but that didn’t bother me. It might not have worked for my face, but it’s still a good sunscreen for the rest of the body.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Skinnies Sungel SPF30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, broad spectrum, PA++++ (PPD 16+)**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

This sunscreen utilises a new technology called Organogel™. It contains no water, and thus it doesn’t have to dry down, and you only need 1/5 the amount of a normal sunscreen. You heard that right: 1/5! So, you only need a pea-sized amount for your entire face! But I used a little bit more than that, because real peas are actually very small, so when people say pea-sized, they usually mean 2-3 real peas. A photo from their website illustrating what they meant by pea-sized confirmed my suspicion. But it’s still a very small amount! The texture is that of a see-through slightly orange-y gel. It’s oily, but it doesn’t move on your skin (also when you sweat). And it’s completely see-though so I can with confidence say it’ll suit every skin tone. It doesn’t completely dry down, though, but it does seem to sink into your skin a little bit, if you wait a couple of minutes. You can feel the gel on your skin when you touch it, but you wouldn’t notice you had anything on otherwise. Since it isn’t water based it also feels sturdier than the others I’ve tried, so I wasn’t as scared of it rubbing off when touching my skin. I think it might work very well as a primer. It has a slight “chemical” smell, it also doesn’t contain any perfume or any nonsense like that. It’s on the pricier side, but one 100ml bottle is actually the equivalent of 500ml of normal sunscreen, when you think about it, so I think the prize is justifiable. This was the sunscreen I kept on using when the Altruist one wasn’t working for me, by the way. It’s definitely the quickest sunscreen to apply of all the sunscreens I’ve ever used. A con is that is a little bit difficult to gauge if you are using enough, and that you’ve applied it evenly. Turns out there are two versions of this sunscreen: An American one and a New Zealand one. I somehow ended up with the American one, and it has worked just fine for me. The NZ version uses non-FDA approved filters, but it still has the same UVB and UVA protection listed, but I would still recommend you buy the NZ version, since there must be a reason why they chose to not just use the same formulation as the American one, right? Since I bought my bottle, they have also released many new products, like an SPF 50+. If the SPF 50+ behaves the same way as this one, I think I might have given it a score of 5/5. But keep in mind that it does not have a dry-touch finish (more of an immovable oily finish), but at least it has a sturdy one.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**The Balm BALMSHELTER TINTED MOISTURIZER (Shade: Lighter Than Light)**\n\n* \\- **SPF 18, broad spectrum**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **64 ml/ 2.15 Fl.

It’s really is a pale shade (it appears darker before you spread it over your skin), and it blends perfectly into my skin: I’ve never seen a tinted moisturiser or BB cream this fair before. However, it is so sheer, that the tint almost doesn’t matter. A little goes a long way, and that’s why you shouldn’t really use BB creams, tinted moisturisers and foundation as UV shields. I intended on using this on top of my sunscreen, but since it has next to none coverage, I never find myself reaching for it. If you’re pale as I am, and you want to experience the novelty of owning a tinted moisturiser, this is a good pick.

These versions are not always equal, both in UV protection and cosmetic elegance. It also turns out that I have bought two versions of this sunscreen: A new and an older version. I actually bought the newest version first – and I loved it. I couldn’t understand how people hated it (the skincare community is very split when it comes to the Shaka fluid). Of course, everyone’s skin is difference and can have a lot to say on how a sunscreen feels and behaves on the skin. It’s a fluid, so you have to shake it thoroughly. It takes a little bit longer to apply, since it’s a fluid. It dries down matte, and you can’t see that you’re wearing anything. Easy peasy. Its biggest downfall is the prize (I bought it on sale) and that it only comes in a tiny 50ml, so you can’t buy it in bulk, so to speak. But this was the newest version (as of this year)… and then I ended up accidently buying the older version online (which might still be in production?), and oh boy, was that a different experience! Not dry-touch, but oily! They looked so similar, but I instantly felt the difference on my face, because it didn’t dry down. Absolutely horrible in comparison, I felt so gross. You can tell the new version from the old from the packaging: The newest version has “ANTI-OXYDANT” written underneath the “UVB + UVA” text. It has a similar texture as the Piz Buin mentioned above, but I personally think the Piz Buin is superior in texture: even more dry-touch. But the shaka outshines almost all sunscreens in terms of UVB and UVA protection, and it doesn’t have any irritating fragrance to boot. I thought this would be my final HG sunscreen, because it couldn’t get any better in terms of UV protection and cosmetic elegance.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5 (new “ANTI-OXYDANT” version, 2019) (old version: 4/5, because it still has great UV protection, okay?)\n\n**EVY TECHNOLOGY SUNSCREEN MOUSSE SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl. OZ**\n* \\- **Probably suitable for darker skin tones**\n* \\- **Sweden**\n* \\- **Ingredients:** Aqua. Butane. Octocrylene. Propylene glycol. Palmitic acid. Diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate. Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane. VP / Hexadecene copolymer. Stearic acid. Isobutane. Bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine. PVP. Ethylhexyl Triazone. Polysorbate 20. Triethanolamine. Hydrolyzed silk. Hydrolyzed Collagen. Tocopheryl acetate. Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate Glycerin. Dimethicone. Propane.\n* \\- **UV filters (organic):** Octocrylene (UVB, short wave UVA), Uvinul A Plus (UVA), Avobenzone (UVA), Tinosorb S (UVB and UVA), Uvinul T 150 (UVB)\n* \\- **Pros:** Excellent UV protection, 5 Boots stars, very water resistant, hydrating texture, antioxidants\n* \\- **Cons:** Difficult to measure amount of sunscreen, some stickiness when overapplied\n* \\- **Review:** This is my Holy grail sunscreen. I found it. Perfect texture, high UV protection, and relatively affordable. It also comes in a 100 ml bottle, not a 50 ml, which I appreciate. According to EVY, their sunscreens work differently than other sunscreens, because they don’t lay on top of your skin and form a film, but instead they sink into the skin (stratum corneum, I presume). Because of this, they’re very water resistant and sturdy. You shake the bottle, turn it upside down, and squeeze out a golf ball-sized blob of mousse. (This mousse holds its shape pretty well and you can play with it.) Then I just rub the mousse into my face: first it turns into a light-weight white cream… and then it disappears into the skin. After a couple of minutes, there is no trace of it, but if I’ve applied to much there might be some stickiness. It certainly feels like it sinks into the skin, because it’s very hydrating. The other sunscreens I’ve liked, I’ve liked for their dry-touch finish, but with EVY I don’t need to worry about it, because I can’t feel it on my face when I touch (well, technically my face feels like it’s been hydrated) and it doesn’t do anything when I sweat. A Youtuber reviewed EVY and said that the Boots star system is only marketing – it’s not. While we have a universal measurement of UVB: SPF, we’ve later realised that UVA also causes skin damage and cancer, but we still haven’t been able to agree on one universal measurement or requirement. The Boots Star Rating system with a maximum of 5 stars requires much higher UVA protection than the European Recommendation, where the UVA protection only needs to be 1/3 of the SPF. Gothamista, however, really liked EVY. It has no fragrance, but a light aerosol smell that goes away. Because of the packaging, no preservatives are needed. It also contains some antioxidants. I’m already on my third bottle of EVY, and I will continue to purchase it in the future.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5\n\nSome sunscreens I’ve heard good things about and might want to try one day: Anessa sunscreens, Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF 50 PA ++++, Ultrasun sunscreens, Bioderma Photoderm Max Cream SPF50+.",

You note the dry-touch finish - which is great - but does it leave any or much shine?\n\nIt's worth noting that the Face SPF30 version has a 5 star (Boots?) UVA rating so the PPA / PPD factor should be around 27.. which is higher than most SPF50s, I'm sure!

    "body": "Everyone’s talking about the skincare items for May’s Glam Bag X they all look very nice and high end.  Since I have nothing better to do I thought I would do some analyzing of the skincare items, will they actually do anything for your skin? Let’s have a look.  So far I think the ones we’ve all seen are: Herbivore Prism Mask, Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream, Rodial Pink Diamond Cleansing Balm, The Route Party Peel, Kopari CBD Balm.  There may be more skincare items but these are the ones that are confirmed. \n\nThe three most coveted items are easy to see, Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream, Herbivore’s Prism Mask and Rodial Cleansing Balm so I’ll focus my analysis on these 3 items since I happen to own all of them as well. \n\n- Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream RV $100\n\nHas the highest RV and I’m guessing most people are aiming for this, the packaging is gorgeous from the way you unbox the cream to the jar itself, makes a great gift.  Now onto the ingredients:\n\nWater, Homosalate (sunscreen filter), Glyceryl Stearate SE, Ethylhexyl Salicylate (sunscreen filter), Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane (Avobenzone, the only FDA approved sunscreen filter that has sufficient UVA protection, however it’s not stable hence why sunscreens has to be reapplied), Octocrylene (sunscreen filter) Cetyl Alcohol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Steareth-21, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Carbomer, Dimethiconol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Hydrolyzed Viola Tricolor Extract, Allantoin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Disodium Edta, Tocopheryl Acetate, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Sodium Hydroxide, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Michelia Alba Leaf Oil, Sodium Lactate, Coco-Glucoside, PEG-8, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Plumeria Rubra Flower Extract, Ascorbic Acid, Citric Acid, Nicotiana Sylvestris Leaf Cell Culture, Linalool, Citronellol, Geraniol.\n\nI know the label doesn’t mention this but this moisturizer actually has SPF15 and other UVA filters, most of the top ingredients are all sunscreen filters/stabilizers.  The sunscreen filters that are in the moisturizer are mostly weak ones or are in low concentration like Avobenzone, so this wouldn’t be my sunscreen pick for going out in the sun.  \n\nThen there are the usual occlusive ingredients like silicones and other ingredients which will give the skin a silky smooth finish, of course having Shea Butter gives it a more thicker texture, most of the ingredients that can’t be pronounced are common preservatives/emulsifiers (ingredients that help water and oil mix properly so they don’t separate)/ingredients that help stabilize the formula, most of these ingredients are in normal moisturizers, you won’t find some of them in most “clean beauty” products, however there’s nothing unsafe/toxic about these ingredients which have been in cosmetics for a long time.  \n\nIn terms of beneficial ingredients for the skin, it’s got the common humectants like glycerin, dimethicone, butylene glycol, hyaluronic acid, aloe vera, that attract and hold onto moisture.  Besides the oat kernel extract and Shea butter most of the other ingredients like rose hip oil, cameilla seed oil, sunflower seed oil, etc aren’t in high enough concentrations for the skin to derive any nutrients from them but they accomplish the task of softening the skin.  The BioNymph peptide that’s talked about the description of the cream is “Nicotiana Sylvestris Leaf Cell Culture”, fairly new ingredient it’s a natural peptide, can’t find any studies on it besides the ones coming from the manufacturer.  Obviously those studies show it’s magic protects the skin against anything oh and it also diminishes wrinkles in 2 weeks....sure.  \n\nFinal thoughts on the product: I bought it because of the hype and nice packaging, it does accomplish what a moisturizer is suppose to do, trap and prevent the loss of moisture, most people expect too much from their moisturizers IMO and that’s why companies are creating ridiculous ingredients like bioNymph peptide in order to look special.  I think this moisturizer was originally suppose to be a makeup primer with higher SPF protection but they couldn’t stabilize the Avobenzone, cos it’s a very tricky sunscreen filter and also the ingredients at the top all seem to be suggest this would be a more lightweight product in terms of texture.  The last part of the cream with all the thickening and beneficial ingredients for skin almost came as an after thought.  It’s fairly scented, the last 3 ingredients are all fragrance, but I don’t mind scented products and enjoy the way this smells.  It’s not as heavy as most of my other moisturizers since I have dry skin and like super thick creams. Most people will likely use this at night but I wonder if it’s okay to sleep with sunscreen filters....\n\n- Herbivore Prism Mask RV $58\n\nIngredients list: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit/Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract, Salix Nigra (Willow) Bark Extract, leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Populus Tremuloides Bark Extract, Gluconolactone, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Sodium Phytate.\n\nMy analysis copied from a reply:\n\n“I have the Herbivore Prism Mask and Serum I bought both when I was still a newbie when it came to skincare ingredients/formulation.  Now that I’ve had to learn more about skincare cos of the constant crap we receive in beauty boxes, I would not recommend the Prism Mask. It uses “natural AHAs” we’ve all seen it before in other products like sugar cane extract, sugar maple extract (maple syrup, very Canadian), lemon extract etc. MANY of these “clean beauty brands” will treat these fruit extracts the same as glycolic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, etc. However they’re completely DIFFERENT!\n\nYes most AHAs are derived from fruit extracts like glycolic acid comes from sugar cane, tartaric and malic comes from maple syrup extract etc, however these acids has to be derived in a lab first, on it’s own these extracts has no PROVEN exfoliation abilities.  Maybe there’s a tiny bit of exfoliating action but because AHAs acids needs to be at the right pH level to work anywhere from pH of 2 to just under 4, from looking at the ingredients of the Prism Mask it’s definitely passed that pH (just a guess, maybe I’ll test the pH later). The closer an AHA exfoliating product gets to the pH of 2, the more free acid value it has. As an example everyone’s favourite lactic acid treatment Sunday Riley GG has only 5% concentration of lactic acid and yet why is it so effective and be loved? It’s because the pH of GG is just around 2.5ish (I tested it with pH strips and got values between 2 and 3 so I’ll just avg it out), at that pH level it can access almost all 5% of the lactic acid in the formula. As another example a product like Saturday Skin’s 10% Glycolic Acid Toner at first looks very promising but when tested the the pH level was between 5-6, making the 10% claim useless since acids can’t do much exfoliating at those pH levels, and the toner can’t access the 10% of glycolic acid and use it properly, making the free acid value basically zero.  When it comes to exfoliating products the percentage of acids doesn’t mean much, it’s all about the pH level and free acid value, if you look at Skinceutical’s Glycolic Overnight Cream on the packaging it doesn’t say this cream contains 10% glycolic acid but rather the free acid value is 10% glycolic.  \n\nAs for the 5% BHA claim, again it uses willow bark extract cos it’s a “clean natural” ingredient, Willow Bark extract contains salicin which only becomes salicylic acid when it’s orally ingested cos of the enzymes in our stomachs, I’m assuming no one wants to eat this mask. Salicylic acid is derived from willow bark extract in labs using a complicated process, thus when applied topically willow bark extract is actually a very good ingredient for inflammation, it soothes the skin, helps with redness etc. It’s good for the skin just not for exfoliating. Lastly the law prohibits any OTC product from having more than 2% salicylic acid (BHA), so these brands get around this by putting 5% BHA on the label hoping people will think 5% willow bark extract is the same as 5% salicylic acid, obviously they’re two completely different ingredients. It’s actually a very good hydrating mask though.”\n\nAlso forget to mention this has zero preservatives not even the new ones that are supposedly so much safer and not toxic, I guess the antibacterial properties of leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate can assist in preserving the product however I’m not a big fan of mold and bacteria so if you do receive this please make sure to check the batch code and when it was manufactured \n\n- Rodial Pink Diamond Cleansing Balm RV $59\n\nIngredients list: Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, PEG-8 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Cetearyl Alcohol, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Germ Oil, Polysorbate 20, Glyceryl Dibehenate, Tribehenin, Glyceryl Behenate, Parfum (Fragrance), Tocopherol , Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Mica, Diamond Powder, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Geraniol, Limonene, Linalool, CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide), CI 75470 (Carmine)\n\nIt’s not really a balm texture, if you’re use to using those K beauty cleansing balms with the sherbet texture or the Farmacy one that will transform from balm/oil to milky emulsion this is different.  When it comes out of the tube it has a oil in gel texture, it removes all my makeup but I don’t wear heavy or waterproof makeup.  It’s heavily scented so maybe not the best for sensitive skin.  It washes off cleanly and comes with a muslin cloth, honestly there’s not too much to say about a cleanser.  I bought it cos I’m a sucker for pretty packaging, it’s nice that it’s in a tube so good for traveling/weekend trips, again the main draw back is the fragrance.\n\nTL:DR - they all make great gifts, as far as skincare benefits....meh.",

Someone in r/AsianBeauty mentioned that it's meant as the final step in an AB routine, meaning it is formulated to lock in multiple layers of hydration that you've put on earlier. So if you aren't doing the AB first treatment essence/hydrating toner/essence steps, you might not get the full benefit of it and despite me using an FTE and toner, I think that's definitely what I'm suffering from. I should also mention that I have normal/dry in winter skin, so I tend to need heavier moisture and occlusives.\n\nIf you have oily or combo skin, La Neige may provide the moisture you're looking for! If you're normal/dry, I'd recommend looking for something more intensive, because the La Neige mask might not meet your expectations, especially after using trentinoin.",

Reviewing some sunscreen/makeup removers today.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o825xixzx6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=686f4f5f086654b57e35cd8906675ccf223ed22a\n\n**My skin type:** Sensitive, very dry (Actives: tretinoin microsphere 0.04%, AHA/BHA peel)\n\n**I Wear:** Heavy-duty, waterproof sunscreen on the daily, on makeup days - heavy-duty waterproof makeup, especially waterproof eye makeup that is difficult to remove. I have hooded lids (full Korean).\n\n**Fragrance is not a deal-breaker for me in wash-off products, although I am wearier of essential oils than I am of synthetic fragrance. Will be bolding main fragrance ingredients.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kzfesai0y6251.jpg?width=425&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df6aa8bee3c981d106a4ee4e3d071a26002ea80a\n\n**Cost:** 8 oz - $24 (Ulta)\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Coco-Glucoside, Coconut Alcohol, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Glycerin, Carbomer, Isopropyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Citric Acid, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, **Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil,** Propylparaben, Triethanolamine, **Amyris Balsamifera (Amyris) Bark Oil, Bulnesia Sarmientoi Wood (Vera Wood) Oil, Cymbopogon Martini (Palmarosa) Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens (Sweet Scented Geranium) Flower Oil, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Oil, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil, Mimosa Tenuiflora Bark Extract, Ormenis Multicaulis (Wild Moroccon Chamomile) Oil, Piper Nigrum (Pepper) Fruit Oil, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Oil,** Fd&C Yellow No. 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n**Texture:** A pale yellow, milky, lightly foaming cleanser of medium thickness.\n\n**Efficacy:** Acceptable as a one-step travel cleanser. Pretty good at removing sunscreen and makeup if you take the time to massage it in. Felt like a godsend before being completely spoiled by AB first cleansers. That was when I thought a little bit of waterproof mascara being left over giving me slight raccoon eyes when I woke up in the morning was \"acceptable\" and \"as good as it's gonna get\".\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** No. Has gentle surfactants but **it also has TWELVE different essential oils.** One of which is endangered and need active conservation according to Wikipedia, which I personally don't feel comfortable using:\n\n>*Bulnesia sarmientoi* was listed as [endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species) in the 2018 publication of the [IUCN Red List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List), due to the [deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation) of [Gran Chaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Chaco#Conservation_issues) and a strong global demand for its wood, extracts, and [essential oils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil) since 2001.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulnesia_sarmientoi#cite_note-IUCN-1) IUCN estimates indicate that over three generations the global population will decline by around 50%.\n\nRequires much more massaging to remove waterproof makeup which may be harsh on sensitive skin and cause more redness.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy. Not too strong.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No, it's a 2-in-1. However, it does not always get rid of everything on the first try, so another cleanse may be necessary.\n\n**Repurchase?** No. It did not bother my sensitive skin too much, but I'm cutting out all essential oils from my skincare + not effective enough as a first cleanser.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Naive Botanical Olive Cleansing Oil 230mL / 7.8 oz\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ovky561y6251.png?width=207&format=png&auto=webp&s=fecf9195af66872bce90dabfe904de2a500678a5\n\nI found out about this [here, ranked #4](https://my-best.net/15468). I wanted something with the highest cleansing power that washed off cleanly & is affordable.\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $14 on eBay before pandemic started. A little less than $7 in Japan. Even at double the price for me in the US, I have had this since **July 2019** (June 2020 now) and I am only *halfway through* it because of how incredibly effective it is with small amounts. I would run out of other cleansing oils relatively fast because of how much it takes to remove all my layers of waterproof makeup. Am shocked tbh.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, ethylhexyl palmitate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, glyceryl tri (caprylic acid / capric acid), PEG-8 glyceryl isostearate, sorbeth tetraisostearate-30, olive leaf extract, olive fruit oil, squalane, BG Water, cyclohexane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid bisethoxy diglycol, **perfume.**\n\n**Texture:** A cleansing oil of medium thickness, not overly greasy. Smooth, spreads very easily. Not super thin like something like Kose Softymo Speedy.\n\n**Efficacy:** Not drying at all on my very dry skin. SUPER effective at removing waterproof sunscreen and makeup. Takes absolutely NO TIME AT ALL, which is very different from other cleansing oils that required me to massage it in for a while. Color me beyond impressed. This is honestly the best first cleanser I've used so far. ZERO residue of any trace of makeup after removal.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes and no. It did not bother me personally but it does contain fragrance. I'm unsure if the current ingredient list is accurate as the Japanese ranking site states it contains essential oils but the list from Yesstyle does not.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy, woodsy. Not so strong that it is super bothersome.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Absolutely. As soon as it becomes affordable again when the pandemic dies down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Moistage W Cold Cream 270g / 9.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tcxvpzp1y6251.jpg?width=249&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0996cc355ecab1a721c0c6316ef76089e89c8b6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q416df74y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd8cd5a3d8cf58c3c0822eb9da142611c5826bc\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $16 on eBay. Currently about $19 on [Yesstyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/kracie-moistage-w-cold-cream-270g/info.html/pid.1069419619). Very cost-effective bc of its huge size.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, water, polysorbate 65, microcrystalline wax, glycerin, DPG, glyceryl stearate, dimethicone, stearoyl glutamate Na, stearic acid, polysorbate 80, beeswax, xanthan gum, olive oil, squalane, hydrogenated castor oil hydroxystearate, silk extract , Ethanol, hydrolyzed collagen, cetearyl alcohol, EDTA2Na, methyl paraben, ethyl paraben\\*\\*, perfume.\\*\\*\n\n**Texture:** A rich, thick white cream.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a huge NO from me, dawg. This is terrible. It barely removes anything waterproof and leaves a heavy residue. However, if you're the type of person who doesn't mind using a more stripping cleanser afterward to wash this off, or using a washcloth, I guess I can see it as being, um. Acceptable?\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** It is gentle but slightly fragranced. No reaction from my skin other than disgust at being left in a thick film after wash off.\n\n**Scent:** Very light floral.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** YES.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter 76g / 2.7 Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/znms9m83y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45f6d28d2958c8133b26a2ab363b88bcf71d065e\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $13.65 on Amazon. Currently [$14.85 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F165210/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea  (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, **Parfum, Aqua, Linalool, Limonene,** Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Citric Acid.\n\n**Texture:** A thick, opaque white balm, not overly greasy or waxy.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a good first cleanser. Quite travel friendly but I have not traveled with it in weather that would melt it so I don't know if it would leak through. It removes everything quite well, no complaints here. It still is not as good as the Kracie botanical olive one, takes longer to break down sunscreen and makeup, and may leave behind a slight amount of waterproof mascara if you aren't thorough enough with massaging/letting it sit on the skin long enough to melt everything.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Has not bothered mine, but fragrance is pretty strong. \n\n**Scent:** Strong floral. Although not strong enough to CHOKE on like some Korean products - those of intimate with Korean skincare - you know what I'm talking about. /sideyes my mom's side of the skincare in the bathroom\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** No, I don't like the scent and the packaging. It's hard to close properly on first try. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# (Not A First Cleanser But) [Equate Eye Makeup Remover](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Beauty-Oil-Free-Eye-Makeup-Remover-5-5-oz/39139097) 5.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfnqtmh5y6251.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05638b521fa8a76a4fe2673625e2b750241a492f\n\n**Cost:** $4 \n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Chloride, Dipropylene Glycol, Poloxamer 182, Allantion, Tetrasodium Edta, Benzalkonium Chloride, Glycerin, Cucumber (Cucumis Sativus), Fruit Extract, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium Phosphate. \n\n**Texture:** You gotta shake it before use. Watery but has silicone slip and thickness. \n\n**Efficacy:** I've used this as a first cleanser with a cotton pad in a pinch on extra lazy nights. It pretty works well to remove things pretty well although it WILL leave a residue obviously that you have to wash off. Honestly can't really tell the difference between this and the Neutrogena one and it's cheaper so. I use it to remove eyelash glue and waterproof mascara that I put on them. \n\nIt doesn't magically whisk away a mess of water-resistant lash glue residue + waterproof mascara on top of THAT (i don't really think anything can) but it's adequate, cheap, fragrance-free, oil-free and prolongs the wear on my beloved Miche Bloomin falsies (Girly Flair is the most popular bc of Pony Makeup but that style is horrible for me - it's SUPER fragile and breaks so easily compared to the other styles) by 10x. \n\nI just pour some in my palm and poke the lashes in a little puddle of it for a bit till the mascara comes off and then remove the glue with my fingers afterward. I don't wash them off afterward and whatever residue it leaves behind does not interfere at all with the next coat of mascara I put on them lashes.\n\n(Gonna write a separate review, but FYI - I prefer [DUO quick drying lash glue](https://www.ulta.com/duo-quick-set-lash-adhesive-clear?productId=pimprod2003529) in the purple label more than the super famous Japanese [D-Up Eyelash Fix](https://www.amazon.co.jp/D-UP-%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A2%E3%83%83%E3%83%97-4946324013622-D-U-P-%E3%82%A2%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC/dp/B0012VQTO2/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=d-up&qid=1590969259&sr=8-5) that's touted as #1 globally. I find that it's SOOO much quicker drying than D-Up and makes the lashes stick BETTER, longer, and stands stronger to tears. Plus it's latex-free too, for sensitive eyes. And way cheaper! I regret getting extra back ups of the D-Up thinking it'll be the best thing ever. There are still some cons that D-Up has an upperhand on, but I'll talk about that in that review post.)\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell yeah. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMini-Review on the **Garnier Skin Active Micellar Cleansing Water (Pink Cap):** This was just a sample so I ran out of it pretty fast but I remember being surprised that it actually was pretty effective at removing waterproof makeup. Scent-free, I quite liked it I think. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water, For Waterproof Makeup (Blue Cap), 13.5 Fl Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4fb7kb6y6251.jpg?width=556&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b56036478b358bd5043af8f80652b63a71cb7f9f\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $6.59 on Amazon. \n\n**Ingredients:** AQUA/WATER, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, ISOHEXADECANE, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DECYL GLUCOSIDE, POLYAMINOPROPYL BIGUANIDE. F.I.L.# D178190/1 \n\n**Texture:** Watery, greasy. I hate this. I got it mainly to remove waterproof sunscreen from my neck and chest at the end of the day without taking a whole damn shower. Leave a very unpleasant, greasy residue that I cannot stand on my skin. No. \n\n**Efficacy:** I only tried removing my makeup with this several times and it was okay I think. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Definitely. \n\n**Repurchase?** No. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Sensibio H2O 500 ml / 16.7 fl oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3q1ucyc8y6251.jpg?width=443&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ffe3ed17780adf84d930a94d27ae29416decdc52\n\n**Cost:** $15 on Amazon.com\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (aqua), Peg-6 Caprylic/capric Glycerides, Cucumis Sativus (cucumber) Fruit Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Propylene Glycol, Disodium Edta, Cetrimonium Bromide. \n\n**Texture:** Watery, very light! Refreshing. Doesn't leave a greasy gross residue like above. I still splash water on top of the skin before toweling off and I still can feel a slight film. Ideally, I would like to wash it all off bc Lab Muffin says it's still not the best to leave surfactants on the skin, but most nights I can't be bothered and it shouldn't be *that* bad if people in places with harsh water just leave it on the skin, right? \n\nI guess a way to deal with that would be to wipe away using a toner/water/spray with a cotton pad or something but idk, that's more unnecessary garbage I feel. And more rubbing sensitive skin. \n\n**Efficacy:** This is fairly new. Got it for the same reason as the Garnier blue cap. It removes my waterproof sunscreen from my neck just fine with a baby wipe or cotton pad. But for everyday, I much prefer a cleansing oil to reduce the amount of tugging and rubbing on my skin as well as disposable wipes or pads. I tried it for removing waterproof mascara from my falsies like the Equate one, but it was okay, similar, but not as good and not as \"conditioning\" on my falsies to keep them soft. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** For me, yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** Yes! \n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext on my Wish List!!:\n\n\\- Muji Sensitive Cleansing Oil 400 ml\n\n\\- Muji Mild Cleansing Oil 400 ml \n\n\\- Muji Mild Milky Cleansing 200 ml \n\n\\- More cleansing gels (first cleansers NOT second cleansers) (I've tried Kikumasamune one before and I really liked that one for heavy, non-waterproof makeup days! Also Innisfree Jeju Bija cleansing gel - but this dried my skin out a bit when used as a LONE first cleanser but for some odd reason was fine when followed up with an actual second cleanser! So strange. That was years ago tho. Much earlier than Kiku.)\n\n\\- DHC Deep Cleansing Oil\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------\n\nHope that helps! \n\n(Ugh I have so many review posts and other posts I wanna write and I can't get them off my mind but I gotta wait for the big sunscreen & ceramide/pseudo-ceramide/urea creams review posts bc I'm so damn extra and gotta wait til I can take more Before & After photos months apart and compare winter vs summer performances. /eyeroll \n\nBUT I WANNA TALK ABOUT MORE SKINCARE RIGHT NOOOWWW SDKFJSD32kfd#@!

This is just my first impression. \n\nIngredients (copy and pasted from their website:) \nWater (Aqua), Azelaic Acid (skin-soothing, antioxidant, exfoliant), C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate (emollient), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (skin-replenishing), Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate (emollient), Glycerin (skin-replenishing), Cetearyl Alcohol (texture enhancer), Glyceryl Stearate (texture enhancer), Dimethicone (hydration/texture enhancer), Salicylic Acid (exfoliant), Adenosine (skin-restoring), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Bisabolol (skin-soothing), Cyclopentasiloxane (texture enhancer), Xanthan Gum (stabilizer), Sclerotium Gum (stabilizer), Propanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phenoxyethanol (preservative).\n\nIt has a cream consistency. I've read that AzA does better in a gel consistency, so if you don't have good results with this, that may be something to consider. \n\nSo a little background: I have mild rosacea, and I've been using Differin to keep my skin clear. I don't have super acne-prone skin, but I do get breakouts. I typically need something (salicylic acid or differin) to keep them at bay. Differin dried my skin out, and made my rosacea worse, but it cleared my skin. So I was on the hunt for something more soothing. The rest of my routine is pretty much set in solid stone, so it's a good base to test new acids from. \n\nI received my package from PC last Thursday, and for once in my life I spot-tested the cream. I put it right on my cheek, where I tend to get reddest if I'm sensitive to a product. After six hours there were no signs of irritation, so I applied a pea-sized amount to my entire face at night. I used it after my serum and before my moisturizer. \n\nAfter two days, I increased to twice a day application, now in place of my serum. I'm hooked. My skin is behaving like normal skin again - it produces oil, even! I look dewy! I can wear makeup! Because my skin isn't irritated 24/7, it looks more luminous, and much less red. Old marks are beginning to heal (which was a huge issue with differin - my skin never healed.) \n\nI'm having a slight purge - areas that were congested had a couple whiteheads, and it takes longer for active acne to go away with AzA than it did with Differin. I'm touching my face a lot right now because it's so soft, so that could also be a factor! But the immediate change in my skin's appearance and behavior have made me so pleased. Even if it didn't make my skin clearer, just the difference in how my skin feels is so good. \n\nIt's 36$ an ounce, but you get a discount if you sign up for autodelivery. They suggest every three months, but I'm thinking it's going to be every two for a twice a day application. Fine by me - now that my skin's not super dry I can skip my expensive serum. \n\nI definitely recommend testing it out if you're in the market for an azelaic acid, or if other acids are too harsh!",

It has drastically reduced the visible redness and somehow reduced the appearance of broken capillaries as well. I’ve been using it twice per day.

Cetaphil is available in two sizes- 30gm for Rs 185 and and 100 gm for Rs 435 (often available at some off at Nykaa). Re'equil one is available in only one size, 100gm for Rs 350.\n* *Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:* DAM- HG/WRP, RE'EQUIL: WNRP.\n\n**Experience:** \n\nHello all\n\nUsually I use lighter moisturiser but winters had me looking for an apt moituriser for my skin, since it gets dry and skin tends to become flaky. I was earlier using Simple Light moisturiser and Disguise Cosmetic's Sorbet, but both of these were proving insufficient for winters, hence decided to try DAM and Re'equil.\n\nAs you can see both of them have beautiful ingredients, though Re'equil one has fragrance (it is the last ingredient, the smell is mild and nice) while DAM is fragrance free.\n\nFor my skin type, I require a small amount of both of these  moisturisers. Though Re'equil is heavier- it is a cream albeit not a thick one, while DAM is lighter comparatively and has lotion like consistency.\n\nI started with using DAM during the morning routine. Needless to say, my skin did not feel dry at all. There was no need for reapplication either. It also did not react with my skin. So overall, I am very satisfied with this. Might this be love? Probably.\n\nRe'equil one I used in my PM routine. Now this moisturiser and I go long back because back in June, I got this for my younger sibling, who has a dry-dehydrated skin which is also prone to blackheads, whiteheads and acne. I wanted her to start looking after her skin a bit so I got her a bunch of products, one of which was this. It suited her nicely, though it is another matter altogether that she was never consistent with her routine. I guess skincare enlightenment has to occur on its own to a person for one to really get invested in it. Sigh. \n\nI also would use it occasionally then, and it did feel a little heavy on my combination skin so I decided to use it during winters. Cut to November, I started applying it in my nighttime routine. However after a couple of days, I could see some acne on my forehead. It probably clogged my pores. I stopped using it for some time, and the acne receded (my skin is not acne prone). I thought I should give it a try again, and once more I could see tiny acne on my forehead. I have since then decided to cut it off my routine. It is a great moisturiser, very nourishing. As mentioned, it works for my sister, but unfortunately it is not for me. \n\nRe'equil's finish is more matte, and it can be seen and felt immediately while DAM can feel slightly greasy on immediate application but sinks in fast and also provides a nice, smooth finish.\n\n**Conclusion**: So for the past one week, I have been using DAM in my AM as well as PM routine and I am more than satisfied. I think DAM is going to be my HG for winters atleast. Not sure how it is going to fare in summers, that remains to be seen. Hope this is helpful for folks looking for winter moisturisers. :)",

But after using this argan oil, I noticed I started having these kind of scalp pimples— which is acalled \"folliculitis\" (inflamed hair follicle). Then after further researching, this Bremod Argan Oil was the cause (based on my own experience) for the following reasons:\n1. Not harmful per se, but not pure argan oil either.\n2. Heavy in silicones (Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethiconol ingredients): which means its great for hair strands but bad if left on the scalp or applied too close to follicles (can clog them, causing folliculitis).\n3. Fragrance ingredients: potential irritants for sensitive scalp or broken skin.\n\nI'm not sure if my scalp is just sensitive that caused to trigger folliculitis, but I just wanted to know if anyone had the same experience and may be able to recommend safe argan oil products?

I was using these and testing them out while I was writing my previous sunscreen post , so I couldn't include these back then heheh. enjoy and I hope this helps you out!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/un9cxl/shelfie_sunscreens_more_info/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**preliminary info**\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wvluy9fctp691.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d3dc4f6ac986e712bf9b297f7f11882f59c62e78\n\n* **The Derma Co.**  **1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum**  \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\]\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 30 ml (bought from amazon)\n\n**For skin type** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid. fragrance free. really watery and leaves a dewy-shiny finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfsq89eetp691.jpg?width=2064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44d6b8bae83040943583a5eb4b1167f006397a41\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gneguawetp691.jpg?width=2693&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=310db1edebf494a6ddcbc27c6d5bd31261b1ee84\n\n**ingredient list** :  Purified Water, Glycerin, Avena Strigosa Seed Extract, Lecithin, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Silica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Decyl Glucoside, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7 & Disodium EDTA.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was....okay-ish? idk but I was really excited for this since their HA sun gel is one of my HGs. This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less 😖 if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation. I found this really mediocre.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Axis-Y Complete No-Stress Physical Sunscreen \\[SPF 50+ PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1450 for 50ml (bought for Rs.999 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily combo skin types. those with dry skin like mine, might find it a bit more drying. good one for sensitive skins since it has a lot of calming ingredients as well!\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick white cream. fragrance free but has very strong ayurvedic smell. matte finish. physical sunscreen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0lmry60ntp691.jpg?width=2284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=87ba8e26163d69608b5908427942392e037340cf\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k16vk0tntp691.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e5842c13a2344fb14bbe8cb6275e1b6355354b19\n\n**ingredients list** :  Water, Zinc Oxide, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propanediol, Titanium Dioxide, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Caprylyl Methicone, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Disiloxane, Niacinamide, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Water, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Stearic Acid, Aluminum Hydroxide, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Copaifera Officinalis (Balsam Copaiba) Resin, Tocopherol, Squalane, Allantoin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5\n\n**filters** :\n\n* zinc oxide (mineral filter)\n* titanium dioxide (mineral filter)\n\nthis had been on my 'to buy' list for such a long time! and I finally got it during a march beauty barn sale! when I first tried it, I was really skeptical since it gave me a pretty bad whitecast and smelt so weird. I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop 😭. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :( but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nrating : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uglx4tvptp691.jpg?width=3027&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1edc1b4cadce02af8a7cdc6b1c061b01ce3df5ce\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sjk70mlqtp691.jpg?width=3234&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9624dd3003686cc5cf39097b7f271e1643502dd5\n\n**ingredients list** :  Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/​PPG-10/​1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is 🔥🔥🔥. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool 🤤 only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure!  in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty 😖 I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao 😌 so you can guess I go out a lot heheh. I feel like this one is getting over sooner than others in my ss ki theli 😫 but either way, if you find a good deal on it, blindly add this to your cart and order it. you wont be dissappointed!\n\nrating : 5/5 and WRP on reduced mrp only.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand that's all I have to share with you all today! there are so many other ss I want to try like the BOJ one and the Beplain nonnano one, but I want to finish my current stock before buying anymore! do feel free to ask any questions related in the comments and I hope you enjoyed reading these!",

I love physical sunscreens for indooors mainly due to the whitecast, I’ve been using the Neutrogena Sheer zinc for a while because it not only gives me a sun protection but also soothes my skin and reduces oil production. But the biggest drawback is it’s whitecast :/ and I totally get you when you mention the white cast around mouth. The Neutrogena one makes me looking like a ghost all day.",

    "body": "By popular demand, I'm here with a review of Missha Near Skin Madecanol Cream! Early in March, I posted [my review] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/82f8h9/review_missha_near_skin_total_ceramide_cream/) of the Total Ceramide Cream from the same line, which has claimed the title of HG moisturizer. Can the Madecanol Cream measure up? Let's find out! \n\n**Missha Near Skin Madecanol Cream:** Sunscreen was my gateway drug into the Missha brand. The All Around Safe Block Essence Sun was the first sunscreen I found that didn't dry out my skin. After that, I fell in love with the Near Skin Total Ceramide Cream and the Ice Sorbet hydrogel masks. I'm almost done with a tube of the Madecanol Cream, and have the FTE mist in my stash. So I guess you could say Missha and I are getting pretty serious about each other. After searching for months to find a moisturizer I loved, the bar was set pretty high for the Madecanol cream. I was hoping for the same dewy, moisturizing goodness as the ceramide cream for my poor, dry skin. My bae Missha did not disappoint!\n\nThis review will mostly be comparing the Madecanol Cream to the Total Ceramide Cream, so make sure to read the first review too!\n\n**Packaging:** Like I said last time, I'm a sucker for minimalist chic packaging à la Glossier. The Madecanol cream comes in the same 50ml white metal tube as its ceramide counterpart. The only difference is that the stripes at the bottom are a pale green, rather than pink. It's cute as hell, but *so* not functional. As I feared, the metal packaging gets really difficult to work with as you get to the end of the product. It's sort of like wrestling with a heavy duty tube of toothpaste, and there was **definitely** product left at the end that I just couldn't get to. This time I'll take the plunge and cut it open, but last time I was traveling, so that wasn't an option. \n\nThis packaging also makes it very easy to use too much product. Because the tube is so stiff and you have to wrestle with it, it's difficult to control the amount of product that comes out each time.  I honestly prefer jar packaging for my moisturizers (nobody tell ScA) because it's easier to control the amount of product I get and minimize waste. It didn't break while I was traveling like it has for other users, so that's one plus, I guess. \n\n**Ingredients:** The ingredients in the Madecanol Cream are much more different from the Ceramide Cream than I expected! And unfortunately, this one does have a few more acne triggers and potential irritants than the Ceramide Cream. According to [CosDNA] (http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_3813285157.html) Cetearyl Alcohol and Olive Oil, both of which feature in the cream, rate a 2 on their scale of acne triggers. Dimethicone and butylene glycol, also present, rate a 1. There's also niacinamide in the Madecanol Cream, which is great for me, but not great for people who are sensitive to it. \n\nThat's the potentially bad stuff. But there's also a lot of potentially good stuff in there too! To start with, the Madecanol Cream contains 45.9% Centella Asiatica, 4% Panthenol, and .1% Madecassoside. [Centella Asiatica] (https://theklog.co/centella-skin-benefits/) seems to be the new it-girl of skincare, especially in the AB world. This plant is known for its anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties. Centella Asiatica and its derivative [madecassoside] (https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/plant-extracts/madecassoside.html) have also been found to have some antioxidant properties, and I even stumbled across [a study] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24352025) suggesting that madecassoside may act as a melanin inhibitor. But that's not all! In addition to the centella asiatica-based ingredients, the Madecanol cream also contains [panthenol] (http://thenakedchemist.com/benefits-of-panthenol-in-skin-care/), an alcohol that creates Vitamin B5 when absorbed into the skin. Panthenol has been shown to behave as a humectant **and** an emollient, soothes, and improves barrier function. There's also some sodium hyaluronate thrown in there, but it's so far down on the ingredients list that I'm not expecting much from it.\n\nThis cream sounded like exactly the moisturizing, hydrating, soothing, anti-redness product I needed in my routine...my expectations were definitely high going in: I was hoping for the same moisture as the Ceramide Cream, plus more soothing and redness reduction, and maybe even a touch more hydration. \n\nAs always, here is the full ingredients list:\n\nCentella Asiatica Extract (45.9%), Glycerin, Water, Dimethicone, Panthenol (4%), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Pentylene Glycol, , Propanediol, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Niacinamide, Cetearyl Olivate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Madecassoside (0.1%), Sorbitan Olivate, Glyceryl Stearate, Microcrystalline Wax, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Carbomer, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract, Tromethamine, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n**Price:** Currently $15 on Jolse (which works out to 30 cents per ml). It's not bad, but I do go through it very quickly, which can add up. \n\n**Use and Performance:** The consistency of the Madecanol Cream is slightly different than the Ceramide Cream. It's still that same \"thick like a pudding but stiff like a gel\" consistency, but leans maybe a bit more gel-like than the other one. It was also a bit more translucent, and felt a bit lighter on the skin. Overall, this cream performs very similarly to the Ceramide Cream. It sinks in nicely, but also leaves my face just dewy enough that I can skip primer on days when I'm wearing makeup. It leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized--no leftover tightness anywhere--and I don't have to touch up during the day as much as I do with other moisturizers. Like the Ceramide Cream, it's also unscented and leaves no white cast.\n\nIn terms of redness reduction, I've definitely noticed a difference in the past few weeks while using this cream. It's slight, but it's there, and I'm pretty sure it's not from my azaleic acid, because I didn't notice the same effect while using the Ceramide Cream...that one made me more glowy, but there was still a lot of redness going on. The Madecanol Cream also feels pretty soothing. I had a nasty, painful breakout about a week ago, and applying the cream definitely helped to calm things down temporarily, while my trusty Skinoren got to the root of the problem.   \n\nThe one negative I've found is that it's not quite enough for very dry days. Like the Ceramide Cream, this moisturizer feels like it might fail me if the weather gets suddenly cold, or if I were to overuse my actives. It's so lovely that I don't mind keeping a little tin of Nivea on hand for those days though. \n\n**Final Thoughts:** Missha has impressed me yet again! If I were standing in a store and *had* to pick out one of the two creams, it would probably be the Ceramide Cream, because it's just slightly thicker. That being said, I already have two tubes of the Madecanol Cream in my cart on Jolse, because this is now tied for HG moisturizer, and I don't want to be without it! I adore the soft, dewy finish, and the redness reduction and soothing effects are just so lovely. \n\nThis cream might not be for you if you have extraordinarily dry skin.  As much as I love it, it probably won't be thick enough, and my recommendation would be the Holika Holika Good Cera Cream (at least as a night cream--the Madecanol Cream might work nicely for the day!) It also probably won't make a good day cream for anyone with oily skin, because it's just slightly too dewy. It might work nicely as a night cream for oily skin, though.\n\nOverall, this is a really nice moisturizing, soothing cream, and I plan on always having a spare in my cabinet. \n\n**My Rating: 4.4/5**",

I perfer Etude's Soon Jung as it was more soothing and less dewy. When I layered this Missha under creams, the dewiness wasn't so ideal.  But I get why you like that. I like that same dewy texture in heavier moisturizers a lot. The Soon Jung Barrier Cream has that quality, but is way thicker, though to me still a day cream. I do like the Missha Madecanol though.",

Ordered on 23 May, received on 2 June.|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy Opinions:  \nI have combination skin and I do not use a moisturiser in the morning. I just wash my face and put on a sunscreen ([review](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/idcnxg/reequil_ultra_matte_sunscreen_review/)) and step out. When I am back home after work, I again cleanse and this is when I slather on a moisturiser. This is why I needed a thick moisturiser to ensure my skin gets its needed dose in one single application.  \nI tried out the DermaCo first. The delivery was slow and I did not like the fact that the tube had to go through crazy temperature differences during its long delivery time. I understand that the delay was probably due to the lockdown but when I wrote to DermaCo about this and suggesting that they sell through amazon as well, since their delivery network is better, all I got was scripted responses which were no where related to my concern. So not a fan of their customer service. As mentioned, this cream did absorb more easily than the Reequil. The huge problem is the Fragrance! I do not have sensitive skin and this is the first time that fragrance has affected me in a negative way. My eyes would get super irritated after putting this on. Trust me, I have tried everything to try and prevent this - never putting it close to my eyes, closing my eyes during application, covering my eyes with a sleeping mask during application etc. lol. Alas, nothing worked and the irritation continued. To be fair, the irritation level was different everyday - somedays it zinged a lot, on others it wasn't much. But it was always after putting this cream on! It could very well be any other ingredient that caused the irritation but I think it was the fragrance. I stopped using it after about a month.\n\nOrdered the Reequil as a replacement through amazon and delivery was in 2 days. With this cream the absorption is a bit of concern, it does take time to get into the skin. I figured that it works much better on moist skin. So I wash my face and just pat off the excess water before application. I have been using this since 1.5 months now.\n\nBoth these creams are moisturising enough. The reequil leaves a bit of oily layer on the skin - its not too much but definitely present. The DermaCo pretty much disappears after application.I have not had any break outs with either of them and no other irritation other than the eye thing with DermaCo.Both of them claim to be non-comedogenic as the whole formulation but both contain ingredients that can clog up the pores, as mentioned in the ingredients breakdown.\n\nFor now, I am happy with the Reequil based on my current requirements.",

I started trying this cream in the peak of winter in extremely dry temperature. It made me break out pretty much the next morning. The pimples were painful and took 2 weeks to subside. This cream and cleanser were the only additions to my routine. I stopped the cream for a while, and continued using the cleanser and my usual routine. However, every time I would use the cream it would aggravate and break me out. But, it worked WONDERS on dry patches on my feet and elbow. So I think this would be good for very very dry skin. But it felt way too heavy for my oily/normal skin. ***WNRP***.",

I was ok with my previous sunscreen, but it made my skin look like a oily well and my skin feel suffocated. I wanted something matte finish and gives a good coverage. I stumbled upon this sunscreen and was thinking back and forth to buy it and finally decided to bought it before a month ago. \n\nIt is not gel based as marketed, but has little but thick lotion like (not completely) consistency. It blends quickly which is surprisingly good for a physical sunscreen. It did gives a matte finish look with velvety feel, and has minimal whitecast which settles within few minutes. I rather be a white ghost (very minimal) than fighting with my eczema. \n\nIt was surprisingly light well and my skin is finally able to breathe and doesn't clog my pores. \n\nOverall rating- 4. 5/5",

I bought it off Nykaa\n\n**Skin info:** Combination. Sometimes, it is combination-dry, sometimes combination-oily, sometimes normal. When it is oily-dry, it is oily around the nose and cheeks but the tip of my nose and chin will be dry. Its weird and really depends on my water consumption. It has been looking dull and dehydrated this past month.**Climate:** Humid, Hot, Rainy (currently)\n\n**Ingredients list:**  Water, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol,                             Styrene/​Acrylates Copolymer, Coco–Glucoside, Poloxamer 407, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methyl Paraben, Menthol, Disodium EDTA,                          Petrolatum, Allantoin, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hyaluronate,                            Perfume, Benzyl Alcohol, Citronellol, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool, CI 42090\n\n**Packaging:** Just like the photo. Comes in a plastic tub. You have to dip your finger in it to pick up the product.\n\n**Texture:** Looks like a light custard in the tub (it jiggles) but spreads like a light gel. It is described as a gel creme on the packaging and the description fits.\n\n**Usage:** Been using it two-three times a day since the 28th of September. In the morning, I spread a light layer on my damp skin after washing my face with Neutrogena Extra Gentle Face Wash. If I am reapplying during the day, I just clean my face with water and apply it on damp skin. At nights, I repeat the morning routine and spread a light layer on my damp skin after washing my face.   \nOn October 1, I had to go out and applied Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Sun Screen over it. On October 3rd morning, I applied Biotique Bio-Dandelion Serum after washing my face and then applied this gel on top. On October 3rd night, I mixed a drop of glycerine with the vaseline gel and applied on my damp skin after cleansing.   \nI have also increased my water intake so that is one thing that will contribute to my skin looking better. I am doing nothing else in my routine so far.\n\n**Opinion:** I love it (so far). It spreads smoothly across the skin and sinks into my skin easily.  At one point I felt that it absorbed too easily and perhaps I needed more on my skin but as soon as I splashed water on my face, I saw this light sheen blocking the water (probably because of the silicone). It feels a little cool when I apply it (because of the menthol) and tingles my eyes a wee bit (but doesn't hurt or make my eyes water. I actually like the tingling sensation on my skin). It keeps my skin feeling soft, smooth and moisturised for a long time. My skin felt a tad bit oily when I applied a thick layer though (however it could be because I sweat a lot that day). This combines well with both my Biotique serum (which is more like a light moisturiser than a serum) and glycerine. It does have a light fragrance (doesn't bother me at all) that seems to go away in a couple of minutes.\n\nI plan to add to this review and write about my whole basic routine at the end of the month. But my first impressions about this product are great. For those with dryer skin or living in dryer climates, you might need to apply a thicker layer of this to feel the benefits. I have never used the Ponds Gel that everyone loves. But looking at the ingredients list, this Vaseline Gel Creme could possibly be a substitute (I personally feel the ingredients are better but I am a beginner at this and could be wrong)\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions about this product.\n\n\nEdited to add:  I did notice a couple of tiiiiiny white heads around my chin and cheeks. And I seem to have a pimple forming near my nose. But I don't know if I can attribute it to the Vaseline gel. On 29th and 30th, I had to go to work and was wearing my mask for 5+ hours and its almost that time of the month. So I don't know if this product is clogging my pores and causing the one pimple and three whiteheads. I don't have a \"break out\" so can't say yet. Will be able to give a more informed opinion when I give a full review.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sc2z56tdu0r51.png?width=322&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c42ec854fa29737c2bfeff62a44ddd5bc341294",

These chemicals block your pores and mask body odor. While I’m not a doctor, it seems logical to avoid products with aluminum that block a natural bodily function like sweating.\n\nIn the past year, I switched to \"natural\" deodorants that don’t contain these chemicals. They work fine for everyday activities, but as a runner, I found them inadequate. After a 4-mile run, I would smell terrible and have to scrub vigorously in the shower to get rid of the odor.\n\nOne day, a friend jokingly suggested using lemon. Desperate after a run, I tried rubbing a lemon under my arms and was amazed at how it instantly eliminated the body odor.

I find the finish very similar to the Soon Jung Hydro Barrier Cream though it looks/feels creamier upon dispensing and application. There's a brief moment where it looks kind of white but it sinks in quickly and leaves a nice natural finish. Not matte, not shiny, maybe slightly dewy on my oily skin. It's hydrating and I can use it alone comfortably, but I do live in a temperate climate with decent humidity. Otherwise, it layers fine over my serum and/or moisturizer. My undereye concealer and loose finishing powder applies fine over it. I can't comment on other types of face makeup. \n\nGenerally, I find it to be a nice no-frills option. There's no fragrance or alcohol. If you like the Soon Jung line, you'll probably like this sunscreen. I'm definitely keeping it in my back pocket in case my HG gets discontinued but it's not an immediate repurchase due to the cost. I got it on sale Jolse for  $9.99 for 1.69 fl oz / 50ml but it generally retails closer to $20.",

Not that I'm always looking for my sunscreen to be moisturizing, but it dries down very matte and even perhaps a touch drying for me. My skin is combo, prone to some dryness and can be sensitive.\n\nIt applies like a dream and has zero whitecast for me. I haven't noticed any irritation or sensitivities from it either. So, overall I think it's a nice sunscreen and I might reorder at some point, but I just ordered the new Beauty of Joseon to try out.",

I was chatting over at the /r/beautyguruchatter Discord when NoSpelledWithAK said that she thought that the formula was changed and that no one said anything.

Probably the one everyone is going to latch onto is that Subculture shadows are based on talc, whereas MR shadows are based on mica, but it looks like the entire formula got changed between the two palettes. This likely explains why people are having problems with Subculture not blending in as well as MR, as well as some major kickback issues.\n\nInterestingly enough, the ingredients for MR aren't [listed on the ABH website](http://www.anastasiabeverlyhills.com/modern-renaissance-palette/ABH01-18170.html).

    "body": "I’m From Mugwort Cream\n\nThe mugwort line from I’m From features some of my favorite soothing/calming products. Artemisia/mugwort is known for its ability to bring down redness and inflammation...and I’m From’s offerings contain some of the higher percentages of the ingredient that I have seen.\n\nTheir Mugwort Cream contains 73.55% mugwort extract alongside shea butter, father david elm extract, and fermented soybean/cogon grass extracts. The entire formulation reads like an herbal remedy that I imagine being concocted at an apothecary.\n\nAs for the consistency/texture...I was quite surprised. The cream has a lightweight look and nearly gel-like feel when first applied. But, once it’s gotten a chance to absorb there is a bit more of an occlusive feel and even slight residue left behind (which might not be ideal for those with oily skin that prefer really watery hydrators).\n\nHowever, it ended up being the lack of immediate calming/soothing that made this product a bit less impressive than the rest of the I’m From Mugwort products.\n\nWhile I did see an improvement to redness and irritation over the course of the past month...there wasn’t that immediate hit of redness reduction that I appreciated in the other products. I could always turn to the I’m From Mugwort Essence to bring my skin back from the brink when adjusting to Tretinoin or after being in the sun too long. \n\nThe I’m From Mugwort Cream just doesn’t seem to have that “triage” ability that I was hoping to see. The amount of hydration and moisture-locking ability is really nice though. Dry/normal skin that experiences redness or sensitivity might get along well with this product...but there might be a slower build to visible calming results. \n\nFull Ingredients List: Artemisia Princeps Extract, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Glycerin, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Stearic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Butylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Arachidyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Flower Extract, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, C14-28 Alkyl Acid, Stearyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-2 Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate, Panthenol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Allatoin, Boswellia Serrata Resin Extract, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/ VP Copolymer, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/ Sodium Acryloydimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Dimethiconol, Saccharamyces/ Viscum Album (Misletoe) Ferment Extract, Lactobacillus/ Soybean Ferment Extract, Saccharomyces/ Viscum Album (Misletoe) Ferment Extract, Lactobacillus/ Soybean Ferment Extract, Saccharomyces/ Imperata Cylindrica Root Ferment Extract, Disodium EDTA, Polyglutamic Acid, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Artemisia Vulgaris Oil\n\nWhere To Buy ($32.00 USD - Wishtrend - 50ml): [https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/mugwort-cream/](https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/mugwort-cream/) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/660kxqxxhrq51.jpg?width=4707&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f44858c40b452cc060e2e1922a84175baf307379",

But to me, this claim sets off my BS alarm. First and foremost, the number 1 ingredient is Cyclopentasiloxane, which is sometimes discussed in SCA as a potential clogging ingredient, especially to those sensitive to silicones. On the other hand, if I am recalling correctly, silicones technically are an occlusive, so they could act as a separate layer on top of the skin. The ingredients list has a lot of ingredients I'm not really familiar with as well.\n\nHowever, if it isn't, this could be potentially very helpful for those who experience breakouts with nearly all forms of foundation. I definitely experience this, and I can't be alone, especially among people with very large pores. More specifically, it seems to me that makeup actively seeps into my pores and will stay there for up to 24 hours after I remove the foundation, no matter what level of oil cleansing/double cleansing/cotton pad swiping/exfoliation I do. \n\nSo, what do you think? Is such a thing possible, or is Tatcha playing up another gimmick? Have you been able to wear problematic makeup (thinking along the lines of a HG finish or color that you love that makes you break out, lord knows they are out there) with the aid of similar primers, moisturizers or anything like that?",

My biggest issue is foundation settling into my smile lines and in the folds at the edges of my nostrils. This primer really helps. I didn’t want to pay the price, so once I ran out I cracked open a deluxe sample of the Tarte clean slate primer, hoping it would be a somewhat more affordable alternative. It had a similar effect, but didn’t feel as nice on the skin, and my makeup didn’t look quite as good. I don’t know if there’s a “protective layer” but I really enjoy this primer. My skin is generally pretty normal, sometimes dry, with the occasional acne spot—so I can’t speak to whether or not the Tatcha is problematic for blemish prone skin.",

    "body": "**First things first, about my skin:**\n\nI live in a really humid, hot tropical country and I have really oily skin. To the level that during the day at work, I can easily go through five or six oil blotting sheets. When I wake up in the morning from sleeping, despite being in an airconditioned room, there's a thin sheen of oil on my face. But oddly enough I had this consistent dry patch of skin near the corner of my lip. I think my skin was dehydrated after going on a beach trip and was overcompensating by making more oil. I've used a clear gel moisturizer for the longest time only because anytime I tried something thicker, my face would break out. But I could tell it just wasn't moisturizing enough for my skin. Which is how a friend recommended to me Nature Republic's Super Aqua Max Watery Cream (what a mouthful!) at least for the PM moisturizer.\n\nThey have variants for oily, dry, and combination skin but I chose the combination because the reviews I saw recommended it, it's the one my friend uses, and given I have that dry patch on my face, I figured I'd go for the combination one to address it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aqy40m2aae211.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57ce8ac54563d6e7e28e50f893d34b22b385b15f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/84rawz6bae211.jpg?width=1278&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a9143842540e8b7297f0dc09d3c6e0481ee1a2d5\n\n[Texture is sort of the in between of a gel and a cream?

And I know a lot of people are particular about that.\n* It's also very heavily scented. Don't get me wrong, personally I find it to be a nice, clean, refreshing scent and it does kind of make me think of the ocean, but it is kind of strong. 10 minutes after I've put it on, I can still kind of smell it on my face. But I know a lot of people are sensitive about fragrance on products, so if you are, yeah, don't get it.\n\n**PROS:**\n\n* It's pretty affordable! I was thinking of trying this or the Skinfood Royal Honey Propolis Essence and it's about 1/4 of its selling price (at least here in my country). \n* It's been about a month since I've been putting it on \\- and no breakouts! That's honestly the bare minimum I ask for in a product. So I'm happy for that!\n* The texture is sort of that halfway point between a gel and a cream so just a little product goes a long way and I can easily smooth a small amount over my face and it glides on easily and sinks into the skin. I don't feel like it's just sitting on top of my skin. It also leaves a nice cooling feeling on my skin.\n* I can confidently say it's doing its part in moisturizing my face.\n   * When I apply it before going to bed, I wake up in the morning and I no longer have a layer of oil on my face. And now I know what it feels like for my skin to be smooth and soft in the mornings. I can really feel the difference on my skin when I start to layer products after it. \n   * Because it sinks in so well, I've started using it in the mornings before my sunscreen \\- and now instead of five oil blotting sheets a day, I can survive with one or two.\n   * I also no longer have the dry patch of skin near the corner of my mouth! I used to have to apply Vaseline on it every night but by the time I wash off the Vaseline in the morning it'd still be there. Now the dry patch is completely gone.\n\nSo overall, I'm really happy with it so far. I've always kinda ignored the Nature Republic in the mall because it doesn't have a lot of noise about it online (from what I've seen), so I'm happy to have tried this out.  \n\n\nEDIT: Included the comment that it's affordable!",

It's really good at preventing the patches, BUT I still think the [L'Oreal Paris Magic Perfecting Base] (http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.asp?pid=270550&catid=183548&aid=338666&aparam=270550&kpid=270550&CAWELAID=120142990000013325&CAGPSPN=pla) is a over-all better primer for dry skin. I have and use both daily but the perfecting base is definatelly my favourite over the two. It's got a much softer finish, perhaps that's why.\nEither of those two are literally drugstore HG's tho.",

    "body": "[Sunscreen Flatlay](https://imgur.com/a/LikqZpP)\n\n[Please note: no sunscreens were harmed while taking pictures; kept them in sun for a couple of minutes for the aesthetics and got the shot then got them inside ASAP😂]\n\nAge: 22 F\nSkin Type: Oily and Acne Prone\n\n[texture shots of both sunscreens](https://imgur.com/a/7hfbAME) \n\n[on partially blending](https://imgur.com/a/pdEucF9)\n\n\n1. DHC Suncut Q10 EX Gel - 80gm\n\n⛅️ SPF Rating: SPF 50 P++++\n\n🌥 Usage Period : Jan - July (not regularly but whenever I went out in sun which is 2-3 times a week)\n\n🌥Price: ₹2395 for 80g\n\n💥 I got it on a Nykaa sale. DHC cleansing oil 70 ml + Sunscreen at ₹1450💥\n\nIngredients: Water/aqua/eau, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, alcohol, isononyl isononanoate, polymethyl methacrylate, pentylene glycol, zinc oxide, cyclopentasiloxane,bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol\nmethoxyphenyl triazine, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate, vp/eixosene\ncopolymer, methyl methacrylate crosspolymer,\nethylhexyl triazone, titanium oxide, ammonium\nacryloyldimethyltaurate/beheneth-25\nmethacrylate crosspolymer, phenoxyethanol,\nacrylates/dimethiconecopolymer,\nisohexadecane, sodium acrylate/sodium\nacryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer,\ntriethylhexanoin, ethylhexylglycerin,\npolyhydroxystearic acid, isostearic acid,\naluminum stearate, olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, tetrasodium edta, caprylic/capric triglyceride, alumina, silica, acrylates/c10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, sodium hydroxide, t-butyl alcohol, laminaria ochroleuca extract, ubiquinone, sodium hyaluronate.\n\nTexture: Extremely Lightweight, No white cast, feels like a light moisturiser, A little runny!\n\nMy views: \n\n✨ When it comes to a minimal skincare routine, this one is my absolute favourite. On mornings when I’m late for work, and have no time for an elaborate skincare routine, this one comes handy. And even when I’m not in a hurry, I choose this while going out because I do not like layers of skincare on my face while I’m out. \n\n✨After application it takes a minute to seep into the skin and gives a beautiful dewy finish. I find it’s texture is quite similar to Paula’s Choice Youth Extending SPF but the DHC one has a white coloured cream which takes a minute to settle. \n\n✨It’s fragrance free and non irritating for my acne prone skin. So far I’ve never encountered any stinging near eyes or overall. And also no contact dermatitis or sudden breakouts. And as for added advantage- it’s hydrating and moisturising enough for entire day. In fact, I’ve been complimented by my colleagues for looking glowy!! 🙈\n\n✨ BUT I feel it’s too overpriced for the quantity and if it were not for that offer on Nykaa, I would have never purchased the sunscreen.\n\n✨ The key ingredients marketed in the sunscreen are: \n\nCoenzyme Q10: Hydrates skin and helps fight\nsigns of aging such as fine lines and loss of\nelasticity\n\nOlive Virgin Oil: Rich in antioxidants, it maintains the skin's moisture barrier and helps fight damage caused by free radicals without clogging pores.\n\nHyaluronic Acid: Helps maintain skin's firmness\nand hydration\n\nLaminaria Ochroleuca Extract: Rich in minerals\nand amino acids, it conditions and soothes skin.\n\n✨ A lot of DHC products are marketed with Olive Oil, including their cleansing oil. And DHC is charges a pretty hefty price for this basic ingredient. \n\n✨The sunscreen comes in a tube packaging with a screw cap and is easy to squeeze and use due it’s tiny opening. Aids in 2 finger rule measurement.\n\n✨I would repurchase it if I get a similar offer but unfortunately I cannot find the sunscreen anywhere. I think the brand has discontinued it, it’s not even listed on their website anymore. Really upset with this discovery because I thought I had found my HG sunscreen to buy at sales. \n\n2. Loreal UV defender Correct and Protect (tinted sunscreen) \n\n⛅️ Usage: April 22 - July 22 (not regular)\n\n⛅️ UV Rating: SPF 50+ Pa++++\n\n⛅️ UV Filters: Hybrid Filters\n➖ Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (aka Octinoxate, Octyl Methoxycinnamate)\n➖ Drometrizole Trisiloxane (aka Mexoryl XL)\n➖ Titanium Dioxide\n➖ Terephthalylidene\n➖ Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid \n➖ Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoy Hexyl Benzoate \n➖Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol\n➖ Methoxypheny1 Triazine C\n\nPrice and Ingredients are available on every website so y’all can check it out there. There’s always an offer and I got it at ₹ 500 from Myntra\n\n⛅️ Texture: Serum like, Kinda hard to spread evenly tho! Takes a while for blending it.\n\nMy Views: \n\n✨ I was extremely excited when it launched since I had never used a tinted sunscreen sadly it wasn’t completely the way I expected it to be. However, as I’m not into makeup, this is an average substitute for tinted cream to cover my light acne scars. \n\n✨ The tint is peachy orange and it’s a little darker for my skin tone so blending is extremely important otherwise it looks patchy. Takes a good 5 mins to blend it in properly. \n\n✨ Me being a lazy perfectionist- makes it a quite difficult for to reach for it everyday. The sunscreen gives my skin a finish which is somewhere between dewy and matte. \n\n✨ Apart from texture and coverage, it’s enriched with vitamin C in form of Ascorbyl Glucoside. And has hybrid filters. I do not have indepth knowledge of sunscreen filters but y’all can look them up on inci decoder. \n\n✨ The sunscreen has a mild fragrance but doesn’t linger much and isn’t irritating considering perfume is the last ingredient in the list.\n\n✨I LOVEEEE its packaging tho, it has a thin nozzle which makes it easy to remove the sunscreen on your fingers. The package has a plastic squeezy bottle with screw cap. \n\n✨ Overall, it’s an average sunscreen according to me and my experience. I don’t hate it, it’s an okay product which I would definitely finish up but wouldn’t repurchase. \n\nTHAT WAS HELL OF A LONG REVIEW LOL. Been writing it since a month and finally posted!! Hope y’all find it helpful :).\nWill be posting part 2 soon!",

I also got it during the same sale and I honestly would have shelled out full price for it, that’s how much I love it. And now it’s lost to the mists of time.

Tbh, before buying i saw some bad reviews of the sunscreen on this sub but the ingredient list sucked me in along with the boot star rating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI first tested a little bit on my hand and guys, let me tell you the texture is AMAZING. Its soooooo fucking light and sinks in the skin beautifully, it also feels a little cold when i apply it. After that hand application I moved onto my face and it pilled so badly, i was very, very, very disappointed. But I had already spent my money though and I was determined to make it work. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI tried a few different methods of application and one application technique worked!!!! I was estatic to say the least. The sunscreen is very lightweight, has NO whitecast, looks beautiful under makeup and looks amazing on the skin. It does look dewy on the skin but doesn't make me feel like a greaseball like the Neutrogena one. Dries fairly okayish so need to set with powder in order for hair to not stick. Although, sometimes i don't follow the technique and it pills in certain areas but the makeup covers the mishaps if the pilling is minute.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Application technique*\n\n • Face needs to be clean with no product on it. I dont apply any moisturizer or serum before suncreen so idk how it layers on other skincare products.\n\n • Take 2 finger worth of sunscreen, and dot it all over the face\n\n • Rub only one area of the face at a time until blends in\n\n • If you want to apply makeup, give it a few minutes to settle down\n\n • ONLY pat your foundation/concealer or any cream product to blend or else it will pill. \n\n*Texture shots*- http://imgur.com/gallery/iSWWJ6e\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know the sunscreen seems like a pain in the ass but it really isn't after getting used to the application. I WRP because of the ingredient list and the boot star rating.",

    "body": "Hello fellow kiwis. I'm sure I'm not the only one who has been on this subreddit for a while, exasperated and disheartened at the lack of products we have access to. I'm going to share a bit of information about the products I have found available in supermarkets and nationwide stores, due to my obsession with poring through skincare aisles.\n\n**BHAs:**\n\n[Clean & Clear Advantage Fast Clearing Spot Gel 10g](http://www.thewarehouse.co.nz/red/catalog/product/Clean-%26-Clear-Advantage-Fast-Clearing-Spot-Gel-10g?SKU=1336248): Available at the Warehouse for $10.99. Countdown doesn't carry this on its own, it sells the combined pack of 4 kit with a cleanser + whatever else. 10g seems small but it has lasted me ages! I used it as a nightly or twice daily spot treatment, and I put it on my T zone where my SFs are. It doesn't burn or anything.\n\nIngredients\n\nActive ingredient: **salicylic acid** 2%-acne medication. Inactive ingredients: alcohol, ammonium hydroxide, benzalkonium chloride, butylene glycol, c12-15 alkyl lactate, c13-14 isoparaffin, capryloyl glycine, cedrus atlantica bark extract, cetyl lactate, cinnamomum zeylanicum bark extract, cocamidopropyl pg-dimonium chloride phosphate, cyclopentasiloxane, dehydroxanthan gum, denatonium benzoate, fragrance, glycerin, hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel)\n\nClearasil Ultra - Rapid Action Pads. 65 Pads.\nThese are available at countdown. I can't remember the exact price but they're around $12-15. A few downsides - there is a lot of liquid in this pot and it leaked when I was travelling, so I had to keep it in a plastic bag. It does mean though that you could probably use half a pad, and use any excess liquid in the bottom with cotton pads. This kind of stings when it goes on, and the pads are textured for some reason so it's best to pat your face with them. \n\nIngredients\n\nActive Ingredients: **Salicylic Acid** (2%) (Purpose: Acne medication) Inactive Ingredients: Water, Alcohol Denatured, Isoceteth 20, Hydrogen Peroxide, Fragrance, Sodium Hydroxide, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Propylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Dipropylene Glycol, Methylparaben, EDTA (Ethylenediamine-Tetra-Acetic Acid), Potassium Sorbate, Butylparaben, Ethylparaben, Propylparaben\n\nThese both have denatured alcohol in them, so might not be ideal for those are sensitive to that.\n\n**AHA**\n\nThis is the reason I made this post! This is the first thing I have found with an AHA in it. I really want to try the St Ives pads but ordering them online is a mission. The only AHA I can get my hands on is lactic acid in the form of milk and yoghurt, but I'm not keen on putting those on my face every night. I found these today:\n\n[Skinfood Facial Cleansing Wipes](http://www.skinfood.co.nz/skin-care/all-products/facial-cleansing-wipes.html) - $10.19 online, or I found them in countdown for approximately the same, or $8.90 on special with onecard today anyway. Bloody good ingredient list if I don't say so myself. I tried one tonight and they are very soft, and big. 25 in a pack. I am not sure whether this contains a good concentration of AHA, but it is an option.\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Glycerine Cocoglucoside, Aloe Vera Extract Chamomile Extract, **Lactic Acid**, Methylisothiazolinone, Methylchloroisothiazolinone.\n\n**Clay Mask**\n\n[Freeman Avocado & Oatmeal Facial Clay Mask](http://www.freemanbeauty.com/product/avocado-oatmeal-facial-clay-mask)\n\nDon't get excited about the price on that website - I found this in farmers and if I remember correctly it was about $20 - but definitely worth it. They have different kinds of masks, I think I remember seeing the Pomegranate Facial Revealing Peel-Off Mask and one other one, and they also have them all in sample packets for about $2. This one comes out green, smells lovely, and dries really quickly. \n\n**Things that I use, and other info**\n\nBenzac AC in a white tube is probably the cheapest **benzoyl peroxide** product - the 5% one I've seen in Countdown and Pak'n'Save, but Pharmacies have it in 2.5% and 10% as well. I got the 5% one and I use it very very sparingly as a spot treatment on my hormonal acne when it flares up, and it does a good job of clearing it, although I wish I had found the 2.5% first. It is about $20 in Countdown. Use too much though and you'll risk flakiness and redness like I got. I would recommend not making this a habit, only a spot treatment if necessary. Clearasil also does a benzoyl peroxide cream as well, which I have seen in countdown.\n\nI also use Cetaphil Gentle Skin **Cleanser** which is in countdown and farmers, it doesn't dry my skin out or give it a tight feeling. I got the biggest size bottle and it will last me AGES. Cetaphil moisturiser isn't my favourite though - it leaves quite a waxy feeling on my skin.\n\nI use Aveeno SPF 30 **moisturiser** which is in all supermarkets, which is a chemical sunscreen. This stings my face when I have irritated my skin too much though, and sometimes pills on my sin. I have a tonne of Neutrogena SPF 50/70/80/100 chemical sunscreens that I use on my face as well, which are good, albeit make me very shiny. \n\nI found jojoba **oil** in Farmers - there are two sizes, and both are fairly expensive - I think I bought the 30ml one for around $30? The pumps squirt out the oil really inefficiently. I'm not sure if I'll buy it again. They have some argan oil there as well - only one brand though and it is expensive. If you really want to buy oils, I recommend checking out Iherb, linked to further down in the post.\n\nI bought the Olay Regenerist vibrating brush face cleanser thing from the warehouse for $35.99. I've used it about three times cautiously. I have been told by someone on this sub that it causes microtears in the skin due to the way it vibrates. When using it on my face I do notice that it kind of moves my skin in different directions, so I can see how it might be a bit rough and cause abrasions. I'm not sure I want to risk microtears so I might not use it on my face any more.\n\nI bought [DermaLab Super Hydrating Moisturiser](http://www.dermalab.co.nz/moisturiser/) from farmers and love it.\n\nThe Warehouse has huge bulk packs of cotton pads and balls for like $3. \n\nYou can find CeraVE on Amazon, but I haven't given that a try yet. Some places don't ship to NZ, PM me/leave a comment if you want to order some and I will find my bookmark of the ones that ship to NZ.\n\n\n**Websites that ship to NZ:**\n\n[Paula's Choice no longer has a NZ site, but does ship to NZ for a flat rate of $15US, arriving in about 8 days](http://www.paulaschoice.com). They regularly have specials and discounts. PM me if you are a new purchaser who would like $10 off your first purchase. PC usually has discount codes that give 20% off - PRPAULA20 currently works as of May 2014.\n\n[Garden of Wisdom](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/mandelicacids.html) ships to NZ, as well as [Silk Naturals](http://host.silknaturals.com/creb/toners-c-107_122.html). Iherb has a [LOT](http://www.iherb.com/search?kw=aha&x=0&y=0#p=1), like that [Aztec Clay](http://www.iherb.com/Aztec-Secret-Indian-Healing-Clay-1-lb-454-g/29363#p=1&oos=1&disc=0&lc=en-US&w=st%20ives&rc=22&sr=null&ic=2) and even raw ACV, but is lacking certain brands like St Ives. Not sure about shipping costs or times for any of these sites. It's not as ideal as buying things instore, but it's there if you want certain things.\n\nI have used [Iherb](http://www.iherb.com/) twice now and it is great. Use the search bar for recommendations as to what to buy from there. Choose the $8 shipping and it will arrive in about a week. This is where you should go if you are looking for **cheap AHAs** - look for the Alpha Hydrox brand. It also has a tonne of cheap ELF products, as well as Raw Apple Cider Vinegar, Aquaphor, Aztec Clay Mask, Mint Julep Mask, Coconut oil, etc.\n\nPLEASE add your own products that you use! I want to have a good idea of what works for people and what we have in NZ. \n",

[Skinmedix](http://www.skinmedix.com/) have international shipping (not sure how good the rates are, I'm hoping they're reasonable) and they sell Elta MD's sunscreens - they have a better range than Amazon even. They sell some avene products too, and lots of other fancy looking brands that I don't really know anything about. *ETA: I just did a fake cart to find out shipping rates, and economy shipping to NZ for two bottles of sunscreen was $13 AUD. not at bad all!*\n\nYou might also strike gold looking in local health food stores. There is one near me that sells raw honey and ACV, as well as some brands I haven't seen in stores anywhere else like alba botanicals (fruit enzyme products) and Dr bronners.

Sadly im also super prone to hyperpigmentation. My main Goals are barrier health, hydration, acne & Hyperpigmentation management and getting rid of the damn stubborn CC\\`s... I also follow a kinda skincycling routine wich includes a non AB Retinal product.\n\nIn **Bold** will be the product name + how long i have been using it\n\nin *italic* will be the ingredients i liked\n\n\n\n**Axis-Y Sunday morning cleanser: (using for a month now)** *green tea extract, centella extract, allatonin*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Coco-Betaine, Butylene Glycol, Potassium Cocoate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Benzoate, Polyquaternium-67, Xylitylglucoside, Citric Acid, Anhydroxylitol, Propanediol, Xylitol, Betula Platyphylla Japonica Juice, Glucose, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Disodium EDTA, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Agrimonia Eupatoria Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Dipropylene Glycol, Allantoin, Perilla Frutescens Leaf Extract, Saponaria Officinalis Extract, Sodium Acetate, Pentylene Glycol, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Kigelia Africana Fruit Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Natto Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxycinnamic Acid, Rutin\n\nTexture:\n\na balmy texture, foams up to a dense and soft foam\n\nExpirience:\n\nI picked this up because I wanted to change from my old clenaser to something that felt like it had a bit more cleansing power, yet was not stripping. As far as i can tell it seems to accomplish that. It foams up nicely, cleans well and doesent seem to strip my Skin. After washing it off it feels almost as if there is a slight layer on my Skin, but i dont mind it/ think that it contributes to the non stripping?\n\n(4/5)\n\n**Cosrx Propolis Toner: (about a month 1/2 of use)** *propolis, honey extract, panthenol*\n\nIngredients:\n\nPropolis Extract, Honey Extract, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Cassia Obtusifolia Seed Extract, Panthenol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride\n\nTexture:\n\na waterlike texture, thats just a bit thicker\n\nExpirience:\n\nTo be honest im not overly impressed... its a nice hydrating toner for sure but i didnt notice anything outstanding that would have me choose it again. But it gets a pluspoint for being reasonably priced so i migth pick it up again to reach free shipping...\n\n(3/5)\n\n**Holika Holika Aloe Waterproof Sungel (3 Months of use)** *Aloe*\n\nIngredients:\n\nAqua, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Niacinamide, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Caprylyl Methicone, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hippophae Rhamnoides Fruit Extract, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract, Rosa Canina Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Extract, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Juice, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Pentylene Glycol, Behenyl Alcohol, Poly C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Decyl Glucoside, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, T-butyl Alcohol, Tocopherol, Ascorbic Acid, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Ceramide Np, Phytosphingosine, Parfum\n\nTexture:\n\na thin cream Texture, not runny but almost there\n\nExpirience:\n\nIt comes in quite a big size for a Sunscreen, you can find 80 - 100 ml Tubes online for around 15-17 Euros! Wich honestly was the sole reason why i bougth it xD i figured my skin would be fine with the Ingredients and i just hate tiny sunscreens! And well... that was exactly what it is like, its decently moisturizing and doesnt irritate my Skin. But if you have sensitive Skin be careful, it does have Fragrance, smells kinda like very artificial Aloe. You can smell it but only upon first apllication, it doesnt linger. I have been using 1 bottle for 3 months and still have enough for another month at min. so a win!\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n**Purito Dermide Cica Barrier Sleeping Mask: (3 months of use)** *Squalane, Centella Extract, Jojoba oil, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Ceramide*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract(250,000Ppm), Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Squalane, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Butylene Glycol, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Panthenol, Ceramide NP(3,000Ppm), Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyacetophenone, Sodium Carbomer, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract\n\nTexture:\n\nA thick Cream, feels quite emmolient\n\nExpirience:\n\nI love, love, loe this! Its the first moisturizer that i found that feels like it actually does its job well on my Skin. As a nigthtime moisturizer it keeps my Skin hydrated all through the Night and has my wake up nicely glowy. I love to use this when my Skin is irritated, it really soothes it quickly. Always have this on my Shelf, you would have to pry it out of my dead cold hands, to seperate me from it. One Bottle last me about 2 months.\n\nHG!\n\n(5/5)\n\n**Mary & May Blackberry Cream Essence: (4 months of use)** *Jojoba oil, ceramides, lotus water, centella*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Nymphaea Caerulea Flower Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit Extract, 1,2-hexanediol, Methlypropanediol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Hydrolyzed Gardenia Florida Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Trilaureth-4 Phoshate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Pvm/Ma Copolymer, Cyanocobalamin, Ceramide Np, Maltodextrin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopherol\n\nTexture:\n\nthin, watery but creamy? (just realized i suck at describing textures haha)\n\nExpirience:\n\nA really nice hydrating and moisturizing Toner, feels like a great balance of the two. Acts nicely as a layer with other Skincare because it absorbs really well. I like it, a bottle lasts me about 2 months.\n\n(4/5)\n\n**Abib Quick Sunstick Protection Bar: ( 3 months of use)** *Aloe, Centella, Ceramides*\n\nIngredients:\n\nOctyldodecanol, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Dibutyl Ethylhexanoyl Glutamide, Dibutyl Lauroyl Glutamide, Diisostearyl Malate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dextrin Palmitate, Octocrylene, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Saccharide Isomerate, Maltodextrin, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethyl Hexanediol, Ceramide NP, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol\n\nTexture:\n\nA translucent stick, glides on smooth, feels a bit occlusive on skin\n\nExpirience:\n\nNicely moisturizing Sunstick, feels good on my Skin and well... does its Job xD I really like the curved shape of it, it relly helps with the application. I just use it for reapplication of my sunscreen, but also sometimes when my Skin gets really dry during the day ( tho its not the best for that)\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n**Numbuzin No.2 Protein 43% creamy Serum: ( 4 months of use)** *Oat protein, Ceramides, cholesterol, fatty acids, ferments, Rice protein*\n\nIngredients:\n\nAvena Sativa Protein Extract, Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Poly C6-14 Olefin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Erythritol, Limnanthes Alba Seed Oil, Sodium Chloride, Allantoin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Adenosine, Dextrin, Theobroma Cacao Extract, Pantolactone, Ceramide NP, Cholesterol, Palmitic Acid, Oryza Sativa Seed Protein Extract, Stearic Acid, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Lactobacillus Ferment, Glycine Soja Protein, Hydrolyzed Lupine Protein, Glucose, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Sweet Almond Protein, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Myristic Acid, Hydrolyzed Pea Protein, Arachidic Acid, Lauric Acid, Sodium Succinate, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance\n\nTexture:\n\nVery thick serum, really is creamy like the name says\n\nExpirience:\n\nSooo repairing and soothing, does wonders for my barrier. It really helps keep my Skin moisturized and helps keep my transepidermal waterloss in check. Love it so much! HG!\n\n(5/5)\n\n**Purito Aha Bha Refreshing Solution: (1 month of use)** *Glycolic acid, Salcylic Acid*\n\nIngredients:\n\nSalix Alba (Willow) Bark Water, Butylene Glycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid (7%), Tromethamine, Water, Salicylic Acid(2%), 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Citrate, Arginine, Caprylyl Glycol, Citric Acid(0.28%), Hydroxyacetophenone, Pentylene Glycol, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Disodium EDTA\n\nTexture:\n\nlike water, it put 2-3 drops on a thin cotton pad and swipe over my Face with it\n\nExpirience:\n\nSince it has only been a month i cannot say too much about how it has worked (and i feel its hard to tell what effects on my skin is retinal and whats from this product) but my comedones are reducing in size and developing into breakouts. But the effects of these ingredients are well studied in these concentrations so i would say its save to say it works. Its my first time using glycolic acid and i can say it packs a punch for sure! So be careful, its intense, so far im using it once a week on my exfoliation day and i dont think ill be moving up.... Might also be the fact that its a combo product, but i have been using salcylic acid and mandelic acid in combo before, and that felt less sensitizing. So im attributing that factor to the 7 percent glycolic acid, since it is the smallest molecule size of all Aha\\`s.\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow lets move to quick first impressions of a few products i just started trying, wich i have seperated from the review portion because i just havent been using them long enough to really speak about the effects on my Skin: (these will also be shorter impressions with less info)\n\n\n\n**Neo:labs liquid enhancer Pycogenol:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Propanediol, Hydrogenated Poly C6-14 Olefin, 1.2-Hexanediol, Methylpropanediol, Glycerin, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Saccharum Officinarum Extract, Jojoba Esters, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Salvia Sclarea Oil, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa Root Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Theobroma Cacao Seed Extract, Melaleuca Altemifolia Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, C18-36 Acid Triglyceride, Coprylyl Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, C12-18 Acid Triglyceride, Squalene, Sodium Polyacrylate, Tromethamine, Albatreus Contuena Extract, Paimitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Phytasteryl Macadamiate, Citric Acid, Phytosterol, Dextrin, Tocopherol, Butylene Glycol, 4-Terpineol, Pentylene Glycol, Octonediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\nExpirience:\n\nBougth this because of the tea tree extract, oil and 4- terpineol for the antimicrobial and antiinflammatory benefits , plus it also promised balancing the water-oil contend of the skin. So far i have been using it for a week and it feels nicely moisturizing, but i cannot say if it has helped with my breakouts. Smells strongly like tea tree, wich i dont mind.\n\n**Isntree Spotsaver Mugwort Ampoule:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nArtemisia Princeps Extract, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth-26, Erythritol, Betaine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Piper Methysticum Leaf/Root/Stem Extract, Panthenol, Propanediol, Beta-Glucan, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Allantoin, Carbomer, Tromethamine, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\nExpirience:\n\nThis i got because i heard amazing things about mugwort and it was on a 50 % Sale, so i got it for a steal! So far i like the simple ingredient list an it seems soothing and hydrating.\n\n**RNW Der.Ceramide Cream:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Ceramide NP, Panthenol, Caprylyl Methicone, Glycerin, C12-16 Alcohols, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Ceramide NS, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Ceramide AS, Ceramide AP, Oligopeptide-1, Ceramide EOP, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Betaine, Arginine, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Carbomer, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Arachidyl Glucoside, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Stearic Acid, Adenosine, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium EDTA\n\nExpirience:\n\nIm really intriged by this brand an was debating between this and the Ceramide serum, but got this Cream. At first i was intimitaded by the essential oils and the strong smell it has (herbal, but to my nose very pleasant) so i patchtested it on my cheek. The Patchtests went fine and i have been using it on my whole face for 4 days now and i must say im impressed.\n\nIf you have oily skin i feel you could hate it but for my dry skin... the texture is amazing. Its a THIIICK cream, like an ointment, very balmy. Upon apllication it feels nice to spread it and it sinks in so well for the thick texture. The cream surprisingly dries down velvety and leaving a protective shield over the Skin. I also love that it has 3 % Panthenol, 3% ceramides and cholesterol and fatty acids.... so perfect ingrdients for skin barrier repair! Really a potential HG...\n\n\n\n",

I would consider myself someone with pretty good skin, and it hardly did much at all - maybe minimally smoothing and evening skin tone. In case you wanted to take the risk regardless, I just wanted to at least let you know that the actual coverage itself is really minimal. For reference, I use the Medium tone and have Oily skin. Skin Tint is a liquid, and for me on my oily skin, by the end of the day I felt pretty greasy.",

I accidentally get products containing silicone in my hair on a daily basis and have no way of removing them. I am also concerned about the potential effects of getting my sunscreen stuck in my hair next to my skin.\n\nI no longer think that dimethicone is a bad or dispensable ingredient. I understand the difference between sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate and sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate, as well as the difference between cyclomethicone, cyclopentasiloxane, dimethicone and amodimethicone. I just bought a shampoo containing the mild surfactant sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate and a conditioner containing dimethicone after spending an hour reading the back of haircare products at the shops. Crazy, man! This is a huge deal and I'm totally jittery.\n\nI think that no-poo can work well for some people, mainly those with short or curly hair. I have long, semi-straight hair, and no matter how much I used my BBB I could not get my hair smooth. I had frizzy, split ends just a short time after getting my hair cut. I kinda succeeded for a long time while telling myself that this was what healthy hair looked like, then I reassessed my needs and here I am. I got all of the damaged hair cut off today and I'm ready to try this shit out.\n\nGood luck everyone!",

        "body": "Hey, do what works for you! No poo works literal wonders for some people, some people never find the perfect method that works for them. Even so, everyone can learn and benefit from at least some of the techniques and knowledge of no poo, that they can take with them even if they don't stick to no poo. Using a low-poo is still waaaaaaay better than an SLS shampoo.\n\nIf the BBB you tried doesn't work for your hair type (I'm wondering if it has a lot of plastic bristles mixed in, because often they do, and those damage hair), I highly HIGHLY recommend getting a wooden bristled brush-- whether you are no poo or not. The bristles are spread far apart, still flexible if you get one of the squishy brushes, and the wood does distribute natural hair oils a bit, which is still beneficial even if (or especially if) you use a low-poo or shampoo cleanser. It can give some life back to your ends between washes without looking greasy or damaging your hair. You can get them at whole foods or health foods stores or online. Best of luck to you!",

I have naturally curly hair but I hate how it looks. (like Brent Spiner in Independence day!!)  Totally frizzy no matter how much I brush or whatever.  So I straighten my hair with that same BBB and a hair drier.  Looks pretty amazing with a good cut.  Healthy hair isnt going to make your hair smooth if its not.  I use a shampoo bar a couple times a week max and I dont have to use a conditioner or any other products.  (I think using styling products makes it more necessary to wash more often but everyone is different) That said if OTC shampoos works for you then right on.  :-)",

Then I tried water only and it worked pretty  well for a while, but my hair looked sticky and greasy.  My hair is very thin and curly. After a while I noticed that my hair got even thinner and my scalp was showing (not sure if it's stress or what). I've discovered that we have hard water at home and the build up was crazy on my head. So last month, I said srew it and went back to an slas shampoo (Johnson's baby shampoo). I do an oil treatment for 2 hours before washing it so the shampoo won't dry out my hair. I no longer use conditioners, I just use a tiny bit of olive oil and that's it.",

    "body": "Hi all! I know this product is not a new one and has been reviewed quite a bit, but I've never done a review before and thought it would be fun. After using this product almost every day for almost a year I'm very familiar with it (and spoiler: I'm searching for a new sunscreen to replace it).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Skin profile:** Normal in terms of dryness/oiliness, prone to dehydration. Have always had sensitive skin but used this product also whilst recovering from skin barrier damage (so major sensitivity). Rosacea, mainly on cheeks. I also have hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), which definitely affects the performance of sunscreens. Skin tone-wise, I am white with a pale, fairly even tone but blotchy-red cheeks from rosacea.\n\n**Routine:** (Current AM) Dampen skin with water, Purito B5 Panthenol Re-Barrier Cream, CosRX Aloe SPF. Have also used the sunscreen in other routines, e.g. my last one was: Pyunkang Yul Essence Mist Toner, CosRX Snail Essence, Purito B5 Panthenol Re-Barrier Cream, CosRX Aloe SPF.\n\n**Climate:** England - used this product in London (very high pollution) and the East coast (lower pollution) from September 2022 - August 2023, so have used it through all seasons. England is humid all year round.\n\n**Product Summary:** High-protection hybrid sunscreen - that is, it combines mineral (titanium dioxide) and chemical filters.\n\n**Price:** £14 on both SkinSider and PureSeoul, where I purchased.\n\n**Amount:** 50ml/1.69 fl. oz.\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Isoamyl P-Methoxycinnamate, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Alcohol,Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Titanium Dioxide, C14-22 Alcohols, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Aloe Arborescens Leaf Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Peg-100 Stearate, Silica, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Triethanolamine Sodium Hydroxide, Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA\n\n**Smell:** Like your average sunscreen with a very mild fresh, green smell. Many people say the smell is overpowering for them, but I literally never noticed it had fragrance until I saw someone mention it.\n\n**Texture:** Creamy texture, not watery but not super thick either. Pretty normal, pleasant texture for a sunscreen, but it is definitely thicker than other creamy sunscreens I have tried and feels thicker on the skin.\n\n**Application:** I used 2 fingers worth for my whole face & neck. Glides on the skin very well; it's pretty nice to apply. It does apply pretty sticky and it takes maybe 20 minutes to dry down - though some days it doesn't really dry down at all. This could be because of the amount of moisturiser I've used underneath it, or because some days I sweat more. More on this in the 'performance' section.\n\n**Visible effects:** As it is a hybrid sunscreen it does apply with a white cast but after leaving it on my face for a couple of minutes it sinks in nicely and there isn't much cast left. Do keep in mind that I am quite pale, though I recommended this sunscreen to a friend who is Indian and therefore darker than me, and it didn't leave a recognisable cast on him either. I have also always enjoyed the glow that this sunscreen gives me. It doesn't make me ultra shiny but isn't completely matte, and it seems to make the light hit me in all the right places, making my skin look healthy and hydrated. As someone who has redness from rosacea I also suspect this sunscreen has a slight green-ish tint on the skin that cancels out the redness slightly, though I could be imagining it! Overall it makes my skin look pretty nice.\n\n**Performance:** As someone with very sensitive skin, this sunscreen never once caused irritation, visible or otherwise. Even when my skin barrier was very damaged and I went back to using barely any products to give my skin a rest, my skin did not react at all to this sunscreen and worked better than even the super gentle sunscreens formulated for babies that I tried, to minimise further irritation during this time. This is super surprising to me given that it includes chemical filters, fragrance, alcohol and plant extracts - all of which can be triggers for sensitive skin and that I generally try to avoid now that I know a lot more about skincare than I did when I purchased this for the first time. However, as nice as it is to have a product that doesn't cause me irritation, I cannot continue using it for any longer because the pilling is SO BAD. I've seen so many people say this and I can't say I noticed an issue with it until a couple of months ago, but that could just be because I wasn't applying enough of it (not getting adequate sun protection). For the last couple of months I have been using only a barrier moisturiser in the morning (Purito B5), and have not been applying this sunscreen until 5+ hours later (I go to work fairly early in the morning and haven't been applying sunscreen until I leave). Even with so many hours between applying products, the sunscreen still manages to pill like crazy. I started applying less moisturiser and applying it on damp skin which definitely helped it absorb better, aka didn't leave as much of a barrier 'film' on the skin so that the sunscreen could sit better on top of it, and although this helped a bit for a while, ultimately the pilling is still awful. All I have to do is touch my face and there will be white flakes all over my finger. If I drag a finger down my face/neck, a huge long, grey piece of sunscreen will roll off onto my finger. Even without touching my face it will pill sometimes. I will say that I think the amount I sweat at work does have an effect on the pilling, because some days it's worse than others, but I can't really control how much I sweat so ultimately it's just not possible for me to use this sunscreen anymore. However, I have seen some people say that they don't have issues with pilling for this, and I think it's less likely that you will experience issues if you 1. chemically exfoliate (I don't) and 2. don't use a moisturiser that leaves a slight 'film' on the skin to eliminate TEWL, like a barrier cream. I did still experience some pilling even on completely product-free skin though. At the end of the day I am unwilling to change my moisturiser right now, so the sunscreen is gone!",

I only use it at home now, which is a shame because it feels really nice right after applying, isn't drying and is a nice dewy but not shiny look.\n\nI ended up opening and bringing Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Gel (not essence) which pills less in comparison but looks very shiny? It's quite drying or maybe it was my skin being temperamental with traveling because I had some dry skin peeling. But it was more makeupable compared to the Cosrx sunscreen. Neither are holy grail for me because there's so many other ones I want to try, but if I could only use these two on my face, I wouldn't be upset.",

    "body": "I've tried many SPF lip balms over the years.  My biggest complaint is that so many are less than SPF 30 and some are not even broad spectrum.  Why insist on SPF 30 for your face but use something less on your lips?  Lips receive UV exposure too and are a common place to get skin cancer.  \n\nAdditionally, I found that many SPF lip products have a \"chemical taste\" and/or irritate my throat.  So I started excluding ones that contain avobenzone (which I suspect, but am not certain, is responsible for this).\n\nHere is a review for three that I've used that met my requirements.  Photos are at the end of the post.\n\n**Elta MD Lip Balm SPF 31** Active Ingredients: 7.5% Octinoxate, 5.0% Zinc oxide.  Inactive Ingredients: Petrolatum, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol,  Lauryl Laurate, Purified Water, Flavor, Polyethylene, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Cera Alba, Glycerin, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Glyceryl Behenate, Microcrystalline Wax, Quercetin, Thiotic Acid, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Hydrogenated Soybean Oil, Hydrolyzed Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum, Glyceryl Stearate, Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum.\n\nContains antioxidants Vitamin C and E.   This has a vaguely minty scent, though it contains no mint or other flavoring.  I would not repurchase this because I don't like the oily base that it is in.  It comes out of the tube as a soft solid, but turns very oily on my lips.  The result is a very glossy appearance and some of the product gets into my mouth. The fact that it melts when hot worries me; I fear the ingredients may separate and no longer be evenly distributed (for example, if you keep it in your pocket). The tube specifies that it should not be exposed to temperatures greater than 103 degrees F.  Leaves my lips lighter and very glossy (see picture at the end of the post).  Price is $10 on Dermstore for a 0.28 oz tube.\n\n**Cotz SPF 45 lip balm**  Active: Titanium Dioxide 4.0%, Zinc Oxide 5.5%.\nInactive: Alumina, Aluminum Hydroxide, Aluminum Stearate, Ascorbyl Palmitate (Vitamin C), Cetearyl Isononanoate, Dicaprylate-Caprate, C12-15 Alkyls Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Helianthus Annus (Sunflower) Seed Wax, Hexadecanol, Hexadecyl Laurate, Iron Oxides, Ozokerite, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Flavor.\n\nThis is a physical sunscreen lip balm that is tinted brown.  Yes, brown.  The brown tint works surprisingly well, though I wish they'd come out with a pink option as well.  I don't find this to be drying at all. Contains antioxidants Vitamin C and E.  It smells a bit like candy, but the scent dissipates quickly.  Tastes how it smells, but only if i lick my lips.  I've gone through several tubes of this because I like it so much. It holds up fine in my pocket, though the label always gets rubbed off eventually.  Looks brown on lips but not overly so (see picture at the end of the post). I've purchased on the Cotz website, as well as on Dermstore.  It's about $6-7 for a 0.14 oz tube.\n\n**Ultrasun UltraLip SPF 30**  Ingredients: C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Stearate, Paraffinum Liquidum, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ozokerite, Paraffin, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, PEG-8 Beeswax, Cera Alba, Cocoglycerides, Cyclopentasiloxane, Candelilla Cera, Ceresin, Dipropylene Glycol Dibenzoate, Limnanthes Alba Seed Oil, Cyclohexasiloxane, Ribes Nigrum Seed Oil, PPG-15 Stearyl Ether Benzoate, Lecithin, Copernicia Cerifera Cera, Tocopheryl Acetate, Butyrospermum Parkii Extract, Aroma, Tocopherol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Oleate, Citric Acid.\n\nThis is a European product, so the percentages of active ingredients are not listed out.  We can see it contains octinoxate, Tinosorb S, and Uvinul A.  Contains antioxidants Vitamin C and E. Contains blackcurrent and meadowfoam oils. Because of the UVA circle, we know the PPD is at least 10, or equivalent to PA+++.  It says it contains aroma, but I smell nothing.  It feels like a regular lip balm, has a very nice texture and no taste at all.  I am not sure yet if it is drying (the weather is getting colder here, so it's hard to tell).  I purchased it on Feelunique and it's $7-8 for a 4.8 g tube.  I like it so far and would purchase again.\n\n[Photos](https://imgur.com/a/riyNr).",

As you should.  You should always ALWAYS be able to trust brand owners, or you shouldn't buy from them.  Absolutely. \n\nI would like to touch on this a bit more.\n\n[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1wq66s/how_do_you_know_products_are_safe_when_ordering) is a post where concerns were brought up regarding not putting EXACT ingredients into our ingredients labels making us bad and sketchy brand owners.  Using the phrase \"May Contain\" is NOT a cop out...and as a consumer of products in general, not just indie products...is something that you are going to have to get used to seeing from us more and more.\n\nLet me give you a few examples.  Someone using the niche of natural ingredients to sell their product (which is something I do), is perfectly acceptable, and very favored among many consumers.  However...Listing say... \"Organic apple juice, aloe vera gel, vitamin c, etc\" LEGALLY should look like this: Pyrus Malus, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Ascorbic acid.  It doesn't look as fun and natural anymore does it?  But, by law..if you want to be taken seriously as the great brand owner you should be by the FDA and other scary monsters...that is how you LEGALLY need to list your wonderful natural ingredients.\n\nNow...as for eyeshadows.  And I know a few of you feel that if they are not listed EXACT what you put in them...they are a sketchy brand owner.\n\nI want to list a few major brand examples to you all, just for reference purposes.\n\n**Urban Decay Primer Potion:**\n\nIngredients\nORIGINAL / SIN:\nIsododecane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Polyethylene, Trihydroxystearin, Triethylhexanoin, Isopropyl Lanolate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Dimethicone, PEG-40 Stearate, Propylene Carbonate, Phenoxyethanol, Synthetic Beeswax, Propylparaben, Methylparaben, Butylparaben, Ethylparaben, Isobutylparaben.\nMay Contain:\nMica, CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide), CI 77491/ CI 77499 (Iron Oxides), CI 77163 (Bismuth Oxychloride).\n\nEDEN:\nIsododecane,Cyclopentasiloxane,Trimethylsiloxysilicate,Disteardimonium Hectorite,Polyethylene,Triethylhexanoin,Trihydroxystearin,Isopropyl Lanolate,Sorbitan Sesquioleate,VP/Eicosene Copolymer,Talc, Dimethicone,PEG-40 Stearate,Phenoxyethanol,Synthetic Beeswax,Propylene Carbonate.\n\nGREED:\nIsododecane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Polyethylene, Trihydroxystearin, Triethylhexanoin, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Isopropyl Lanolate, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Dimethicone, PEG-40 Stearate, Phenoxyethanol, Propylene Carbonate, Synthetic Beeswax. May contain: Mica, CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide), CI 77491/77499 (Iron Oxides).\n**May Contain:**\nCI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide), CI 77491/77492/77499 (Iron Oxides). \n\nThe list goes on and on and on with MAC, however...\n\nMAC Bronzing Powder:\nTalc, Nylon-12, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Octyldoecyl Stearoyl Stearate, Isostearyl Neopentanoate, Zinc Stearate, Hordeum Vulgare (Barley) Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Squalane, Magnesium Myristrate, Mathylparaben, Propylparaben\n\n**Bronzing Powder may contain:**\nMica, Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxides, Bismuth Oxychloride, Carmine, Chromium Hydroxide Green, Ferric Ferrocyanide, Manganese Violet, Ultramarines, Blue 1 Lake, Red 6, Red 7, Yellow 5 Lake\n\n\nI'm not even going to start with the shadows.  So according to the FDA this is how it's legally written...it's not a sketchy business practice...it's actually a RESPONSIBLE business practice.\n\n\nWhen brand owners don't do this you have to assume they know what they're doing...but what if they made a typo?  Or what if they just don't know what they're doing and write it that way?  You have to think about the legality of us keeping our shops open, and trust the good ones know what they are doing.  \n\nPersonally, seeing wax listed as the first ingredient after mica in a list of ingredients for eye shadow is more concerning. I'm not making candles.  The possible pigments contained in a colored mica that was made by someone else as an ingredient, then delivered to me deserves a \"May contain\" section on my label.\n\nI'm not writing this to be mean or rude...I just want you all to be more aware of the changing world and rules that go along with that.  Just because we're indie, doesn't mean we are above, or omitted from the same rules and regulations as big brands.  If anything people who follow the letter should be commended that it CAN be done, and held to a higher standard. \n",

        "body": "This is a really interesting post, thanks for writing it! I have a few random thoughts...\n\n* Incomplete, inaccurate, or completely missing ingredients listings scare the crap out of me. For one, I have bad allergies, and it's critically important for me to know what's in the products I'm using. For another, US brands that don't list ingredients show a lack of respect not only for their customers but also for US law, which requires full ingredients listings for every product. Alternatively, it may show a terrifying lack of research on the part of the brand owner - if they don't know they are legally required to list ingredients, what other important, widely available information have they also missed?\n\n* I've read an explanation of the \"May contain...\" lists and I'm curious to know everyone's thoughts on this. I've read that batches don't always come out exactly alike, so the \"May contain\" list usually has ingredients that might be added at the end of batch creation to tweak it to meet the overall standard for the product. For example, if one particular batch came out a little less red than usual, they have the option of adding carmine or another red pigment, but they won't necessarily do that for every single batch so the ingredient isn't necessarily present in every single batch. Has anyone else heard this? Does anyone know if it's a myth or an actual explanation? \n\nAnd you're absolutely right - we should definitely commend the brands who do this well, because it's super important! I'm not always good at only buying from brands that follow the law in disclosing their ingredients, but I really want to resolve to do so from now on.",

I was ok with my previous sunscreen, but it made my skin look like a oil well and my skin feel suffocated. I wanted a physical sunscreen with matte finish and provides a good protection. I stumbled upon this sunscreen and was thinking back and forth whether to buy it or not and finally decided tobgo for it. \n\nIt is not gel based as marketed, but has little but thick lotion like (not completely) consistency. It blends quickly which is surprisingly good for a physical sunscreen. It did gives a matte finish look with velvety feel, and has minimal whitecast which settles within few minutes. I rather be a white ghost (very minimal) than fighting with my eczema. \n\nIt was surprisingly light well and my skin is finally able to breathe and doesn't clog my pores. \n\nOverall rating- 4. 5/5",

    "body": "This is my first review on here, so I'm still trying to find my style and all that but I hope to post more reviews in the future!\n\nAnyway, onto the product.\n\n**WHY I BOUGHT IT**\n\nI bought this based upon recommendations from this sub, where I have heard people rave about it, as well as over on r/AsianBeauty as well. This was also recommended by Cyrille Laurent - he absolutely adores this moisturiser and constantly raves about it. If you don't know who he is, he's still fairly small on Youtube and Instagram and he has a Biology PhD, so his videos and content tends to focus on what is supported by science. I find him a really valuable source of information alongside LabMuffin, Dr Ginza, The Eco Well and Skinchemy. I was looking for a new moisturiser at the time and this seemed to fit the bill really well.\n\n**MY SKIN TYPE/CONCERNS**\n\nI have pretty dry skin, and I do tend to get quite sweaty from exercise as well. I'm prone to blackheads and clogged pores on my nose, and I also get some closed comedones on my chin. I'm sensitive to fragrance and essential oils as they tend to cause some stinging and and cause acne.\n\n**HOW/WHERE I BOUGHT IT**\n\nAs I live in the UK, this is available at Boots (basically a drugstore) for £19.50 for 40g, which is a little pricey but honestly not too bad as I didn't have to pay shipping.\n\n**HOW LONG I'VE BEEN USING IT FOR**\n\nI've been using this for 3 1/2 weeks, which I think is pretty much long enough for a moisturiser. I patch-tested this first as well.\n\n**INGREDIENTS LIST**\n\n*Water/Aqua, Glycerin, Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide, Cyclopentasiloxane, Squalane, Trisiloxane, Dimethicone, PEG-3 Dimethicone, Allantoin, Magnesium Sulfate, Butylene Glycol, Isostearyl Glyceryl Ether, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Succinic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Bis-Methoxypropylamido Isodocosane, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Tocopherol, Methylparaben*\n\nIt does contain eucalyptus extract, which could contain some fragrant components, however it is low down on the ingredients list - just something to be aware of if you have very sensitive skin and tend to avoid all fragrant extracts and hydrosols.\n\nThe eucalyptus extract is [reported by the manufacturer KAO](https://web.kao.com/sg/curel/ceramide_care/) as being able to boost the skin's production of ceramides.\n\nIt contains a pseudoceramide (*Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide),* which tbh I trust more than improperly formulated ceramides, as well as allantoin, a great soothing ingredient at a concentration of 0.5%. Squalane and tocopherol as well as the classic humectant glycerin are also included. This does contain silicones, which is something to be mindful of, however my skin really enjoys the texture of silicone-containing products and the smoothing effect.\n\n**SCENT**\n\nAs one should expect, not much scent aside from a slight chemical-ish scent which disappears extremely quickly.\n\n**TEXTURE**\n\nThe texture of this is very light and fluffy, yet slightly wet. Not liquid at all, so it is very easy to scoop out from the packaging. On your skin, as you apply it it quickly sinks in very smoothly and feels invisible on the skin. Not sticky at all (yay!)\n\n**EXPERIENCE/EFFECTS**\n\nI have seen a massive difference in the plumpness and hydration since using this cream. My skin is so much plumper and less dehydrated. When I wake up in the morning, my skin feels smooth and soft, practically glowing. Honestly, I'm not sure I could wish for more in a moisturiser - it goes above and beyond to do the job and keep your skin hydrated.\n\nIt hasn't broken me out, irritated my skin OR clogged my pores (a win in my book!)\n\n**OVERALL THOUGHTS**\n\nHonestly, I couldn't rave about this moisturiser any more. My skin has never felt so good - I didn't even realise how dry and dehydrated my skin was until I started using this.\n\nI would probably suggest this to dry and normal skin types looking for good hydration but a light and elegant texture. This might work for combo skin in the colder/drier months as well.\n\nThis is definitely a HG product for me - I'm not sure what other moisturisers could top this, but maybe I'll try some more one day. \n\n**10/10 - I recommend this product if you want a light and fluffy texture, fragrance-free, very hydrating, overall plumping effect!**",

It's actually the same quantity and price (but I do wish this came in the same kind of packaging, so I'm going to get some little spatulas for the jar)\n\nI was also nervous about the eucalyptus extract, but am doing fine with it so far, and my skin is hyper-sensitive and extremely dry, so I am pleasantly surprised.  \nOn first used I felt a slight cooling sensation that made me a bit nervous too, but not it's just very soothing and feels fortifying, and has worked the best at preventing those flaky dry patches on my cheeks without causing irritation.

I am super happy and honored to be partnering with them to provide more reviews and potentially some giveaways on my social media. \n\nAnyway, all of that is to say that this product from I’m From is the first one that was sent to me from Wishtrend to test/review. They asked me to provide some information about my skin type, skin concerns, and skin goals…and recommend the I’m From Honey Serum based on my responses. So, let’s dig in!\n\nI’m From is a really interesting brand in that they seem to really focus on key ingredients and try to use those ingredients in as high of a concentration as they can in each product. Their Mugwort Essence for instance (I’m using it right now and spoilers…I’m loving it LOL) uses 100% Mugwort Extract…thats it. Other products like the Honey Mask use nearly 40% pure Honey. Really cool. \n\nThe Honey Serum takes a slightly different approach by using 30.63% of their “Honey Glow Queen Complex”. This is a combination of Honey Extract, Royal Jelly Extract, Propolis Extract, Bee Venom Extract, Turmeric Extract, Cinnamon Extract, and Pollen Extract. Honey seems to be the most abundant of these ingredients in the “complex” (which makes sense)…while the others fall pretty low on the ingredients list.\n\nWhen reading over the product description on the Wishtrend site I was excited for the possible hydrating, nourishing, and brightening effects of this serum (it also includes a super small amount of Vitamin C). However, I was concerned because my skin has historically not gotten along with propolis or honey in products. I don’t know if it was that my skin was too oily at the time or what, but throughout my skincare exploration I have tried several honey based sheet masks and a serum from Elensillia with 82% Propolis Extract that broke me out pretty significantly. \n\nOn top of that, silicone and I have had a love/hate relationship for quite some time. And this serum from I’m From…well it’s all about the silicones LOL! Before the honey and other “Honey Glow Queen” ingredients you will find Cyclopentasiloxane, Undecane, Tridecane, and 4 forms of Dimethicone in the formula. So I guess you could say that the “Silicone Complex” in the I’m From Honey Serum is more featured that the one focused around honey.\n\nTo me…this all sounded a little scary and like I was taking a pretty big risk. Two of the things that my skin has had a hard time handling in the past all crammed into one serum (and at high concentrations). I didn’t want my first “PR” experience with I’m From/Wishtrend to be a huge flop. But I pushed onward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7oqhhbuiazy41.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e92e771366c0b3f3bc5d1530551be8e04f772f5b\n\nI had seen photos and texture shots of the I’m From Honey Mask and was expecting the serum to be kind of the same. While this Honey Serum is quite thick/dense…it all has to do with those silicones. This product has an INCREDIBLY slippery and slide-ry (LOL) feel to it without being watery or runny. It reminds me a lot of a couple makeup primers I have tried on my hands over the years. Even though Glycerin and Water are the first two ingredients…there just isn’t much movement to this product without the assistance of fingers. I applied one pump to my hand while writing this to just get a quick visual…and after 10 minutes the dollop hadn’t really moved at all LOL!\n\nOnce massaged in...the I’m From Honey Serum really starts to shine (literally LOL). Much like other silicone based products I have used, this serum smooths out and glides so easily over the skin. Just one pump is enough for my big-ol face with some to spare. I found that I have a better time smoothing it out over skin that is sufficiently hydrated with toner/essence vs. dry however. Once on, the I’m From Honey Serum feels quite light and comfortable on my skin…almost like a veil or protective layer on top. Those with particularly oily skin may still find this to be a bit too much though.\n\nThe glow and radiance that this serum provides is really impressive. This is absolutely one of those products that has a near “makeup” effect in that the glow/slight sheen is immediate after one application and not something that needs to be used over the course of weeks or months to see the benefit from. Thanks silicones LOL! In addition to that initial result though, the silicones will help to lock in hydration from toners, essences, and sheet masks while the “Honey Glow Queen” Complex imparts nourishment, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory benefits. Kind of a one two punch that I have really come to love.\n\nOver time I’ve found that my skin seems to stay hydrated and dewy feeling/looking throughout the course of the day without relying too much on facial mists or other hydrators. I have also been able to get away with using a lighter day moisturizer as the I’m From Honey Serum really acts like a moisture locking product. The product also has this honey, sweet, and slightly powdery/floral scent that I really ended up liking.\n\nAt the end of the day…I’m kind of surprised by how much I like this serum from I’m From. I didn’t see any adverse reaction to the propolis and the silicones were actually a plus for me. They really helped to lock in the hydration from my toner and essence which I really needed as I transition into using Tretinoin/Curology…my skin has been D-R-Y! The immediate glow and dewy finish is also really nice. I could see this being a great product to use under makeup for certain looks.\n\nThose that have dry skin (or are experiencing temporary dry skin) will really appreciate this serum either as a separate step or to mix a bit with a current moisturizer to amp up the moisture locking properties. For those with more oily/combination skin…proceed with a bit of caution as this might be a little too heavy or feel “stifling” on the skin. I would suggest using maybe a half pump right after toner/essence to aid in as much absorption as possible. Then, graduate up as you see fit.\n\nPersonally, I will be retiring the rest of my bottle for the summer months to re-introduce it in the fall/as things cool back down. I have always been on the oily/combination side of things…but I anticipate that as my skin adjusts to the Tretinoin and the weather heats up I will become the oily/sweaty mess that I am from June-September LOL! I think the I’m From Honey Serum will be a little too heavy for me at that point.\n\nThe I’m From Honey Serum changed my mind about propolis/honey for sure (I already have several other propolis and honey based products on their way to me LOL)…but more importantly it confirmed what a lot of bloggers, skincare experts, and dermatologists have been saying recently (or all along I suppose). Silicones aren’t as comedogenic and evil as they have been made out to be…at least not for everyone. Formulation/trial and error are key and I think I’m From did a great job with this serum. I was certainly swayed early on by the marketing of brands like Drunk Elephant. But now, I feel more comfortable and confident in approaching skincare products with silicones now…which I think will be helpful in my quest to hold hydration to my skin. YAY!\n\nThings To Note:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* While I think The I’m From Honey Serum is a great addition to a moisturizer…I don’t know if it has enough hydrators to be a stand in FOR a moisturizer LOL! It’s missing some watery hydrators like Sodium Hyaluronate to really do a “complete job” it seems. In fact, it might be the perfect companion to the Krave Beauty Oat So Simple Water Cream LOL! That moisturizer is lacking the ingredients to hold moisture to the skin (in my opinion). I may have to repurchase that one to mix with the I’m From Honey Serum in the fall to see if I can make the “perfect” moisturizer for me! \n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nGlycerin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Niacinamide, PEG/ PPG- 18/18 Dimethicone, Undecane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Tridecane, 1,2- Hexanediol, Sodium Chloride, Dimethicone/ Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, PEG-10 Dimethicone, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Boswellia Serrata Resin Extract, Honey Extract, Adenosine, Cinnamomum Cassia Bark Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Levan, Decyl Glucoside, Olea Europaea (Olive) Leaf Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium EDTA, Pollen Extract, Phenethyl Alcohol, Ziziphus Jujuba Seed, Centella Asiatica Extract, Royal Jelly Extract, Propolis Extract, Bee Venom, Citric Acid, Ascorbic Acid, Madecassoside, Fragrance, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Geraniol, Limonene, Citral\n\nWhere To Buy: This product can be picked up on Wishtrend, Amazon, and various other K-Beauty retailers. Since I did mention that I was gifted this product…I’d rather not include a link to avoid confusion/suspicion around affiliated links or commissions. A quick Goggle search should bring up a whole bunch of places where you can grab this serum!",

It’s gel texture is almost aloe-like. This means that if you apply just the right amount, it sinks in without any residue on top of the skin. But if you apply too much, it just feels like a slab of aloe on the skin. Since it’s not moisturising or occlusive in any way, this just made it hard to apply a large amount to get maximum hydration.\n\nI ended up using most of it on my body since it kinda has a cooling effect from it’s gel texture.",

    "body": "My skin type is acne prone and oily, and I am allergic to silicones. I can vouch for this makeup base and claim that it really calms forming acne/pimple and zits. Although it contains Cyclopentasiloxane, it does not bother my skin since it's a volatile silicone that evaporates into thin air upon skin contact. Anyway, I suffered from acne for 2 years util I cleared my skin just this year. Now, I can wear makeup again without any problems. One thing I learned is to be aware of the ingredients that may exacerbate your acne and know the ingredients that are actually beneficial for your skin. I discovered this tension pact (others call this cushion) in the Asian Beauty Community and it was also recommended by Ivan Lam on youtube who has also an acne-prone skin. I took the risk and bought it because although I don't have any acne anymore, I still have redness and PIEs. This is my second makeup base to try after clearing my skin and I am loving it so much that I can call it my HG. First one was Maybelline Dream Satin Skin Liquid Foundation and it broke me out because Dimethicone is high up above the list of its ingredients.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\nAccording to cosDNA, its first ingredient is Centella Asiatica Extract aka Tiger Grass which is a healing herb for wounds. This is the reason why any forming pimple/acne or zits will shy away immediately. Another good thing about this tension pact is, it has Titanium Dioxide as its second ingredient and Zinc Oxide which are great physical sunscreens. Cyclopentasiloxane is on 5th place and Dimethicone on 7th place but it does not bother my skin at all. Again, I have a very acne-prone skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SCENT**\n\nThis is my first Asian makeup product to try so I am not sure if this is a common scent. It smells fresh like a green plant. I love it, it has a calming effect on me. It makes me feel safe lol. It gives an impression that the ingredients are clean. I believe it does not have any synthetic fragrance. Watch Ivan Lam on YT if you like skincare products that are fragrance-free and alcohol free.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SHADES**\n\nJust like most of the Asian brands, it has a very minimal selection of shades and in this case only 2 shades: #21 and #23. I am a medium fair Asian so their darkest shade which is #23 looks okay on me. I have to extend the application way down my neck just because I'm scared to look like a clown but I noticed that it blends on my skin tone after some time. If you have a deeper skin tone, try COSRX Clear Fit Blemish Cushion #27. I saw this girl made a review on it. *(SEARCH on YT: Celia Leslie first impressions: cosrx clear fit blemish cushion #27 deep beige).* It matches her skin really well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**COVERAGE**\n\nIt has a medium to full coverage. One dab of applicator covers my whole face full of PIEs and red marks. I can layer the application twice or thrice depending on what I need. I haven't tried it while having an active acne so I can't speak for those who are still in the healing process.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's really a HG product for acne prone skin who still wants to wear makeup. It's very affordable and it has a refill unlike the CosRx one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can buy it here if you're in US/Canada: stylekorean.com/shop/a-pieu-wonder-tension-pact-made-cassoside-23/1496640967/\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can buy it here if you're in The Philippines: shopee.ph/APIEU-Wonder-Tension-Pact-Madecassoside-13g-i.122319.520419370",

I was hoping to buy Missha's eversince i watched Liah Yoo raved about it. I cant find it anywhere online though. Alam mo na ang hirap maghanap dito sa atin\n\nAnyway I heard APIEU is one of the most popular tension pact out there and i was really excited to try this kind of foundation so i bought this as liah recommends this also naman. \n\nThis is also my second base makeup. My first and the only one i tried ever since i cleared my acne is Missha in shade 27. This one is in 23 so i was scared to try this but i was surprised - it looked natural on my skin. I really liked that it made my pores (which are my main issues) smaller. \n\nYes it made my pimple heal faster! Its really wonderful. Usually i cant stop it when theres pimple in my nose area. Nose has a different skin. But i noticed it will be gone after a day. Like shrink as if its shying away. It never came to me that it was because of the A'pieu. Thank you for this review.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find a lot of reviews on this specific moisturizing cream, so I just finished up a tub of it and thought I'd share my experience with you guys!\n\n**My Skin Type/Climate:** Normal to Dry and not sensitive. Closed Comedones around my forehead and occasionally in my jaw area. Blackheads around my nose area. Northeast Coast US. I'm in the army, so I frequently travel to other climates. \n\n**Product Info:** This is the Moisture Cream by Laneige from the Water Bank line. It comes in a little blue tub, looks like [this](http://www.laneige.com/sg/en/product/skincare/line/view.water-bank-moisture-cream.water_bank.html). It's 50ml and I bought it while I was in Myeongdong from the Laneige store they have set up over in Seoul. It's $32 on [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/Laneige-Water-Moisture-Cream-Ounce/dp/B007O602CE/ref=pd_sim_121_2?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B007O602CE&pd_rd_r=2ZVSG33NKSHGVRP2TZ1A&pd_rd_w=5HE2M&pd_rd_wg=Gj0QQ&psc=1&refRID=2ZVSG33NKSHGVRP2TZ1A) and $32 on [Target](http://www.target.com/p/laneige-water-bank-moisture-cream-50-ml/-/A-14897250). This product is marketed towards Normal to Dry skin types.\n\n**Ingredients:** I just copied and pasted this from Laneige's website, but I'm putting it in here to save you a trip:\n> Purified water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Dimethicone, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane,  Dicaprylyl Ether, Cyclopentasiloxane, Sucrose Polystearate, Cyclohexasiloxane ,  Glyceryl Stearate, Urea, Quinoa seed extract, Glasswort extract, Magnesium Sulfate, Manganese Sulfate, Calcium chloride, Zinc sulfate,  Sodium Hyaluronate , Meadowfoam Seed Oil, Copper tripeptide -1, Ceramide 3, Phytosphingosine , Niacinamide, Myristyl Myristate, Glyceryl Yaounde Silinate, Acetylglucosamine, Cetearyl alcohol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Tocopherol, Propanediol, Stearic Acid, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Xanthan Gum, Trisiloxane, Palmitic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Propylene Glycol, PEG-100 Stearate, Acrylate/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, PEG-5 rapeseed sterol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Tromethamine, Disodium EDTA,  Glyceryl Caprylate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Herbs\n\n**My Experience:** I used the product on and off(occasionally I left it at home because I forgot to take it with me when I went to work) since September. I'm sure if I used it more religiously it would probably only have lasted me a month or two max. The cream does have a scent. I would describe it as a sort of floral, fruity scent almost like fresh laundry. I find that it dissipates really fast, so I have no problems wearing any other scented products and the smells mixing. Although, I may just be used to the smell after a few minutes, so I would definitely take that into consideration if smells bother you. I would describe this cream as a medium to light moisturizing cream and I find that a little goes a long way. Every time I use it without forgetting it I find that my skin and face feels plumper and refreshed. I do notice it feels a little sticky(emphasis on little) upon first applying it, but I throw on sunscreen and then makeup on most days so it doesn't last.\n\n**My Routine:** Following the format of similar posts on here, here's the table: RP: Will Repurchase again, HG: Holy Grail; I loved it. WRP: Will not repurchase.\n\n**Morning**\n\n* Kojic Soap(Might Repurchase again)\n* Cosrx Galactomyces 95 Whitening Power Essence (RP)\n* MIZON Snail Repair Intensive Ampoule (RP)\n* Laneige - Water Bank Moisture Cream (RP)\n* Biore UV Aqua Rich Smooth Watery Gel (HG)\n\n**Night**\n\n* Skin Food Black Sugar Perfect Cleansing Oil (RP)\n* Kojic Soap(Might Repurchase again) or Boscia Detoxifying Black Cleanser(Testing)\n* OST Vitamin C 20 Serum (HG)\n* Cosrx Bha Blackhead Power Liquid (Testing)\n* Cosrx AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid (Testing)\n* Cosrx Galactomyces 95 Whitening Power Essence (RP)\n* MIZON Snail Repair Intensive Ampoule (RP)\n* Laneige - Water Bank Moisture Cream (RP)\n* Laneige - Water Sleeping Mask (WRP)\n\n**Substitutions:** I'll give an honorable mention to Cerave Moisturizing Lotion because I think that it's a great substitution for this product. I find them both to be really similarly hydrating. Some notable differences between the two: Cerave is fragrance-free and cheaper, but I didn't feel like my face was as plump and dewy as it did with the Laneige Water Bank Moisture Cream.\n\n**Conclusion:** Now I that I'm looking into my empty tub I think that there's a high chance that I would buy it again, but I'd like to try out other moisturizers before definitely buying it because I do think it's quite expensive for a moisturizer. The packaging looks really nice, it lasted me for quite a while, and I found it to be a great step for a more dewy and plump finish for my skin. Anyways, I hope this was of some help to you guys. I'm not a seasoned reviewer, but I thought it might be useful for some of you who are thinking of trying this product out. Feel free to ask any questions and I'll try to get back to you asap. :)",

    "body": "Hi! So I am by no means a doctor or scientist, but I did some quick research today and found really interesting information about Mizon Snail Recovery Gel Cream.\nThis was the first face cream I ever bought when I got started with AB and it was love at first sight (first application?). I really like the consistency of a gel cream and I personally feel like it is less sticky/thick than a traditional lotion. I've always been happy with this product and have bought it multiple times. Plus it can be found on amazon with 2 day prime shipping! :D\n\nNow on to the interesting stuff. I scar easily and currently have a wound/forming scar on my arm that I have been applying a vitamin C serum and the face gel to. So far it seems like the scarring is already fading and the cut is healing much better that if I left it alone. My boyfriend, knowing I scar easily, sent me a link to a product called NewGel plus. It is a scar cream and the website has amazing before and after results, so I was curious about what the ingredients are. The main ingredient is called polydimethylsiloxane, it is a type of siloxane (or silicone oil). Curiosity got the best of me and I wonder if the Mizon Face Gel was similar in composition. What I found was that one of the top ingredients in the face gel is cyclopentasiloxane; it is also a siloxane and more specifically it is a dimethyl polysiloxane. (so pretty much the same thing in the scar gel)\n\nI just thought that this was really interesting. The gel is called a \"recovery\" gel but I honestly just thought that was for marketing purposes, but it seems to be a little bit more creditable now! I've noticed that when I'm using this cream, any dark spots I get from acne fade really quickly.\n\nLike I said before I'm not a doctor or scientist so I'm not guaranteeing anything, but I'd recommend this to anyone trying to fade dark scar spots (probably not raised scaring, sorry).\n\nDoes anyone use this cream and have you had similar results?",

My cheeks, jawline, forehead, and nose are completely untouched. Is there a reason why this product, which I apply all over, would only cause breakouts in one area of my face? Or should I look for another culprit? I have since stopped using the BB Cream (which sucks because I really loved it) and I think my skin is slowly starting to clear up. Only other products I introduced around the same time are micellar water (which I'm still using to take off makeup, followed immediately by my normal face wash) and my Rimmel Stay Matte pressed powder, which I decided to give another go (have since stopped)...a bit suspicious of this as well because the lid had cracked so it is only sealed with the help of tape.

    "body": "I’m From Mugwort Cream\n\nThe mugwort line from I’m From features some of my favorite soothing/calming products. Artemisia/mugwort is known for its ability to bring down redness and inflammation...and I’m From’s offerings contain some of the higher percentages of the ingredient that I have seen.\n\nTheir Mugwort Cream contains 73.55% mugwort extract alongside shea butter, father david elm extract, and fermented soybean/cogon grass extracts. The entire formulation reads like an herbal remedy that I imagine being concocted at an apothecary.\n\nAs for the consistency/texture...I was quite surprised. The cream has a lightweight look and nearly gel-like feel when first applied. But, once it’s gotten a chance to absorb there is a bit more of an occlusive feel and even slight residue left behind (which might not be ideal for those with oily skin that prefer really watery hydrators).\n\nHowever, it ended up being the lack of immediate calming/soothing that made this product a bit less impressive than the rest of the I’m From Mugwort products.\n\nWhile I did see an improvement to redness and irritation over the course of the past month...there wasn’t that immediate hit of redness reduction that I appreciated in the other products. I could always turn to the I’m From Mugwort Essence to bring my skin back from the brink when adjusting to Tretinoin or after being in the sun too long. \n\nThe I’m From Mugwort Cream just doesn’t seem to have that “triage” ability that I was hoping to see. The amount of hydration and moisture-locking ability is really nice though. Dry/normal skin that experiences redness or sensitivity might get along well with this product...but there might be a slower build to visible calming results. \n\nFull Ingredients List: Artemisia Princeps Extract, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Glycerin, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Stearic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Butylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Arachidyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Flower Extract, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, C14-28 Alkyl Acid, Stearyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-2 Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate, Panthenol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Allatoin, Boswellia Serrata Resin Extract, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/ VP Copolymer, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/ Sodium Acryloydimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Dimethiconol, Saccharamyces/ Viscum Album (Misletoe) Ferment Extract, Lactobacillus/ Soybean Ferment Extract, Saccharomyces/ Viscum Album (Misletoe) Ferment Extract, Lactobacillus/ Soybean Ferment Extract, Saccharomyces/ Imperata Cylindrica Root Ferment Extract, Disodium EDTA, Polyglutamic Acid, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Artemisia Vulgaris Oil\n\nWhere To Buy ($32.00 USD - Wishtrend - 50ml): [https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/mugwort-cream/](https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/mugwort-cream/) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gej52o8uhrq51.jpg?width=4707&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69c33d2c3502651329ebd0b47e18a465bf9de2d1",

    "body": "Skin type: dehydrated, eczema-prone, acne-prone\n\nLocation: Toronto, Canada (i.e. I can't access some USA-only type moisturizers)\n\nHi everyone!\n\nSo I've started my journey in Jan 2019 attempting to find the best moisturizer w/ HA (along with a HG sunscreen), and have used the following products:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*NOTE: YMMV - this obviously details my own personal experiences w/ the products below :)*\n\n**1) Cetaphil - Daily Hydrating Lotion w/ Hyaluronic Acid**\n\nIngredients: Water, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Cyclopentasiloxane, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Homarine HCI, Sodium PCA, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Erythritol\n\nThis is the best moisturizer I've used; the -1 in the rating is that I use it up too fast! I use three pumps (2 on the face, 1 on the neck) AM and PM. As its consistency is more lotion and watery-like than that of a heavy cream, the bottle is tiny at 88 mL and runs out quickly. I've used up 2 bottles of this in 4-5 months or so (so a bottle per 2 months, and its pricey at that too!). It doesn't break me out, applies like silk and actually gives me lasting moisture. I think it's more because of its hydroxy urea moreso than the HA, tbh, because my Hada Labo premium outperforms TO's HA serum also; and it contains the same urea ingredient. BUT due to the price, I'm not sure if I will buy again... in the event no other moisturizers in the future work as well though then I will resort to this lol\n\nRating: 9/10 (-1 Price)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2) The Ordinary - Natural Moisturizing Factors w/ Hyaluronic Acid**\n\nIngredients: Aqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Stearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Arginine, Aspartic Acid, Glycine, Alanine, Serine, Valine, Isoleucine, Proline, Threonine, Histidine, Phenylalanine, Glucose, Maltose, Fructose, Trehalose, Sodium PCA, PCA, Sodium Lactate, Urea, Allantoin, Linoleic Acid, Oleic Acid, Phytosteryl Canola Glycerides, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Lecithin, Triolein, Tocopherol, Carbomer, Isoceteth-20, Polysorbate 60, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Pentylene Glycol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.\n\nI really wanted to love this, I really do, because I've been attempting to put out an all-DECIEM based routine to save up on my budget and support a Canadian company at the same time. But this moisturizer, given its universal praise isn't cutting it! Lack of silicones in it usually end up with me contracting eczema at the end of the day. Also, heads up - I can't tolerate oils at all because I'm prone to sebborhea, eczema AND acne (I can only use jojoba oil and squalane) - so I really feel the oiliness of this product, despite being oil-free. I think it's because of the oleic and linoleic acids in the product which is basically what oils are comprised of.  To add, it feels tacky on my skin, and the packaging format isn't too nice as i have to squeeze hard for the product to come out. The price is great though, so I didn't waste my money on it. I don't think it breaks me out particularly so I'll still try to use up the entire 100mL of it :p\n\nRating: 7/10 (-1 tacky feeling, -1 oily feeling, -1 no silicones)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3) CeraVe AM Lotion w/ SPF30**\n\nMed. Ingredients: Homosalate 10.00%, Menthyl Anthranilate (Meradimate) 5.00%, Octinoxate (Ethylhexyl, Methoxycinnamate) 5.00%, Octocrylene 2.00%, Zinc Oxide 6.3%.Other Ingredients: Water, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Behentrimonium Methosulphate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Ceramide AP , Ceramide NP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Disodium EDTA, Glycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Methylparaben, Niacinamide, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Xanthan Gum\n\nOkay this sucks big time. It clogged ALL my pores, literally and I had to take a week course doxycycline to clear it up a bit. It also left my face a greasy mess. But it does moisturize well so I'm planning on using it up on my neck and hands, lol 😂 Also, there was a very informed post of ceramides in CeraVe not really doing anything so there's that too. Will definitely NOT be buying again.\n\nRating: 4/10 (-5 100% pore-clogging, -1 greasy face)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4) CeraVe PM Lotion**\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Ceramide NP, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Disodium EDTA, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n\nThis one sucks too, but it doesn't clog my pores as much as the AM variant. I've been using this on and off because I just hate the greasy feeling it leaves my skin, and I'm not really sure if its the main culprit clogging my pores yet (I just started using it last month on and off). I also kind of itch a bit after using it. It's definitely not a silky smooth application feeling as I had when I used the Cetaphil moisturizer. Will not be buying again.\n\nRating: 6/10 (-3 may be pore clogging , -1 greasy face)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo in short, I still did not find my HG Moisturizer, unfortunately. I'll be looking into the following products now:\n\n**5) Eucerin Replenishing Face Cream w/ 5% Urea** \\- Due to my success with products containing the hydroxy derivative, and its wonderful reviews I'm dying to try this. I just ordered a tube off of [well.ca](https://well.ca), and hope it works out. I'll be using this after I use up the CeraVe PM or discontinue it lol. I have very high expectations of this, and hope this will end my quest to find my perfect moisturizer  😭\n\n**6) CeraVe SPF 30 Ultra Light Moisturizer** \\- Despite my bad track record with CeraVe, I've heard great things about this version of their sunscreen+moisturizer hybrid, and I still am looking for my HG sunscreen.\n\n**7) Hada Labo Perfect Gel** \\- This thing has squalane, hydroxy urea AND HA. Seems too good to be true, but the Premium Lotion already is a HG for my skin. The problem is, it's an Asian product so I need to buy in bulk online for that free shipping or risk getting a counterfeit product off of Amazon (and I don't like buying off of Amazon due to its treatment of its workers anyways).\n\n**8) Neutrogena Extra Dry Hydro Boost Moisturizer** \\- I'm not sure about this one because HA is the 4th last ingredient, and is listed well after the phenoxyethanol (which is 1% I believe) meaning that the HA % of this is less than 1%. Butttt enough ppl are raving about it for me to notice it  😅 so I'll give this a shot if the other ones don't end up being my HG.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd that's that! If anyone has any experiences regarding the products above (especially the ones I want to try in the future) please let me know :)!",

Every shadow? Etc.*\n\nYes, there is a SPREADSHEET that lists every shade name of every product (it's up to date to the best of my knowledge) that is maintained by ME.

Pretty much anything that ends in -icone or -siloxane is a silicone.\n\n\n\nMy sensitivity seems to be dimethicone in particular, with other silicones causing milder reactions. I have been completely silicone free for over a year and my skin has never been better. I used to have cystic acne on my jaw line, 3 or 4 cysts that just never went away (like seriously all through my 20s). Once I stopped using silicone based products, my skin cleared up immediately. I haven't had any breakouts since I changed my routine to be silicone free, and reading labels is like second nature now. The truly htf silicone free products seem to be foundation, moisturizer and primer but they are out there. (If you need any product recs just shot me a message, I am happy to help).",

I still went through a purge when I switched despite using tretinoin for the past couple years.  I don't feel it works as well for my acne.  I'm finishing up a huge pump of it and then will likely switch back to tretinoin.\n* The Ordinary azelaic acid 10% (x7) - I prefer the 20% prescription cream, but this is cheap and easily available so I keep using it.\n* Urban Decay Naked color correcting fluid (pink) - I am using up a second one, and then want to try something else\n* Real Techniques expert face brush - now sheds horribly when cleaning it.  Will keep buying RT brushes.\n* Covergirl clump crusher mascara\n* Covergirl clump crusher water resistant mascara - WRP\n* Tarte Lights, Camera, Lashes mascara - WRP if on sale\n* Anastasia Bevery Hills clear brow gel (x2) - WRP\n* Smashbox primer water mini - WNRP, using up a larger bottle then I am done with sprays, don't need them\n* EltaMD UV clear broad spectrum SPF 46 - WNRP, too expensive, cyclopentasiloxane high on ingredient list which I am trying to avoid\n* Sun Bum Face SPF 50 - burns in my eyes so not good for sweating/water.  I will probably repurchase to have around though since it's easily available and a good price\n* Purito Centella green level unscented SPF - a bit too shiny for me.  WNRP.\n* Purito Comfy Water SPF - I really like the consistency/finish but WNRP due to concerns about Purito SPF claims.  It does pill if you try to apply makeup immediately afterward or don't rub it in well.\n* Rosasea Care for sensitive skin mild oatmeal face cleanser\n* Clinique rinse off eye makeup solvent - WNRP, I don't need a dedicated eye make up remover since I use cleansing balms.\n* The Ordinary squalane cleanser - WNRP, doesn't emulsify well for me or remove mascara very well\n* Drunk Elephant Beste No. 9 jelly cleanser mini\n* Good Molecules Instant cleansing balm - This would be my favorite if it was unscented.  The most effective one I have found for a decent price.\n* Clinique Take the Day Off cleansing balm - I would repurchase if on sale\n* Aveeno daily moisturizing lotion\n* Cerave moisturizing cream mini (x3) and tub (12oz)\n* Clinique All About Eyes rich - I didn't repurchase any eye creams this year and not sure how I feel about them anymore.\n* Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser - good second cleanser when you want something that foams.\n* Neutrogena ultra gentle hydrating cleanser - creamy.  Really like this one as a gentle second cleanser.\n* Simple water boost micellar facial gel wash - this one is great on its own for light makeup or sunscreen only days, but I generally use it as a second cleanse.",

And Reddit came through!\n\nI gathered several things to try, and figured I’d start doing follow ups on my experiments to find a way to wear makeup again.\n\nOriginal post for products I am testing can be found here: [Testing, testing, 1.. 2.. 3..](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rosacea/comments/zht0jn/testing_testing_1_2_3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nFor reference: I’m 38F, sensitive oily/dehydrated skin type, mild hyperpigmentation from old acne scars, Type 1 & 2 rosacea\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nGlossier Perfecting Skin Tint (in shade G10)\n\nIngredients: \n\nDiamond Powder Gives a brightening and blurring effect, while minimizing the appearance of pores.\n\nGlycerin Helps skin attract and retain moisture\n\nFull list:\nAqua/Water/Eau, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Dimer Dilinoleyl Dimer Dilinoleate, PEG-10 Dimethicone, Glycerin, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Alcohol, Dimethicone, Mica, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Chloride, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Chlorphenesin, Propylene Carbonate, Boron Nitride, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Zea Mays (Corn) Oil, Diamond Powder, Quercus Suber Bark Extract. May Contain/Peut Contenir (±): CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide), CI 77491, CI 77492, CI 77499 (Iron Oxides)\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nInitial impressions \n1. It’s very sheer - which can be good and bad depending on the level of redness I’m dealing with\n2. It goes on super easily.  I just use my fingers. I didn’t need a sponge or brush to blend it in\n3. Not great for oily skin - it’s very dewy and doesn’t dry down all the way on my skin \n\nTrials\n1. Wearing it solo just over top of my skin care and sunscreen products, I don’t like it. My skin looked fantastic for a few short hours in the beginning of the day. But I looked greasy by lunch time. The products was sliding off my face and it’s VERY transfer prone and rubs off\n2. I tried it wearing a primer under it and setting powder over it: improved wear. I used Fenty Pro Filt’r primer (my face burned after applying this… unsure yet if it’s actually the primer or if my skin barrier is slightly off… I’ll be testing this primer again later), and my tried and true Laura Mercier translucent setting powder on top. My skin was beautifully matte for hours, but lunch there was a natural finish, and by dinner time I had a dewy glow. I didn’t have any issues with the skin tint sliding off my face or breaking down. And didn’t notice it rubbing off on my coat or my fingers if I touched my face.\n\nIt did not cover my redness. It did diffuse it and give me a nice glow. More diffusion with the setting powder on top.\n\nAll in all - I’ll try this with a different primer and maybe a setting spray before I give up on it. I think this would be great for someone with dry to normal skin that doesn’t have a lot of redness or texture to conceal. It’s too sheer to really cover much.",

Niacinamide is known to help hyperpigmentation from acne scars and overall skincell turnover.\n\nIn my experience most asian skincare that has whitening or brightening in their description refers to skincell turnover rather than bleaching. The ones that actually bleach would use that in the description (ie bleaching soaps).\n\nI think the ingredient to look out for if you're concerned about bleaching would be hydroquinone.

Yes, that's how strong the fragrance is.\n\n**Texture:** A light milky, runny lotion\n\n**Experiance:** The lotion does what it claims to be - Brightening. I notice a mild brightness on my face after its application, so I preferred to apply it in my AM routine. Here's the problem that I faced:\n\nOn application, my skin felt a bit clogged & sweaty. I hardly used 1-2 pumps, and yet there used to be mild sweat after I applied. I blame this due to this summer heat, that kinda ends up melting anything that I apply on my face. The product doesn't absorb smoothly on your skin, leading it to feel this way. \n\nHowever, one fine day, the atmosphere was a bit colder, the sun wasn't as cruel as it usually is, so I tried the product again. My skin felt okay. Had the same Brightening effect, but didn't feel sticky. So I've decided to store this and use it when monsoon starts. \n\nIt's a good product, and comes in sufficient quantity, but not recommended for this hot weather. \n\n**WRP:** Not really. I'd look for cheaper alternatives \n\nIf you're expecting hydration from a moisturizer, i wouldn't recommend this.",

    "body": "Hi guys,\n\nI figured there might be some people interested in this as well. I've been enjoying the BHA liquid exfoliant from Paula's Choice which is a bestseller and loved by many on this sub. I noticed they have different formulations of BHA and I've recently gained more interest in antioxidants in skincare. So I compiled a list of all their BHA's to figure out what the difference is. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR :All their exfoliants are nearly the same price, however some of their products contain more ingredients that might be a good addition to your skincare regime, specifically antioxidants and hydrators/skin soothers. HOWEVER, a lot of people who use BHA like to have a product that is not heavy and doesn't add to their oil production. In that case, not all of their products might be suitable for your skin type, even though they contain added antioxidants. \n\nNote: I have not tested any of these products apart of the liquid exfoliant so I can't comment on the consistency but I can make an estimation based on the ingredients.\n\n**Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant**Only contains green tea as an antioxidant and only two hydrators: methylpropanediol and butylene glycol. This consistency is probably the lightest.\n\n**Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Gel Exfoliant**Contains grape fruit extract, green tea and willow herb as antioxidants and only the 2 same hydrators as the liquid. Has added bisabolol (derived from camomile) which is skin soothing. Has a gel texture so might still be suitable for those who want a light consistency like the liquid but added antioxidants.\n\n**Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Lotion Exfoliant**Contains green tea, licorice root extract, oat bran extract and willow herb as antioxidants. Also only contains the two hydrators mentioned above and has added allantoin which is skin soothing and repairing, so is the oat extract. Might be a little heavier than the two above.\n\n**Resist Anti-Aging 2% BHA Exfoliant**Has many added hydrators so might be best suit for dryer skin types which don't tolerate BHA as well. Has nordihydroguaiaretic acid added as the only antioxidant.\n\n**Clear Extra Strength 2% BHA Exfoliant**Again only contains the two hydrators mentioned in the description of the liquid. Only contains green tea as an antioxidant so doesn't seem much different to the liquid to me.\n\n**Clear Regular Strength 2% BHA Exfoliant**Contains many added hydrators and no antioxidants. So my bet would be if you're looking for a more moisturizing BHA go for the resist anti age. This one is a little bit cheaper tho...\n\n**Calm 1% BHA Exfoliant**Lower percentage of BHA and many added hydrators. Contains green tea, licorice root extract, oat bran extract, and willow herb as antioxidants. Also contains allantoin. If you're not sensitive I would choose the lotion mentioned above over this one as it has a similar ingredient list but higher percentage of the active ingredient.\n\nMore detailed summary of the products:\n\n**Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant**\n\nPrice: €36\n\nActive ingredient\n\n* 2% salicylic acid\n\nHydrators\n\n* Methylpropanediol (hydration)\n* Butylene Glycol (hydration)\n\nAntioxidants\n\n* Camellia Oleifera (Green Tea) Leaf Extract (skin calming/antioxidant)\n\n**Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Gel Exfoliant**\n\nPrice: €36\n\nActive ingredient\n\n* 2% salicylic acid\n\nHydrators\n\n* Methylpropanediol (hydration)\n* Butylene Glycol (hydration)\n* Bisabolol (skin-soothing)\n\nAntioxidants\n\n* Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Fruit Extract (antioxidant)\n* Camellia Oleifera (Green Tea) Leaf Extract (antioxidant)\n* Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (skin-soothing)\n\n**Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Lotion Exfoliant**\n\nPrice: €36\n\nActive ingredient\n\n* 2% salicylic acid\n\nHydrators\n\n* Butylene Glycol (hydration)\n* Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration)\n* Allantoin (skin-soothing)\n\nAntioxidants\n\n* Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract (antioxidant)\n* Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (plant-based antioxidant soothing agent)\n* Avena Sativa (Oat) Bran Extract (plant-based antioxidant soothing agent)\n* Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (plant-based antioxidant soothing agent)\n\n**Resist Anti-Aging 2% BHA Exfoliant**\n\nPrice: €38\n\nActive ingredient\n\n* 2% salicylic acid\n\nHydrators\n\n* Dipropylene Glycol (hydration)\n* Pentylene Glycol (hydration)\n* Butylene Glycol (hydration)\n* Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1 (skin-restoring)\n* Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7 (skin-restoring)\n* Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing)\n* Oleanolic Acid (skin-soothing)\n* etanorulayH muidoS (hydration/skin replenishing)\n* Allantoin (skin-soothing), Trehalose (hydration/skin replenishing), Panthenol (skin-conditioning agent)\n* Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing)\n* Methyl Gluceth-20 (hydration/texture-enhancing)\n* Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane (hydration/texture-enhancing)\n* Glycereth-26 (emollient texture-enhancing)\n* Caprylyl Glycol (skin-conditioning agent)\n\nAntioxidants\n\n* Nordihydroguaiaretic Acid (antioxidant)\n\n**Clear Extra Strength 2% BHA Exfoliant**\n\nPrice: €36\n\nActive ingredient\n\n* 2% salicylic acid\n\nHydrators\n\n* Methylpropanediol (hydration)\n* Butylene Glycol (hydration)\n\nAntioxidants\n\n* Camellia Oleifera (Green Tea) Leaf Extract (skin-soothing/antioxidant)\n\n**Clear Regular Strength 2% BHA Exfoliant**\n\nPrice: €34\n\nActive ingredient\n\n* 2% salicylic acid\n\nHydrators\n\n* Dipropylene Glycol (hydration)\n* Pentylene Glycol (hydration)\n* Butylene Glycol (hydration)\n* Glycerin (skin replenishing)\n* etanorulayH muidoS (hydration/skin replenishing)\n* Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing)\n* Allantoin (skin-soothing)\n* Panthenol (hydration)\n* Methyl Gluceth-20 (hydration)\n* Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane (hydration)\n\nAntioxidants\n\n* None\n\n**Calm 1% BHA Exfoliant**\n\nActive ingredient\n\n* 1% salicylic acid\n\nHydrators\n\n* Butylene Glycol (hydration)\n* Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration)\n* Dimethicone (hydration)\n* Allantoin (skin-soothing)\n* Lauric Acid (skin-replenishing)\n* Glycerin (skin-replenishing)\n* Hexylene Glycol (hydration)\n* Ethylhexylglycerin (skin-conditioning agent)\n\nAntioxidants\n\n* Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract (skin-soothing/antioxidant)\n* Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing)\n* Avena Sativa (Oat) Bran Extract (skin-soothing)\n* Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (skin-soothing)",

It has a slightly higher PH which makes it less irritating, has more soothing ingredients than Skin Perfecting, and it dries down matte with a less slippery texture. Also, the bottle comes with a nicer cap that's more convenient to open.",

    "body": "Thought I'd review this since I wasn't able to find many reviews online!\n\n**Purpose of purchase:** I wanted a larger size, cheap sunscreen for daily application during non-hot seasons and indoors. And I was running out of my Biore Watery Gel. So I bought the [MISSHA All Around Safe Block Total Moisture Sun Gel](http://missha.ee/en/catalog#!73/products/497) after seeing it mentioned in a comment here that it was 250 ml, biggest Asian sunscreen size I've seen. I generally prefer a higher spf, but I figure SPF 30/PA+++ is fine for when I'm only going to be in the car for short periods or in a building. I'm in Canada and work in Healthcare so sometimes I don't see the sun before or after work anyway. :|\n\n**Purchase:** On [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/MISSHA-Around-Block-Total-Moisture/dp/B014FE4XWM), from Jolse. Packaging was great, lots of bubble wrap in a box, took 28 days to arrive.\n\n**Ingredients:** ([CosDNA link](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_1c09208285.html), though I'm lucky that my skin doesn't react to much so I wasn't too concerned.)\n\nWater, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butylene Glycol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Alcohol Denat., Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Glycerin, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Behenyl Alcohol, Silica, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Carbomer, Caprylyl Glycol, Fragrance(Parfum), Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Myristyl Myristate, Brassica Campestris (Rapeseed) Sprout Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Rosa Davurica Bud Extract, Juniperus Communis Sprout Extract, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Palmitate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Limonia Acidissima Extract.\n\n**Previously used:** Biore Watery Gel, Shiseido Senka, and Biore Face Milk. Never tried the Watery Essence, figured I'd be fine with the gel since it was cheaper. In the morning during the winter, I'd rinse with warm water, put a thin layer of Cerave Moisturizing Lotion on under the Biore Watery Gel. I used Senka without any moisturizer underneath. I moisturize under Biore Face Milk, and only use this during active and/or extremely hot summer days.\n\n**REVIEW, FINALLY:** I like it. The gel smells a little florally and I find it very slightly unpleasant, but it goes away in 20 min or so. Because it's a gel, it doesn't need to be shaken up so it decants easily into a smaller container. When I first apply it, it feels weird, like I was rubbing a lot of gel cleanser on my face. It takes longer to absorb than the Biore watery gel, and feels like it probably has less alcohol. I look \"dewy\" for maybe about 20 min, and after that I can't feel any trace of it on my face. It's definitely not matte, but not dewy. Doesn't feel \"velvety\" either. My skin just feels nicely moisturized but not covered in goo, and I'd have to say looks closer to being dewy than matte. I don't think this would be suitable for anyone with oily skin. Mine is slightly dry and felt great with no moisturizer under it.\n\nI'm pretty happy with this purchase, as it's economical and suits its purpose. I would like to have something higher SPF for hot summer days that aren't sweltering and I'm not going to be active, as I feel like Biore Face Milk is excessive for this purpose and annoying expensive for the tiny 30 ml bottle. I'll probably either order a replacement Biore Watery gel for that, or try something slightly more matte than the watery gel. I'm interested in the new formulations, but will wait for the price to fall before I even consider ordering.\n\n**My Routine:**\n\nAM:\n\n* rinse w/ warm water\n* Cerave moisturizing lotion + Biore watery gel, OR just Missha All Around Safe block\n\nPM:\n\n* The Face Shop Bright Rich cleansing oil (totally meh about this, trying to use it up because the store doesn't take returns), OR\n* Muji Sensitive Skin cleansing oil\n* Cerave Hydrating cleanser\n* Mizon AHA & BHA Daily Clean Toner (for pH adjusting)\n* CosRX BHA blackhead power liquid\n* CosRX AHA 7 whitehead power liquid OR The Ordinary Advanced Retinoid 2%\n* The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%\n* Ole Henrikson Truth Serum (vit C, a sample that I'm meh about)\n* Humidity Cezanne skin conditioner coercive (1-2 layers depending, also layer on lips)\n* First Aid Beauty ultra repair cream (really like this but pretty expensive, looking for replacement)\n* Aquaphor on lips\n\nI do wait times when I have time, otherwise it's 30 seconds between or less really. No pilling even then.",
