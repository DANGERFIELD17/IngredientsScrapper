Zinc acetate appears to have a much stronger effect than gluconate. \"Three trials used **zinc acetate in daily doses of over 75 mg**, the pooled result indicating a **42% reduction in the duration of colds** (95% CI: 35% to 48%). Five trials used zinc salts **other than acetate** in daily doses of over 75 mg, the pooled result indicating a **20% reduction in the duration of colds** (95% CI: 12% to 28%).\"[1]\"\n\nhttps://www.commoncoldwiki.org/wiki/Zinc_for_the_common_cold\n\nSo basically most forms of zinc lozenges make colds 20% shorter, if and only if you take more than 75 mg a day. **For the 42% reduction mentioned in the title it sadly has to be zinc acetate.** Also dosage matters: a number of trials looked at doses of less than 75 mg per day and found that didn't significantly work.\n\nZinc acetate in the 13 trials they looked at made colds 42% shorter.\n\nWARNING\n\nYou should also know: Don't use zinc nose sprays. Can cause you to lose your sense of smell (!). http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/30/AR2006013001240.html",

As the zinc lozenges formulation has been widely studied and there is a significant reduction in the duration of cold at a dose of ≥ 75 mg/day, for those considering using zinc it would be best to use it at this dose throughout the cold. Regarding prophylactic zinc supplementation, currently no firm recommendation can be made because of insufficient data. When using zinc lozenges (not as syrup or tablets) the likely benefit has to be balanced against side effects, notably a bad taste and nausea.\n\nsource: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23775705",

On the face it looks quite ridiculous and I always find the need to powder over it to hide the cast and shine. The shine is not \"dewy\", it's definitely oily.

In both cases I was sufficiently protected; no burns or tans, no deepening of PIH (and I tan/get PIH very easily -- most US and Asian formulations aren't protective enough for me). For me this works just as well as the old formulation, if not better.\n\n\\--\n\nOverall, I was pleasantly surprised by this reformulation. Not only is it more cosmetically elegant in terms of both shine and white cast, but it has a slightly higher PPD and doesn't contain octocrylene, which was one of the ingredients I didn't quite like in the old formula. \n\nI will continue to purchase this sunscreen and look forward to seeing how it holds up in higher (summer) UV indices.",

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

I sure hope people are buying it so it doesn't get discontinued. I got it for maybe 6000 KRW for the 50 ml tube and it's such a nice moisturizing vehicle with Tinosorb S and Uvinul A Plus. So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

They don't always appear as \"ceramide \\_\\_\", there are other names for them, such as:\n\nHydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, Myristoyl/​Palmitoyl Oxostearamide/​Arachamide MEA, Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide, Hydroxypalmitoyl Sphinganine, [Safflower Oil/​Palm Oil Aminopropanediol Esters](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/safflower-oil-palm-oil-aminopropanediol-esters), etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo today I wanted to make a list of products that are easily overlooked when searching for ceramide skincare, because many people are only looking for the word \"ceramide\".

Because with a brief look earlier I saw the Palmitamide MEA in it and thought it's one of the ceramides (the names are so similar haha!). However, today I saw incidecoder mentioning it as just a viscosity controlling ingredient (and I usually find them quite accurate), but more things came up where I saw something from mdedge [here](https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/74188_main.pdf) stating \"Palmitamide MEA (PEA) is an important component of MimyX nonsteroidal cream, Dr. Smith said. PEA is an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties\" but this doctor has a consulting agreement with Stiefel Labs, which manufactures Physiogel. Also came across this [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/) but it's testing a synthetic ceramide PC-104 in combination with other things like Palmitamide MEA, grapeseed extract etc. Plus, I remember reading an AMA from kindofstephen where he said \" I think most cosmetic companies would attribute patents as a marketing cost. Most novel patents I've seen in the cosmetic industry are to deal with delivery vehicles (like an airless soft container, etc)\". My takeaway is things can be patented even if they're not doing too much, because to consumers it seems like it's doing a lot? And now idk if this ingredient/Physiogel is any good as a ceramide cream or it's just a good plain heavy moisturiser.\n\nEdit: Realised this ingredient is present in Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume, along with SK-Influx, where it's described as \"Atoderm Intensive Baume quickly stops itching and reduces the urge to scratch thanks to its anti-itching dermatological active ingredient PEA\"\n\nMy understanding is Physiogel doesn't have any ceramides or cholesterol/phytosterols (looks like Zeroid uses phytosterols in place of cholesterol?), but has PEA as a fatty acid (skin similar ingredient), so it must be a good moisturiser but not an ideal-ratio ceramide moisturiser.",

    "body": "Hi all, I suffer from depression, anxiety and ADHD (the holy trinity) and I recently started supplementing Zinc at 15mg before bed and I have never slept so well, nor felt so well rested. It is crazy to me such a small element can improve my overall energy levels and mental health. Absolutely 0 depression symptoms over the past 3 days while taking zinc. I also feel energetic before taking ADHD meds (methylphenidate) or caffiene.\n\n I would really recommend those who suffer with depression, or insomnia to give Zinc a shot. I was genuinely stunned how much it helped, much more than some psychotropic medications ever did. I take 25 MG of Zinc gluconate, a 50 MG tab split in half in the evening. Looks like 25mg is a decent dose for an adult male, with upper bounds around 50. 50 vs 25 didn't change much so I stuck to the lower dose.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions or share your experiences! Thanks a million for all the great life changing information on this sub. I wouldn't know what to do without it ❤\n\n\nEdit: for my conditions I am currently taking venlafaxine xr 150mg, methylphenidate er 36mg and mirtazapine 15mg\n\nMirtazapine is taken nightly, and the others are daily",

With time, it makes hypothymia better, anhedonia somewhat better, but slowly.\n\n2) Zinc (any bioavailable form) always makes me much more sleepy, like, a lot. Sometimes it syncs with what I want but often contradicts my aspirations. If there's a period of life where I want to get into a warm cocoon away from reality and feel just cozy & introvertive, zinc works nice.  If I wish to be energetic, it actually pushes me back from my goal, especially in evening. May be not SLEEPY per se, just less motivated to do anything other than lying on my sweet bed watching something pleasant. Perhaps it's because, when I take zinc, I can't stay at low dose (15 mg or below) but take up to 50 mg every day. Perhaps, in case of zinc, dosage is the golden key.\n\n3) I noticed than taking it with magnesium brings synergy. Taking it without magnesium also works well, but magnesium boosts the effect. Possibly it has to do with dual NMDA modulation when taken together.\n\n4) I am really not an alcohol-loving kind of guy, rather vice versa. But I also noticed that, when on zinc, especially when a course is well past its beginning and zinc has already begun to accumulate, even a small beer brings on malaise & confusion. I goes away when alcohol is fully metabolized & excreted.\n\nIn total, zinc seems to really help \"depression\", problem is \"depression\" is actually an umbrella term. Fatigued, oversleeping, unmotivated depression types will probably worsen on it, anxious & overexcited types will surely benefit. Or not, it's just my own experience.",

    "body": "***Hi! I made an easy to understand (hopefully lol), but long guide for exfoliation. Beginners or those who need more detailed information.***\n\n# Exfoliation Guide\n\nTLDR: Just scroll to what type you wanna see.\n\nExfoliation is a great way to help with many different skin concerns. The reason most exfoliate is for the benefit of speeding up skin cell turnover. Skin cell turnover essentially is new skin cells replacing old skin cells and it’s approximately around 28 to 42 days for it to happen. Our skin already exfoliates itself within those 28 to 42 days in a process called “*desquamation*”, but exfoliation can help speed that up when done correctly. With forms of exfoliation, it aids in that process. The issue with exfoliation is people overdo it and destroy their skin cell barrier. We see a lot of videos of people using AHAs, BHA, PHAs, and manual exfoliation daily. This is not ok for most people and they end up with compromised skin barriers or aging themselves quicker. Most only need to exfoliate once to three times max per week depending on the routine. However, all forms of exfoliation have amazing benefits for the skin if done correctly for the right skin, percentage, skin tone, and age.\n\nUse this guide to find what you are looking for or read the whole thing lol. It’s a wall of text. Always remember to\n\n# USE SUNSCREEN ALWAYS SPF 30+ AT LEAST BROADSPECTRUM!\n\n***Alpha Hydroxy Acids (The Top Three)***\n\nMore for the drier people. Not all AHAs are for sensitive people, but they tend to have more options for people wanting gentle exfoliation or having sensitive skin. Strongest to lightest goes (and smallest to biggest in molecular size):\n\nGlycolic<Lactic< Mandelic\n\nIt is really important to understand your skin tone when using these. A lot of people who have or can have hyperpigmentation and scarring easily may use too high of a percentage of certain AHAs causing this reaction. Remember stronger and higher is not better. Slow and steady can win the race a lot of times. Especially if you are young there is no rush. These can help with whiteheads, but not really blackheads. If BHA is too drying for you, you might need to look into AHAs. It is a **must** to use sunscreen with these as they will make your skin more sensitive to the sun.\n\n**Glycolic Acid (Water-Soluble)**\n\nSkin Tone: Fitzpatrick skin types 1, 2, 3 (below skin types 3 should give caution.)\n\nSkin Type: Combo, Oily, or balanced (“normal”) skin. \n\nSkin Wants/Benefits: fight anti-aging, to boost collagen, quick results, control moderate acne, glowy skin, control hyperpigmentation or dark spots, and help with dullness.\n\nRules/Suggestions: \n\n1. Start super low please like 2% to 4% and build up to that 7% or 8%-10% max. Usually. This AHA works so fast because it penetrates the skin and can go to “hot spots” fast like a dark spot. However, since it flies through the skin, it can also cause trauma. Starting low can reduce negative effects. \n2.  Darker skin tones should start slow when using this and maybe use glycolic acid at first within face washes. \n3. Suggested if you have more resilient skin and if you have more “mature” skin.\n4. Should hydrate, hydrate, hydrate.\n5. Pregnancy Safe\n\nProducts: The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toner, The Alpha Care Glycolic Acid 10%, Versed Doctor’s Visit Instant Resurfacing Mask, Paula’s Choice 8% Skin Perfecting 8% AHA Gel, FaceTheory Clarifying Cleanser C2\n\n**Lactic Acid (Water-Soluble)**\n\nSkin Tone: All Fitzpatricks.\n\nSkin Type: Dehydrated, Dry, Combo, Sensitive, Kilaris Pilaris (KP), Crepey Skin. \n\nSkin Wants: Hydration (could be dehydrated and have dry or oily skin), want a glow, softer skin, control kilaris pilaris (KP)/hyperpigmentation/acne. Help with dullness, skin texture, wrinkles (anti-aging and long-term effects), minimizing pores. Random but nail health too!\n\nRules/Suggestions: \n\n1. 5% at the start max is 7% for benefits from studies. If you can handle it and have been using it for a while go up to 10%. \n2. Safe for darker skin tones starting out at 5% to 7%. You need to start low to avoid hyperpigmentation. \n3. Good for pregnancy\n\nProducts: The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5%, Skin Revolution 5%,  The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10%, The Inkey List 10%,  Amlactin 15% Lotion(s) and for the body), PCA Skin Pigment Gel.\n\n**Mandelic Acid (The only oil-soluble AHA which makes it amazing for acne types)**\n\nSkin Tone: All Fitzpatricks.\n\nSkin Type: Extremely Sensitive, Dry and acne-prone, Dehydrated, Easily Traumatized, Oily. \n\nSkin Wants: Moderate oil (sebum control) and acne control, anti-inflammatory, control hyperpigmentation, help with dullness, evening out skin tone, glowing skin, skin texture, anti-bacterial, need hydration needs help with laying down make up.\n\nRules/Suggestions:\n\n1. 5% to 10% to start (5% you might not see any benefits though. It might be a good way to introduce if you are worried.) \n2. Also if you have a nut sensitivity you may want to patch this one really hard to see that you won't have an allergic reaction.\n3. Extremely safe for darker skin types (Type 3 to Type 6.)\n4. If you like oily feeling ingredients. \n5. Good for pregnancy!\n\nProducts: The Ordinary Mandelic acid 10%, Wishtrend Mandelic acid 5%, Stratia Soft Touch AHA, FaceTheory Mandelibright Serum, The Inkey List Mandelic Acid Treatment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Beta Hydroxy Acid***\n\nSo there's only one BHA used in skin care and technically it's not truly a BHA (technically it is an O-Hydroxybenzoic acid lol). There's only one and it's Salicylic Acid (SA). This Acid does a lot and has grade B evidence to clear acne out. It is the best for those blackheads because it's oil-loving and can go into the pore. If you are truly looking to fight acne look into this and a grade A ingredient to help fight moderate to severe acne.\n\n**Salicylic acid**\n\nSkin Tone: All Fitzpatricks.\n\nSkin Type: Oily, Moderate to Severe acne-prone individuals, Seborrheic dermatitis, KP, Rosacea. \n\nSkin Wants: Pore Declogging, Destroy those Sebaceous Filaments (blackheads) and Closed Comedones (CC white heads), Needs a spot treatment, minimize pores, fight enlarged pores, anti-bacterial needs.\n\nRules/Suggestions: \n\n1. Can also do work for slight to moderate hyperpigmentation (not know for it though), inflammation, and decrease minimal redness \n2. Works at 0.50% to 2%\n3.  If you are dry you can use this to spot treat acne before trying AHAs. \n4.  Avoid for pregnancy\n\nProducts: Cerave SA Face Wash, Paula’s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant, The Ordinary Anhydrous Salicylic Acid 2%, The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Solution, The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Masque, The Inkey List Salicylic Acid Cleanser, FaceTheory Clarifying Cleanser C2, Cerave Rough and Bumpy Skin Lotion, Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Poly Hydroxy Acids***\n\nSkin Tone: All fitzpatrick shades.\n\nSkin type: Extremely sensitive, dry, dehydrated skin, or KP.\n\nSkin Wants: Less sensitivity, Less aggressive products, hydration, anti-oxidant, stop collagen breakdown within the skin, skin firmness and help with dullness.\n\nThese are the \"new\" upcoming acids. They give you everything AHAs can do but no or little sun sensitivity. These are amazing in toners and can be worked up very well to everyday use. More easy on the skin than both AHAs and BHA. Now I am NOT saying use these everyday.\n\nRules/Suggestion: \n\n1. PHAs to look out for: Lactobionic acid, Maltobionic acid, Gluconolactone, Zinc gluconate, Copper gluconate, Gluconic acid\n2. Also help strengthen the natural skin barrier function.\n3. No Photosensitivity\n\nProducts: The Inkey List PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner, Naturium PHA Topical Acid 12%, PCA Skin Hydrating Serum, Cosrx PHA Moisture Power Renewal Cream, Cosrx Triple Hyaluronic Acid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Enzyme (Plant) Exfoliants***\n\nSkin tone: All Fitzpatricks.\n\nSkin type: All.\n\nSkin Wants: Less irritating, gentle, less drying.\n\nThese are for people who need to feel something physical happening. Enzyme exfoliants are more gentle than physical ones (like scrubs). If you need instant gratification and need that scrub working feeling look into these. (pineapple and papaya enzymes are where most of these enzyme exfoliants come from.)\n\nRules/Suggestion: \n\n1. Can be used for sensitive skin and skin conditions that have more of a rough texture.\n2. Look for Papaya (Papain), Pineapple (Bromelain), or Pumpkin (Pumpkin Enzymes.)\n\nProducts: Amorepacific Treatment Enzyme Exfoliating Powder Cleanser, Kinship Naked Papaya Enzyme Cleanser, Alpyn beauty PlantGenius Creamy Bubbling Cleanser, Golde Papaya Bright Superfood Face Mask, Josie Maran Pineapple Enzyme Pore Clearing Cleanser, Herbivore Brighten Pineapple Enzyme + Gemstone Instant Glow Mask, Youth To The People Yerba Mate Resurfacing + Exfoliating Energy Facial, Wishful Yo Glow Enzyme Scrub, Sun + Moon Sunny Daze Gel Enzyme Scrub, Tula So Smooth Resurfacing & Brightening Enzyme Mask, Peter Thomas Roth Pumpkin Enzyme Mask Enzymatic Dermal Resurfacer, Bliss Powerhouse Pumpkin Face Mask.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Manual Exfoliation*** These are your towels, scrubs, gloves, shaving, dermablading or whatever you’re rubbing against the skin for exfoliation. This type can be beneficial for certain skin concerns such as Kilaris Pilaris (KP). This type of exfoliation can go wrong as it can take away alive skin cells and not dead ones adding to sensitivity. It can give immediate satisfaction though. Better for the hands and feet, not the face.\n\nProducts or Ways To Do It: Foreo Luna 2 or 3 (Silicone Face Brush), Towels (you have them at home), Shaving. If you want to and have to look into facial scrubs or facial exfoliating pads.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Very Minor (like very light and also kinda an honorable mention) Exfoliation***\\*:\\* These are skin care ingredients that give slight exfoliation affects.\n\n**Azelaic Acid**\n\nSkin Tone: All Fitzpatrick.\n\nSkin Type: Acne prone, Extremely sensitive, Rosacea (!!!!), Hyperpigmentation-Prone, Combo, Balance, Oily, and Dry skin.\n\nSkin Wants: Anti-inflammation, anti-redness, anti-hyperpigmentation, anti-acne, very gentle exfoliation, fight melasma, smoother complexion, stop pore plugging. \n\nRules/Suggestion: \n\n1. Grade A evidence to fight acne and very gentle exfoliation (very light but still should be watched). This can be used daily and used with another acid (like an AHA, BHA, or PHA once a week) to help fight acne, hyperpigmentation, and redness. Whatever you need it to be, it can do it. Can be drying for drier skin types.\n2. If you are a dry or oily sensitive individual, have active low to moderate active acne, hyperpigmentation, don't want extreme exfoliation and not really looking for an exfoliation and something that can be used daily and don't mind a little dryness.\n3. Starting around 10% or 15  (maximum 20%. Gel form at 15% can be more potent than 20% creams.)\n4. Can help Post-Inflammatory Erythema (PIE). \n5. No photosensitivity. \n6. Safe for pregnancy.\n\nProducts: Paula's Choice 10% Azelaic Booster, The Ordinary Azelaic Acid 10%, Naturium Azelaic Topical Acid 10%, Cos De Baha Azelaic Acid 10% Serum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Conclusion (What not to use when exfoliating and closing statements)*** \n\nAlways **patch test** (neck or arm area or wherever) before using these acids. You never know if your skin will react badly. If you don't use caution you could get a and reaction. Now look, you're at your doctor's office or battling another skin concern on top of your old concern. So please let's patch test before use. If you get a bad reaction (itching, burning, stinging, redness, swelling, SKIN PILLING OFF, etc.) stop use immediately!!!  Just take two weeks to a month using the product once a week to get accumulated to the product and then incorporate further into your routine. \n\nPlease don’t exfoliant more than 3 times a week (once or twice a week is amazing) especially if you are using retinols/retinoids. Don't use retinol or exfoliating acid (except azelaic acid as it technically is not considered an exfoliant) at the same time please (layering one and then the other unless it is within the same product)!  Please avoid \"slugging\"/ointments/balms use when exfoliating or using retinol. Irritation can increase when \"slugging or using ointments such as \"LRP Cicaplast Baume or Cerave Healing Ointment\" as these products basically trap moisture from leaving and active ingredients are trapped as well to causing them to become more potent and the longevity of how long it stays active on the skin. **Use discretion**. You can and will destroy your skin barrier over time. Please also avoid using exfoliation after shaving the face (the body is a little different.) I would exfoliate the day before you actually shave for a better shave. \n\nI hope this helps anyone looking for an exfoliation ingredient. Let me know if something doesn't make sense or is wrong.\n\nSorry for grammar >.<\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit- I have all the articles I took this information from and videos from dermatologist. I didn't put them in the post as it made it even longer lol. If you want them I can put them down or send them to you!",

        "body": "Hey there! Exfoliation can make such a difference for your skin, but figuring out how to do it right can feel overwhelming. I recently found this super helpful guide: [How to Exfoliate Safely: Tips for Healthy Skin](https://empowerherlife.com/how-to-exfoliate-safely-tips-for-healthy-skin/). It completely changed how I approach my routine, so I thought I’d share some tips I learned!\n\n* **Know Your Skin Type**: This is a game changer. Oily skin? Go for chemical exfoliants like salicylic acid. Dry or sensitive skin? Stick to gentle scrubs and limit it to once or twice a week.\n* **Pick the Right Exfoliant**: I used to think scrubs were the only way to exfoliate, but chemical exfoliants (like AHAs/BHAs) are amazing—so much gentler and effective.\n* **Don’t Overdo It**: I learned the hard way that over-exfoliating makes your skin freak out. Stick to 1–3 times a week, depending on your skin.\n* **Moisturize Right After**: Exfoliating can leave your skin feeling thirsty. A good moisturizer (I swear by anything with hyaluronic acid) makes all the difference.\n* **Sunscreen is Non-Negotiable**: Your skin is more sensitive to the sun after exfoliating, so always, always use SPF.\n\nIf you’re into DIY, the guide also has recipes for sugar scrubs and natural fruit acid exfoliants, which are super easy to whip up at home. I’ve tried the sugar scrub, and my skin felt so soft after!\n\nHonestly, this blog helped me stop making a ton of rookie mistakes, like scrubbing too hard or skipping sunscreen. If you’re struggling with dull skin, clogged pores, or just want that glow, check it out—it’s packed with practical tips.\n\nWhat’s your go-to exfoliation routine? Would love to hear what’s worked for you!",

    "body": "My hashimotos is in remission & I’ve tested at normal levels for the past two years. Here are the changes I’ve made. I did a lot of research & was heavily focused on improving my levels without medication. You can also do your own research to find out what works for you! Good luck. \n\nI AM NOT A DOCTOR AND THIS IS NOT MEDICAL ADVICE. \n\n*Add Supplements*\n\nBuy one of those 3x a day pill organizers from Amazon and start taking supplements daily. When looking for supplements, look for the most bio-available sources. Sometimes your body is already under so much stress that it can’t effectively perform the steps necessary to breakdown the supplement and covert it to the vitamin that you can use. Some people also have gene mutations that make it impossible to breakdown certain sources of vitamins. \n\nFirst and foremost take a good daily multivitamin - not a gummy or a “one a day pill.” I recommend the Thorne brand or Pure Encapsulations. \n\nI also supplement with CoQ10, vitamin D3, selenium, zinc, fish oil, magnesium, b-12. Ask your PCP for a vitamin & mineral panel to rule out any deficiencies so you know what supplements to use. A lot of the deficiencies have overlapping symptoms with Hashimotos. Also look up the UL for each supplement you end up taking to make sure you do not go over the daily upper limits. \n\nI recommend 200-400mcg of CoQ10 - the Uniquinol active form specifically. CoQ10 is a vitamin-like substance that plays a key role in energy production in cells. It’s also an antioxidant. Some studies have shown that CoQ10 levels are inversely correlated with thyroid hormones. CoQ10 levels are low in hyperthyroid patients, but high in hypothyroid patients. CoQ10 has been shown to be effective in treating mitochondrial dysfunction, which is a common issue in hypothyroidism. This helps me with fatigue. CoQ10 deficiency is a rare disease that can cause a wide range of symptoms, including fatigue and muscle weakness, even during non-strenuous activities like walking. \n\nAsk your doctor for vitamin D bloodwork. I take 5,000 IU but I know I am deficient and I need to build up reserves in my fat cells. Try to find one with K2 for better absorption. Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin, so take it with at least 10g of fat (like a couple hunks of cheese or a meal). If you don’t take it with fat, you won’t absorb anything. One study in particular found that 96% of Hashimoto’s patients had a deficiency in vitamin D. The Endocrine Society guidelines classify D levels of 30.0 ng/ml or higher as vitamin D sufficiency, 20 to 29.9 ng/ml as insufficiency, and less than 20 ng/ml as deficiency. In one study, Hashimoto patients who were deficient in vitamin D took 1,200 to 4,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D every day for four months. After four months, they had significantly lower levels of anti-thyroid antibodies. Bonus - if you are vitamin D deficient, supplementing can help with weight loss. Symptoms of Vitamin D deficiency include muscle pain, bone pain, hair loss, fatigue, binge eating, depression, weight gain, eczema, frequent colds, constipation. \n\nThe body can only absorb up to 5-10 mg of Zinc at any given time. Take it on an empty stomach. Zinc is required for the conversion of inactive T4 to active T3. If you don’t have enough zinc you won’t be able to produce the T3 that you need. Zinc can also help reduce inflammation and may act as an anti-inflammatory agent all by itself. Zinc is also required for the proper regulation of your immune system, which can lower your antibodies. Not all formulations of zinc are equally effective because they are not all equally absorbed. If you have Hashimoto’s you’ll want to house zinc chelate, zinc monomethionine, zinc gluconate, zinc acetate, or zinc citrate. Zinc is also an important mineral for hair growth and scalp health. It helps maintain the structure of hair follicles, and is involved in cell division and protein synthesis, which are essential for hair follicle activity. Zinc also helps regulate keratin, a protein that forms the structure of hair strands. A zinc deficiency can make you loose your hair. have IBS symptoms (chronic diarrhea), delayed wound healing, problems with thinking, reasoning, and memory & fertility problems. \n\nSupplement with 100 mcg of Selenium per day, as you will absorb more from food sources. Too much selenium will cloud your thyroid management. Selenium plays a role in protecting your thyroid gland from oxidative stress, it also supports thyroid function directly through its actions on selenoproteins. These selenoproteins regulate major systems in the body like your thyroid gland, brain, liver, and intestines. There are also several studies that show that supplementing with selenium may reduce thyroid antibodies. Selenium deficiency can have many symptoms, including fertility issues, hair loss, muscle weakness, fatigue, mental fog, weak nails, anxiety, increased anger, weight gain, constipation, & feeling cold. \n\nI take 550mcg of fish oil a day (broken down into 3 pills, one at each meal). Fish oil / omega-3 fatty acids have beneficial effects for cardiovascular health, which is crucial for individuals with Hashimoto’s and hypothyroidism. These conditions are associated with an increased risk of heart disease, and incorporating omega-3s into your diet can help reduce this risk. Omega-3 fatty acids, which are commonly found in fish oil supplements and fatty fish like salmon & sardines, possess anti-inflammatory properties that can help manage the inflammation associated with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Low omega-3 can cause brittle nails & hair, dry skin, depression, brain fog, joint pain / stiffness, dry eyes, and thinning hair. \n\nI take a combo pill of Calcium Magnesium (Citrate) - 240 g Calcium - 240 g at bed time. Low magnesium levels are associated with thyroglobulin antibody (TGAb) positivity. A magnesium deficiency can put those with Hashimoto’s at a higher risk of developing symptoms. Studies have shown that adequate magnesium levels can help reduce the production of thyroid antibodies, which can lower the autoimmune attack on the thyroid gland. Magnesium supplementation may also help reduce inflammation, prevent metabolic disorders, and help prevent weight gain in patients with Hashimoto’s. Early signs of low magnesium are fatigue and stiffness. It can also cause nighttime leg cramps, head aches, tingling in hands / feet, and heart palpitations.\n\nI take 2,000mcg of B-12 in the Adenosyl/Hydroxy forms. Take this in the morning as it will give you energy, and may keep you up at night. This helps so much with energy levels and memory. It also lessens my anxiety. The stress hormone cortisol has been proven to be decreased by vitamin B12, which has been shown to assist in controlling the body’s reaction to stress. While up to 20% of adults have Vitamin B-12 deficiency, Hashimoto’s and hypothyroidism are risk factors for a deficiency in B-12. Vitamin B-12 has anti-inflammatory properties and is crucial to the immune system’s function. Low levels of vitamin B-12 apparently exacerbate inflammation in the thyroid gland, worsening Hashimoto’s thyroiditis symptoms. A study released in 2023 looked at both vitamin D and B12 levels and their correlation with thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) in patients with autoimmune hypothyroidism and found that higher levels of TPOAb are associated with low levels of both vitamins. Something else I just learned - anesthesia from a surgery can drastically decrease your B-12 reserves. Symptoms of vitamin B-12 deficiency include fatigue, memory fog, breathlessness, tingling hands/feet, and poor balance.\n\nTake 1mg melatonin at bed. Your body needs rest to repair itself. Melatonin may be useful for Hashimoto’s because it can reduce thyroid inflammation while also suppressing thyroid hormone production. However, melatonin can also interfere with thyroid medications and thyroid function, so it’s important to consult a doctor before taking melatonin as part of a thyroid care plan. If you start taking melatonin, you should check your thyroid hormone levels within a few weeks. \n\nI do not take any iodine. Note that supplementing with high doses of iodine in the absence of an iodine deficiency may lead to adverse effects in those with Hashimoto’s. Don’t take high dose iodine supplements unless a healthcare professional has directed you to do so. Check your salt and spices - they often have iodine added.\n\n*Exercise*\n\nSign up for a gym with a sauna and low impact work out classes. Try Pilates, barre, meditation, stretching, water aerobics, incline walking for 1 mile and weight lifting. \n\nAvoid HITT cardio at all costs. Keep your weekly workouts under 5 hours total. Low impact workouts have been shown to help hashimotos, while anything high impact will put more stress on your body. \n\nAs for the sauna, I do 10-15 min at a time and it really helps with my muscle pain. Sweating can be a powerful tool for health, and an infrared sauna offers many benefits to people with Hashimoto’s, including stress relief, detoxification, pain relief, improved circulation, weight loss, clearer skin, lowered blood pressure, and wound healing. Infrared saunas are much more beneficial, but a traditional dry sauna works too. \n\n*Diet Changes*\n\nI cut out gluten completely, and this was the only change I made for the first year of my Hashimoto’s journey. I have been GF for a year and a half now, and my levels are now within the normal range and I don’t need any medication. \n\nIncrease your protein intake. For general health purposes, you should be consuming a minimum of 0.45-0.55 grams of protein per day, for each pound that you weigh. This translates to roughly 75 grams of protein per day, for a person who weighs 150 pounds. The more active you are, the more protein you need. If you are trying to build muscle, aim for 1 gram of protein per pound. This is especially important for people with Hashimoto’s or other autoimmune disorders. The body is breaking down its own muscle protein to fuel its inflammatory stress response. This means your overall requirement for protein will be increased. While we know that inflammation is at the root cause of this and we definitely want to address the inflammation so that we no longer need as much protein, realistically, reducing inflammation to a healthy level may take some time. I track my food in MyFitnessPal to make sure I am hitting my macros (roughly 40% carbs, 30% fat, 30% protein). You can try protein powders, bone broth, extra meat servings, etc. \n\nKeep your alcohol intake under 4 drinks a week. Make smarter alcohol choices, like a liquor and diet drink or water. Beer contains gluten. You will want to avoid any high sugar alcoholic drinks unless you are pairing them with a protein and moderation (see below). Alcohol is inflammatory and will make your symptoms worse. \n\nThe same goes for caffeine. People assume that more caffeine = less fatigue, but caffeine is bad for us. Caffeine can stimulate the adrenal glands to release stress hormones like cortisol, which can lead to worsened symptoms of Hashimoto’s disease and an underactive thyroid, including fatigue, weight gain, and mood disturbances. Start by slowly weaning off caffeine. I now have 1 cup of had caffeine coffee, then a second cup of decaf. If you’re on meds, google when you can have caffeine, because it will interfere with your medicine. Again, don’t have a coffee with cream & sugar on an empty stomach. I suggest drinking your coffee black - this helped me wean off it faster, and now I enjoy it black. \n\nMake sure you are pairing any high glucose foods with protein. Eat breakfast before having your coffee. Example - Greek yogurt  (high protein) with blueberries (antioxidants). Any antioxidants will help lower your antibodies, which can help you feel better (coQ10, NAC, Vitamin C, melatonin before bed, etc). High antioxidant foods are berries, pecans, dark chocolate, spinach, carrots, green tea (get decaf). \n\nIf you have Hashimoto’s, eating too much sugar can increase inflammation, provoke autoimmune thyroid flares, throw blood sugar out of balance, create dysfunction in gut health and gut bacteria, and create hormone deficiencies and excesses. \n\nI still eat dairy. I couldn’t bear to cut out cheese, so I cut gluten out first. I make some dairy free swaps, like almond milk yogurts. Dairy is one of the most problematic foods for people with Hashimoto’s, and eliminating it can help reduce bloating, diarrhea, and acid reflux.\n\nOther things to watch out for are processed food - try to cook your own meals or buy your food from the “organic” or “health” food sections. Don’t even bother keeping chips, cookies, ice cream, candy, etc. in your house. It’s not worth the temptation or the damage it will do to your body. Avoid soy products and fried foods. Remember that food affects us differently. \n\nTry to eat a lot of fruits and vegetables. Remember to pair anything high sugar with a protein (grapes & cheese, berries & Greek yogurt, apples & peanut butter, etc.) \n\n*Sleep*\n\nHashimoto’s, an autoimmune disorder affecting the thyroid gland, can cause insomnia. As the thyroid regulates metabolism and sleep-wake cycles, its dysfunction may lead to sleep disturbances. Hashimoto’s disease affects the body’s internal clock and circadian rhythm as thyroid hormone levels fluctuate.\n\nOnly have caffeine in the morning, if at all. So not have any caffeine after noon. Try to get at least 20-min of natural sunlight when you wake up. Do not wear sunglasses. Sunlight on our retinas helps activate morning cortisol production and helps set our circadian rhythm for the day. This can be a 20-min walk in the morning, which counts as your low impact exercise for the day, or as simple as eating your breakfast near a bright window. You can also try a blue light lamp (often called sun lights) in the morning, and then blue-light blocking glasses at night. \n\nMake sure your lighting is dim after sunset. You can buy dimming light bulbs if you don’t have dimmer switches. We set out bulbs to automatically dim at 6pm, then turn off at 10pm. The light in your home should mirror what is outside to promote melatonin production. \n\nHave the “night mode” turned on your phone, where it will automatically take the blue hue out of your phone screen after 6pm. If you can, avoid screens at night.\n\nExercise earlier in the day to promote better sleep. I go to the gym before dinner. Exercising raises cortisol levels, and although this is generally a good thing, it’s highly energizing and can interfere with sleep. Try to exercise no later than two hours prior to your bedtime.\n\nSee what works for you - black out curtains, sound machines, weighted blankets, etc. Supplements like melatonin and chamomile tea can also help you sleep better. \n\n*Routines*\n\nThe above works better for me when I have a routine and expectations. I try to plan my week day meals in advance, knowing I will dine out and not stick to any diet on the weekends. I try to find exercise classes that work with my schedule and are enjoyable so I am more likely to go. It is also easier to pick a few changes, and focus on them for a couple months until it becomes your new normal. It’s easier to add on other changes slowly. \n\n\nGood luck & I hope you feel better soon! \n",

        "body": "Thank you so much for this comprehensive write-up. Even though I've had Hashi's for 20+ years it's still helpful to read about someone else's experience with really rigorous lifestyle changes and the impact it's had for you. I so appreciate the generosity of you sharing all this!\n\n100% agree that if you can — even if it's just at your local YMCA — get thee to a sauna! There probably isn't enough research yet to show concrete differences between infrared and traditional, but here's a compelling paper about sauna's benefits for rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, cardiovascular disease, exercise recovery, glucose levels, and even lipid profiles.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5941775/.\n\nIt's interesting that you don't mention iron, as it seems like many of us here also struggle with anemia. From others in this group I gleaned that iron supplementation works best if you take it every other day, with vitamin C, and spaced apart from calcium supplementation or calcium-rich foods.\n\nThe one thing you mention that I can't agree with is to avoid HIIT training \"at all costs.\" Obvs folks should do what feels good for their bodies and avoid what feels bad. But it's important to note that ACUTE STRESS, which is what your body experiences when you push it to the max during a HIIT session, is very different from CHRONIC STRESS, which can contribute to inflammation. For example, some research studies have found that high-intensity intervals actually DECREASE CORTISOL, which is not what Insta fitfluencers would have us believe. There's also quite a bit of research showing that HIIT workouts, especially for women, effectively lower TSH and stimulate weight reduction, and that HIIT is an effective way to maintain metabolic health (avoid high glucose and cardiovascular disease.) Again, do what feels best for you, but the science doesn't support the \"HIIT is bad for Hashi's\" claim right now.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10703296/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10703296/)  \n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33581014/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33581014/)",

Oh, and half a cup of cottage cheese.\n\nIs it normal to be faint, weak, hot and have a RACING HEARTBEAT?\nI literally thought multiple times yesterday I was going to black out.\n\nI am a bit better today.\n\nMy calories are supposed to be 1800 a day. I am not counting anything but I am measuring out the portion sizes I’m supposed to have, like it says 15 grapes, that’s what I have. 1/3 cup feta cheese on the greens?

Pictured above.\n\n**Fragrance:**  ~~Yes. An extremely artificial flowery scent. Dissipates, but I find it slightly annoying while applying.~~. None. \n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:** Got this when my previous gel moisturiser got over. I had already used the other 3 and I started using this with fairly high expectations. And I was / am disappointed. **It's not bad. It moisturises**. But I was expecting a jelly like moisturiser that sinks in easily while still packing a moisture -filled punch. And this is not that. It takes way longer than I'd like to sink in.  I either have to compromise on the quantity I use and the moisturised feeling or go around feeling oiler than I would like. It's the kind of product that does everything to some level, but none of them spectacularly or to an above average level.\n\nAs far as healing for barrier damage is concerned, I get way faster results from the other three Bioderma moisturisers and I pretty much never touch this for that purpose after the initial trial period.\n\nThis does have a few de-pigmenting ingredients, but so far I've not been able to see anything results that I can directly attribute to this product.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:**  Moisturised feeling. I've used this with actives that are known to cause dryness and faced no issues. It can handle drying actives. No glow noticed. No standout effects.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:**  Can't think of anything. If you start using this with low / zero expectations, you'll probably like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status:**  Jury's still out, haven't decided. But as of now it's a **Will Not Repurchase.**\n\n\n***Additional Notes on whether the product is fake****\n\n**Tl;dr: Old tube is genuine, NOT FAKE.  Confirmed by brand too. Review still stands**\n \n\nOn 24th October 2023\n\n1. Some people's experiences does not coincide with mine in important ways such as fragrance and I'm now wondering if mine was a fake, I contacted Bioderma but haven't received any info yet. But I'll update and or delete the review when I do get it. \n\n2 Of 5 people, 4 can't smell anything from their product and 1 can (but doesn't sound similar to my description. & Bioderma still hasn't replied :(\n\nOn 1st November 2023\n\n1. Bioderma replied on Instagram that my moisturiser is genuine, By the time they replied, I had already repurchased another tube from Tira, to check for myself. The new tube has already arrived and they are identical in all ways. Including from the same batch 😅. \n\n2. New tube arrived with bioderma samples, which jogged my memory. Old tube had also arrived with samples. Two of which I still have unopened. So chances of old tube being fake is 0.\n\n2. But the smell was still different. My old tube smells like a flower. My new one doesn't smell of anything, unless I put copious amounts on my arm and put my nose in it and even then it smells like a teeny bit chemically, Thats all. I can understand why most people say it smells like nothing, because that's what I would have said too, if I wasn't looking that closely. \n\n3. Anyway, I was breaking my head trying to figure out why my old tube is has that smell, And then it struck me. I had a perfume leak incident in my travel kit many months ago. Most of the stuff is replaced and I don't still have that perfume, so I'd kind of forgotten. The tube was new then and I didn't use it enough to note the frag or lack thereof.

It doesn't smell exactly like grease but it reminds me of grease. It's a dusty, chemically smell that I associate with Bioderma moisturisers. Like if you've smelled any of the Bioderma moisturisers, all except the gel-creme have the same DNA, though they are not exactly the same. It's not repulsive, but it's there. Does dissipate after a minute or so.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  I bought this on a whim after a few friends raved about it. They were so so so right. This was the second bioderma cream moisturiser I used, so I knew it would help with barrier issues but it does so much more. When I first used this, I had oily to combination skin and I never ever used cream moisturisers by choice. I had a misconception that since I was an acne / clog prone, oily skinned person, that I need to stay as far away from cream moisturisers as possible. This is the moisturiser than changed my mind.\n\nIf I want a one and done PM product when I'm too tired or too lazy or too whatever, I reach for it.\n\nIf I want a one and done travel moisturiser, this is the only one I pack.\n\nSuper dry climate, this is it.\n\nAirplane dryness, this is it.\n\nSlight tingling, or signs of barrier damage incoming, this is it.\n\nBarrier damage, this is it.\n\nDerm procedures, this is it.\n\nBut in even other scenarios such as humid climate or AM routine, where this is NOT my ideal or go-to product, it still does a decent job. It holds its own. It can be greasy but hey it can be worked with. It does an amazing job moisturising without clogging pores for me.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:**\n\nMoisturised feeling.  Super soft skin. Heals Barrier overnight depending on damaged your skin is. It's my tried and tested barrier recovery product.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The heaviness, I guess. Upto combination skin or barrier-damaged oily skin, it's fine. Very oily skinned people may want to avoid this for general use.\n\n**Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:** Have repurchased 3 or 4 times. Will continue to repurchase till it's discontinued. Love it. **Holy Grail.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Bioderma Sensibio Forte Rapid soothing cream\n\nMRP: 1499 for 40 ml.\n\n**Texture:** White Cream.

A different version of that greasy smell.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  This was first prescribed by my then dermatologist for application after a MNRF session. And since then till Atoderm intensive baume came into my life, this was a re-buy. **Slightest irritation, and I used to apply it**. I have urticaria, this helped with many of my allergic reaction episodes. **Skin will feel greasy, but it was soothing at the same time.** As soon as the greasiness disappeared, I used to reapply. **This was never a daily use moisturiser for me.** I kind of used it like medicine. As and when needed, at the quantity, I needed. However the soothing it provides does overlap with the Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume and I've not repurchased this in more than a year. I simply use that, wherever I previously reached for this. I have a feeling this is a gold standard product for certain sub set of people who need a rich, soothing moisturiser, but for most of us, this can be a pass.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:** Moisturised feeling. Very soothing on irritated skin.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The heaviness, I guess. Upto combination skin or barrier-damaged oily skin, it's fine. Very oily skinned people may want to avoid this for general use. And the price. Damn expensive for 40 ml.\n\n**Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:** As of now, I don't miss it in my routine, so **WNRP.** Considering the price and the benefit from the others, unless you have sensitive skin or are advised by your derm to try this out, I'd skip it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Cicabio Crème\n\n**MRP:** 1399 for 40 ml\n\n**Texture:** Green tinged Lotion.  Pictured above. Feels heavy for a lotion.\n\n**Ingredient List :**[Aqua/​Water/​Eau](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Fructooligosaccharides](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/fructooligosaccharides), 🌟[**Zinc Oxide**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-oxide)**,** [Sorbitan Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitan-stearate), [PEG-30 Dipolyhydroxystearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-30-dipolyhydroxystearate), [Butylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butylene-glycol), [Polyacrylamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyacrylamide), [C13-14 Isoparaffin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c13-14-isoparaffin), [Laureth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-7), [Copper Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/copper-sulfate), 🌟 [**Mannitol**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/mannitol)**,** [Sodium Hyaluronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-hyaluronate), 🌟 [**Xylitol**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/xylitol)**,** [Zinc Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-sulfate), [Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Vine Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/vitis-vinifera-vine-extract), [Rhamnose](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/rhamnose),[Laureth-3](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-3), 🌟[**Asiaticoside**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/asiaticoside)**, 🌟**[**Madecassic Acid**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/madecassic-acid)**, 🌟** [**Asiatic Acid**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/asiatic-acid), [Hydroxyethylcellulose](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethylcellulose), [Acetyl Dipeptide-1 Cetyl Ester](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acetyl-dipeptide-1-cetyl-ester), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylic-capric-triglyceride), [Laminaria Ochroleuca Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laminaria-ochroleuca-extract)\n\n**Fragrance:** A subtler version of that greasy smell, a teeny bit herbal, to be this dissipates the quickest of all the bioderma moisturisers.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  😍 I love it. I love it only slightly lesser than Atoderm Intensive Baume and mostly because it's comparatively way more expensive. 😅.  I wouldn't use this daily, there's no need, but definitely a barrier saviour product. I wake up with such soft glowy skin even when it's damaged, like the healthy part of my skin feel look glowy even if skin damage texture is still there to an extent.\n\n***Comparing with baume, since I use them both for similar reasons :*** I originally had the impression this was heavier than Atoderm Intensive Baume and that it forms a suffocating seal on the skin. This isn't true under normal circumstances. It does feel suffocating when barrier is SEVERELY damaged but not otherwise. I applied this on half and the baume of half my face to check if there's any major difference and no. **No functional difference noticed.**\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:** Soothing, Healing, Moisturising, it does it all.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The price. And for a lotion consistency product it's quite heavy.\n\n**Repurchase Status**: When I started writing this review, this was going to be a WNRP, because between all of them, I'd only repurchase Atoderm Intensive Baume, but ngl, the more I thought about it, I find myself wavering. **This is a WRP.** I don't know when, but I'll probably come back to this at some point.\n\n# \n\n# Comparision\n\n***Ranking based on Use Case***\n\n||1st Choice|2nd Choice|3rd Choice|4th Choice|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|As an AM Moisturiser|None of them|Intensive Gel-creme|Intensive Baume|Sensibio Forte|\n|As an PM Moisturiser|Intensive Baume, Cicabio, Intensive Gel-creme, Sensibio Forte||||\n|Time taken for Healing|Cicabio|Sensibio Forte, Intensive Baume|Intensive Gel-creme||\n|Versatility (Can work for any of the above use cases in a pinch)|Intensive Baume|Intensive Gel-creme|Cicabio|Sensibio Forte|\n\nI've ranked them after considering the following factors (these are the most important deciding factors for me personally).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***As  AM Moisturiser:***\n\n**I would use absolutely none of them as an AM moisturiser.** That doesn't mean they can't be used as such. it's just that none of them absorb in minutes or 'set' when you use a normal amount or slather it on. They're all occlusive but not the matte kind. Intensive Gel-creme is the easiest one of them to use as an AM moisturiser.\n\nThis gif will show you how long it took for them to sink into my arm, which is way dryer than my skin. But caveat is that I don't always use a AM moisturizer (infact I very very rarely do), but i when I do, I slather it on like below. If you use a teeny teeny weeny bit, you might not face this issue. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/isq9941kddwb1.gif\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***As PM Moisturiser:***\n\nI can't actually decide I love them all. Atleast I love Intensive Baume, Sensibio Forte and Cicabio, but there's nothing to complain about the gel creme either. ✨ **Skin just looks so nourished with all the Bioderma moisturisers.** ✨  If you use only a tiny amount, all of them will sink in by morning. I like to slather them all on. And how much is absorbed by morning completely depends on how damaged my skin is. If I catch signs of barrier damage early and use them, they'll sink in. If I've completely wrecked my skin, there will be residue when I wake up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***On healing***\n\nTime taken for healing: shortest to longest, ranked above. But honestly, most people don't need a moisturiser stronger than Intensive Baume even for barrier damage.\n\n**Note on the likeliness of clogging pores and causing acne: I've personally not had breakouts from any of them. None of them caused acne for me.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\n👉🏾 All 4 moisturisers are good.\n\n👉🏾 For most people Sensibio Forte & Cicabio is not necessary. Unless you have facial wounds, surgery on your face, intensive derm procedures, very bad rosacea and are prescribed or recommended these, I'd say skip them.  People with sensitive skin may like them though.\n\n👉🏾 If you have oily skin, you might like Bioderma Intensive gel creme.\n\n👉🏾 Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume has ceramides, fatty acids and cholesterol. Ratio unknown, will link if I can find anything.\n\n👉🏾 I've seen a fair number of people mention that baume is heavy and breaks them out in this sub. Something to be aware of.\n\n👉🏾  If I had to suggest only one product, from the above, hands down it'll be Atoderm Intensive Baume and it's best cost - benefit wise too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Im going to buy the cica +arnica to try out next. The Atoderm Creme Ultra doesn't seem interesting enough to me to want to try. If I can get a mini or sample somewhere just to update this post, I'll do that.\n\nETA2: After writing so much I still like left somethings out , so I'm editing to add them. Apologies 🙏\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs with any other review, YMMV",

But ever since getting some high end Western skin care as gifts, I noticed that many of them actually have a lot of fermented/yeasty ingredients in them.\n\nBut I can't find much on the \\~science\\~ or evidence behind why ferments can be good for your skin. But I also wonder, since ferments aren't really a thing that majority of consumers in the Western market are looking out for (like fragrance, rose water, coconut water, rosehip oil, fruit/veggie extracts that have label/experience appeal, but aren't necessarily good for skin), why would these huge companies bother putting ferments in their expensive skin care if they didn't have evidence that they do SOMETHING?\n\nI especially am curious because AB/Korean beauty are sometimes looked down upon as just being trendy and not using ingredients that are scientifically proven to be truly beneficial for skin.\n\nDo you think ferments are legit?

Fermenting antioxidant rich ingredients such as ginseng, green tea etc. breaks down the antioxidants/complex molecules that are beneficial to our skin into smaller molecules, which allows it to be absorbed into the skin easily. Not only that, yeast/bacteria ferments produce additional metabolites (AHAs, peptides) that provide additional benefits such as whitening, hydration, skin repair, you name it!\n\nEdit: forgot to put my favorite fermented product!! I love the Manyo Factory Galactomyces Niacin Special treatment. :) \n\n2nd Edit: here are the links to some scientific literature articles on fermented cosmetics which were found through PubMed! You do need access to the database if you want to read them in its entirety, but you can get some brief information on the topic just through the abstract.\n\nFermenting red ginseng enhances its safety and efficacy as a novel skin care anti-aging ingredient: in vitro and animal study.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23126662\n \nEvaluation of tyrosinase inhibitory and antioxidant activities of Angelica dahurica root extracts for four different probiotic bacteria fermentations.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254340\n\nSkin resistance to UVB-induced oxidative stress and hyperpigmentation by the topical use of Lactobacillus helveticus NS8-fermented milk supernatant.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28598022\n\nBifidobacterium-fermented soy milk extract stimulates hyaluronic acid production in human skin cells and hairless mouse skin.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12637786",

    "body": "Hello! I just wanted to share my love for panthenol! It has really helped heal my moisture barrier (too much acids!). Personally, I feel like it's been a bit underrated compared to some other ingredients, along with urea. But I think it's starting to make some headway. :\\^)\n\n**Panthenol** is a derivative of Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). It's readily absorbed by our skin and converted to vitamin b5 since it is naturally produced by our bodies. It's approved by the FDA at 2% and higher for wound healing and anti-itching. It also acts as a humectant, drawing water to the skin. (It's great for hair as well!) So it's really effective for strengthening our skin barrier at 2-5%. It's also a penetration enhancer.\n\nHowever, the studies were all done on products with only little amounts of water in them, so for watery products, you may need it at a higher percentage for it to work better ([Swift Crafty Monkey blog](https://www.swiftcraftymonkey.blog/humectants-panthenol-a-closer-look/)), like at **5-10%.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease check out the Western Beauty version of this list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/fz2l58/list_of_panthenol_products_western_version/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Key**\n\nEO = Essential Oil\n\n$ -

I remember being always kinda blown away by how lightweight it was yet packed a massive punch at calming and rebuilding my skin barrier from tretinoin and overexfoliation. And guess what it works on giant cystic acne that TO's bha being completely useless at treating. From what I know it's not available outside of Apac region, which is a travesty because good skincare should be had by all. \n\nBut I'm in Malaysia and Hada Labo is practically everywhere. So the only products I have repurchased so far are rhe super economical ones like Hada Labo's premium hydrating lotion (gold bottle), rich hydrating lotion (the one with 3 molecular weights of ha), premium whitening lotion (tranexamic acid), inkey list niacinamide serum, Q10 serum, bha serum, and their bha cleanser.\n\nYes, fragrance free advocate here.",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

    "body": "Hi everyone, today I want to explain to every Indian about a scam that has been going on for a long time and is getting uncontrollable. There is a very high chance you would have already heard about Herbalife, perhaps even through recommendations from friends or family. I will explain clearly how the scam operates and how it affects you financially as well as your health.\n\n\n\nHerbalife Nutrition\n\nHerbalife is the largest MLM company which sells overpriced ultraprocessed “health” supplements. The most common product they sell is called the Formula 1 Shake which is a powder you mix in milk or Herbalife Shakemake with water and drink regularly to “lose weight”.\n\n\n\nPyramid Scheme\n\nYou cannot buy Herbalife products in a store, you can only buy them from “distributers” who are essentially people authorized to buy from the company and sell to you. With each sale, the distributor earns a portion of the revenue, and the recruiter above them also receives a cut, creating a chain. It’s essentially a Pyramid Scheme with extra steps. A distributer will convince you to do one of two things, buy the Herbalife products regularly (so they can keep making money from you) or for you to become a distributer under them (so whenever you make a sale, they get a cut).\n\n\n\nThe Top 4%\n\nThe disturbing truth about the Herbalife model is 96% of distributers in Herbalife are in a loss. Only a select few, typically those who joined early, manage to earn substantial profits by positioning themselves at the top of the pyramid. These top 1% distributors are revered as heroes within the organization (aka Herbalife cult), conducting meetings and supposedly imparting sales wisdom to those beneath them. However, this system essentially functions as a scam, as profitability becomes impossible for those lower part of the chain. These elite distributors, now self-styled mentors, are elevated to godlike status at Herbalife-hosted events, where they deliver speeches and receive worship-like behavior from all other distributors. Herbalife hosts parties in which these top distributors are called up on stage and give speeches and are hailed upon by every other new distributor as a god. Where the only thing they have done is got lucky by joining Herbalife early and being on the top of the chain. Now even if they don’t work, people under them will work and they make money (because of the pyramid). It’s an infinite money glitch. It's like purchasing Bitcoin in 2012, witnessing its value soar, and then leveraging that success to sell courses on cryptocurrency trading, despite the primary source of wealth being timing and lucky rather than expertise.\n\n\n\nThe Product\n\nHerbalife sells a lot of products but the main one they sell is called the Formula 1 Shake and they have multiple flavors of it like Chocolate, Vanilla, Strawberry, etc. You are supposed to blend it together in water with shakemate (another product they sell), or with milk and drink it as a replacement for breakfast and dinner. The product is an ultraprocessed sugary powder which your body would never absorb (not even close to real foods).\n\n\n\nThe Meetings\n\nThe distributers who sell Herbalife products conduct daily meetings through Zoom. Distributers will convince you to attend their cringe worthy meetings. I guarantee you cannot be able to watch it for even 10 minutes. The meeting is at least half-filled with paid elderly people who claim they were able to cure their diseases. This is strictly against Herbalife’s rules as on every product they sell, it clearly states Herbalife does not intent to cure any disease. But the people in these meetings claim all sorts of things. One person claims it has treated kidney disease which modern medicine was not able to do so. Another claims their type 2 diabetes has been cured after 6 months of taking Herbalife supplements. Another claims they were not able to walk for decades until they have taken Herbalife. (One dummy was stupid enough to upload this on YouTube Shorts: [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/edfDsADUyLs](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/edfDsADUyLs))\n\nIn my opinion, Herbalife’s primary target customers for its distributors are elderly individuals and those from rural areas who are in poor health and desperate for solutions to their problems. These evil distributors exploit these vulnerable people. If you are even slightly educated, it becomes clear that the people making grand claims at these meetings are likely faking their stories and are paid for their endorsements. However, to those who are uneducated and suffering from health issues, these claims seem desperately real. It is similar to how online scammers deceive elderly people by posing as Microsoft representatives and convincing them that their computer is infected with a virus, ultimately persuading them to transfer money to get rid of the virus.\n\n\n\nThe Cult\n\nHerbalife operates in a cult-like manner. If you criticize it or ask a Herbalife member a question like, \"Isn't this like a pyramid scheme?\" they may become very angry, stop talking to you immediately, and even try to harm you in other ways. This is because the cult teaches members to avoid anyone considered a \"negative influence.\"\n\nHerbalife frequently holds real-life events in major cities, with the biggest one called Spectacular Herbalife (held in Bangalore in 2024). Only Herbalife distributors can attend. At these events, the top 1% of distributors, known as the President Team (essentially the top of the pyramid), are invited on stage to give speeches about succeeding in Herbalife and in life. They are seen as god-like by all the other distributors.\n\nThese top members claim that everyone in the audience can achieve their success if they work hard enough, presenting themselves as living examples. However, they are fully aware that those below them will never make significant money because that's how a pyramid scheme functions. The leaders at the top know this; they were simply early to the scam, which is why they hold their positions.\n\nQuestions like, \"Isn't it impossible for me to make money unless I'm at the top of the pyramid?\" inevitably arise in everyone's minds. However, your upline (the person who recruited you into the pyramid) instructs you to eliminate all negative thoughts if you want to be successful.\n\nYou are encouraged to post about Herbalife on social media and to talk to your friends and family to persuade them to start purchasing Herbalife products from you. Your friends would generally start avoiding you and slowly your friends circle (the people you hang out with) is full of Herbalife distributors.\n\n\n\nThe Truth\n\nAnyone with common sense understands that reducing your calorie intake leads to weight loss, while increasing it results in weight gain. Naturally, you will lose weight if you replace meals with Herbalife shakes because you are consuming far fewer calories. However, you can achieve the same weight loss by eating real foods, such as fruits and a small meal.\n\n\n\nHeralife Formula 1 Shake Ingredients:\n\nFructose, Soy protein isolate, Calcium caseinate, Whey powder, Oat fibre, Oliggofibre, Polydextrose powder (bulking agent), Dibasic calcium phosphate, Lecithin powder, Guar gum powder (thickener), Monobasic potassium phosphate, Flavours (natural and artificial French vanilla), Whey protein concentrate, Citrus pectin (emulsifier), Magnesium oxide, Carrageenan (thickener), Vegetable oil, Beta-carotene, Dibasic potassium phosphate, Ferrous gluconate, Ascorbic acid, Zinc gluconate, Aminogen ‡ enzymes, Sucralose (sweetener), dl-alpha Tocopheryl acetate, Potassium iodide, Copper gluconate, Biotin, Niacinamide, Vitamin K, Manganese sulfate, d-Calcium pantothenate, Pyridoxine hydrochloride, Riboflavin, Vitamin A palmitate, Thiamine mononitrate, Vitamin D3, Cyanocobalamin and Folic acid. \n\nAlso note per 100g, sugar is 32.1g.\n\nThe most used ingredient is Fructose (Sugar) and most of the ingredients are nonsense. How can one even consume this, that too daily! How can one claim that their diabetes has been cured when they consume this ultraprocessed nonsense which is over 30% SUGAR.\n\nIf Herbalife is so legit, why aren’t they selling it in stores but following the scammy MLM structure to make sales?\n\nDo note that there are legitimate weight loss shakes in the market which are way less in price and are on store shelves. Some of those products contain only real ingredients like a mixture of oats, whey, soy, etc…\n\n\n\nDeaths and Diseases\n\nThere are numerous deaths due to consuming Herbalife. It is studied that liver is affected the most. I have linked to various studies of Herbalife linked to Liver and Kidney diseases/failures at the end of this post.\n\n\n\nMarketing\n\nIf Herbalife is a Pyramid Scheme and its products are ultraprocessed nonsense which aren’t even absorbed by the body and cause diseases, how is it still surviving on the market? Herbalife spends most of its revenue on marketing. A huge budget is spend on censoring information on the internet. If you were to post a video on YouTube that Herbalife products suck, the video will immediately be removed by Herbalife as they would have send a defamation strike on your video. Any news article, any post or any video which slightly talks a little bad about Herbalife is immediately taken down or sent a legal notice. No one dares to talk wrong about Herbalife on the internet as it could lead to legal problems.\n\nHere is a YouTube Shorts video of a doctor who posted about Herbalife and received a legal notice: [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/u44ODqs4Bx4](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/u44ODqs4Bx4)\n\nHe is even scared to say the word “Herbalife” on camera. That is the power this company has on the internet.\n\nThe reason the government will not ban Herbalife is due to the humungous amount of taxes (and bribes in India) it pays to the government. The government doesn’t care about how a company makes sales if they are paying up. The government would never ban Herbalife and let go of the large taxes it earns. In fact, that would be stupid of the government to do.\n\n\n\nSome resources against Herbalife:\n\nEverything you need to know about how Herbalife Cult works:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He1bgJ0sqtw&t=951s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He1bgJ0sqtw&t=951s)\n\nJohn Oliver Herbalife Debunking:\n\n[https://youtu.be/s6MwGeOm8iI?si=UrnrwPJVQGMbCtXs](https://youtu.be/s6MwGeOm8iI?si=UrnrwPJVQGMbCtXs)\n\nReputed Doctor TheLiverDoc posts:\n\n[https://x.com/theliverdr/status/1697236972421693489?s=46&t=WtmSNJe4B0A3MqCrVjsAzA](https://x.com/theliverdr/status/1697236972421693489?s=46&t=WtmSNJe4B0A3MqCrVjsAzA)\n\n[https://twitter.com/theliverdr/status/1516002814413381634?lang=en](https://twitter.com/theliverdr/status/1516002814413381634?lang=en)\n\nMedical Research Papers:\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314303/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314303/)\n\n[https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Full-Paper-Philips-et-al-2019.pdf](https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Full-Paper-Philips-et-al-2019.pdf)\n\n[https://www.weizmann.ac.il/immunology/elinav/sites/immunology.elinav/files/2022-06/Association%20between%20consumption%20of%20Herbalife%20nutritional%20supplements%20and%20acute%20hepatotoxicity.pdf](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/immunology/elinav/sites/immunology.elinav/files/2022-06/Association%20between%20consumption%20of%20Herbalife%20nutritional%20supplements%20and%20acute%20hepatotoxicity.pdf)\n\n[https://www.journal-of-hepatology.eu/article/S0168-8278(07)00406-0/pdf](https://www.journal-of-hepatology.eu/article/S0168-8278(07)00406-0/pdf)\n\nPlease search “herbalife liver pdf” on Google for more studies.",

Personally, I feel like it's been a bit underrated compared to some other ingredients, along with urea. But I think it's starting to make some headway. :\\^)\n\n**Panthenol** is a derivative of Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). It's readily absorbed by our skin and converted to vitamin b5 since it is naturally produced by our bodies. It's approved by the FDA at 2% and higher for wound healing and anti-itching. It also acts as a humectant, drawing water to the skin. (It's great for hair as well!) So it's really effective for strengthening our skin barrier at 2-5%. It's also a penetration enhancer.\n\nHowever, the studies were all done on products with only little amounts of water in them, so for watery products, you may need it at a higher percentage for it to work better ([Swift Crafty Monkey blog](https://www.swiftcraftymonkey.blog/humectants-panthenol-a-closer-look/)), like at **5-10%.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease check out Asian Beauty version of this list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/fz2kw4/list_of_panthenol_products_asian_beauty_version/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Key**\n\nEO = Essential Oil\n\n$ - Very affordable (\\~$1-12)\n\n$$ - Affordable-ish (\\~$13-24)\n\n$$$ - Mid-range (\\~$25-55)\n\n$$$$ - High-end (\\~$56-100)\n\n$$$$$ - Luxury/Medical Grade (\\~$100+)\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Disclosed Panthenol %\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [The Ordinary Amino Acids + B5](https://theordinary.deciem.com/product/rdn-amino-acids-b5-30ml?redir=1) (5% panthenol, 17% amino acids)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Gel B5 Pro-Recovery Skincare 40ml](https://www.escentual.com/la-roche-posay/larocheposay072/) ($$) - 5% panthenol, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, manganese gluconate, copper gluconate, vitamin e\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5 ($$) - 5% panthenol, shea butter, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, manganese gluconate, copper gluconate ( [https://www.escentual.com/lrpcicaplastbaume001/](https://www.escentual.com/lrpcicaplastbaume001/) )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [Medisei Panthenol Extra](https://www.ebay.com/itm/PANTHENOL-EXTRA-CREAM-FOR-IRRITATED-SENSITIVE-SKIN-WITH-PANTHENOL-UREA-100ML/263780836273?epid=2260763521&hash=item3d6a9023b1:g:4v0AAOSwZrdbMl27) ($) - 5% panthenol, 5% urea *(Comes in a 100ml tube, very light-weight.

Still probably way higher than most other brands).\n\nThough with these products in general, particularly for the ones with “real” (not pseudo/ceramide precursors), honestly I would be shocked if they were present at more than 0.1 %. Even if they come before the preservatives, the preservatives are probably present at like 0.9% so the company can list them after the fancy ingredients even though the expensive ingredients are at minuscule concentrations. Maybe I’m too cynical, but a >1% concentration of any ceramides would be such a HUGE selling point (not to mention very expensive to produce) that I can’t believe they’re not advertising it\n\nLike Regimen is coming out with one and they are trumpeting the HELL out of it (and I mean fair enough)",

    "body": "Hello folks! So my Physicians Formula booster and Olay Luminous booster came in the mail today!\n\nI'm just really excited to share because I searched HIGH AND LOW for affordable niacinamide products that have a high % of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLINK TO MY PICTURES:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/7ab5NZ8](https://imgur.com/a/7ab5NZ8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe PF I have not used before. But it's the FIRST affordable product that I came across that has high % of niacinamide AND  Acetyl glucosamine ---- not just those, but a small amount of supposedly the most powerful vitamin c derivative!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Niacinamide and NAG work synergistically together](https://lotioncrafter.com/products/n-acetyl-glucosamine-nag) to be a brightening powerhouse as well as repairing your skin barrier. They help boost your ceramide production and NAG is skin-identical.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**PHYSICIANS FORMULA SKIN BOOSTER - BRIGHTENING**](https://www.target.com/p/physicians-formula-skin-booster-vitamin-shot-brightening-1-fl-oz/-/A-75569193)  **$7.99/1 oz or 30ml**\n\n*Water, Butylene Glycol,* ***Niacinamide***\\*, Glycerin,\\* ***Acetyl Glucosamine***\\*, Pentylene Glycol, 1, 2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Disodium Edta, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Phenylethyl Resorcinol, Caesalpinia Spinosa Fruit Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Sodium Benzotriazolyl Butylphenol Sulfonate,\\* ***3-0-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid***\\*, Iron Oxides (Ci 77492), Tocopheryl Acetate, Phenoxyethanol, Vegetable Collagen, Agar, Calcium Alginate, Xanthan Gum, Kappaphycus Alvarezii Extract, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tropolone, Gluconolactone, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cynara Scolymus (Artichoke) Leaf Extract, Red 30 (Ci 73360), Sodium Benzoate.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like it's an \"inspired\" product of [**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**](https://www.paulaschoice.com/10pct-niacinamide-booster/798.html)**:**\n\n*Water (Aqua),* ***Niacinamide*** *(vitamin B3, skin-restoring ),* ***Acetyl Glucosamine*** *(skin replenishing/antioxidant),* ***Ascorbyl Glucoside*** *(vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative).*\n\nThe Paula's Choice obviously has more beneficial ingredients and higher % but still, it's **$44 for 0.67oz/20ml**.

Probably because Olay developed it. But it works great on its own as a brightener, and even better combined with vitamin c (which is why you see ascorbyl glucoside here, a stable derivative of ascorbic acid). The miracle boost USED to contain n-acetyl glucosamine (which is the one I used) as well the other ones listed here. But I guess it got too expensive or whatever.\n\nThis also has some other great ingredients, like xylitol, gylcerin, panthenol, zinc and copper gluconate for soothing and healing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used this booster in conjunction with the Luminous cream, which has niacinamide and NAG. My skin looked so much brighter and prettier. The texture was really smoothed out and my skin started getting a more like.. translucent ?? quality? You DO need to give brightening ingredients *at least 3 months* to work their magic though, especially for things like arbutin/hydroquinone. (Arbutin breaks down into hydroquinone.) But for niacinamide, I saw results for skin texture/overall brightening before that.\n\nI honestly couldn't believe the price Target was selling it for, because I got it for a much higher price elsewhere before. I couldn't keep affording it so I let it go, sadly. :'(\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe [**Luminous Tone Perfecting Treatment ($24.99)**](https://www.olay.com/en-us/skin-care-products/regenerist-luminous-tone-perfecting-treatment) is a simpler formula, but still has the same active ingredients.\n\n*Water,* ***Niacinamide\\*****, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Dimethicone,* ***Undecylenoyl Phenylalanine***\\*, Silica, Boron Nitride,\\* ***Ascorbyl Glucoside***\\*, Polyglyceryl-2 Oleate, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Dimethiconol, Aminomethyl Propanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Oleate, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium EDTA, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, \\*Vitamin B3\\*\n\nBut ironically, it costs more than the more complex booster if you purchase at Target online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DIY:**\n\nI have made DIY niacinamide NAG serums before. But because I'm too lazy to make it properly, they really lack penetration power. I'm really into cosmetic science and have read from professional cosmetic chemists that a simple DIY isn't effective if you don't do it right. You gotta keep the powders dissolved right and STAY dissolved instead of them recrystallizing on your skin and not penetrating your skin/being useless. I experimented for months with the DIY but I DEFINITELY noticed a difference as soon as I started using well-formulated, commercially available niacinamide serums.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy personal experience with certain products:\n\n\\- [**Eva Naturals 5% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-Niacinamide-Serum-Eva-Naturals/dp/B0147PDMYY/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=eva+naturals+niacinamide&amp;qid=1561763684&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-3)**:** Pretty awesome, works well, you get 2 oz. But it has avocado oil and such, and may break some people out. (This is definitely a private-label product and you can find the same exact formula for cheaper on DIY sites - which is why you see like 324982394 bottles of the same formula of everything from niacinamide to vitamin c serums on amazon.) I get the same sort of overall brightening and translucency I get with Olay. Better results with my other products, Benton 0.5% salicylic acid (very gentle) aloe BHA toner, Purito green level centella buffet serum (also has niacinamide, like 2%), and Naturie Hatomugi gel essence. Bright, translucent skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Cerave PM:** Supposedly has 4% niacinamide. Loved this as a lightweight moisturizer, but did NOT see the results I got with other niacinamide products. Makes me feel skeptical. Or perhaps there's a pretty big difference for my skin with 4% and 5%. I doubt it, but you know. Maybe it's just cuz it's formulated for skin-replenishing and not for brightening. But you'd think same ingredient will have same effects, y'know?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- [**Skinlex 10% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.skinlex.com/product/10-niacinamide-serum-60ml/)**:** Ingredient list looks GREAT and some others seem to love it, but I saw absolutely zero niacinamide benefits for my skin. Penetration issue?\n\nI have other products I've used with niacinamide, but these are the main ones I can remember on the top of my head. La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+ baume has it as well, but I do not know the %. Very good moisturizer for the body.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther commercial products you can find SEPIWHITE in:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- [**Black Opal skin care products**](https://blackopalbeauty.com/collections/skincare): They have multiple.

For as long as I could remember after starting Tret, it has been very red, sensitive and constantly peeling no matter the season and how much moisturizing skincare products I pile on. On top of that, my acne situation didn't entirely clear up, but tretinoin did help diminish a large amount of it. With the sensitivity, I couldn't use products with a long ingredient list, or sunscreens (chemical or physical), they all burned. Talked to dermatologist about it, they recommended lowering the strength and simplifying routine, but none of it seemed to help. Few months ago, I started looking into impaired skin barrier functions as a result of longterm high strength tretinoin use. I began slowly changing out and incorporating La Roche Posay skincare into my routine. I can finally say that my skin barrier appears to have improved a lot and now is no longer as sensitive as before. I attribute the healing of skin barrier to these products. Hopefully it can help others.\n\n**Eau Thermal** \\- their own branded thermal spring water. I use this as first step. Sometimes I use it after toning with BR Lotion P50. I don't know how I feel about it. I've used this one, Avene and Evian. I feel like most of the aerosol spring waters do similar things. It definitely helps with moisture building for rest of the routine. For 5.1 floz, it's quite expensive. I won't repurchase, I'll opt for the bigger Evians at Marshall/TJMAXX.\n\n**Cicaplast Gel B5** \\- This is amazing. I love this and the baume B5. I use the gel version in the morning as a base layer moisturizer due to the difference in thickness/feel, and then top it off with Vanicream. The gel and baume both have centella, zinc gluconate and B5. Those 3 ingredients works wonder for my skin. Highly highly recommend this to people who respond well to Baume B5 and want something less occlusive and oily for daytime. It's also surprisingly great for scar healing. Would repurchase 100x.\n\n**Active Vitamin C 10%** \\- This is great considering the price point and delivery vehicle/packaging. I've used Skinceutical (same parent company btw), Timeless, Maelove and Drunk Elephant. I would go back to this because the thin lotion formulation works well with the rest of the LRP products. Also the vitamin C level is only 10%, so it's less irritating than some other vitamin C products. The packaging is also interesting, it's a squeeze tube with a tiny spout that appears to be air tight, because you can literally see the product spill outside of the tube change color as it oxidizes over time. It has done a good job fading PIH, so I would repurchase.\n\n**LIPKAR AP+M Baume** \\- This is a newer EU version of the american LIPKAR AP+ formulation. As far as I can tell, the main difference is that it doesn't contain mineral oil. The texture is also very different than the American version, as it dries down very matte and dry touch feel, rather than oily and shiny. At the same time, it's just as occlusive and able to stifle transepidermal water loss as the AP+ version. With regards to the Microbiome Science claim, I think it's related to the pre-biotic or pro-biotic properties of the thermal water used in all their formulation. So in theory, all of their products are that functionality. I prefer the AP+M just because it's more elegant and dry feel after application, can be used day and night on face or body. I like it, would repurchase.\n\n**Cicaplast Baume B5** \\- HOLY GRAIL status. WTF is in this baume, can they make a bath version of this so I can soak up all its healing properties?? It is literally life changing. Hands down, I think this product changed my skincare game. My skin barrier has changed for the better after incorporating this and I noticed it within a week. I use this as a last step in my routine to seal everything in, and I apply a very generous amount, to the point that I look slightly pale (because it has zinc/titanium dioxide). Your skin will look shiny and pale, and it'll takes some time (about 30 min) to absorb and die down, but the result is SO worth it. There is definitely a trick to applying this baume. I've read some people feel it's too thick and greasy, white/pasty and clings onto dry spot. YES to all of those observations. What I found that works for me is to moisturize with something light beforehand, like Vanicream or LRP toleraine ultra. The Baume B5 will sit nicely on top, and won't pill. Some people slug with Vaseline and Aquaphor, I slug with Cicaplast Baume B5. I restocked 10 bottles of this just last week because there was a sale at CVS. I can rave about this for years, but reddit won't let me. I'm committed for life now.\n\n**Cicaplast Lips** \\- I got this from an european site (caretobeauty), just because I was such a big fan of Cicaplast line in general. I have to say I won't be repurchasing. It's good, but nothing chapstick can't compete with.\n\n**Toleraine Ultra day/night** \\- Love the packaging and simple ingredient list. Truly these 2 products are for sensitive skin types. Prior to purchasing, I've heard that people prefer the day version because it feels more nourishing and moisturizing than the night/blue one. People are correct, I also prefer the day/white one for the same exact reason. The night version is more like a lotion texture while the day version is like thicker and creamier. The day version also has a nice matte dry down feel, while the night version dries with dewiness/wet feel. Either way, I use these as my 2nd to last, or final moisturizer (depending on the day). Definitely layer Baume B5 on top of these if you want a nice even spread. I would repurchase the day one, but probably not the night one and just use the day one for both morning and night. Up to your own skin type and condition, but I don't mind either. Overall, the toleraine line is super gentle for sensitive skin.\n\n**Toleraine Hydrating Gentle Cleanser** (not shown in picture) - I use this as a cleanser. It's my HG cleanser. Super gentle, non irritating. The niacinamide in the formulation does pose a very quick temporary initial sting upon application, but fades very quickly esp considering how quick I wash off. But my skin doesn't feel stripped after washing, it actually feels normal. It's non foaming and last a long time (bottle is huge), so will definitely keep repurchasing.\n\nIn general, I trust La Roche Posay products, I think they have a fantastic range of products that's for everyone. For sensitive skin, I find the Toleraine & Cicaplast range to be super helpful in my journey to recover the skin barrier function. As always, skincare is very personal and YMMV.",

Loved their moisturiser too but then I broke out in cystic pimples and closed comedones which stopped after stopping that moisturiser and using BP, so now I'm suspicious if it was the moisturiser and the silicones in it.... But even tho i had those problems my skin was finally hydrated.",

But every time i try this, it goes really bad. Like: i have nothing to say, do not dare to express my emotions, cannot dance or sing at a party even after lots of alcohol, make mistakes, always look nervous to the point of people pointing it out a lot, etc. So thats why i wonder if anyone has the same problem and what you have tried for social anxiety.

A bit of a calm effect physically but didnt change my anxiety.\n- magnesium glycinate. Gave me horribly increase of my bad impulsivoty (i am only impulsive in a negative way: procrastination and internet addiction and anger). \n- glycine alone. Same effect as magnesium glycinate.\n- magnesium malate. Slightly more calm and reduced negative impulsivity but not much effect on social anxiety.\n- magnesium threonate. No positive effect although it maybe wasnt a good brand\n- taurine: maybe a bit of a decrease in anxiety but not social anxiety as far as i can remember. Will try it again soon\n- omega 3 fish oil. Tried a few times from different brands. No effect or lowered mood. Will try both dha and epa algae oil soon.\n- inositol. Need to test this more. Small Mood elevation and calmth/improved sleep\n- magnesium oxide. Only helped for negative impulsivity but sometimes disturbs sleep. \n- zizyphus jujube, dried and pills. Made me laugh more once, then stopped working. \n- b vitamins, isolated as well as in different b vitamin combination preparations: no effect or increased restlesness/ negative impulsivity. Only reduced anxiety once with a b complex but never again so might have been a coincidence.\n- valerian : makes me too drowsy and smell bad but a bit effective for anxiety. Not much and not for social anxiety.\n- lemon balm. Good for social anxiety though it only makes me more calm not more extraverted. But it impairs my memory (this is scientifically proven). Edit: after taking it a few times, sometimes the memory impairment doesn’t seem that bad especially at low doses. Its the most effective remedy so far. However, i am not sure if i can stop taking it due to my suspiced condition since its an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. need to continue it to find out.\n- gaba tea: no effect\n- lavender: only tried lavender oil tea. No effect\n- tulsi: only helps a bit for procrastination.. sometimes\n- sam-e: increased my mood and reduced my anger, but stopped working after a few weeks and dose of 1000mg. Also it caused bad insomnia. I also feel that because it is methionine it might cause you to smell bad. But i might try it again sometimes because my leftover pills expire this summer. \n- q10: slightly increased cognition or no effect, increased insomnia if there was any effect\n- pqq: increased anxiety\n- carnosine: no effect\n- vitamin d/k: because i had confirmed low vitamin d i took this for a long time, both normal pills as drops and oil based ones. In normal and high doses. However it either had no or a really slight effect on mood and increased my fatigue and the mct oil based drops made my hair greasy. \n- ashwagandha: didnt help and i got weird symptoms from it like greasy hair and weird smell?? So i stopped\n- n-acetylcysteine (NAC) i noticed no effects from pharmaceutical NAC except for smelling bad. Which makes sense since its cysteine and i guess i cannot digest it very well sadly. \n- kombucha from a specific brand: lessened rumination but only once, might try it again\n- this herb from africa that increases serotonin (kanna): not much effect in either tea or pills \n- uridine: mood improvement once then stopped working, afraid to take again since its not welk researched\n- saffron extract: no effect\n- lions mane, reishi etc: made me cry more and maybe lessened my anger but not much other effects \n- rhodiola on its own: no effect at all or overstimulation that made me feel restless.\n- CBD oil: only tried in the form of drinks and dark chocolate. Made me a bit more calm but didn’t help my social anxiety. However, if i took it at night the next morning it sometimes decreased my negative impulsivity.\n- zinc: maybe slight increase in self confidence but zinc gluconate made me feel really bad, it had some other ingredients in it though like acerola which i often react badly to. Will try picolinate soon. \n- l tyrosine, dlpa, l citrulline, beta alanine, tryptophan and 5 htp, nalt , different brands: no or barely any effect or only once\n- passion flower tea and tincture, different brands: only increased my negative impulsitivy/agitation\n- l theanine, different brands: only increased my negative impulsivity\n- bacopa: helped with negative impulsivity but not other symptoms\n- melatonin: made me wake up more and didnt really have an effect except for maybe slightly more drowsiness in the evening and lowered mood sometimes.\n\nI try to have a healthy lifestyle (trying to eat lots of vegetables , fruits, whole carbs protein healthy foods and limit sugar and processed foods, trying to get as much sleep as possible, exercise, do breathing exercises/meditation and try to relax with activities like reading and listening to music. i rarely party and at the rare special occasions i now never drink more than 3 glasses of alcohol) and it helps a bit but not for this. \n\nIf i forgot anything i will add it later.",

I viewed them sort of like training wheels and I knew I would have to learn to take them off someday which I now have. \nSome people may be confused why someone would have such a long list but I know that its probably years of trying different things that work somewhat but changes need to be made once they stop to work as well.\n\n\nThe most helpful for me have been\n-Nigella sativa or black seed oil powder from ND\n\n-Fresh Nutmegs, crushed ground up and capsuled. ( probably the most effective actually.) I used to take one capsule daily with a cup coffee. (3pm) Coffee actually enhanced the effects the more I drank.\n\nNutmeg seems to have a reverse tolerance where the longer I take it the stronger it gets. It got to the point where I used this for probably more than one year where It got to strong and felt more like getting stoned on anti anxiety Marijuana, I actually had to stop. No negative effects to report when stopping. No withdrawals such as cannibis can have withdrawal symptoms.\n\n-Also effective is Cistanche tubulrosa. One capsule of the ND powder along with a little apigenin and Magnesium biglycinate taken before bed. The anti anxiety effects continue to build every day and I actually was very surprised how effective it is. This needs to be cycled for me because to take it continually it makes me aggressive or starts to cause estrogen problems because it does raise testosterone and that later makes for raised estrogen if I take it to long.\n\nFor occasional use also very effective are antioxidants.\nGotu kola and pomegranate extracts with coffee. Astaxanthin and beta carotene with a small fat source meal.Not to be used daily.\n\nCurrently I mostly use Magnesium. And occasional antioxidants and Cistanche.\nWhat I also did is lower caffeine intake. Lowered alcahol intake from daily to around only once or twice a month (very important). I no longer have addictions and urges to run for a supplement to escape anxiety or bad feelings. I also work quite a bit and Im pretty busy in achieving goals and improvements.",

I tried the regular LLMD route, even treating with one of the best LLMDs in the world. They resolved some of my symptoms, but I still had terrible fatigue and autonomic dysfunction. \n\nA random redditor reached out to me and suggested some supplements for me to try, and that inspired me to start experimenting with different DIY treatments. Those experiments ultimately led to getting much of my function back. So I want to share the knowledge I've gained, in case it can help anyone else here. \n\nI'm not a medical doctor, and I can't give any medical advice. I'm just sharing my own personal experiences and information that is available in books and scientific articles. I find myself often typing all of this out in comments, so I figured I would put it in a post. Everything here is about Lyme, rather than coinfections, but please leave a comment if you need some resources for coinfections. \n\n# Buhner's core protocol\n\nFrom Stephen Buhner's book Healing Lyme (2nd ed), this protocol is designed to provide support for your body in various ways, protecting the body from damage from Lyme, controlling inflammation, and support your immune system, as well as killing Lyme directly. These are the herbs and supplements in the core protocol:\n\n* Japanese knotweed (often sold as resveratrol) - for protecting endothelial structures from damage by Lyme\n* Dan shen (red sage) - for controlling inflammation (cytokines)\n* Baical skullcap - for controlling inflammation (cytokines)\n* Gelatin - for protecting collagen in your brain and joints\n* Cat's claw (uncaria tomentosa) - for immune support\n* Cordyceps - for immune support\n* Ashwagandha - for immune support\n* Eleuthero - for immune support\n* Licorice - for immune support\n* Andrographis - for killing Lyme bacteria\n* Gou teng (uncaria rhynchophylla) - for neuro-Lyme\n\nBuhner recommends starting all of these at a low dose and gradually increasing your dose. I disagree with this approach. I have had unpleasant side effects and drug interactions from some herbs. Because I only started one new herb at a time, it was not difficult for me to figure out which one was the culprit. \n\nI highly recommend keeping notes of when you start each herb. Wait at least a week between adding a new one. Two weeks is better, because some of these have a long half-life and the side effects won't start immediately.\n\n**It is very important to read the full details on each herb before you start it.** Buhner has the details on each herb in the Materia Medica chapter of his book. It explains any side effects to watch out for and any drug interactions that Buhner is aware of. \n\nBe careful, because sometimes he is not aware of a drug interaction (i.e. coumadin should not be taken with turmeric but he does not mention this). If you are on any other medications, I recommend researching it yourself rather than just taking Buhner's word for it. Google and Google Scholar are your friend (search for \"drug name\" + \"herb name\" + \"interaction\"). The [Healing Well forum](https://www.healingwell.com/community/default.aspx?f=30) is also a good place to search. Even if you have an LLMD overseeing your treatment with these herbs, they are sometimes (often?) unaware of drug-herb interactions. See my post on [CYP3A4](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lyme/comments/jwg1mt/what_lyme_patients_should_know_about_cyp3a4_drug/) to start learning about drug interactions.\n\n# MSIDS model\n\nDr. Horowitz has a [helpful paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/6/4/129/htm) that also discusses supporting the body in various ways beyond just killing Lyme. There is a significant overlap with the areas that Buhner addresses. However, Buhner is not a medical professional ~~and never treated patients whereas Horowitz is constantly experimenting with new treatments with his patients~~. Having a good understanding of both can help you get ideas for new approaches to try. \n\nHorowitz has [a book](https://www.amazon.com/How-Can-Get-Better-Resistant-ebook/dp/B01B1MWLVQ) that covers similar material, but is easier to understand than the scientific article. As a disclaimer, I haven't read the book, because the article is a lot shorter!\n\nI won't detail everything about the MSIDS model here because it would really need its own post (probably more than one). I recommend reading through his article or book to see if there are any areas that you think you need more support in. For example, I had bad fatigue, and I knew that mitochondrial dysfunction leads to fatigue, so Horowitz's paper gave me ideas for treatments to experiment with.\n\n# My personal experience\n\nMy worst symptoms after antibiotic treatment were fatigue and orthostatic intolerance. I discontinued treatment and eventually became mostly bedbound. I felt too weak to do much, so I spent more time in bed, and eventually my muscles got very deconditioned. It was a vicious cycle.\n\nAfter trying some supplements recommended by a fellow Lymie, I started experimenting with the Buhner protocol. I tried each component (although I never got around to trying andrographis). Some of them helped, and some of them did not. \n\nThen I added in mitochondrial support after reading the MSIDS paper. My LLMD recommended ATP Fuel and ATP 360 from Researched Nutritionals. I also began to use RibosCardio from the same brand, but I have since started to blend that one myself ([here is my recipe](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lyme/comments/klp2ey/where_to_draw_the_line_on_treatment/ghepqv9/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=0)). \n\n**Eleuthero root changed my life**, once I found the dose that works for me. Before eleuthero, I had begun to start taking short walks (1-2 blocks) with the help of Japanese knotweed, dan shen, and the mitochondrial supplements. After eleuthero, I was able to start exercising at the gym for 30-60 minutes, 2-4 times per week. As my body got reconditioned, I could do more and more \"normal\" things, like run errands, cook meals, and go for long walks. Buhner does not mention that eleuthero can help with orthostatic intolerance or autonomic dysfunction, but it has helped mine tremendously.\n\nI'm also now able to work from home, 30 hours per week. I made a career change during the worst of my illness so that I would be able to have some kind of income, but I was only working part-time hours from bed in the beginning. I'm now established in my new career and starting to make up for lost time.\n\n# A note on self-treatment\n\nI began self-treatment because I felt like I had exhausted the traditional LLMD avenues. I had treated with Horowitz but it seemed like he was running out of ideas to try (this was back before disulfiram and dapsone were on the scene). I was also pretty broke and couldn't spend much on treatment anymore.\n\nHowever, when you go the self-treatment route, you are the only one responsible for what happens to you. It is on you to do all of the research to ensure that what you are taking is safe. \n\nWith what I now know, I would highly recommend having an herbalist oversee treatment with the Buhner protocol if you can afford it. Buhner's partner has recommendations [here](https://juliemcintyre.net/herbal-consultations/), under \"Additional Resources.\" If you can find an LLMD who is familiar with herbs, such as an integrative medicine LLMD, then they will be able to also prescribe you medications if needed. I had a relapse of cognitive symptoms this year, which I have not had since I completed antibiotic treatment 7 years ago. So I am currently doing a round of disulfiram, and plan to add antibiotics soon.\n\n# My current protocol\n\nMy protocol might seem overwhelming, but keep in mind it was built up over 3 years of experimentation. I added in one herb or supplement at a time, took notes as to any benefits or side effects that I saw, and gradually built up to this. I started out with inexpensive Buhner herbs. As I got better, my earning potential increased, so I was able to afford a more complicated protocol, more expensive supplements, and regular visits with an LLMD.\n\nFrom Buhner's core protocol:\n\n* Eleuthero root - 15 drops of 1:3 extract per day\n* Japanese knotweed - 2 g/day (I paused this because of disulfiram, but highly recommend trying it)\n* Cat's claw (uncaria tomentosa) - 1g/day\n* Gou teng (uncaria rhynchophylla) - 5 drops of 1:3 extract per day\n* Ashwagandha - 1/2 tsp powder per day\n* Red root - 10 drops of 1:3 extract per day\n* Red sage - 3 drops of 1:3 extract per day (this one gives me side effects if I go higher)\n* Baical skullcap - 3 drops of 1:3 extract per day (this one gives me side effects if I go higher)\n* Selenium - 200 mcg once per week\n* Biotin - 5 mg/day\n\nFor mitochondrial dysfunction:\n\n* ATP Fuel from Researched Nutritionals - 3 capsules/day\n* ATP 360 from Researched Nutritionals - 3 capsules/day\n* DIY RibosCardio - 1 tsp of [this blend](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lyme/comments/klp2ey/where_to_draw_the_line_on_treatment/ghepqv9/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=0), or 1 scoop of the Researched Nutritionals version\n* Acetylcarnitine\n\nGeneral supplements:\n\n* Fish oil - 2g/day\n* Calcium - 500 mg/day\n* Vitamin D - 700 IU/day\n* Magnesium - 250 mg/day\n* Vitamin B6 - 200 mg/day\n* Vitamin B12 - 1 mg/day\n\nFor detox:\n\n* Milk thistle extract - 150 mg/day\n* Spirulina - 1g/day\n* Chlorella - 1.2 g/day\n\nTo reduce inflammation:\n\n* Turmeric extract - 800 mg/day\n\nFor sleep:\n\n* Trazodone - 75 mg\n* Melatonin - 1 mg\n\nDisulfiram & disulfiram-related support:\n\n* Disulfiram - 94 mg/day\n* Dihydromyricetin - 300 mg/day\n* L-ornithine - 500 mg/day\n* N-acetyl-cysteine -  600 mg/day\n* Zinc gluconate - 25 mg/day\n* Nattokinase - 2,000 FU/day\n\n# Support group?\n\n~~I saw a comment from someone who is new to herbal treatments and wished that there was a support group for this stuff. I would be happy to organize a biweekly Zoom call to discuss herbal treatments like this, how to experiment with different treatments, or even just to vent. Please leave a comment or DM me if you're interested.~~\n\nEdit: Corrected a typo and the name of an herb.\n\nEdit 2: Buhner did treat patients, but does not any longer. Horowitz is still treating patients and developing new treatments, so I recommend following his research.\n\nEdit 3 (Feb 2024): I am not running a support group but someone else on this sub is.

There are lots of reasons why, but you covered it with the basics in that drug-drug interactions can occur.   Supplements are also untested and generally unregulated, so you have to be really careful with sourcing, as well.  The way you went about creating your own care is a good example for others who suffer with Lyme and I think you safely adding in herbs/supplements over time is a good way to go compared to just jumping on 10 herbs in combination at once.  A big problem that mainstream medicine has with prescribing this type of stuff is that its very untested and unregulated, and thus the chances of having an adverse reaction is greatly increased with this stuff.\n\nPS: I'd up the vitamin D to at least 5,000 IU's per day and if possible get off Trazodone in time, but this was a useful post (I was a pharmacist and I've been dealing with Lyme for longer, but I've been managing my own symptoms with lifestyle + supplementation since 2009).  Trazodone can cause drowsiness in general, but if you really need it to sleep then its difficult without something like that",

    "body": "Since I've been having a hard time finding reviews for foreign products (I'm in the USA) I thought I would review one and possibly help someone else out! This review is for [Avène Cleanance Sun Care SPF 50+](https://www.cocooncenter.co.uk/avene-cleanance-sun-care-spf-50-50ml/22947.html) I purchased this from Cocooncenter, a website that ships European products to loads of different countries!\n\n**My skin for reference:**\n\nExtremely oily, dehydrated, sensitive, not particularly acne-prone. My morning routine while trying this was just CeraVe foaming cleanser, Cosrx Centella toner, and this sunscreen.\n\n**Product name:** \n\nAvène Cleanance Sun Care SPF 50+ (50ml) - $13.62 USD before shipping from Cocooncenter.\n\n**Product type:** \n\nDaily use sunscreen\n\n**Product description:** \n\ntaken directly from the website - \"Avène Cleanance Sun Care SPF 50+ is a cream of very high protection specially formulated for oily to acne prone skin exposed to intense sunlight. This cream contains a photo-protective active complex which insure a high protection against all of the solar radiation UVB and UVA long and short. It also contains a powerful antioxidant, as well as monolaurin which allows to matify the skin thanks to its seboregulator action. Its light and fluid texture protects, moisturizes, and matifies the skin without leaving any white effect after its application.\"\n\n**Ingredients:** \n\nThis sunscreen is advertised as silicone and paraben free, and it also happens to be free of alcohol, oxybenzone, octinoxate, and most other American filters (contains avobenzone). This sunscreen would be considered reef safe to Hawaii's standards. Its filters are Tinosorbs M & S, Uvasorb HEB, and Avobenzone.\n\nAvene Thermal Spring Water (Avene Aqua), C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Methylene Bis-Benzatriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol [Nano], Cetearyl Isononanoate Water (Aqua), Disopropyl Adipate, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Glyceryl Laurate Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Benzoic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Glyceryl Behenate, Glyceryl Dibehenate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides Hydrogenated Palm Kernel Glycerides, Propylène Glycol, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl, Glucoside, Tribehennin, Xanthan Gum, Zinc Gluconate. \n\n**My opinion:** \n\nI wore this sunscreen for about a month before quitting (about three weeks ago). This sunscreen is quite matte. Definitely the most matte alcohol-free sunscreen I've ever tried. It is a thin lotion, but because of the high concentration of Tinosorbs it is slightly sticky and doesn't rub in very well. Once it dries, the stickiness is greatly reduced. It is a matte upon application, and stays matte for a few hours, but it is not \"mattifying\" in that it doesn't prevent my oil from shining through the sunscreen later in the day. I get greasy eventually, but it is still much better than any other sunscreen.\n\nIt leaves a slight white cast, mainly in streaks where I couldn't completely rub it in. After it completely dries, the white cast is mostly gone. It just stays white in patches around my nose and near my hairline. For reference, I am extremely pale, lighter-than-the-lightest-shade-of-foundation pale, so it would definitely show up white on anyone dark.\n\nThe sunscreen is very fragranced, and I can smell it all day long unless I apply makeup over it. It definitely irritates my senses and makes my skin itch when first applied. If you are sensitive to fragrance I would avoid this sunscreen. It didn't break me out, and is advertised for acne skin, so I can assume it will be safe for people who are acne prone. I ended up quitting on this sunscreen because I was too sensitive to the fragrance and couldn't wear it out of the house without foundation to hide the streaks.\n\n**Overall Rating:**\n\nI would rate this sunscreen 6.5/10 - it is matte, which I like, and it is free of alcohol/octinoxate/oxybenzone etc., which are big plusses. The cons, that kinda outweigh the pros, are that it is fragranced, slightly streaky, and difficult to rub in. I would not repurchase this sunscreen, it is just too expensive to ship for a very small/mediocre product. \n\n**Additional mini-review: Avène Sun Care Lip SPF 30 Lip Stick**\n\nThis SPF lip balm is AMAZING. Definitely the best lip balm I've tried with sun protection included. It uses the Tinosorbs and Avobenzone as filters. It has no nasty sunscreen taste, no weird texture. It's high protection to keep your lips safe from UVA. The only cons I have are that it's quite matte, and I prefer shiny lip balms. You could easily apply lip color on top of it for a day out. It also contains fragrance, but I don't notice it whatsoever. I give this a 9.5/10.\n\n[Avène Sun Care Lip SPF 30 Lip Stick - $6.33 USD / 3g](https://www.cocooncenter.co.uk/avene-sun-care-lip-spf-30-lip-stick-3g/12848.html) - Ingredients: Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil (Ricinys Communis Seed Oil), C 12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dipentaerythrityl Tetrahydroxystearate/Tetraisostearate, Ozokerite, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Beeswax (Cera Alba), Myristyl Lactate, Dimethicone, Esters, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Bis Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Copernica Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax (Cera Carnauba), VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Octocrylene, Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene Aqua), BHT, Decyl Glucoside, Parfum (Fragrance), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Propylene Glycol, Silica, Titanium Dioxyde, Tocopheryl Glucoside, Aqua, Xanthan Gum.\n\n**Overall, I feel that if you have oily, acne-prone skin that is not sensitive to fragrance and can handle a slight white cast, you could like this sunscreen. Most people would like the lip balm!**\n\nEdit: added some info",

    "body": "*Moisturisers seem to be the most boring and ignored category in a skincare regime but I have learnt over the years that they actually play the most important role. Sometimes actives are not what your skin is looking for and a good moisturiser can be the game-changer.*\n\n[Just a pic](https://preview.redd.it/p39fzjc4kx661.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=027cc219d95e8947525507a3beec33a9d459f961)\n\nBefore I review the products, these are my expectations from my moisturiser.\n\n1. ***Hydrate:*** Bring water/moisture to my skin\n2. ***Emolliate:*** Thanks to kindofstephen (google his blog or insta if you haven't) for providing a term to my feelings. Make my skin soft and supple by nourishing my stratum corneum with nourishing lipids without clogging my pores.\n3. ***Strengthen my barrier:*** To reduce TEWL by strengthening my barrier so that my skin stays hydrated and supple for longer. This also means I want the moisturiser to have slight occlusive properties.\n4. ***Repair:*** To help my damaged/sensitised skin by repairing my skin barrier.\n5. ***Extras/added benefits:*** Would like if the moisturiser additionally helps to deliver certain ingredients that help with targetted issues like ageing, hyperpigmentation etc. This is not a must though.\n\n\\---\n\n***1. Avene Skin Recover Cream -*** ₹*1500 (depends on discounts); Cost Per gm: ₹30/gm*\n\nThis is my go-to skin-emergency product. I do not use it on daily basis. The texture is cloudlike but not mousse-y. It is a lightweight cream. Nevertheless, it packs a punch. I have gone through 8+ tubes of this stuff. It is the only cream that does not aggravate any sensitised areas (burning/redness/dry patches/peeling patches) and absolutely calms my skin. This cream is true to its name. Repairs compromised flaking, sensitised skin in two days with twice/thrice a day usage. The ingredient list is very minimalistic. It is expensive and the sterile patented packaging kind of sucks because you will most definitely have face squirts if you are not careful. However, I can rely on this cream to fix my skin mistakes.\n\n* Hydrate: 4/5\n* Emmoliate: 4/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 4.5/5\n* Extras: 0/5\n* Status: HG, It is easily available in India but shit is expensive.\n\n***Perfect for: All skin types, Sensitive skin***\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene Aqua), Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Squalane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Serine, Carbomer, Tetrasodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, Water (Aqua)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***2. Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream -*** *$10/* ₹*1300 (with shipping/customs); Cost per gm* ₹6.5/gm\n\nI tried this product a month back and I am in love. This cream is perfectly balanced. It adequately hydrates and emolliates my skin. My skin feels supple and bouncy without being too greasy and the moisture lasts. I did not see noticeable calming benefits but as a moisturiser it is lovely. The tube is huge and a little goes a long way. This has a slight cooling effect when applied to the skin. Also uses a patented encapsulation delivery mechanism to delivery pseudo-ceramides (lab-made) which help to strengthen your skin barrier. In short, it is a simple no frill moisturiser that is easy to use - not too thick, not too thin, not too heavy, not too light, doesn't sensitize, not too silicone-y, doesn't pill, value for money.\n\n* Hydrate: 4/5\n* Emmoliate: 4/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 3.5/5\n* Extras: 0/5\n* Status: will repurchase.\n\n***Perfect for: All skin types***\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Stearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Palmitic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide Mea, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Magnolia Biondii Flower Extract, Cholesterol, Perilla Ocymoides Seed Extract, Lactobacillus/​Soybean Ferment Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohols, Glyceryl Caprylate, Dimethiconol, Mannitol, Cyclohexasiloxane, Silica, Arachidyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Alcohol, Acrylates/​Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polysorbate 20, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Propanediol*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***3. Eucerin Q10 Anti Wrinkle Face Cream -*** *$9*\n\nThis is my third tub of this cream. This cream is richer than any cream in the lot. It has a thick emollient texture without being too greasy. It absorbs easily in the skin. It also contains shea butter, SAP and Ubiquinone (Q10). This cream has helped me transition into tretinoin. Do not recommend it for day time use (especially in summers) but for night time/winters it is perfect. It keeps my face moisturised through the night and it has a soft blurring effect on fine lines/skin texture. It did not sensitize peeling skin but helped repair my barrier. I use this regularly at night and it helped to fix the acute dryness that comes with tretinoin. I use it around my eyes and it hasn't given me milia/ clogged my pores. My mom loves and swears by it. She finds it makes her wrinkles look softer.\n\n* Hydrate: 3.5/5\n* Emmoliate: 4.5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 4/5\n* Extras: 3/5\n* Status: HG but not readily available in India. Will stock up when relatives come post covid.\n\n***Perfect for:*** *Combo-dehydrated/Dry/ Mature skin*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Cocoate, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Stearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Octyldodecanol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ubiquinone, Biotin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Zea Mays (Corn) Oil, Beta-Carotene, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Trisodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Phenoxyethanol*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***4. Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume -*** ₹*1300 (with shipping/customs); Cost per gm* ₹6.5/gm\n\nThis cream is unique. As the name suggests it is a cream-balm hybrid but the texture is surprisingly lightweight. Highly emollient with occlusive properties. It absorbs quickly into the skin as the texture is not too heavy. Sadly, it leaves a greasy feeling/film on my skin. I can not use it the day time and worry that it will clog my pores if I use it on my face. I love it for the body especially my Sahara hands. It seriously brings life to my hands and I do not need to reapply often. I did notice a calming effect. Many of my friends from the community love to use it on their face. It is a little too heavy for my face. If your face is very dry, I think you may like this.\n\n* Hydrate: 3/5\n* Emmoliate: 5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 3.5/5\n* Extras: 0\n* Status: WNRP at least for my face.\n\n***Perfect for:***  *Extremely Dry Skin*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Aqua/​Water/​Eau, Glycerin, Paraffinum Liquidum /​ Mineral Oil /​ Huile Minerale, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Behenyl Alcohol, Sucrose Stearate, Canola /​ Canola Oil /​ Huile De Colza, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Pentylene Glycol, Beta-Sitosterol, Xylitol, Zinc Gluconate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Palmitamide Mea, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Rhamnose, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 60, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Phytosphingosine, Ceramide Np, Mannitol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceramide Ap, Cholesterol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Ceramide EOP*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***5. Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream -*** ₹2700 *(estimated); Cost per gm* ₹45/gm\n\nI was sort of disappointed with this product. It is not a bad product but it is not necessarily better. The soft blue colour deceives your mind to think the cream texture may be light. It is actually slightly thick with a silicone-y feel. It has a cooling effect on the skin when you first apply it which tricks the calming feeling. While it is hydrating when you first apply it but compared to others I feel the moisture does not last as long. Also, it makes the sensitised area skin sort of burn. The feeling is not intense but very much against claims. I did not notice any calming/repairing benefits. It may also not be enough moisturisation for the winters. The colour is aesthetically pleasing and silicone-y texture + cooling feel can outwit you into enjoying application but I do not see many real benefits.\n\n* Hydrate: 3/5\n* Emmoliate: 2.5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 3/5\n* Repair: 3/5\n* Extras: 1?\n* Status: WNRP, Expensive.\n\n***Perfect for:***  *Oily/ Combo Dehydrated Skin?*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Centella Asiatica Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Glyceryl Stearate, Stearic Acid, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Polysorbate 60, Bees Wax, Chlorphenesin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Morus Alba Root Extract, Tromethamine, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Guaiazulene, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Lecithin, Acetyl Glutamine, SH-Oligopeptide-1, SH-Oligopeptide-2, SH-Polypeptide-1, SH-Polypeptide-9, SH-Polypeptide-11, Bacillus/​Soybean/​Folic Acid Ferment Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol*\n\n&#x200B;",

Couldn't find anything conclusive about the effectiveness of each form, but that \"cadmium\" claim is alarming. I already know that the supplements industry is not tightly regulated, so...\n\nEDIT: I found [this](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11474903/) and it's pretty old (2001).\n\n>The four supplements in the lower category were single mineral, Zn-only tablets comprised of the gluconate or citrate/amino acid chelate/picolinate forms of Zn. The three formulations within the higher Cd concentration category were multi-mineral products containing a variety of other minerals in addition to Zn (which was in the form of a sulfate or amino acid chelate). The Zn used in these latter three high Cd multi-mineral supplements may have been of a lower grade or purity compared to the four single-element products.\n\n&#x200B;",

There are various forms of Zinc available and we can never be sure which supplement contains what exactly unless there're independent lab testings. However, my other concern would be regarding the possible mineral imbalances (beside heavy metals toxicity) that may occur with high dosing and/or prolonged intake. I found Zinc really helpful for a number of health aspects including libido but the benefits were transient for me and I'd always slip back into other issues and imbalances. The same applies to other minerals. That's why I now believe real food is the way to go to obtain Zinc and other necessary minerals to ensure proper balance.

It's nice to use during winter, since it doesn't foam up nor dry out the skin. It has some pink capsules in it that melt into the skin, but they didn't bother me. WRP\n\nBeauty of Joseon ☆ Glow Serum: This was my second bottle. It has a thick, gloopy consistency, yet it absorbs well and doesn't dry down tacky. It's great for acne-prone skin. I like to use it if I have a breakout, since it helps to calm it down. WRP\n\nNoughty ☆ To The Rescue Intense Moisture Treatment: This was my second jar. It's a nice hair mask, it has a pleasant scent and it leaves your hair silky and moisturised. No complaints! WRP\n\nThe Ordinary ☆ Multi-Peptide + Copper Peptides 1% Serum: I was super excited to try this, but I ended up with mix feelings. I don't think that copper peptides are my thing, at least not in high concentrations. This serum didn't break me out, give me an allergic reaction, irritate my skin – nothing like that. My skin would just look a bit dull and lifeless the morning after I'd used this serum. I ended up giving up and using the rest of it on my body. WNRP\n\nOngredients ☆ Deep Calming Cream: This was an interesting product. It's very, very thick and buttery, probably the thickest moisturiser I've ever used. It can be difficult to spread and melt into the skin. It was very moisturising, which I enjoyed, but it was too heavy for my taste. WNRP\n\nCosrx ☆ Ultra-Light Invisible Sunscreen SPF50: This was my third tube. It's everything you could wish from a sunscreen; light, breathable, unscented, pretty affordable, high spf, broad spectrum, non-irritating, doesn't sting your eyes, doesn't clog pores, doesn't pill... Well, it isn't water-resistant, so there's that, but otherwise it's amazing. One of my holy grails. WRP\n\nBioderma ☆ Atoderm Intensive Baume: I loved this cream. It contains cholesterol, fatty acids, zinc gluconate, and three types of ceramides. It has a fluffy, creamy consistency and it absorbs well. It insantly floods my skin with moisture and it's been a great help in dealing with dry weather and adapalene side effects. WRP\n\nDove ☆ Indulging Ritual Hand Cream With Oat Milk And Acacia Honey: It was nice! It has a faint, sweet scent of oat which I enjoyed. I often struggle with dry hands during winter, but this cream has helped me. My hands weren't dry or rough at all while using this. It has a really nice creamy, silky consistency and it sinks in like a dream. And it's afforable! WRP",

On application (I apply a pea sized amount only on face not the neck), it is definitely a little sticky... some might find it annoying however it leaves a beautiful dewy look on the skin. The product gets absorbed easily after 15-20 minutes but since I use neutrogena dry touch sunscreen, it cancels out the stickiness very easily only leaving a dewy glow. Definitely hydrates the skin well and is soothing...\n\nIt is not comedogenic at all and gets absorbed easily... didn’t face any blackhead issues... it works good under makeup and keeps the skin healthy... \n\nOverall I like the product.... would not recommend it for oily skin but it works well for normal/dry/combination skin... my mom has sensitive skin, she tried it twice and it didn’t give her those bumps on skin she usually gets with other moisturisers. \n\nResult- WRP definitely since it’s quite affordable ;-; might order another tube for my mom.",

    "body": "I am sure many are familiar with the recent discussion of ceramide formulations being effective/ineffective so when I came across the Atopalm website that makes it very accessible to US residents , I bought several Zeroid products to see whether it's just hype or whether they really work.  I also decided on Zeroid and Ceramol over other brands because they do not contain fragrance or essential oils.\n\n* Skin type dry\n* Weather: 30 F to 50 F\n* Testing schedule: 3 weeks\n\n**Skin Concerns**: Looking for a moisturizer that can help my already dry skin handle the drying effects of daily 0.05 tretinoin unbuffered this winter. My skin used to be painfully tight right after washing and I couldn’t handle not applying a toner right away while doing the 30 minute wait for tretinoin. \n\n**Zeroid Intensive Cream**\n\nWater/Aqua, Propanediol, Caprylic/capric triglyceride, Glycerin, Squalane, Cetearyl alcohol, Polyglyceryl-10 distearate, Glyceryl stearate, Stearic acid, Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Myristoyl/palmitoyl oxostearamide/arachamide MEA, Phytosterols, Tocopheryl acetate, Canola oil, Olea europaea (Olive) fruit oil, Cetyl palmitate, Sorbitan palmitate, Sorbitan olivate, Bisabolol, Methyl caprooyl tyrosinate, Xanthan gum, Sodium hyaluronate, Carbomer, Arginine, Caprylyl glycol\n\n* Texture: rich moisturizer that falls somewhere between medium and heavy. \n* Smell: None that I can detect.\n* Experience: Applies and spreads very smoothly. My dry skin sucks it ups and it leaves a slightly greasy feeling for a while. It eventually absorbs completely after a few minutes. Oily skin type won’t like it but dry skin type will most likely enjoy this cream. I like it enough to consider a repurchase for summer. \n\n**Zeroid Intensive Oint-Cream**\n\nWater/Aqua, Theobroma cacao (Cocoa) seed butter, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cetearyl alcohol, Cocoglycerides, Butyrospermum parkii (Shea) butter, Polyglyceryl-10 distearate, Sorbitan stearate, Panthenol, Glyceryl stearate, Squalane, Stearic acid, Camellia oleifera seed oil, Caprylyl methicone, Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phytosterols, Tocopheryl acetate, Myristoyl/palmitoyl oxostearamide/arachamide MEA, Euphorbia cerifera (Candelilla) wax, Zinc gluconate, Methyl caprooyl tyrosinate, Tetracarboxymethyl palmitoyl dipeptide-12, Xanthan gum, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA, Madecassoside, Caprylyl glycol\n\n* Texture: super thick moisturizer that is definitely heavy but isn’t occlusive enough for me \n* Smell: None that I can detect.\n* Experience: Take a bit to squeeze it out of the tube as it is thick. Even so, it spreads very smoothly. It takes my skin much longer to drink it up and is definitely greasier but not oily. Due to how long it takes to dry down, I use it at night.  Oily skin type should avoid this like the plague but desert dry skin type will enjoy the richness. Definitely my go to for night time winter moisturizer.  \n\n**Ceramol 311 Crema**\n\nWater, Shea butter, Petrolatum, Penethylene Glycol, Glycerin, Caprylic/capric triglyceride, Batyl alcohol, Stearic Acid, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol, Arginine, Carbomer, Lecithin.\n\n* Texture: I can’t decide how to classify this cream. It squeezes out of the tube so easily, applies like a light lotion yet it is the farthest thing from light. It is firm enough that the squeezed ”cream” holds its shape. It is a translucent white, unlike the clearly white non-tranlucent Zeroid. It reminds me of a gel but it’s definitely not a gel.  \n* Smell: None that I can detect.\n* Experience: The texture is incredibly deceiving as it looks and feels light upon application but it really isn’t. I think it feels that way because it dries down matte. I enjoy using this in the morning because I don’t need to wait long for it to dry down before applying sunscreen. \n\n**TLDR**\n\nI like all 3 for different reasons. I was originally underwhelmed because my skin still felt dry halfway through the day. I want to test these properly so I continued using them. Since many are curious as to the performance and effects of Zeroid, I decided to do my review write up a week early (3 weeks versus 1 full month of testing). Note that these creams are NOT fungal acne safe.  \n\nI think these creams strengthened my moisture barrier. In fact, I stopped using an occlusive at night last week except on my eyelids and at the corners of my mouth, whereas I had to slather Eucerin all over my face for months. I don’t have any flakes or patches of peeling skin anymore compared to before I started these creams. My skin also doesn’t look tight or dry the next morning. \n\nTesting after I have finished the current tubes:\n\n* Zeroid Richenic Cream Urea 5% (haven’t opened)\n* Zeroid Intensive Hydrating Ampoule (haven’t opened)\n* Ceramol 311 Lipocream (seller sent me samples, haven’t opened)\n\nI have also tried La Mer, Nivea Mexico and Nivea Germany and will do a write up comparison on SCA when I can cough up the energy.",

    "body": "I am posting this content to help others who have suffered from seb derm. I suffered with this condition for more than 2 years and after trying many things I've finally cured this condition for myself with no relapse since.\n\nI've tried gluten-free, cow dairy free and even low-lectin diets but these did not work. I actually developed gastrointestinal issues by going on gluten free because I switched to a lot of white rice instead of bread which led to the depletion of some vital vitamins and minerals (b1 namely). I also tried doctor-prescribed non-steroidal creams which did not work.\n\nFirst things I tried were dietary changes and the following helped:\n\n**Probiotics:** I tried probiotic suplements but with little results but eventually decided to make my own potent probiotic, goat kefir. I purchase live kefir grains from amazon and using pasteurized whole goat milk have been consuming it ever since. I feel this really helps with energy levels. I consume it first thing in the morning, usually before brushing teeth as toothpaste/mouthwash can and will likely interfere with bacteria reaching large intestines. Kefir is most potent probiotic and can help to bring balance to gut microbiome by populating the gastrointestinal tract with friendly bacteria and yeast.\n\n**Zinc:** This has been very effective for me. First time taking it felt my skin clear slightly and also had an effect on my energy and sleep. I did have a blood test done and zinc was the only issue flagged as I had lower-than-normal levels. I recommend taking a non-chelated form of zinc as I developed joint pains taking 15mg (150% RDA) of zinc picolinate and zinc l-monomethionine. I've had little issue with zinc sulphate monohydrate. I think zinc gluconate and zinc citrate will be fine too. Zinc should also be taken with copper.\n\n**Vitamin D:** I take 4000 IU every day in soft gel and oral spray form. I take 8k-16k when ill. \n\n**Vitamin C:** This is another immune-supporting supplement and have also noticed better skin. I also felt a boost in energy when taking this. 1000mg 1/2 a day. Ascorbic acid form is fine but liposomal form is better based on the research I've done.\n\nI also try not to consume tea, coffee, or foods high in phytic acid around nutrient-rich meals as these can inhibit the absorption of zinc and other minerals. \n\nThese diet changes helped but did not solve my seb derm. What really cured it for me was the following:\n\n**MCT Oil Pure C8:** By far the biggest impact on getting rid of my seb derm. First time I applied this to my face it completely cleared it all up. I continued to apply it every day for 10 days. I left it on for 30-40 minutes then showered. Now I apply it 2 times a week and never had a relapse.\n\n**Dr Bronner's Baby Unscented Pure-Castile Liquid:** I tried this before the C8 MCT oil and although it helped alot it did not fully clear it and there were relapses. But it's still effective.\n\nIt's possible the C8 MCT oil and castile soap would work on their own but the aforementioned dietary changes will help anyone with seb derm imo. Zinc and vitamin d deficiency are widespread and a severe cases of these may be a key reason why a lot of people develop autoimmune issues. Likewise, a poor gut microbiome is another key reason why people develop reactions to certain foods and poor gut permaemability. Zinc, vitamin d and vitamin c are also crucial for immune system, this extends to the body controlling yeast on skin and gastrointestinal tract. Being deficient could lead to overgrowth.  \n\nI think the reason for the C8 MCT oil and castile soap working so well is there was likely an overgrowth of yeast and/or demodex. In hindsight I could've saved my self a lot of trouble visiting a dermatologist but with the terrible experience I had with my GP I didn't take that path.",

I'm buying a new one tomorrow 😂\n\n#Skin type\nOily, sensitive, redness-prone, prone to malassezia overgrowth (\"fungal acne\") and mild but ever-present acne and PIH, thanks to hormones and slow-healing skin 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\n🐳 Age: 30\n\n🐳 Current climate: Hot and humid\n\n#Usage timeline\nBought at Feb end, just finished the bottle. So it lasted two and a half months... I used it twice a week, mayyybe thrice the week before my period. I used... half a ₹1 coin size? On face and upper neck. \n\n\n🐳 Price: ₹275 for 30ml [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.in/Disrupt-Salicylic-Sulphate-Blackheads-Exfoliant/dp/B09FZLLSZG/). MRP marked as 445.\n\n#Ingredients\nAqua, Glycerin, Salicylic Acid, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Methylpropanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, C15-19 Alkane, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate, Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Gluconate, Magnesium Aspartate, Zinc Gluconate, Copper Gluconate, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n#User experience\n\n[Packaging, product texture shots, pH strip results](https://imgur.com/a/IGMbYzm)\n\nA translucent, slightly milky, runny serum that sinks in fast, leaving no residue or tackiness. The brand advises to leave 1-2 minutes before layering other products. I've never had any pilling issues or anything. \n\nLeaves the skin feeling very slightly smoother than before application, but otherwise unchanged. I like that a lot about this serum ☺\n\nAlkanes are apparently plant-derived alternatives to silicones, and I think along with the polymers in there, they contribute to the sliiiightly velvety finish after application. But it's very subtle, and there no film or layer formed over the skin at all. \n\n#My thoughts\nI was super pleased when I pH tested it and the results were 3-4. Right at the sweet spot for efficacy of salicylic acid - even though the Amazon seller answered a pH question by saying it was 5.5 🙃. I purged almost immediately after starting use - nothing irritated, but I could see my clogged pores (of which there were quite a few that had made themselves at home) start to get a move on 😂\n\nMy skin has a pretty slow turnover rate, so I purged for at least three weeks - I'd say the period would last much shorter for most. \n\nI'm also delighted by the low price point, which belies the simple elegance of the texture. I didn't feel like the formulation cut corners, or like I was compromising in any way. They also cover all their bases with the label, including advising a patch test, warning not to use on broken skin, etc. which I appreciate. \n\nThey suggest using it 2-3 times a week at night, and recommend sun protection the next morning. Brand communication on point 👌🏽\n\nAll in all, very happy with the product. Would recommend to anyone looking for a basic, affordable, effective BHA. Finally, a 2% salicylic serum I can recommend to beginners! 😤❤\n\nEdit: I just bought a second bottle of this, having run out -  it was dispensing product without having to poke the nozzle 🤔 Did I poke it unnecessarily? Do some of them not dispense for some reason? Who knows 😂 Lemme know of your experience with Disrupt packaging if you try  it! TIA!",

    "body": "#Review type \nRave! 5/5. Currently on my second bottle.\n\n#Skin type\nOily, sensitive, redness-prone, prone to malassezia overgrowth (\"fungal acne\"). Mild but ever-present clogged pores, PIH, and a couple pimples, thanks to menstrual cycles and slow-healing skin. Reads like a lot, but I'm actually quite happy with it 😂❤️\n\n🐳 Age: 30\n\n🐳 Current climate: Hot and humid\n\n#Usage timeline\nFinished up a bottle - lasted me around one and a half months, used almost every day at night. Sometimes morning AND night, because that's what the brand had in their little Routine recommendation slide. Link to [my approximate routine at the time.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/uwmvkk/my_current_2022_fungalsafe_skincare_routine_with/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) I used it pretty generously, half a coin-sized amount.\n\nCurrently on my second bottle and using it a bit less heavily, both in frequency and amount used. I use it more often the week before my period, or if I have redness/breakouts I wanna calm down.\n\n\n🐳 Price: ₹275 for 30ml [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.in/gp/aw/d/B09FZJGJC8). MRP marked as 475.\n\n#Ingredients\nAqua, Niacinamide, Glycerin, Methylpropanediol, Zinc PCA, C15-19 Alkane, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate, Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Gluconate, Magnesium Aspartate, Zinc Gluconate, Copper Gluconate, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n(Very similar ingredients to their 2% salicylic acid serum, which I [reviewed here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/v7wzhz/review_disrupt_2_salicylic_acid_serum/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share))\n\n#User experience\n\nThe packaging and product texture are near identical to their salicylic acid serum [(images here)](https://imgur.com/a/IGMbYzm) so I didn't bother to take new pictures 🙃\n\nCan literally copy-paste the same sensory experience, as well:\n>\"A translucent, slightly milky, runny serum that sinks in fast, leaving no residue or tackiness. The brand advises to leave 1-2 minutes before layering other products. I've never had any pilling issues or anything.\"\n\n>\"Leaves the skin feeling very slightly smoother than before application, but otherwise unchanged. I like that a lot about this serum ☺\"\n\n>\"Alkanes are apparently plant-derived alternatives to silicones, and I think along with the polymers in there, they contribute to the sliiiightly velvety finish after application. But it's very subtle, and there no film or layer formed over the skin at all.\"\n\nI've only ever used the Minimalist 5% niacinamide serum (old formulation) apart from this one. That one didn't do much beyond give an immediate plumping effect (it had 1%HA) and help slightly with barrier health. And it was a bit sticky. The Disrupt one was a delight to use in humid weather. Absolutely hassle-free and undetectable, everything I personally hope for from a niacinamide serum 😂\n\nThe very first time I used it, I felt very slight stinging on an active pimple. I shaved around my brows during the same week, and applying the serum stung momentarily then, too. No stinging or anything since then.\n\n#Brand claims & my thoughts\n+ \"Reduces pigmentation, scars and other blemishes in 4 weeks with daily use\" - I'd say this is on point. 4 weeks is long enough to see a difference, especially if used morning AND night, as they suggest. I definitely found my redness reduced, PIH fading faster, and breakouts less frequent. PMS skin was reduced to literally just one or two pimples 😆🙌🏼\n\n\n+ \"Regulates sebum production, gives \"clear matt\" look throughout the day, reduces redness and inflammation\" - my skin is OILY. Sure, using this serum made me marginally less greasy if I used it in the AM, but come evening time, I was as shiny as usual 😂 Slight oil control, yes. \"Clear matt\" look, nah.\n\n\n+ \"Prevents acne and repairs skin barrier\" - for sure. The frequency and severity of my breakouts are much reduced, and my skin is less easily irritated 😌👍🏼\n\n\n+ \"For all skin types\" - quite possibly. What I like most about these serums is that they have the one active, a minimal ingredients list, etc. but the texture and resulting finish is really nice. Cheap ass packaging, elegant product experience 😂 Right up my alley.\n\n\nI'd read so many people raving about the Ordinary 10% niacinamide being their HG active. Clearing their acne, watering their crops, caring for their livestock - but the texture seemed like a dealbreaker. And what people were saying about 2-5% being the clinically studied amount, and 10% being unnecessarily high made sense to me 🤷🏽‍♀️ Turns out there's a lot to be said for anecdotal evidence ☺️ (FYI: some people do find 10% irritating, so as always with skincare, YMMV)\n\n#Suggested for \nAnyone with acne and/or sensitive skin, looking for a relatively affordable daily use serum to improve their overall skin health. Niacinamide is compatible with just about every other active, and I personally think barrier support and anti-inflammatory products are just as important as chemical exfoliation and stuff. A great first ever serum for people with acne and/or PIH! The lovely texture is the cherry on top 🍒",

    "body": "Here are some various lotions and balms from Dollar Tree, drug stores (i.e. Walgreens) and Ulta which I’ve tried to organize left to right, top to bottom from lightweight to medium and heavier. Some are empty, others halfway or new to me. \n\n> Skin type: oily, acne prone. Lately dry because of (over)using actives. \n\n##Watery gel\n * Peter Thomas Roth - Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer. New to me. Humectant forward, nice at first but burns a bit after a while if by itself. I think layering it with a moisturizer should be fine. I don’t understand the 30% hyaluronic complex claim—isn’t this ingredient usually only at 1%? \n* (Dollar Tree) B Pure Hydrating Gel Cream. Supposed to dupe the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel (I haven’t tried that one). Similar to the Peter Thomas Roth, not that friendly to my skin, and doesn’t smell as nice (like a baby powder smell). But this one actually is a pretty good as a makeup remover cold cream which can remove eyeliner. \n\n##Gel cream \n* (Dollar Tree) Global Beauty Care - Lift and Firm Eye Cream with Collagen and Peptides. Actually a very nice serum texture. The 0.5 oz lasts a while. I just used as a lightweight face moisturizer instead of eye cream. While I’d want a larger size I would get this texture again. \n* Nivea Breathable body lotion in scent Tropical Breeze. New to me. I got this as people said it’s light enough to be a face lotion, and it’s true, it’s very light. Too light for body really. I have some issues with this one. Perhaps my skin is currently compromised (it’s dry), but there is a consistent cooling feeling to the lotion, that sometimes also feels a bit burning. I don’t know what ingredient it is. It’s interesting there’s a vitamin c derivative sodium ascorbyl phosphate though. The scent is nice like a floral rose, geranium, jasmine type scent, that is true that it smells like Glad Air Freshener, which I happen to like. \n* Gold Bond - Pure Moisture daily body and face lotion. This didn’t work for me as a hand cream (not moisturizing enough). Slightly thin so it does also go by fast. But I started to love it when I thought of it as a face lotion instead. Layers nicely with other lotions too. I’m interested in repurchasing as it comes in large value sizes, although it appears this product may be on the way out in some stores. Seems a great value. \n\n##Lightweight lotion \n* Cerave Daily Moisturizing Lotion. Similar story to Gold Bone Pure Moisture, didnt value it until I thought of it as a lightweight face lotion instead of for body. This is a nice but plain light lotion. I’ve heard the ceramides complex might not be in an amount to help skin recovery that much. But it’s nice enough anyway. The Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Repair is a pretty similar product on skin. \n* Vaseline - Intensive Care Soothing Hydration. I liked the Vaseline Advanced Repair unscented a lot so tried this one. I like its cucumber melon type scent. But similar to the Nivea Breathable lotion (above), it has a cooling sensation but also can burn at times, especially on my face which is also currently sensitized. It seems fine for body. \n* The Beauty of Eczema - Moisturizing Cream. Rebranded as a “daily moisturizer,” this independent business which started on Instagram has since closed shop. The moisturizer is quite lightweight but also has sweet almond oil as the second ingredient, making the feel similar to a face oil/lotion hybrid. Not as moisturizing as something with dimethicone or petrolatum (like Cerave Daily Moisturizer or Vaseline Advanced Repair), but did not cause any breakouts. I didn’t find this to be “enough” in winter time but I loved the natural rose scent, just so much like the flower. I don’t have eczema btw. \n\n##Moderate lotion \n* Cetaphil - Moisturizing Lotion. New to me. A bit scared to put on my face as I’ve heard people have had breakouts. But it does seem to moisturize for a long time (applied to hands) and doesn’t cause sensitivity. The pump is a bit annoying as it locks when you turn it 45 degrees and also doesn’t dispense a lot for body use (but enough for face). \n* (Dollar Tree) Dermasil - Eczema Relief Body Lotion with chamomile flower and colloidal oatmeal. Moisturizes well for face and body. Possibly caused stinging once but has been fine after that. Has a light herbal scent kinda like dead flowers (pelargonium graveolens oil), but not bad. \n* (Dollar Tree) Kissable - Diabetics Dry Skin Relief Lotion. Has 30% petrolatum and 1% dimethicone as active ingredient skin protectant. Unscented. Actually love how this moisturizes and has a slight gel feel. It’s similar to Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion but less emollients (no oils). I am comfortable using for face and hands. \n\n##Thicker lotion \n* Alba - Very Emollient Body Lotion. Has a big variety of oils. Actually a godsend for when my nails are dried out because of Bath and Body Works hand soaps, dish detergents and bleach cleaners. Makes nails glossy. But uses a plant based emulsifier (glyceryl stearate SE) so it takes a long time to rub in, where a dimethicone would cut down that time. Seems great as a hand cream rather than a body lotion… takes too long after a shower on damp skin. \n* Gold Bond - Age Renew Retinol Overnight for face and body. Definitely thicker than the Gold Bond Pure Moisture. Has shea butter. Makes my skin soft in the morning (especially with Vaseline on top). Doesn’t seem to cause acne strangely enough. Has a texture like Hempz hand cream. I like this lotion especially in winter. \n* Eucerin - Eczema Relief Cream with 1% colloidal oatmeal. A good balance between a lighter and thicker cream. Doesn’t seem to cause issues. I don’t have eczema but liked this for drier skin days on face and body. \n\n##Cream \n* Lumin - Face Moisturizer for Oily and Normal Skin. A similar thickness to Gold Bond Age Renew Retinol Overnight, except a little more like a gel cream. This is an interesting one as there’s a stickiness similar to Cosrx Snail Mucin (but doesn’t have that ingredient) but also has meadow foam seed oil high in the ingredients list. Enjoyable to use. Is a men’s marketed product and has a citronella scent like bugs spray but also the Belif Aqua Bomb fragrance (not the texture). 1 oz but does take a while to use up. \n* Lumin - Face Moisturizer for Dry Skin. The same as above but includes more meadow foam seed oil (second ingredient) for a somewhat thicker balm. I believe both of these are made in Korea and they do remind me of K-beauty products with the long ingredients lists full of plant extracts to match. \n\n##Balm \n* La Roche Posay - Cicaplast Balm B5. Unscented but kinda smells like white out paint. It’s a white color that takes a bit to rub in, probably because of the zinc Gluconate which I hear does have healing properties. Had madecassoside which is the chemical form of centella. 1% dimethicone is listed as skin protectant (similar to the Dollar Tree Kissable one above). Seems to have great ingredients, but is just expensive and the 1.35 oz goes by quickly for me. Looking for alternative. \n* Cerave - Healing Ointment. Lasts a long time. It’s nice, I like it. A different feel than Aquaphor but similar in its skin protectant qualities. Both of them changed temperature after a particularly hot day though (the Aquaphor became runny and he Cerave became gritty). \n* (Dollar Tree) Revitalizing Body Balm Jelly Stick. Probably meant as a dupe to the Vaseline petroleum jelly stick. Haven’t tried that one but from reviews I’m guessing it’s similar. This is a nice way to put petroleum jelly on nails but tends to get dirty otherwise and is sort of a bit stiff so it can take other product off. \n* (Dollar Tree) Personal Care 100% Pure Petroleum Jelly (not pictured). I got this after the jelly stick, and like how it’s softer and more spreadable for face. It’s unscented but does have a small bit of cocoa butter taste (I think they also sell a cocoa butter iteration). \n\n##Repurchase?\n* ✅ I would buy these again: Gold Bond Pure Moisture, Gold Bond Retinol Overnight, Kissable Diabetics Dry Skin Relief (awesome find), Cerave Healing Ointment, and also Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Repair (not pictured) as a Cerave Daily Moisturizer alternative as it’s cheaper. I’ll try putting the Alba Very Emollient in a hand cream tube as I think it works great for that purpose specifically. I have it in my bathroom in the meantime. \n* ⚪️ I’d find some alternatives for the other ones as I like to try new products and find great deals. Specifically want a La Roche posay cicaplast replacement (is Triple Paste butt cream good enough?). It’s not that I saw results, it’s just people say this is their holy grail, and I don’t think I was able to go ham on it as it cost 💲💲to my budget ass. \n* ❌ I would avoid: Nivea Breathable and Vaseline Soothing Aloe as my skin seems sensitive to something about these two (fragrance?), especially in my skin’s current somewhat compromised state. \n\n\n\n",

The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment remains poorly elucidated and is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents is effective perhaps because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes counts by inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels\n(Quote from 3rd article listed below)\n\nSources: \n\n* [NANOSTRUCTURED ZINC OXIDE ENHANCES THE ACTIVITY OF\nANTIBIOTICS AGAINST STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS](http://jbstonline.com/documents/vol1issue2/jbst2010010202.pdf) \n* [Effect of zinc gluconate on propionibacterium acnes resistance to erythromycin in patients with inflammatory acne: in vitro and in vivo study.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15908296)\n* [Zinc Therapy in Dermatology: A Review](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4120804/)",

[Produtct Link](https://www.netmeds.com/prescriptions/excela-cream-50gm). Cipla Excela and Ipca acne oc are the 2 most recommended pharmacy moisturisers for oily skin by dermats and users alike. Both are HG products for many people beating branded moisturisers. I have finally tried them both n some others and here are my findings -\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Consistency**\\- thin cream like\n* **Smell** \\-  fragrance free\n* **Absorption** \\- It absorbs like reequil oil free moisturiser. It turns from cream to little foamy to invisible gel when massaged and then quickly absorbs. Even the instructions say to massage for 30s and it should be followed. Spreads easily when foamy and then it drops quickly.\n   * d > b > a > e, f >c\n* **After application feel** \\- the absorption mechanism of this products feel unnecessary work when simple gels like ipca acne oc exist. Many a times It also feels like the skin starts to sweat out water from the pores, its little but noticeably visibly and the cooling effect of evaporation is felt on the skin. Didnt sting my eyes.\n   * e, d > b > a, f >>> c\n* **Hydration** \\- on par with reequil oil free moisturiser and slightly more than ipca. It might look different due to their different post applications looks.\n   * f, e, d > c > a > b\n* **After application looks** \\- it has the hydrated matte look with little brightness. Ipca is slightly less matte relatively but its quantity applied has a direct effect on wether it looks matte or dewy\n   * f, d, > e, a > b >> c\n* **Soothing** level - none. Infact i think the reason for the little sweating is that it didnt suit me perfectly. Also a drawback is that because of the need to massage more for it to absorb, excela on sensitised skin (like bad days of tr€t) used to aggreivate the irritation  because of skin rubbing. Both ipca and excela have bare minimum soothing properties\n   * e > d, b, f > c > a\n* •oil control - its on par with or little more than ipca oc\n   * f, d > b > a > e > c\n\nSidenotes -\n\n* great pump packaging.\n* I saw 50gm of this product finish  v quickly because its easy to apply larger quantities. infact its the fastest 50gm of moisturiser to finish.\n* its sister versions excela rich n lite are more easily available in pharmacies ime.\n* ipca with 2 drops of HA serum can give better hydrated look\n* reapplication during the day with ipca is a seamless experience -  it gives some instant oil absorption, noice cooling effect and hydration without addition of greasy feel or tackiness. With excela even just the thought is cumbersome\n* ipca oc + ipca acne uv layer is much lesser likely to pill and better combo than excela + ipca uv.\n* [Potent ingredient list](https://incidecoder.com/products/cipla-excela-moisturiser-for-oily-acne-prone-skin) but things like copper and zinc gluconate failed to have any irl soothing effect, while cocoglucoside and Isononyl Isononanoate could be reason for the emulsification when spreading\n* other product reviews by me - [ipca acne oc](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/vqawtd/ipca_acne_oc_moisturizer_review/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), [re'equil oil free](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/w6t1on/reequil_oil_free_moisturiser_review/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), [minimalist b5 10%](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/spi6mt/minimalist_vitamin_b5_10_moisturizer_first/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), [oily skin products megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/vmmota/megathread_best_products_for_oily_skin/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n* price - 500 for 50g\n\nTl;Dr - WNRP as ipca is a better experience, value and my HG\n\nHope that was helpful, thanks",

    "body": "I'd been drinking generic unflavored Pedialyte as my preferred electrolyte drink for several years, but it is expensive and sometimes stores are sold out.  So I decided to make my own.  It's easy, inexpensive, and tastes quite decent (way better to me than any commercial products I've tried).\n\nMy recipe:\n\n\\- 16 oz water\n\n\\- heaping 1/4 tsp salt\n\n\\- heaping 1/8 tsp of [potassium citrate powder](https://www.vitacost.com/now-potassium-citrate-pure-powder) (May use [potassium chloride](https://www.vitacost.com/now-potassium-chloride-powder) next time so that I can get more chloride, but they were out of it when I ordered.)\n\n\\- heaping tsp of turbinado sugar or honey (Edited: a heaping tsp was way too sweet for me, so I cut it down to a heaping 1/2 tsp...and later 1/4 tsp...and finally I decided to leave it out entirely unless I've been outside sweating a lot or have diarrhea.)\n\n\\- 1/2 tsp (66.5 mg) [Magnesium Chloride liquid](https://www.vitacost.com/nutricology-magnesium-chloride-liquid), which I add for migraines (You can also use [magnesium citrate powder](https://www.vitacost.com/now-magnesium-citrate-pure-powder), but the stuff clumps up a lot unless you stir it in really slowly.  Edited: I also tried [magnesium bisglycinate](https://www.vitacost.com/now-magnesium-bisglycinate-powder), and it doesn’t clump up and is cheaper than the chloride liquid.  But it tasted like old fish, so no.  I’m sticking with mag chloride.)\n\nEdited to add: Sometimes I include other ingredients, such as Vitamin B-12 drops, vitamin C powder, inulin for fiber, etc.\n\n\\[I'm not specifically hyping brands or online stores, but I recommend **not** buying from Amazon [because so many supplements sold there are counterfeit](https://www.consumerlab.com/answers/avoid-counterfeit-supplements/counterfeit-supplements/).\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The nitty-gritty, nerdy details...**\n\nIf you want the info I used to create my recipe, I primarily worked from [ConsumerLab.com's article on electrolyte replenishment](https://www.consumerlab.com/reviews/electrolytes-sports-rehydration/electrolytes/).  It is behind a paywall.  (And, if you buy supplements, well worth the yearly subscription if you can.)  What I don't really understand is how to calculate how much chloride I am getting, so I'm kinda flying by the seat of my pants on that bit.  (Edit: See mystisai's helpful comment, below.)\n\nHere's what the WHO recommends for electrolyte [Oral Rehydration Salts solution](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-FCH-CAH-06.1) to replenish after diarrhea (and what I modeled my recipe on):\n\n\\- 16 oz water\n\n\\- 816 mg sodium\n\n\\- 1091 mg chloride\n\n\\- 369 mg potassium\n\n\\- 6.4 g sugar\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd here's what the [Institute of Medicine](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/10925/dietary-reference-intakes-for-water-potassium-sodium-chloride-and-sulfate) recommends after exercise (more sugar, less sodium and potassium than WHO recipe):\n\n\\- 16 oz water\n\n\\- 218 to 326 mg Sodium\n\n\\- 37 to 92 mg Potassium\n\n\\- 23-45 g Sugar\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor reference, here what's in 16 oz of CVS generic Pedialyte:\n\n\\- 493 mg sodium (presumably as sodium citrate & sodium acid sulfate)\n\n\\- 587 mg chloride\n\n\\- 373 mg potassium (presumably as potassium citrate and potassium chloride)\n\n\\- 12 g sugar (as dextrose)\n\n\\- 3.73 mg zinc gluconate",

    "body": "I haven't seen these reviewed much on here so I thought I'd write up a quick review of each.\n\n**My skin type:** combination, temperamental. Currently on 0.05% tretinoin so cheeks/mouth area are especially dry, forehead/nose oily as usual. I bought these because I am on the lookout for something that has high protection across the range, does not contain alcohol, does not have a white cast, is chemical (i.e. organic) only, and preferably isn't too shiny for the summer months. Had a terrible time with LRP's Shaka Fluid so went on the hunt for other French brands because I trust their sunscreens when it comes to protection against harsh sun. I cannot comment on whether any of these stain clothing, I'm using them for face only. Will update if any of this changes! \n\nFor reference, these are the UV filters mentioned below (info comes from Incidecoder). The first three are new-generation I believe. \n\n\\- *Tinosorb S*: generation, covers the entire UVB and UVA range, very photostable/hardly deteriorates in the presence of UV light\n\n\\- *Uvinul A Plus*: high protection across the whole UVA range\n\n\\- *Uvinul T150*: highest photo-stable aborption of all UVB filters today\n\n\\- *Octinoxate*: UVB proection, not very photo stable but is made more stable when combined with something like Tinosorb S\n\n\\- *Homosalate*: also UVB, also not very photo stable; incidecoder says it is not a very strong UV filter in itself, but useful for dissolving other agents\n\n\\- *Octisalate*: also UVB, also not a very strong filter on its own but can be helping hand for other filters\n\n\\- *Ensulizole*: UVB, oil soluble but not water soluble so good for oily types, fairly photo stable\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **NOREVA Cicadiane Photoprotective Repairing Care (Crème Réparatrice Photo-Protectrice)**\n\n**Bottle size**: 40ml\n\n**Price:** £9.10\n\n**SPF:** 50+\n\n**PPD:** 36-38 (website says UVA 36-38)\n\n**Texture:** thick cream, yellow-ish\n\n**White cast:** none\n\n**Ethyl alcohol:** none\n\n**Scent**: non-perfumed; generic cream scent (quite strong to my nose)\n\n**Shininess**: certainly not matt, but not an oily mess either. I'm never completely sure what people mean by dewy skin, but I'd guess that it's something like this\n\n**Feel:** I can mildly feel that it's there, but it's not disturbing. If I touch my face it is a bit sticky. \n\n**Sunscreen agents:** they went for minimal but modern, powerful protective ingredients. Tinosorb S, Uvinul A Plus, Uvinul T150\n\n**Other actives:** Zinc Gluconate, Copper Gluconate (last on the ingredients list so I assume very little of it, if copper worries you)\n\n**Further notes**: the first thing one notices, is that the nozzle is the type you'd find on a spot-treatment cream rather than a sunscreen where one is expected to apply a healthy amount on the face. The back also says 'apply to the damaged area'. This, coupled with the fact that the bottle is very small, sort of makes me think this isn't designed to be an every day sunscreen, but rather a cream with actives that doubles up as a powerful sunscreen. In retrospect maybe that's obvious, but I didn't realise. It's thick but not hard to spread, the scent (to be clear, there is no perfume, I just mean the scent of the cream) is fairly noticeable to me but eventually disappears. Mind you, I have a fairly sensitive nose. Strangely for something designed to help damaged skin this stung a little in the minute after I applied it, I don't know whether that's normal or not. Other than that I have not noticed irritation, but I don't fully get the 'soothing' part of this product; perhaps my skin is not damaged enough for that part to be noticeable.\n\nOverall, to me this seems like a solid sunscreen which could work occasionally but the impression I get is that it isn't designed for daily all-year-round wear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **SVR Sun Secure Extreme Multi-resistant Ultra-matt Gel (Gel Ultra Mat Multi-résistant)**\n\n**Bottle size:** 50ml\n\n**Price:** £11.50 online\n\n**SPF**: 50+\n\n**PPD**: ≥ 20 (I contacted them for an exact number and they said they can't tell me for privacy reasons)\n\n**Texture:** gel, yellow-ish\n\n**White cast**: none\n\n**Ethyl alcohol:** none\n\n**Scent:** perfumed, and noticeably so: the scent lingers and was detectable for most of the day. It smells summery and doesn't bother me hugely, but if perfume bothers you, this is not for you (nor is the other SVR below)\n\n**Shininess:** matt (probably the second most matt sunscreen I've ever tried, after Sun Cotton by A'pieu which is literal magic)\n\n**Feel:** weirdly, despite being matt, you can feel yourself wearing it. Touching your face it is fairly sticky. I say weirdly because, to anyone else it will probably not look like you're wearing something, yet to you it'll feel like you definitely are wearing something. One usually associates stickiness with visible shine, but that is not at all the case here.\n\n**Sunscreen agents:** Tinosorb S, Uvinul A Plus, Uvinul T150, Octinoxate, Homosalate, Octisalate\n\n**Other actives:** Carrot Extract, Vitamin E\n\n**Further notes:** standard, flat dispenser, comes out easily. Feels like it's designed to withstand sport activity ('extreme', 'multi-resistant'). As the name suggests it is a gel, which I'd never seen before in a sunscreen. Another user pointed out that this is because it is not water based, which separates this sunscreen from the crowd. It claims to protect against UVA, UVB, infrared, and some visible light (the latter due to the carrot extract, though from what I've seen it looks like there isn't published evidence that carrot extract has this property when applied to the skin, so who knows). From this point of view I would say it's certainly worth trying if only because it is quite different to many other sunscreens on the market. I like the infrared light blocking, if it does indeed do that. For days where one would be under harsh sun this seems like a fair bet; in my view anything that is 'very cosmetically elegant' is unlikely to provide the protection needed if you're spending the day at the beach/hiking, but that's just my feeling rather than being a fact. This felt like a good middle ground, but for me personally this won't be an all-year-rounder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **SVR Sun Secure Comfort Cream Invisible Finish (Crème Confort Fini Invisible)**\n\n**Bottle size:** 50ml\n\n**Price:** £9.60 online\n\n**SPF:** 50+\n\n**PPD:** ≥ 20 (as above)\n\n**Texture:** light cream, pale yellow-ish\n\n**White cast:** none\n\n**Ethyl alcohol:** none\n\n**Scent:** exactly like the Ultra-Matt\n\n**Shininess:** fairly dewy -- not proper shiny, but not matt. I disagree with the invisible finish claim.\n\n**Feel:** contrary to the ultra matte gel, I feel this a bit less on my skin, but it is more visible to anyone else. Not to an unpleasant amount though, and expected from something that claims very high protection.\n\n**Sunscreen agents:** Tinosorb S, Uvinul A Plus, Uvinul T150, Octinoxate, Ensulizole\n\n**Other actives:** Niacinamide, Carrot Extract, Vitamin E, and some moisturising agents (Glycerin, Squalane)\n\n**Further notes:** bottle is pretty much identical to the previous. The cream is light and goes on easy, the protection claims are the same as that of the other SVR. Did not note much reaction from my skin. Feels richer than the ultra-matt and the ingredients list seems to agree with that feeling. Having Niacinamide is nice. Once it's sunk in, the difference in feel between this and the ultra-matt isn't enormous though. I'd say this is also worth a try. I'm having a hard time choosing one over the other in the SVR bracket.",

Same happened with other SVR sunscreens, Cicavit and Sun Secure Stick, both with even safer filters and without fragrance.\n\nAgree about the fragrance. This is Clarins-level floral bouquet on your face-intensity, even though the fragrance is comparatively pleasent, it's more perfumey and less medical smelling than other pharmacy brand fragranced sunscreens.\n\nI've been desperately looking for a new face sunscreen this summer and SVR were a hot contender, unfortunately they all fell through.",

I was procrastinating mostly out of superstition, not to tempt fate, but posts like this one helped me to hopefully come to some lasting solution.\n\nI rushed with all my might against this disease and in a very short period of time I went around and researched all the doctors, surgeons, herbalists, etc., but mostly I spent time reading studies on PubMed, and most importantly the Reddit forums.\n\nNot to dilute the post any more - First, with my last infection (cysts the size of a walnut in my arm pits) either cutting or antibiotics was inevitable. I chose the antibiotic and took 21 days of Clindamycin 600. But immediately parallel to the antibiotic I also took the following steps, which I have arranged in order of importance in my opinion:\n\n1. DIET. I did a food intolerance test right away, and while I was waiting for the results I switched to the Paleo diet. There is a lot written about it on the Internet. Turns out I'm gluten intolerant and after reading tons about possible trigger foods I stopped consuming the following:\n\n- Gluten and anything that may contain gluten (e.g. roasted nuts). I only drink plant-based milks that are explicitly labeled gluten-free. This is just one of the few examples. The same goes for oats.\n\n- Yeast. It is found in many things, the main ones being beer and bread. That is why I don't consume any bread, not even gluten-free, as well as cakes, croissants, etc\n\n- Dairy and any dairy products. Including sheep, goat, etc.\n\n- Sugar. I don't take anything with added sugar, no sweeteners at first, then I added Stevia, Erythritol, Xylitol, etc. some months after. Sometimes I treat myself with something with a sweetener, but my advice is to avoid it 100% for the first 3 months. Even honey! Only fruits\n\n- Eggs\n\n- Nightshades – potatoes, tomatoes, eggplants and peppers, respectively their derivatives such as ketchup, tomato sauce, potato starch, etc.\n\n- Minimal consumption of processed foods (generally everything that has a barcode) including sausages, salami, snacks etc. The same goes for minced meat in general.\n\n- Coffee. I've already stopped decaf too, I don't see any point in it. You get used to it without coffee, I guarantee. I used to drink 3 a day.\n\n- Alcohol. About a month ago I started drinking a little bit of tequila, gin and whiskey. But at first I didn't drink for 3-4 months. And you get used to it as well, I'm a person who drinks every day usually.\n\nI learned a lot about diet and supplements from a book called The Silent Killer (but it is only in Bulgarian :( ). It's a quick read, explaining what foods usually cause inflamation. I also drink a lot of water 3-4 liters every day, this is very important in my opinion! A bonus to everything is that I lost almost 20 kilos. At the same time, I started doing sports and moving more. Also key, I think. In general, I don't believe in trigger foods, but rather that the wrong foods increase general inflammation in the body. That's why I avoid them.\n\n2. LASER HAIR REMOVAL. As soon as the inflammations subsided and went away, I started a laser in all the places where they most often come out (although I have scars even on my back, stomach and thigh). I have already had 3 procedures each on the armpits, intimate area, inguinal folds, buttock and perianal area.\n\n3. SUPPLEMENTS. They may even be more important than the LHR. I take the following:\n\n- Zinc Gluconate (Wallmark) – 90mg./day after each meal. When the skin around the folds gets so dry that it forms something like a fine white powder - you reduce the dose until it clears up. I am currently on 30mg/day\n\n- Turmeric (Smart Hit) 2x5ml.\n\n- High Quality Omega 3 + vit. D3\n\n- Probiotics! Every morning. Gut health is so important for the immune system\n\n4. HYGIENE.\n\n- 3-4 times a week abundant washing of the usual places with Chlorhexadyne 4%. There are all kinds of brands, I buy them at ANIOS\n\n- No deodorants!\n\nI don't claim to have found a panacea, but it certainly helped me and I hope it could help other people, too and believe it is worth the try\n\nI wish you all health and success, and if you have any questions please ask",

    "body": "# Today are: \n\n* Accounting Day \n* International Hummus Day \n* Cough Drop Day\n\n>Cough drops are small tablets, usually medicated, that slowly dissolve in the mouth to suppress or stop coughs temporarily, as well as to soothe sore tissues in the throat. Some are designed to combat other symptoms of the common cold or influenza as well. They are sometimes known as throat lozenges because they were originally shaped like lozenges, or diamonds. They have also been called troches, cachous, and cough sweets. Today we celebrate them for all they do to help us while we are sick.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Ingredients in cough drops include both expectorants and cough suppressants. Cough drops also have many of the same ingredients that hard candies have, such as sugar and corn syrup, as well as other additives such as vitamins. Some common ingredients include benzocaine, eucalyptus oil, peppermint oil, menthol, spearmint, honey, dextromethorphan, vitamin C, zinc, echinacea, and camphor. Non-menthol cough drops usually have an oral demulcent such as pectin or zinc gluconate glycine. The ingredients are mixed together, cooked, and cooled, in a similar process to how hard candy is made.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>In ancient times, coughs were suppressed with herbal teas and syrups. Precursors to cough drops date back to 1000 BCE, to Egypt's Twentieth Dynasty, when candies were made with honey and flavored with herbs, spices, and citrus. In the fourth century, hard candies similar to those of today began being made, and their design predated modern cough drops. Hard candies originally were only available to the rich, but as sugar became cheaper and more readily available in the eighteenth century, so did these hard candies.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Cough drops that resemble those of today were born in the nineteenth century. What would become Smith Brothers Cough Drops, the first cough drops, began being made in 1852. A street vendor named Sly Hawkins stopped into a restaurant owned by James Smith in Poughkeepsie, New York. Hawkins gave him his recipe for \"cough candy.\" Smith began making the recipe and selling the cough candy in glass bowls. James Smith passed away in 1866, and his sons William and Andrew took over the business. In 1872, they changed the name of the cough candy to Smith Brothers Cough Drops, they put them in special packaging instead of bowls and began a more aggressive marketing campaign. The company added menthol to their cough drops in 1922. The company was sold in 1963 and the cough drops stopped being made in 1972.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Other early brands include Luden's, which was formed in 1879, and Halls, which was started by two brothers in Great Britain in 1893. Halls originally focused on jams and caramels, however, and it wasn't until the 1930s that they began selling cough drops, making them with menthol and eucalyptus. Halls cough drops were introduced to the United States in the 1950s. Today there are many popular brands of cough drops, such as Halls, Lockets, Luden's, Fisherman's Friend, Ricola, Sucrets, and Vicks. On Cough Drop Day, we celebrate all cough drops, no matter their brand. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Frog Jumping Day\n\n>Frog Jumping Day is dedicated to frogs that jump, to jumping like a frog, to frog jumping contests, and Mark Twain's short story \"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,\" which appears to be the inspiration for the day.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>The short story was originally published as \"Jim Smiley and His Jumping Frog,\" and appeared in The New York Saturday Press on November 18, 1865. It was Twain's first important work: it went on to appear in more magazines and newspapers and brought him to national attention. It was published as \"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\" in The Californian on December 16, 1865—it is under this title that it most frequently appears today. It has also gone by the name \"The Notorious Jumping Frog of Calaveras County.\" The story appeared in Twain's first book, The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, and Other Sketches, a compilation of 27 short stories that had previously appeared in newspapers and magazines, that was published in 1867.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>In the story, the narrator recounts a tale he heard from a bartender named Simon Wheeler, at the Angels Hotel in Angels Camp, in Calaveras County, California, about a man named Jim Smiley who liked to make bets. In the tale, Smiley catches a frog, names it Dan'l Webster, and trains it for three months. He then makes a $40 bet with another man saying that Dan'l Webster can outjump any other frog in Calaveras County. The other man says he will accept the bet if Jim Smiley can find him a frog. When Smiley goes to find one, he leaves Dan'l Webster behind with the man, and the man (spoiler alert!) puts lead shot down his throat. Jim returns with the other frog and sets it next to Dan'l Webster. When Smiley and the man encourage the frogs to jump, the new frog hops away, but Dan'l Webster doesn't move off the ground. Confused and angry, Smiley pays the man the $40 he owes him. After the man leaves, Smiley picks up Dan'l Webster to find him much heavier than before. Dan'l Webster then belches out a double handful of shot. Realizing he has been cheated, Smiley tries to catch the stranger, but can't.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Nowadays, frog jumping competitions are still held in small towns throughout the United States. Angels Camp in Calaveras County, which was featured in Twain's story, has held a frog jumping contest since 1928. Currently, the record for distance for frog jumping is held by \"Rosie the Ribeter,\" who set a record of 21 feet, 5¾ inches (in three jumps) in Calaveras County in 1986.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>It is not known why May 13 was chosen as the date for Frog Jumping Day. The date is near to the date of two occurrences having to do with jumping frogs, however. The publication of The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, and Other Sketches was May 14, 1867. Also, the annual frog jumping contest in Angels Camp in Calaveras County takes place on the third weekend of May each year. On Frog Jumping Day, we honor all types of jumping frogs and remember the story that brought them to prominence. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* National Leprechaun Day \n* National Fruit Cocktail Day \n* National Women's Check-Up Day \n* National Apple Pie Day\n\n>Apple pie is seen as being very American. Just how American? Well, there is not one but two National Apple Pie Days in a year. And it's almost a certainty you've heard the phrase \"as American as apple pie.\" How ironic it is, then, that apple pies didn't even originate in the United States, nor did apples!  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Apples came from Asia, and their seeds and cuttings were brought to the Americas by Europeans during colonial times. Prior to this, only crab apples were grown in the Americas. The first apples brought to the Western Hemisphere were tart and were used for making cider. It wasn't until around 1800 when apples better suited for pies—with a higher acidity and crispness—began being grown in the United States. It was also around this time that Johnny Appleseed began traveling the country and helping solidify the association of the apple with America.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>The earliest record of the phrase \"American as apple pie\" dates to 1924, when it appeared in an advertisement in the Gettysburg Times. The association between apple pie and America became inextricable by World War II when American soldiers would tell journalists they were fighting for \"mom and apple pie.\" This eventually led to the phrase \"As American as mom and apple pie.\" It became a prevalent saying in the United States during the Postwar years.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>The earliest known apple pie recipe was printed by Geoffrey Chaucer in England in 1381. It included apples, spices, raisins, figs, pears, and saffron in a pastry crust. A Dutch apple pie recipe was found that dates to 1514. Dutch apple pies usually have a lattice pastry top. French, German, and Italian apple pies all appeared in recipe books before American colonies had been settled. Many early apple pie recipes didn't include sugar, and some early pies were made in inedible containers called coffins. Today, apple pie usually has a bottom and top crust. It can be served hot or cold and can be topped with ice cream, custard, and whipped cream. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* World Cocktail Day \n* Top Gun Day \n* Tulip Day\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHappy Celebrating",

    "body": "Hi All,\n\nI cured my Rosacea about 4 years ago (MSM sulfur, zinc, and  selenium) and never returned to this thread. I recently had it again for about the last month and cured it again right around 2 days ago. I put myself through a huge round of tests so I could isolate the cause and the cure. Here are my findings:\n\nCause: I had a week of coffee and spicy food. It wasn't just a little spicy food. It was like hot boiling spicy oil and it obliterated my stomach. I had a KNOWN ulcer at the time of my previous (first)  Rosacea, and thought it was h-pylori but was tested negative. This time around my ulcer HURT and Rosacea came back. For sure there is a connection between my ulcer and rosacea. Whatever foods/items that would destroy gastrointestinal lining, also flared rosacea, the connection was 1:1. If I decided to tempt the fates and drink hot liquids, my stomach would nag and my rosacea would flare. Im aware not all people with ulcers get rosacea and not all rosaceans have ulcers, but at least in my case there is a strong connection. My best tested guess likely is a weakened immune system or related to mucousal antioxidant protection which I'll explain later. I do NOT think it's food or acid leaking into my blood stream because my stools lacked the presence of blood (which I monitored very closely lol). I have other possibilities and theories but I'll address as I go.\n\nTesting: My first bout with rosacea had some the triggers other rosaceans have. Hot water, spicy foods, too much sugars, histamine foods etc. This second time was the same but a lesser degree. Any of the \"triggers\" with ulcers were shared with my rosacea and they coincided completely. Initially I thought it was maybe SIBO, but this time I discounted it because hot water was one of the worst offenders and seems unlikely to make it into the small intestine at high temperatures. I also had tried  a regiment of mastic gum, garlic, and other natural H pylori cures. I did this for almost 2 weeks. None of them worked and had no marked improvement and in some cases actually exacerbated the issue. In my case SIBO/H pylori is out. And then I moved onto MSM supplements (sulphur)  which I initially thought was my original cure. This time... it helped, but never made my skin better it just stopped it from getting worse. Just like the first time round. If taken with food it stopped it from getting worse and there was some marginal improvement, but I still got itchy occasionally and the red marks didn't heal. \n\nPhase 2 testing: At this point, I knew I had to test if it was zinc or selenium was the thing that cured me the first time around. When I had Rosacea at first I took these two simultaneously so it was hard to isolate which helped. So I tried zinc gluconate and zinc carnosine to see if it would help. It helped with other areas of my body, but didn't help rosacea or ulcer much. I also had doubts because I'm ALWAYS taking Zinc.\n\nPhase 3 testing: I did some deeper researcher into Vitamin E and Selenium (again). For some reason I had a nagging feeling that my stomach lining mucous was thin. It was an instinct based on the pain and decided to test it out. Because of it, I looked up some cures for helping mucosal wall. and I found this:  [Influence of vitamin E on gastric mucosal injury induced by Helicobacter pylori infection - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17264389/)  . There are like 40 other papers I could reference, but I wanted to test out if the issue was caused by mucous lining.\n\nTHEORY SIDE NOTE: I have 2 different theories that branch from mucous. 1 being that its directly the mucousal wall in the stomach thats weak and causing the problem. The other is that mucous in the body is completely drained and lacking proper nutrients for production. Which would manifest in the sinuses of rosaceans. So either the stomach lining is so weak its causing bleeds or ruptures or something. OR your body can't produce enough protective mucous, likely it's prioritizing stomach mucous and doesn't have enough antioxidants and protective factors to also make it for your lungs and sinuses. Which would explain rosaceans have issues and flares that spread in that butterfly pattern on the face instead of the whole body. The other last possible theory is that it's JUST antioxidants and the body doesn't have enough. I have doubts on this but it's very possible I'm just glutathione (anti-oxidant) deficent\n\nBack to vitamin E:\n\nThere's a connection between the 2 including the removal of lipid based free radicals and also the stomach lining. I figure, okay... IF my theory somewhat makes sense, supplementing Vitamin E should help since it's an antioxidant used for mucous production. It also makes sense why the first time I cured my rosacea, MSM, zinc, and selenium all helped because they are protective factors from free radicals.  So I took Vitamin E and had MARKED improvement. My dandruff also had been reduced greatly. My Ulcer issue also had calmed down a lot. I found improvement in both after 2 days. I was blown away. \n\nPhase 4 Testing: So now I'm fully convinced it's a Mucousal issue and decided to try selenium.  [Selenium supplementation in the diets of patients suffering from ulcerative colitis | SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02034441)  ,  [SELENIUM DEFICIENCY ALTERS EPITHELIAL CELL MORPHOLOGY AND RESPONSES TO INFLUENZA (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2048669/)  Boom full remission of Ulcer and Rosacea. My dead rosacean skin flakes away and normal skin is underneath.  I've been on selenium and vitamin E (still combo it with MSM and Zinc) but I'm almost back to normal. I can eat normal again but DARE not to take hot liquids as I believe that will just melt my mucosal wall and undo the healing. \n\nConclusions: So the cure, for me at least, involves mucous support. It's possible that glutathione protection (Antioxidant) is comboed with MSM, Selenium, and Vitamin E, and my order of regiment essentially was necessary for a cure. I can't be too sure if it's the combo of all or just strictly selenium / vitamin E. But the fact is all of these supplements work in tandem so I am hesitant to say it's JUST selenium.\n\nIf you do decide to try this on yourself please remember 2 things. \n\n1) Do extensive research on Vitamin E. Some forms are well known to be cancer causing especially dl-alpha synthetic form.  Your body reuses vitamin E so definitely don't overdo it and space it out. Even 400mg is consider an overdose so please be careful.\n\n2) Selenium also can be overdosed so please be extremely careful about your dosage. At most I might take only 400 mcg a day. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Vitamin E/ Selenium, focus on mucousal support supplements. \n\nAlso. PLEAAASSEE let me know if this works or doesn't for you. I'd greatly appreciate it.",

I was hacking up mucus chunks and not digesting food properly. Eventually my cheeks started to get red and bumpy which has never happened before but it wouldn't go away.

Final results take 3 weeks to appear.\n\nOptional: take magnesium citrate and zinc supplements.\n\n# Introduction\n\nHi, I'm always surprised when other medicated people with ADHD tell me their sleep sucks. I can only tolerate poor sleep for 2 weeks before I kill someone, so I try really hard to manage my sleep and I took notes. This guide is the result.\n\nI tried to make this guide short because long posts on an ADHD subreddit are blah, but at least I made the key takeaways into memes.\n\nYou can read through this post chronologically, but it's fairly long, so it might be better to pick the section you're interested in and start there.\n\nThis post is divided into 4-ish sections\n\n* Heavy Hitters - important habits that help you sleep, and why\n* Good to Have, but Not Essential - extra stuff you can do that might help with sleep\n* Troubleshooting when you can't fall asleep\n* Troubleshooting when you can't stay asleep\n\nOkay, good luck with your sleep!\n\n# Disclaimers\n\nI'm not a doctor.\n\nThese methods are the same [guidelines recommended by the National Sleep Foundation](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/sleep-hygiene) (except the magnesium and zinc supplements), but the explanations are written by me based on my understanding of the literature. If I have misunderstood something, please feel free to add a correction.\n\nThese sleep practices allow me to get 7.5 hours of sleep each night in one solid chunk, and without the use of antidepressants, sleeping pills, or melatonin. However, I do use supplements like zinc and magnesium.\n\nMy preexisting conditions:\n\n* ADHD-PI. I take 40mg Vyvanse.\n* ~~Some anxiety~~ A good amount of anxiety. I don't take any medication for this.\n\nKeep in mind that my insomnia is caused by my medication and (occasionally) anxiety. I don’t have any other sleep disorders like sleep apnea, sleep terrors, restless leg syndrome, etc., or other health issues that prevent me from sleeping (i.e., waking in the night to use the washroom).\n\n# The Heavy Hitters\n\nDo you want to see fast results? Do these 4 things: exercise, avoid caffeine/alcohol, stick to a bedtime, and avoid light before bed.\n\n## Exercise\n\nThe best thing you can do for your sleep is to do some sort of cardio work out. The exercise should be moderate to vigorous and should be at least 20 minutes. This means you need to be panting and sweating for at least 20 minutes, and not doing warm-ups or cool-downs. I typically go outside for a 20 minute run in the morning, then a 3 minute cool-down.\n\n**Why does exercise help with sleep?**\n\n>Exercise reduces muscle tension that interferes with your sleep by tightening them up and wringing them out. By bedtime, your muscles will be too tired to tense up, allowing you to relax and drift off.  \n>  \n>Exercise also helps you tolerate stress better, which may result in better sleep. Vigorous exercise spikes cortisol levels during and after your workout so that it will drop later in the night when you’re trying to sleep or stay asleep. Regularly exposing your body to cortisol in a low-emotional stress situation (i.e., exercise) will help your body adapt to higher levels of stress/cortisol when it is in a high-emotional stress situation (i.e., dealing with life in general).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I hate getting all huffy and puffy when I do cardio. Can I do other stuff?**\n\n>No. I tried yoga, indoor workout videos, lifting weights, walking, core workouts, stretching. I find that none of the listed exercises are as good as cardio (specifically running) to keep me asleep at night.  \n>  \n>You don’t only need to get cardio through running like I do. There are alternatives like cycling, doing laps at the pool, solo practice (i.e., squash, tennis), team sports (i.e., soccer, dragon boat racing, ultimate Frisbee)—anything that gets you panting continuously for 20 minutes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**MORE EXERCISE MEANS BETTER SLEEP RIGHT?**\n\n>No.  \n>  \n>Just like how a moderate amount of stress is good enough to motivate you to do something, too much stress will still make you do the thing, but you’ll be crying the whole time.  \n>  \n>It is the same with exercise. Too much vigorous exercise and too often will stress you out too much. Stick to 20 – 40 minutes of vigorous exercise a day, and throw in some low-intensity exercises like yoga, walking, or gardening to further tank your cortisol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**When should I work out?**\n\n>Working out spikes cortisol levels during and shortly after a workout, and then keeps it low as time passes. Therefore, it makes the most sense to exercise first thing in the morning when your natural cortisol levels are the highest (this helps you wake up even more!), and then allowing cortisol to dip lower throughout the day and into the evening.  \n>  \n>Afternoon and evening work outs are also fine, but make sure you don’t exercise within 2 hours before bed or else it can end up stimulating you instead of relaxing you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I worked out in the evening within 2 hours of my bedtime. Oops?**\n\n>You need to do two things as soon as you can: counteract stimulation from exercise and cut all blue light and light in general.  \n>  \n>Wind down by going on a leisurely evening walk or yoga (i.e., 20 minutes or so). Take a warm shower to rapidly cool your body temperature (yes, you read that right) that was elevated by intense exercise. Even better, shower in no or dim lighting (candle time!!) to reduce blue light.  \n>  \n>Literally avoid all bright and/or blue light (i.e., phone, computer, tablet, etc) because it inhibits melatonin production. Instead, spend the remainder of your night with a warm tinted nightlight, or just turn off the lights. Of course, you can fight the boredom by listening to a podcast/audiobook or do some gentle stretching.\n\n## \n\n## Avoid caffeine\n\nUnless you’re one of those people who falls asleep after a cup of coffee, stop consuming caffeine. All of it.\n\n**Lol but why?**\n\n>You already have one stimulant in your system (your meds), so do you really want another one (i.e., caffeine)? Additionally, stimulant medication amplifies the effects of caffeine so your usual cup of coffee will hit you much harder than you remembered. Caffeine typically takes \\~8 hours to completely exit your body, which means your morning coffee may still be kicking around by the time you’re ready to sleep.  \n>  \n>In addition to suppressing tiredness at night, consuming caffeine with your meds may increase anxiety levels, which may further interfere with falling asleep.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So, no coffee or tea?**\n\n>I mean, no NOTHING.  \n>  \n>Besides the obvious sources of caffeine in energy drinks, coffee, and tea, there are a lot of hidden sources of caffeine. Here’s a list:\n\n* Granola bars, specifically named “energy” bars, certain Cliff bars, certain Kashi bars\n* Chocolate or anything containing cocoa powder: Hot chocolate, cocoa, truffles, cheap chocolate bars, chocolate pudding, chocolate breakfast cereals, brownies, the list goes on :( .\n* Most carbonated beverages\n* Coffee or chocolate ice cream/frozen yogurt\n* Certain over-the-counter medications for PMS, headaches, colds\n* Decaffeinated things: decaf coffee and decaf tea\n* Fortified water, specifically “energy” beverages (i.e., vitamin water)\n* Kombucha\n* Oreos coated in chocolate or Oreos with chocolate filling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I have a pretty high tolerance for caffeine. I’ll be okay.**\n\n>Sure, you may not experience jittery hands or anxious thoughts when you have a coffee or a chocolate bar, but it’ll still affect your sleep when you’re on meds. Go ahead. I’ll wait until you’re desperate enough for sleep, give it up, then realize I’m right.  \n>  \n>Please take your time. I’ll wait.\n\n## \n\n## Have a consistent sleep and wake time\n\nPick a bed time and a wake time. Stick to it. Mondays to Fridays, and even on the weekends and holidays.\n\n**Is having a bedtime really going to help?**\n\n>Yes. By having a strict sleep and wake time, you are training your body to sleep and wake at specific times. With practice, you will notice that the time it takes for you to fall asleep will drop to 15 minutes or less.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How strict do I need to be with my sleep and wake times?**\n\n>Generally, the stricter, the better. Try to aim to sleep within 15 minutes of a given bedtime, every single night (including weekends and holidays). For example, if your bedtime is 11pm, the latest you should get into bed is 11:15pm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I went to bed on-time consistently for two weeks and it doesn’t help me fall asleep any faster.**\n\n>Y’know how you need to tire out dogs and children in the day or else they act up at night when you try to put them to sleep? And then they cry? That’s you.  \n>  \n>Going to bed on time works collaboratively with other sleep hygiene habits. For example, if you get into bed after sitting in front of your bright AF dual monitors, while finishing off a midnight slice of chocolate cake, without working out that day (or the previous day), you’re going to be tossing and turning in bed for hours.  \n>  \n>I’ll say that again for the people in the back: Avoid caffeine because it doesn’t make you sleepy, workout to feel tired at night, then avoid lights to make you sleepy, then go to sleep on time.\n\n## \n\n## Avoid light before bed\n\nAn hour before bed, dim the lights in your room so it’s really hard to read, or just chill in the dark. Tint the lights a warm red colour to eliminate blue wavelengths. Avoid sources of blue light like laptops, phones, tablets, cars in traffic (if you drive at night), fluorescent and LED bulbs, and of course the biggest source, the sun (if you’re trying to sleep in a different time zone or do shiftwork).\n\n**Lol why?**\n\n>The *absence of blue wavelengths* is the strongest trigger of melatonin production. You need melatonin to make you sleepy and stay asleep.  \n>  \n>Our lizard brains are (unfortunately) wired to associate blue wavelengths with day time, and its absence with night time. When you expose yourself to blue wavelengths at night, you’re telling your lizard brain to hold off on the melatonin because it’s still day time!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How long do I need to avoid light?**\n\n>For at least 30 minutes before bed. An hour before bed seems to work better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**But sitting in the dark is SOO boring!**\n\n>It doesn’t have to be boring! Listen to some podcasts, audiobooks, make a phone call, stretch, yoga, do all your thinking before you crawl into bed—whatever you want, as long as it happens in a dimly lit room and doesn’t require screens.\n\n## \n\n## Magnesium and Zinc (optional)\n\nI choose to supplement with magnesium and zinc because people with ADHD generally have a deficit of both these molecules, and stimulants suck up a lot of magnesium in our body.\n\nI don’t officially recommend magnesium and zinc, because I’m not anyone’s doctor, but magnesium and zinc definitely help me get better sleep. Magnesium helps with muscle relaxation (i.e., unclenches my jaw and loosens up tense muscles). Zinc helps converts serotonin into melatonin. On nights I forget to take them, I have trouble falling asleep because I’m too tense or wide awake.\n\nI take 300mg of magnesium citrate and 25mg of zinc in the evening with dinner (i.e., 2 – 3 hours before bed). Don't take them in the middle of the day because they'll make you sleepy. \n\nNotes on Magnesium\n\n* The magnesium citrate brand I use is Webber’s Naturals. 300 capsules of 150mg for $14 at Costco.\n* I determined the 300mg dose by calculating the daily recommended intake for a person of my age and gender. 300mg is slightly below the daily recommended value, and I fill the rest with my diet.\n* Taking too much magnesium citrate will give you a bit of diarrhea. I try to decrease this by eating a lot of leafy green vegetables and berries for fibre. Overtime, the diarrhea has improved as my diet improved.\n* Do not take magnesium oxide because that will actually give you explosive diarrhea.\n* I tried switching out magnesium citrate for magnesium bisglycinate, and it was a mega terribad decision, because it doesn’t seem to help with sleep or muscle tension at all.\n\nNotes on Zinc Gluconate\n\n* The zinc brand I buy is Jamison. 100 Tablets of 50mg for (\\~$10) at NoFrills. I split the pills in half with a sharp knife to double my pills.\n* I determined 25mg of zinc by calculating the upper daily limit for taking zinc (40mg), and then reducing that daily limit a bit.\n* DO NOT USE ZINC NASAL SPRAYS. They will permanently destroy your sense of smell.\n\n# Good to Have, but Not Essential\n\n## Clearing Distractions\n\nUse earplugs and sleep masks to decrease your chances of getting woken up by random noises or by the morning sun.\n\n## Temperature\n\nCooling your bedroom will help you fall asleep. I do this by cracking a window open and blocking the heating vent in my room with some books. However, a room that is too cold can also impede sleep because you’re just shivering.\n\n## Sun Exposure\n\nGo outside for 10 minutes is one of the best things you can do for yourself. Exposing your eyes to unfiltered sunlight (viewing it through a window/sunglasses does not count) helps regulate your circadian rhythm and tells you that you should be awake. At the same time, unprotected skin will produce serotonin, which helps you feel more awake. At night, when your eyes stop detecting blue light, your pineal gland uses zinc to convert all that serotonin you produced in the morning (y’know, from your workout and sun exposure) into melatonin, which helps you sleep. The more serotonin you generate in the day, the more raw materials you have to generate melatonin at night.\n\nThis serotonin-melatonin relationship is also the reason why it is so important to avoid blue light and light at night (i.e., the presence of blue light/ light will inhibit your melatonin production).\n\n## Other sleep hygiene points\n\n* Limit naps to 30 minutes and take them before 3pm\n* Avoid large meals before bed\n* Have a bedtime routine (warm shower, reading, stretch, avoid emotionally upsetting activities)\n* Sleep environment is pleasant (cool room, comfortable bedding and clothes, dim lights, blackout curtains, eye shades, ear plugs, humidifiers, fans)\n\n# Troubleshooting\n\n## Trouble Falling Asleep\n\n**I can’t sleep because my body feels restless and tense**\n\n>Physical problem description = You’re lying in bed and you notice that your jaw is clenched. Unclench it! Oh, are your shoulders tense too? Relax them! Oh no, it seems that your whole body is a bit tense.  \n>  \n>I actually don’t really know what physical problems are caused by, but it’s most likely just a side effect of being on stimulant medication in general. Fortunately, it’s a really easy problem to solve. Guided meditations that relax the body are extremely helpful, counting off 10 deep breaths.  \n>  \n>To prevent this problem in the future, try to exercise in the morning/afternoon, or take magnesium supplements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I can't sleep because I can’t get my mind to shut up!**\n\n>Mental problem description = Literally anything is more interesting than focusing on falling asleep, or maybe you can’t stop thinking about what a movie plot means, or maybe you’re ruminating on a frustrating conversation! Before you know it, it’s 2 hours later and you’re no closer to sleeping.  \n>  \n>Try your best to redirect your mind by giving it something soothing to think about. Use meditation and counting off 10 deep breaths to help you refocus your attention. If you can’t even focus on that, put your hand on your diaphragm, notice your breaths as your lungs fill and empty. Focus on the rising and falling sensation, and try again to count your breaths.  \n>  \n>To prevent this problem in the future, I find it extremely helpful to go for a leisurely evening walk (15mins+). I do this on nights after an engaging social event, before important events, and after really stressful days where I can’t help but replay the events in my head. Meditation is also a super effective method to redirect your attention and effectively cope with fluttering thoughts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I can't sleep and I don’t know why! I am SO TIRED. My body is relaxed. My mind is blank, but I can’t fall asleep!**\n\n>Chemical problem description = You have done all you can to ensure you’ll be tired for bed, but you just can’t seem to fall asleep!  \n>  \n>Chemical problems are caused by consuming caffeine or taking your stimulant medication too late in the day. This can also be caused by taking stimulant medication when you first start them, or if you’ve been off them for more than 2 days and resuming medication.  \n>  \n>This problem is also very easy to solve. Take your medication earlier. STOP CONSUMING ANY TYPE OF CAFFEINE, including chocolate or coffee flavoured anything. If you have just started medication, or you are resuming medication after a 2 day break, your body is re-acclimating to stimulants. In this case, there’s no way around insomnia except to continue taking medication as usual and wait for your body to adjust.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I can't sleep because muscle spasms jolt me awake every time I'm about to fall asleep.**\n\n>From personal experience (and according to the internet), this happens when I’m extremely anxious and have been sleeping very poorly for several weeks. If you’re experiencing this, you have my deepest sympathies.  \n>  \n>The simplest way to relieve this is to address the source of your anxiety head on. The sleep deprivation will help you give zero fucks as you truck through the task.  \n>  \n>If addressing the problem is out of your control, try admitting to yourself that the source of your anxiety has a strong impact on you and it makes you feel frustrated/sad/disappointed/angry/whatever. Journal those feelings (which normally leads to cathartic crying. Yesss! More stress relief), or ask for help from someone you trust.  \n>  \n>This problem can also occur if you physically push yourself too hard for too long (i.e., overtraining). In this case, ease off the vigorous activity and switch to moderate-low intensity activities that decrease cortisol like taking evening walks, yoga, and tai chi.\n\n## \n\n## Trouble Staying Asleep\n\n**I wake up at night and can’t fall back asleep, or I’m awake for hours before I can fall back asleep**\n\n>This problem has two common causes: alcohol and/or high cortisol levels.  \n>  \n>If you drank alcohol in the evening, this is an easy fix: don’t drink alcohol. Alcohol can help you get to sleep, but it interferes with slow-wave sleep (i.e., responsible for your learning and memory) and it suppresses REM sleep (i.e., your cognitive processes won’t get any rest) and makes it hard to stay asleep because it triggers adenosine (i.e., a chemical that makes you feel tired) and then it rebounds HARD, making you wake up before you’re done resting.  \n>  \n>However, night awakenings are usually caused by high cortisol levels, which means you’re stressed AF. The hands-down best solution is vigorous exercise in the morning, then low-intensity exercise in the evening.  \n>  \n>You can also use mental solutions to decrease cortisol levels like meditation or therapy, but they’re not as effective as exercising.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Even though I work out every day, I still wake up in the middle of the night**\n\n>When you turn off a burner on the stove, you remove the source of the heat, but the burner is still hot and needs time to cool down. This is you and cortisol. Just because you remove the stress doesn’t mean your body will instantly stop producing cortisol. You will need time for your cortisol levels to normalize.  \n>  \n>It takes time and consistent effort for cortisol levels to go down (via working out and taking direct action), so don’t give up and stay consistent! In my experience, it takes roughly 2 – 3 weeks of consistent working out and good sleep hygiene to stop waking at night.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I slept 8 – 9 hours or more, but I still feel sleepy even after several hours!**\n\n>If you’ve recently had a period of time when you slept poorly, then your body is trying realllllly hard to catch up on lost sleep. Give your body 3 weeks to make up for lost time. By then, the amount of time that needs to pass before you feel ‘awake’ should shorten until it’s only 5 – 20 minutes post-waking.  \n>  \n>If your body can menstruate, you’re probably about to have your period.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I have consistently adhered to all the sleep hygiene practices for at least 3 weeks and I still have trouble sleeping.**\n\n>If you do all of the above consistently for at least 3 weeks (i.e., exercising, avoiding caffeine, keeping a consistent sleep schedule according to your circadian rhythm, regulating light exposure, regulating temperature, using earplugs/sleep masks), plus you take magnesium and zinc, then you may have an issue that is not addressed in this post (e.g., your other medications may interfere with sleep, you may have a sleep disorder, etc.). Please go see a doctor.",

        "body": "Just a head's up but insomnia is a symptom of your ADHD. That means that taking a nighttime dose of your medication might actually improve your sleep. There's growing evidence for this, in one study 95% of patients who added a nighttime dose saw improvement. There's a pretty significant chance that your insomnia is the result of your meds wearing off, not a side effect of them. This isn't a stretch, we already know that stimulants work \"paradoxically\" in people with ADHD.\n\nYou can try it yourself by trying to take a nap 2 - 3 hours after taking a daytime dose of your medication. If you can fall asleep, you might consider adding a dose of your medication 2 -3 hours before you want to be asleep.\n\nBefore I was getting treated for ADHD, I could not fall asleep before 4:00 AM. It didn't matter how physically tired I was, it didn't matter how much sleep hygiene I did, it didn't matter how consistent my wake-up time was. Falling asleep any earlier required some form of sedation (I was on trazodone which I didn't like using every night because after a few days of use it would make me feel weird). The problem was that I had to wear out my brain first, and my brain was on a completely different schedule that had nothing to do with what the rest of my body was doing or feeling. I started adding a dose of my medication 2 - 3 hours before the time I wanted to be asleep because I was aware of how well my meds were able to \"calm\" my brain. After taking my meds, I still did all the sleep hygiene stuff - bedtime routine, turning off lights, getting into bed, etc. Lo and behold, not only was I actually able to fall asleep when my body became tired but I actually felt rested when I woke up. I felt like I \"got enough sleep\" for the first time EVER. Previously, there was no discernible difference in my energy levels whether I got four hours of sleep or ten. I'm not joking, I had never experienced a good night's sleep before this. I'm finally able to appreciate what people are talking about when emphasizing the importance of sleep on mood and function.\n\nSo, definitely establish good sleep hygiene. But if sleep is still a huge struggle for you, consider actually adding a dose of your meds before bedtime. The results might surprise you.",

I have been using it every night for a month in conjunction with my 0.025% tret prescription and I'm only about 1/3 of the way through the bottle! A little really goes a long way as this has a pretty watery texture. This product has single-handedly helped so much with the redness and dryness that my tret was causing. I think if you are someone who has lots of skin redness, rosacea, or a damaged skin barrier this would be really great for you. I also love how short the ingredients list is. The only downside is the price/size, as at Shoppers it retails for $47 for 30mL. I'm interested in trying the cream from the same line next. Does anyone have thoughts about that product? Let me know what you think!",

    "body": "(TLDR: They discontinued Neutrogena Creamy Fragrance-Free Ultra-gentle Daily Cleanser, which fixed my tretinoin-related dryness/rash. I need to find a new *extremely bland/hypoallergenic creamy* glycerin/water-based cleanser, but tretinoin has made my lower face SUPER reactive and dryness-prone. **List of preferences, cleansers I tried/am considering, and current routine below the dashes at bottom**. I've maintained the results in the first photo. The cleanser ingredients are in the second photo. After that, photos are in chronological order from the start of the reaction to the healing process, with cleansers listed in text. No other products were adjusted.)\n\nA few months into using tretinoin, my skin became EXTREMELY red/irritated/rashy/reactive. I suspect it may have either been an extremely damaged skin barrier or possibly perioral dermatitis, but never had it diagnosed (peak pandemic at the time and couldn't be bothered to get a referral). \n\nMy cleanser ended up being extremely important in the recovery process. Not to be dramatic, but when I started using Neutrogena's **CREAMY formulation** of the Ultra-gentle Fragrance Free daily cleanser *everything changed*. It didn't sting, make my skin tight, or cause redness/bumps. It actually felt MORE comfortable after washing. Within a few weeks my skin was a normal color again and flare-ups of the rash/dryness became much less severe and eventually disappeared completely. My skin *loves* this cleanser. I've been using it for 4 years and my skin looks unbelievably dewy and clear and I regularly get compliments on it. (Pictures included) I still feel occasional dryness/tightness around my nose/mouth/chin if the air is especially dry, but I can completely avoid rashes/flaking by temporarily reducing tretinoin and applying extra aquaphore when I feel it starting to happen.\n\n**Unfortunately, Neutrogena decided to break my heart and replaced the creamy cleanser with a \"cream to foam\" version that sucks absolute butt**. They're really playing up the whole *\"repairing the skin barrier\"* thing with the new line, but it's SO much harsher than the old creamy cleanser.\n\nThe best thing about the cleanser was how few ingredients there were (only 11). It was pretty much just glycerin and water. I've been having a hell of a time finding other creamy cleansers in general (why must everything foam??) but when I do, they've got tons of \"extras\" in there (ceramides, niacinamide, Hyaluronic Acid, various plant extracts or oils, etc.) and I'm very much afraid they will trigger my skin.\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(**Creamy cleansers I've already tried +  Cleansers I am considering + Current routine all listed below**)\n\nThings I am looking for:\n- **the BLANDEST hypoallergenic creamy cleanser you know of; very few ingredients and absolutely nothing \"special\" added**.\n- **Water and Glycerin** as first two ingredients \n- **Creamy soap-free formula** (foam dries/irritates my skin — I don't think it's just an SLS thing; Oil cleansers don't really work for me, and tend to trigger the reaction + make acne on forehead worse.)\n- **Fragrance-free**\n- **No Hyaluronic Acid** (90% sure I'm allergic)\n- **No exfoliating ingredients/actives** (I know some people can handle a little, but I am unfortunately not one of them)\n- **No botanical extract/plant extract/essential oil** or anything else clearly marketed as \"something special/ancient they found in a secret forest/ocean that sets this cleanser apart from everyone else\" (I personally see this stuff mostly as a marketing gimmick, and if you are prone to reactions like me, it just increases the odds of a rash by 1000%)\n\nCreamy cleansers I have tested:\n- **Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser** - tested it on hands last week (because of trust issues). Felt nice while washing, but my hands were itchy and tight 20 minutes later. *Ingredients that were different from my current cleanser*: sodium benzoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, xanthan gum, panthenol, citric acid, niacinamide, pantolactone (note: citric acid and niacinamide are both in the glossier serum I use, so I don't *think* I react to them.)\n- **CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser** - Tried this before I found my discontinued cleanser. It stung like nobody's business and my rash always looked and felt worse immediately after using. I'm considering another go, but I'm scared of it tbh...\n\nCleansers I am considering/curious about:\n- [**SVR Sebiaclear Cream Cleanser**](https://ca.svr.com/en/products/sebiaclear-creme-lavante) (Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Niacinamide, Behenyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Xanthan Gum, Zinc Gluconate, Decyl Glucoside, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Glyceryl Stearate Se, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Phytate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate)\n\nMy current routine:\n- cleansing (AM/PM): Neutrogena creamy fragrance free ultra gentle daily cleanser (RIP)\n- AM products: Glossier super pure (niacinamide+ zinc) serum, Indeed labs squalane oil, Eucerin Urea Repair (5%) replenishing face cream (*LOVE this*), Jamieson Vitamin E Deep Nourishing Day Cream (dryness-prone areas only), Aveeno positively radiant SPF 30 moisturizer, Supergoop unseen sunscreen, Vichy Capital Soleil tinted mineral sunscreen. Aquaphore over dry spots (as needed; usually just near nose in winter)\n- PM products: Eucerin Urea Repair (5%) replenishing face cream, Jamieson Vitamin E Deep Nourishing Day Cream. Aquaphore all over face on tretinoin-free nights.\n- *Trenton every other night*: regular PM products, then add Retin-a Micro (0.04%) and an extra layer of Jamieson moisturizer on top. ",

It's very creamy/milky, it doesn't foam or even really lather, fragrance-free, no hyaluronic acid or any other actives or exfoliating ingredients, no essential oils (does contain chamomile flower extract, though).\n\nIt's the gentlest, most no-frills cleanser I've ever tried. I switched back to it after struggling with dryness & flaking with tret, and it's helped massively. If nothing else, it comes in a little 4oz version for $16 USD, so if your skin doesn't agree with it, at least you won't be stuck with a huge bottle.\n\nMy other, more tentative suggestion would be HoliFrog's Tashmoo Water Lily cleanser, which *does* have water and glycerin as the first two ingredients. It's very similar to Stratia's cleanser, but does contain 3 plant extracts (water lily root extract, lotus flower extract, and spirulina extract). It's also more expensive than Stratia's 4oz version for only slightly more product.",

Well I went to Walgreens and bought zinc gluconate while waiting on zinc carnosine to arrive by mail. Well last night after eating I began feeling pretty shitty and I was like let me try this zinc.. literally 5 minutes later I felt fine. Works better than ppis.. and a bunch of other people have said the same thing. Just wanted to inform y’all in case anyone wanted to try it!!\n\nEDIT: I also want to add that zinc carnosine is standard treatment for gastritis and ulcers in Japan! In Japan you need a prescription for it. So yeah it works...",

If anything I’m sensitive or allergic to rubs on my skin and I happen to touch it, I’m breaking out in instant hives that last for days. Pure hell. \n\nI’ve been to the doctor and I’m working on repairing the barrier and have been instructed to use unscented lotion multiple times per day (I’ve also been given an RX steroid cream for the hives and it’s working well, and we switched my allergy meds — all good).\n\nI’ve been using Lubriderm Unscented Lotion for Normal to Dry Skin. I used it years ago and remembered it was good. It’s been perfect. \n\nI used up the first bottle and repurchased. I didn’t notice right away, but the second bottle was slightly different and I noticed the consistency was thicker. I was also having skin issues on the first day after I used the new bottle. Well, I compared the ingredients and the new bottle is different, namely the addition of shea butter. I checked Lubriderm’s website, and they’ve updated the formula to include shea butter.\n\nI cannot use shea butter. My skin doesn’t absorb it and it just sits on top and doesn’t allow my skin to breathe, which causes other allergy and medical issues. \n\nI need help finding a lotion that is pretty much the same as the old Lubriderm formula.\n\nHere’s my issue though — I don’t mind lotion, but I am super picky and it cannot leave a greasy feel. Like at all. And it needs to absorb quickly otherwise stuff sticks to my skin and causes the hives. I struggle finding lotions I like, because most lotions for sensitive skin which are fragrance free are too heavy and almost always have shea butter in them. \n\nAny suggestions? \n\nEDIT - adding ingredients for formulas.

I recently got a new bottle of lubriderm (daily moisture-all skin types) and after just a few applications, it began to cause a severe skin rash on me with redness over most my body. After putting it on again just now, it immediately caused my skin to grow red and irritated.  Nothing else that I have been eating or applying to myself has really deviated from my normal routine.  Mind you, this is the same cream I’ve been using since 2017.  After reading about this, lubriderm has lost another customer.  I won’t be using this product again.\n\nAfter checking my old bottle of lubriderm daily moisture normal to dry skin, I am noticing that it does not contain shea butter; however, the new one does. \n\nThis new formula, as you so aptly put it, is toxic for our skin.",

Since atopalm.com website is based in New Jersey, United States, the order arrived quickly. Both are 80 ml and have no scent. \n\nSkin type: Combination (oily dehydrated acne prone)\n\nProblem: Restoring skin barrier and inflammation \n\n1. Intensive Oint-Cream\n\nIngredients:\n\n\nWater/Aqua, Theobroma cacao (Cocoa) seed butter, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cetearyl alcohol, Cocoglycerides, Butyrospermum parkii (Shea) butter, Polyglyceryl-10 distearate, Sorbitan stearate, Panthenol, Glyceryl stearate, Squalane, Stearic acid, Camellia oleifera seed oil, Caprylyl methicone, Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phytosterols, Tocopheryl acetate, Myristoyl/palmitoyl oxostearamide/arachamide MEA, Euphorbia cerifera (Candelilla) wax, Zinc gluconate, Methyl caprooyl tyrosinate, Tetracarboxymethyl palmitoyl dipeptide-12, Xanthan gum, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA, Madecassoside, Caprylyl glycol\n\nReview: I apply this nighttime after I put on the soothing cream for more hydration. This melts into the skin right away and surprisingly doesn’t make my face look oily. I really like this moisturizer and I started using it in May (when the month started off with cool weather). It feels so light on my skin and I’m going to repurchase it after it’s finished. With this moisturizer, the hydration lasts the whole day. It doesn’t break me out either and doesn’t leave a white cast. In the winter time, I’ll probably use this during the daytime too. \n\n2. Soothing Cream\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater/Aqua, Glycerin, Propanediol, Caprylic/capric triglyceride, Sorbitan stearate, Cetearyl alcohol, Carthamus tinctorius (Safflower) seed oil, Glyceryl stearate, Stearic acid, Dimethicone, Myristoyl/palmitoyl oxostearamide/arachamide MEA, Methyl caprooyl tyrosinate, Phytosterols, Tocopheryl acetate, Bisabolol, Xanthan gum, Sodium hyaluronate, Carbomer, Arginine, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl glycol, Tropolone\n\nReview: I use this daytime and nighttime. It’s a great simple moisturizer and this also doesn’t make my face look oily. It doesn’t break out my skin. This moisturizer also goes into my skin right away and does not leave a white cast. I will also be repurchasing this moisturizer too. \n\nResult: Both of these moisturizers really have helped restore my skin barrier and my skin feels stronger. My skin also has been less inflamed.",

    "body": "I've recently been diagnosed with COVID-19 and I wanted to chronicle my journey here because it's definitely a spooky experience, I'm only finishing up my second day and I'm worried about how my symptoms might worsen. Hopefully listing my experiences will help someone assess where they are if they have similar symptoms sometime in the future.\n\nDay 0 - I don't know whether to include this or not but I will just in case, Wednesday (Dec. 23) I generally feel fine the whole day, however closer to midnight I started to feel warm and have some muscle aches, not much more.\n\nDay 1 - Wake up, mild fever, muscle aches, don't feel too great but smell and taste are still there. I also only got around 5 hours of sleep because I got an early phone call from my part-time job cancelling my shift, thank goodness. Fever around 100.2 at the peak but generally hovering around 99.8. Took some Tylenol and generally walked around as much as I could to circulate the blood. Also mild bit of nausea in the morning.\n\nDay 2 - Woke up at some point in the night since I wasn't sleeping under my blanket with chills, I quickly crawl under my blanket and after what felt like 1-5 minutes I stop shivering and knock back out. Wake up later feeling mostly fine, but decided to get a test done anyway. I go to my nearest urgent care and get a rapid ag test done, the doctor says my breathing is clear, my temperature is at 99.1, but that I had COVID and my results came back pretty fast (I want to say under five minutes?). Muscle aches are gone, fever is better, no breathing issues, taste and smell are fine. I've had somewhat of a lost appetite these last two days but it's probably due to stress more than anything. Mild head tension, but hardly anything worth noting. Also very mild coughs, maybe 3 times an hour.\n\nThat's it so far, all I know is that things are going to start getting worse around day 5. I ordered an oximeter that's coming Monday so if things worsen by then at least I'll have a number on my oxygen levels.\n\nEdit: Day 3 - Slept on my side that night just to be extra safe. Temperature at 98F, no muscle aches, smell and taste still there, out of no where I developed what felt like thick mucus on the lower part of my throat and it's been bothering me on and off throughout the day with the upper part of my throat being mildly sore. I've been thirsty the whole day and it seems like no matter how much I drink I'm still thirsty, although I've felt this way with other sicknesses, still no coughs however. My brother dropped off vitamin D3 (2000 IU), Tylenol (extra strength & sinus severe), Mucinex, Zinc Gluconate Glycine, and vitamin C (500 mg). I know vitamin D is fat soluble, however I'm definitely within the safe zone in terms of intake. Other than that, I feel normal, hopefully things stay that way.\n\nThanks to everyone who left advice and words of encouragement! More updates tomorrow.\n\nEdit2: Day 4 - No new information, the only symptoms for today have been a mildly sore throat, other than that temperature has been at 98F and no other symptoms present. Oximeter came early today and the oxygen saturation is at 98%. starting tomorrow for the next week I'll have to keep a closer eye on my symptoms because that's the range I heard that things can start getting worse, although I won't post daily updates unless any significant developments occur.\n\nhopefully things stay positive.\n\nEdit3: Day 6 - Finally lost my sense of smell, yesterday I had an endlessly runny nose and today my sense of smell is all but gone. If a spray a strong deodorant against my hand and really press my nose against it I can faintly smell it but otherwise it's gone. Everything else is normal. 97.8F temperature, no coughs, sore throat is all but gone, oxygen saturation at 98%, and heartrate at 72 BPM. My nose is a battlefield though: sneezing, no smell, and if I sharply inhale I'll feel a slight burning sensation in my nostrils. Let's hope things start going uphill soon.\n\nEdit4: This is the final update, I'm on day 11 and all my symptoms are pretty much gone. I have to say, the scare of the virus was worse than the virus itself for me. There is still research being done on the potential long term effects (even for asymptomatic people) but if all goes well then I should be cured of it for now. I know the virus has been lethal for some and a horrible experience for others, so I'll continue to stay protected and warn others about it, hopefully no one takes it less seriously due to my personal experiences.",

Don’t worry you will be fine. Eat good food, eggs, meat, take liquids. Have vitamin C and zinc tabs as advised by your doctor. My  wife and son(25) got it November last week and stayed normal though had little fever for first two days. I too took test with them but was negative so we three quarantined at home together I taking care of household. Everything went fine. After 15 days both  wife n son took  test again and were negative.  But as precaution I also did another test for me. I was now positive. That showed I too might have gone positive 10-12 days earlier while in their company . But I had been asymptomatic and in fact unaware of my being corona positive til I took that second test.  Now we all three are fine and negative. My advice is get RT PCR test done as rapid tests are not that reliable as people say.",

    "body": "Here are the results of August’s saliva test from my dentist. The test was $199 initially, which also included genetic testing. I was informed that future tests will be cheaper because I won’t have to pay for the genetics portion again. These are bacteria that specifically cause bad breath. As you can see, my results were abnormally high for some of these. My hygienist thought I’d be disappointed when the results came back, but I was actually empowered because I was given a map of the issue and what to treat. \n\nI was put on an antibiotic for 10 days (I don’t remember the name) following the saliva test. A month prior to the test, I went to the GI doc and it was guessed that I had SIBO. I took 5 days of antibiotics for that, and haven’t taken antacids since. I had a root canal this month due to the roots of a tooth dying and an access forming within my jawline. I was given a z-pack (4 days of antibiotics). This has dramatically improved my situation. I’m not encouraging anyone to go crazy with antibiotics because they have side effects, but I was careful to take probiotics between doses. \n\nI recommend getting the saliva test from the dentist because it specifically tests for strains of bacteria that cause BB. Finding out which strains are most prominent helps with determining a course of treatment. \n\nI’m not completely out of the woods yet. I had alcohol and French fries at a hockey game last night and my breath was tart by the time we got to dinner. But that went away when I started drinking water to both hydrate and rinse my mouth, and I popped some gum. I’ve also discovered that my mouth gets dry when I get nervous so I have to keep water on hand. \n\nI also found zinc liquid gels on Amazon and take 3-4 in the morning, 3 around lunch, and sometimes 3 at night. I take 2 magnesium pills in the morning. I can tell a difference when I don’t take the pills. A dose of pure zinc should only be 40mg daily, but zinc gluconate can be up to 350mg daily per www.drugs.com. \n\nhttps://www.drugs.com/mtm/zinc-gluconate.html\n\nI hope this helps. I’ll be updating you guys as I continue making progress. ",

    "body": "I’m currently suffering from a compromised skin barrier which is making my allergic skin far more sensitive than usual. If anything I’m sensitive or allergic to rubs on my skin and I happen to touch it, I’m breaking out in instant hives that last for days. Pure hell. \n\nI’ve been to the doctor and I’m working on repairing the barrier and have been instructed to use unscented lotion multiple times per day (I’ve also been given an RX steroid cream for the hives and it’s working well, and we switched my allergy meds — all good).\n\nI’ve been using Lubriderm Unscented Lotion for Normal to Dry Skin. I used it years ago and remembered it was good. It’s been perfect. \n\nI used up the first bottle and repurchased. I didn’t notice right away, but the second bottle was slightly different and I noticed the consistency was thicker. I was also having skin issues on the first day after I used the new bottle. Well, I compared the ingredients and the new bottle is different, namely the addition of shea butter. I checked Lubriderm’s website, and they’ve updated the formula to include shea butter.\n\nI cannot use shea butter. My skin doesn’t absorb it and it just sits on top and doesn’t allow my skin to breathe, which causes other allergy/skin and medical issues. \n\nI need help finding a lotion that is pretty much the same as the old Lubriderm formula.\n\nHere’s my issue though — I don’t mind lotion, but I am super picky and it cannot leave a greasy feel. Like at all. And it needs to absorb quickly otherwise stuff sticks to my skin and causes the hives. I struggle finding lotions I like, because most lotions for sensitive skin which are fragrance free are too heavy and almost always have shea butter in them. \n\nAny suggestions? I also posted in r/Allergies but I can’t cross post to here so I am double posting. \n\nOLD / PREFERRED FORMULA: \n\nINGREDIENTS: Water (eau), Mineral Oil (huile minérale), Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Stearic Acid, Cetyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Ceteary! Alcohol, Dimethicone, Carbomer, Ceteareth-20, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Citrate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Citric Acid, Ethylparaben, Panthenol.\n\nNEW / TRASH FORMULA:\n\nWater, Mineral Oil, Glycerin, Carbomer, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Cetyl Alcohol, Sodium Polyacrylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, Sodium Hydroxide, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Fragrance, Disodium EDTA, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Oil, Magnesium Aspartate, Zinc Gluconate, Copper Gluconate",

    "body": "(tl;dr at the end)\n\nFor the last 2 weeks I've been taking Zinc to try and combat my acne. I read about it years ago, tried one and barfed. I didn't know you should take it with food. I was 15 at the time. I am 27 now.\nI've tried:\n\nAccutane - Worked but it came back and I believe was the source of my kidney and liver issues :\\\n\nBenzoyl Peroxide - Helped, but it was not a cure. Also too much skin irritation and actually made my back acne worse. Stopped helping after prolonged use.\n\nAntibiotics (Bactrim) - It helped but it gave me reoccurring yeast infections (anal), very itchy and gross. Also, as we all know, antibiotics are not good to be taken for long periods of time (google).\n\nRetin A - Fried my skin and only helped my back a little, face did not heal.\n\nFish Oil - Didn't do a thing. Took it for a couple months.\n\nNo Dairy - Did it for a few months, no improvement.\n\nGluten Free - Did it for about 4 months, no improvement.\n\nProactive - Imagined punching everyone that continues to tell me I should try proactive in the balls/vagina.\n\nI get acne on my face, scalp, neck, back and chest. I've had it since I was 12. I'm one of those guys that is known for always having acne. Especially now, as an adult at 27, I'm sure plenty of you can empathize. I was VERY hard to talk to girls, even when my face was clear, because I know if things went well and we ever ended up being intimate, I would have to take of my shirt and expose my acne ridden skin. I almost always have body acne. The face has gotten a lot more mild. \n\nZINC IS MY CURE! I realize that everyone's cause and relief is different. But, if you haven't tried it, please do! I can attest! It has only been 2 weeks and I've stopped getting huge cystic acne all over. Even my spots are fading (at my age the skin doesn't heal as well as it did when I was a teen). I take one half of a 50 MG Zink Gluconate early day with a big meal and the other half at night with a big meal. If I take a whole, no matter how much I eat, I'm super sick. It's been that easy. I still get some small ones every once in a while, but I'm going to keep it up as long as possible! I will update next week with progress. \n\ntl;dr - 50 MG of Zinc Gluconate per day (half with meal early in day, half with meal late part of day) has started to cure my acne about 80% after 2 weeks. Will update next week!\n\nUpdate: Update: 50mg of Gluconate is not enough. It only contains a small amount of Elemental Zinc, which is the kind that actually helps with acne. My acne hasn't gotten past about 75 to 80% clear. I'm still getting a few zits here and there. It's clearly helping but not curing. I've learned that, when they speak of toxicity involving zinc, they are referring to Elemental Zinc. Therefore it is safe to take Gluconate in higher doses. There's a good pill out there with close to 200mg of gluconate that equals 25mg of elemental zinc. My pills are 50mg gluconate so I am going to start taking 3 to 4 pills at day to see if it improves any more. I will update! Thanks guys!\n\n",

    "body": "TL;DR Testosterone 497 -> 575 after 3.5 months\n\nSo I have been taking ND's Tongkat Ali 2% and Cistanche (both 200mg) for 6 days a week since middle of September, starting out with smaller dosage and separately and took 10 days off in late November. I have been taking Solaray tongkat since the beginning of July and I did not feel much difference after a week so I searched around and found ND. Basically from my first blood test I concluded that Tongkat without eurycomanone (I saw a post from MYASD somewhere that he tested Solaray to contain 0.1%) can also lower SHBG as my SHBG has been show to be quite low. After taking both I quickly feel the effects and by the third week I feel my body just clicked both mentally and physically and I feel a lot younger. So this morning I went to do another blood and... actually I thought the increase in total test is quite low (only 16% increase) while I feel a lot better in all regards. Perhaps there is some more improvement left for me?\n\nMy physique has got quite better with my waist down from 38 1/4\" to 36 1/2\" after 3 months, almost 2 inches. Body fat % (us navy method, not DEXA) down from 24% to 22%, so that is some nice recomposition there, also more muscle on my upper body esp arms despite never doing any arm specific training (I do mostly compound bodyweight these days). My diet/exercise hasn't changed much so I think ND's tongkat really helped in this area. Although the bloodwork result is not significant, my smaller belly is, so I am glad I bought enough TA and cistanche to last me until early 2024.\n\nIn general, on this simple stack, I feel more energetic, mood up, confidence up, more motivated, easier for me to make progress while working out. Feels like turning black the clock as a 39M.\n\nAbout cistanche, I found out that if I overeat for some time, it would GREATLY enhance my mood and energy to almost euphoric like state. However if I undereat for some time it would lead to depression, so if you are going to take cistanche, you have to EAT, at least not under. It is good for a health toner and made my stool much better when I eat rather normally.\n\nOther supps I took:\n\nmagnesium daily (switching to ND micromag when my current supply finishes, if I can take only 1 supp it would be magnesium)\n\nvitamin D/zinc occassionally (I live in the tropics so took off most clothes while viewing the sun in the morning). I personally don't really think I lack zinc although I started to take 10mg zinc gluconate pretty much daily recently)\n\nTrialing agmantine (200\\~300mg) and alcar (300\\~350mg) in the morning with coffee and feels great, hopefully I don't run into side effect from alcar as I feel overstimulated after 400mg). Agmantine in this amount somehow made me feels more libido and somehow cancels out unwanted jittery from alcar, and together makes me more energetic and happy. After starting ALCAR one thing I noticed is that I no longer can feel any sadness.\n\nI will be purchasing ND tribulus the day it is released for sure, I think it is the missing supp in my quest to feel more androgenic.\n\nSome bio-hacks I have been implementing:\n\nViewing sun first thing in the morning since July\n\nIcing my ballz since September (feels slightly better, free and does not take time on its own so why not)\n\nMouth taping since 10 days ago - By far the most impactful, increases calmness throughout the day, much more restful sleep comparing to no tape, increases sleep duration.\n\nIn conclusion, I am glad I made the choice to give ND a try and thanks to ND's team effort to make quality stuff, keep up the good work!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ts9q9wap569a1.jpg?width=981&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ff0e872fb6da13c2c2f13999d19de6d67b1b0af\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xg4309bp569a1.jpg?width=1405&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d7ea24f405c56aa38b095c32a2542c6b4f514a9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uzhrs1bp569a1.jpg?width=1248&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb56dac5f155581184e2cfd149159cb293a1335e",

        "body": "Thank you for sharing this great review! I'm glad you are getting such results! The numbers you share between body weight, body fat %, and belly fat are huge - not to mention the cognitive and \"wellness\" effect!\n\nSo what's great is I am the same age as you, I take the same supplements with TA, cistanche, and agmatine at the core of my stack, and I perceive very much the same things as you. Granted, our \"starting configurations\" may be different as I work out very often and my body fat is 10% lower. I've never had a problem with feeling my age creep up on me, but with dialing everything in and optimizing my supplementation schedule I really do feel better than at any other age in my life. Oh and I 100% get the same experience with cistanche! I take it with dinner on days I work out. I'm working on beefing up so I will sit there and eat two huge dinner portions and soon after my whole body feels warm and floaty. Overeating (especially high quality calories) on occasion is a powerful hormone stimulator itself, and throwing in cistanche seems to boost this effect.\n\nLast note, while the blood work is good, I think all the other results you share eclipse that. I think in many cases, people looking to supplementation for the sake of raising testosterone alone miss the forest for the trees. I think what they want is what you describe in your results which can be *associated* with elevated test - body recomposition, feeling better/happier/smarter, having a better sex life. But the reality is there are so many other factors and, in fact, those objectives can be met while maintaining very modest test levels. \n\nAnyways, hats off to you. I'm definitely interested in how things progress in another few months if you stay the path. If you really dial in nutrition and exercise and get your body fat to the low teens, I have no doubt you will feel like a brand new person.\n\nEdit/add: Do not be discouraged by the modest increase on your panel!!! If you want to see higher numbers, focus on bringing your body fat and overall weight down. High body fat will absolutely hinder optimal hormone production and supplements alone will NOT do the job. The other experiences you noted are a strong indicator that your supplement routine is moving you in the right direction. But you have to address the big stuff (pun intended) first, or it will be like driving with your foot on the brakes!!",

Rescue Balm has zinc oxide towards the bottom)\n\n\\-Rescue Balm is marketed as a post-blemish spot treatment, but can also be used on the entire face if desired. From what I've seen, most people use Cicaplast as an all-over treatment, but can also be used as a spot treatment.\n\n**My experience:**\n\n\\- I've used both of these products and the texture is almost the same, with the Rescue Balm being a bit pastier with less spreadability (although it is intended as a spot treatment so keep that inmind)\n\n\\- Rescue Balm tends to separate in the tube and get oily, but shaking the tube resolves this issue so it isn't a problem. I've personally never experienced this with Cicaplast. \n\n\\- 50ml Cicaplast is around $14-$15, and 50ml of Rescue Balm is $30 (the more readily available 15ml of rescue balm is $13).\n\nSo far, I've used Cicaplast as an occlusive for my entire face, and have only used the Rescue Balm on blemishes as I only have the 15ml tube and don't want to go through it too quickly. However, I used the Cicaplast on breakouts that I got after threading and it worked really well, just how I expected the Rescue Balm to work. Given all that, I think I'll be sticking to the Cicaplast from now on and use it a spot treatment when I need to because it's way more cost effective. Although the peptides in the Rescue Balm seem promising, the end result, at least for me, is the same. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Has anybody else used both and found one to be superior to the other? Have you found the Rescue Balm to be worth the price?",

My memory is fuzzy but according to the empty bottle I still have I started with 3x 30mg of zinc citrate capsules (so many different formulations of zinc, jury mostly out on any one type being superior) and I do remember it giving me some really bad nausea until I just did one capsule on a full stomach 3x/day. Lesson: start low, go slow, zinc nausea is *awful*.\n\nWhen I finished that bottle I think I switched to 50mg zinc gluconate tablets, which I ended up having to split with a pill cutter. Uh, swallowing jaggedy tablets isn't the funnest so I abandoned that bottle and for the last 150 days or so I've been taking one called Optizinc (zinc methionine) with added copper (too much zinc causes copper deficiency), but just one 30mg capsule per day is working great (and has never given me nausea). No HS \"lumps\" in many many many months. A real experiment would mean going off the zinc and seeing if the lumps come back, but...hard pass.\n\nI should add, for context, that back when I started the zinc I was on two immune suppressant prescriptions (infliximab, azathioprine) for my Crohn's disease (that apparently had no helpful effect on the HS) and now I'm on none.\n\nEdit: for everyone sending me chat requests to ask for updates, please send DMs instead, those notifications get seen more easily/often.",

If I ate a huge meal, I would take 100mg zinc. It was literally having some sort of \"cancellation\" effect. For example, if I had a huge meal and only took 50mg zinc instead of 100mg, it would only protect me half as much and a lump would appear, just smaller.\n\nThe only worrying thing is the long-term effects of zinc capsules daily. There's the nausea and copper thing and I guess it depends on the dose you're taking but i'm at a stage now where food isn't really triggering me the same way it used to before, so maybe taking a low dose zinc daily as a preventative measure could prove to be useful.\n\nThanks for the post. It reminded me of a supplement I abandoned which really could help me a lot lol.\n\nEdit: I wonder if something like Zinc Cycling can be done, where you take zinc for a period, then rest, and repeat",

It will get into places and really disrupt the \"stuff\" deep in pores, wounds and tracts where bacteria hide and protect themselves from immune response and antibiotic treatment.  \nOne way to make the most of a regular dietary intake of zinc is to avoid all foods that are browned, fried, or otherwise heated enough to produce the delicious Maillard reaction, as Maillard products will remove zinc from your body.  \n\n\nThe whole nausea thing is completely understandable, looking at the results of the pilot, and what any doctor can tell you about taking so much zinc... taking so much zinc long term will probably not have nice results",

    "body": " Now at 36... I was thinking about going on testosterone for life over 4 yrs ago when I came off opiates after 9 yrs on them and realized they shut down your testosterone through OPIAD or opiate induced androgen deficiency. And they can do it worse than cycling test since some people stay on them many years like me. I did test when I was younger and did proper post cycle protocol. My hormones were fine afterwards & I kept most my gains for many years. However eventually out of stress I began using opiates. Fastforward 9 yrs I continued using opiates for stress & work. When I stopped using them I realized I could no longer get erections at all. It took 10 months, almost a fully year to masturbate 1 time. Let me reiterate at 32. And I was absolutely sick of doctors too at this point & stopped going to most. I won't rant about that.\n\nAnyway, I was crazy depressed & tearing up or crying at least once a day. I just couldn't react to stress on any level and was deficient in so many minerals. But I simply couldn't hop on testosterone because I had already spent most my life going to doctors. I grew to hate NEEDING to go to the doctor over & over for MY health issues. High blood pressure, crazy anxiety & depression, vertigo, lack of motivation to do anything, lack of hope about anything, dizziness, blood sugar problems, I was 32 dealing with all this crap. Literally I felt like I was in my 80s... like I was very close to death. \n\nSo anyway I did a lot of things but this was mostly what I did -\n\n(a targeted higher dose mutli-B vitamin without any minerals)  \nB-1 (thiamin) - 100mg day  \nB-2 - (riboflaving) 100mg day  \nB-3 - niacin 50mg day  \nB-5 - pantothenic acid 250mg day  \nB-6 (20mg p5p)  \nmethyl folate & methyl B-12   \nCholine   \nInositol (or \"B8\") 4gms day (a great long term potentiator for herbal anti-depressants like kanna, rhodiola or st johns wort if you take ANY of these at all consider adding high dose inositol for 1-2 month to build up levels).    \n\n\nA mineral supplement for all more rare metals (manganese, chromium, molybdenum, vandium, silver, etc).|  \nThen isolated minerals at higher doses for bone & hormones: boron 3mg, magnesium citrate 4,500mg, calcium citrate 1000mg, zinc gluconate 15mg (always at night), copper gluconate 2mg (always early), iodine 225mcg (early), etc. Then all the best aminos all taken multiple times a day, l-tyrosine (early), l-citrulline, l-glutamine, l-arginine, agmatine 2gms / day, l-carnitine 2gms/day, l-carnosine 1000mg (I love the combination of l-carnitine with l-carnosine everyday)  l-glycine 500-1000mg, l-tryptophan & higher doses of l-gylcine at night to sleep. Throw in some GABA on top of there. \n\nAminos that seem to improve my mood the most would be: l-tyrosine, l-tryptophan, l-carnitine, l-carnosine, l-glycine, agmatine. I could say others too but I focus a lot on those 6 everyday in terms of really maintaining mood & energy. \n\nThis is all done with protein scoops throughout the day (25gms twice a day) on top of all the chicken, fish and veggies I now eat.  \nD-aspartic acid is great to help boost test, cycle it. Never cycle it with less calories always more or you will feel worse. Watch macro intake carefully.   \nL-orthinine combined with L-aspartic acid (LOLA) is great for cleaning the liver from ammonia heavy aminos like l-glutamine which too much can raise ammonia & make you feel not good after an extended period. If you take lots of aminos & protein in general, maybe you workout too... really consider buying \"LOLA\" to wash the ammonia out of your blood. Do high doses 3-6gms for 60 days it will bring down ammonia levels from repeated breakdown of certain proteins. They give LOLA for liver failure... and even if your liver is not failing... your liver will thank you for it.\n\nBetaine also needs to be singled out. Betaine over that first year or 2 cleared up so many of my digestive issues.   \n   \nOther supplements include holy basil for stress, rhodiola, kanna, SAMe 800mg, st johns wort (I prefer lower doses which are always active for me due to how I take it with inositol always in my diet & sometimes a very low dose kanna activates it \\[ps you should never mix these 2 if you don't know what you're doing\\]), cordyceps (always the extract, the NOW brand (not extract) sucks).. ALL great for stress. Take 1 on monday at a fair dose, another on tuesday, another on wednesday, this will keep your mood boosted from various different effective agents, keeping workouts & motivation strong without developing tolerance to any 1 agent. \n\nI've been doing this approx 4 yrs now I have conquered my depression, hot flashes, insomnia, foggy brain, extreme fatigue from moving or doing anything, vertigo, dizziness, high blood pressure, on & on and now I  get erections ALL DAY LONG. And I lost 60lbs of fat & am way leaner. Though to be real I don't care how I look its the psychological component that is why I will probably keep doing this all my life in some form till I expire like my supplements never will cause I always take them & love this damn forum!   \n\n\nps. I sometimes write long sentences when I write a long post, to keep people from pausing or leaving the page.  And if you're mad about it, it's probably cause you're still reading & possibly it worked. =\\]",

    "body": "Hello my name is Billy, this is a secondary account that I made a couple of years ago but yeah, you already read the title, and this is a massive breakthrough for both me and for you. I found out 3 years ago that I had a condition known as Pyroluria, pyrrole disorder, KPU, HPU and others that is a biochemical ailment that involves high levels or kryptopyrroles in a person's body which are neurotoxic and deplete the body extensively of both Vitamin B6 and Zinc. The condition is associated with and linked to almost every mental 'disorder' that exists and are most likely untreatable without addressing it. I could get into my whole story and experience with Pyroluria, but for now I'll just say that for this entire year so far, I've been taking 30mg and then 50mg of Zinc everyday and was expecting significant results, but I waited as nothing happened and was disappointed and discouraged because of it. But then yesterday I started questioning whether or not I was taking enough and then today decided to take 100mg this morning and felt pretty euphoric after but thought it was from taking extra B6 instead. And then about an hour ago after eating dinner, I decided to take another 200mg of Zinc and then as I was reading online, I pictured myself playing a game I used to like and actually felt able to enjoy it, which has never happened to me before. Since I was feeling so good, I thought I would test my ability to enjoy something by listening to music, which I have barely done for years now. I started watching this music video and then it hit me, the anhedonia was almost gone if not completely. WOW. Then I listened to another song after and was being brought to tears. I felt so different and was FINALLY experiencing relief. After that song though, I did start to feel worse again but it may have been from using my laptop with headphones on because of the electro smog which increases inflammation and most likely pyrroles also but it could've just been temporary anyway. It really doesn't matter though, because I actually just experienced a good 10 minutes with no anhedonia which felt like a long time after years now of having it constantly. I needed to come on here and post this about it, even though I abandoned reddit 2 years ago because the tons of information about illness overwhelmed and bothered me. If you want to see my old account and some of the stuff I posted regarding depression and what not my username is 'unpluggedtoaster76'. You can go and see how much I was suffering back then to put into perspective how much this means to me. I will say that on my my many symptoms is mania, so maybe there's a chance that I was having that rather than total symptom relief, but I never feel how I just felt and it was right after taking the Zinc which is part of the treatment for Pyroluria which causes mania, but I wanted to at least mention that to not entirely give your hopes up. I would now highly suggest that everybody reading this gets Zinc and B6 for themselves but there are some really serious things to know when buying supplements including these. Most supplements that are manufactured contain an additive called 'magnesium stearate' which has been called a poison by medical doctors and will make your illness drastically worse because of how toxic it is. They use it in dman pharmaceutical drugs and almost everybody with health problems reacts badly to it. One day I will explain what it did to me 3 years ago. Even though magnesium is a natural mineral and stearate is a natural substance found it foods, when you combine the two you create a new, artificial chemical that is toxic to the body because it is not a natural substance. So you have to get powders of these two supplements and any others to avoid it, and the best brand that I get is the 'Bulksupplements' products. No, I'm not getting paid to say this, I don't even know how I would anyway, but their supplements are almost all clean and aren't overly expensive so I like theirs the most. The Zinc that I took is the 'Zinc Gluconate' from Bulksupplements and they list on the package that their quality is 'premium grade' so I do think that it is so. The only other thing is that you have to take Zinc with a meal or else you'll get nausea and probably vomit from it, and ya I'm speaking from experience haha. But I am renewed with hope now from my experience tonight after taking a high dose of Zinc, but now I'm stuck wondering what the actual limit is for Zinc if you have Pyroluria. I mean maybe up to 1000mg or more? I will most likely have to experiment with myself like a lab rat but I'm willing to do it if it means obtaining huge relief from the torturous symptoms/condition that is anhedonia. I will probably try to also post this on the depression page, but it'll be hard for me to do because it'll bring back haunting memories from 3 years ago for me, but I'll try and do it because of how many people are on there. I will read any comments tomorrow when I wake up. For those that are going to try high-dose Zinc now, I wish you luck and be sure to let me know how it goes and I as well will keep you updated on this subreddit when I take a lot of Zinc again tomorrow and onward. Just make sure to keep the faith, God bless everybody.",

Look up copper dumping syndrome. But according to William Walsh, copper dumping doesn't typically last more than 60 days until detoxification has completed, with use of zinc. And in my experience, certain other metal chelation agents can be useful, namely NAC with selenium and molybdenum.\n\nIt has completely changed my life.

Hormonal acne, working on diagnosis with doctors for probable PCOS.\n\n**Age:** 30\n\n**Climate:** Hot and humid summers, cold and dry winters. Northeast USA.\n\n**TL;DR: Will not repurchase.** Irritates my skin, leaves it feeling tight and shiny, doesn't play well with other routine steps.\n\n**Background Info:** I absolutely LOVE my LRP Cicaplaste Baume B5, and was on the hunt for a source to purchase the 100ml tube that would ship to the US when I came across LRP Cicaplast Baume B5 SPF50. It was like the heavens parted and I could hear angels singing. A product that would soothe my redness and irritation, protect me from the sun, and possibly let me skip a step in my morning routine? Hallelujah! I found a seller on eBay with good reviews and bought it for about $20. The seller ships from Greece.\n\n**Ingredients:** [CosDNA Link](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_1ca9231503.html); ([From Website](http://www.laroche-posay.com/products-treatments/Cicaplast/CICAPLAST-BAUME-B5-spf50-p23991.aspx)):  AQUA / WATER; HOMOSALATE; PANTHENOL; ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE; BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE; OCTOCRYLENE; ALCOHOL DENAT.; BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE; STYRENE/ACRYLATES COPOLYMER; ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE; TRIETHANOLAMINE; DIMETHICONE; PHENYLBENZIMIDAZOLE SULFONIC ACID; PEG-8 LAURATE; SORBITAN OLEATE; ZINC GLUCONATE; MADECASSOSIDE; MANGANESE GLUCONATE; ISOHEXADECANE; SODIUM ACRYLATES CROSSPOLYMER-2; SILICA; 2-OLEAMIDO-1,3-OCTADECANEDIOL; PERLITE; DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE; POLOXAMER 338; DISODIUM EDTA; COPPER GLUCONATE; CAPRYLYL GLYCOL; POLYSORBATE 80; ACRYLAMIDE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE COPOLYMER; ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER; BHT; TOCOPHEROL; PHENOXYETHANOL\n\n**Packaging:** Same as the non-SPF Cicaplast Baume. Stiff white tube with a cap that cannot be twisted off. It's pretty difficult to get the last bits of product out, but the tube can be cut or you could probably leverage a butter knife or flat head screwdriver under the cap to pop it off. \n\n**Smell:** This is fragrance free (yay!) which I expected, but it is **not** unscented. This has a strong sunscreen smell that takes quite a while to dissipate. I grew up in South Florida and am used to the smell, so it's not a deal-breaker for me, personally.\n\n**Texture:** This is pretty thick. Not quite as thick as, say, Aveeno Baby, but a little thicker than LRP Anthelios 60 Melt In Suncreen Milk for Face and Body. If you're already using LRP Cicaplast Baume B5 I would say the texture is nearly the same, but this is slightly more difficult to spread and apply evenly. \n\n**Whitecast:** Hard to say, as I am quite pale. The lightest shades in most foundations are a little too dark for me. My best match so far is BareMinerals BarePro in Fair01. \n\n**How it felt on my skin:** I'm pretty disappointed in this suncreen, sadly. One of the sunscreen filters is just not sitting well with my skin. It consistently leaves my skin feeling like it's slightly burning and this lasts for hours after application. My face gets red and hot immediately. I generally try to stick with mineral sunscreens as I know it's a safer bet for my sensitive skin, but was really hoping this might be gentle enough to work for me. It does not. It leaves my face feeling tight after, despite having many of the same ingredients as the non-SPF Cicaplast Baume, and leaves a weird shine all over my face. Not dewey, moisturized, or chok chok, but SHINY. It also didn't really play well with anything else in my routine. I tried putting on a little bit of my non-SPF Cicaplast Baume before applying this, but it manages to somehow pill? My primer doesn't sit well on top of it at all. If it weren't somewhat drying I could see getting away with a little powder on top and it looking okay, but it's just not working for me. :( **I will not repurchase.** \n\n**My Routine:**\n\nAM:\n\nWash with water. Occasionally cleanse with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser as needed.\n\nStratia Liquid Gold\n\nLRP Cicaplast Baume B5\n\nSPF\n\nPrimer and makeup\n\nPM:\n\nEtude House Real Art Moisture Oil Cleanser\n\nCetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser\n\nActives - Currently using 10&#37; Mandelic Acid serum, not sure if I like it. Was using Melazepam pretty religiously for almost a year but it's not playing well with my skin right now and I'm not sure why (probably hormones, honestly. They're all out of whack and my skin is not happy with it.). Vitamin C every other day. Just starting to add 2&#37; granactive retinoid once a week.    \n\nStratia Liquid Gold\n\nLRP Cicaplast Baume B5 \n\nOn occasion: vaseline, as needed; Sulwhasoo Ginseng Cream if I'm feeling extra fancy (recent purchase from momomango going out of business sale)",

    "body": "Long story short, my facial skin is extremely sensitive and acne-prone. There are only 3 moisturisers that have ever worked for me in my adult life (moisturising without causing further irritation/acne) and all 3 of them have been reformulated/discontinued/increasingly harder to buy, so you can understand my frustration.\n\nThey are as follows:\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Fluide**. (Reformulated many years ago).  \n*Water, Squalane, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol.*\n\n**Innisfree Truecare Allantoin Waterdrop Essence.** (Discontinued recently).  \n*Water, Squalane, Propanediol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Allantoin(2,000 Ppm), Tromethamine, Glyceryl Caprylate, Carbomer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Vitamin E, Disodium EDTA.*\n\n**Galderma Daylong After Sun Gel.** (Possibly discontinued, hard to source).  \n*Water, Pentylene Glycol, Glycerin, Isododecane, Squalane, Panthenol, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer.*\n\nCurrently using the Galderma one until it runs out.\n\nLet me get this straight - My skin only likes the bare bones of a moisturiser. Water, squalane and some filler ingredients. No fragrance is a must. My skin does not fare well with oils, including 100% Squalane. Far too occlusive by itself. My skin also does not like silicones or stearates.\n\nI recently bought the **Uriage Bariéderm-CICA Gel-Crème** because of this subreddit but unfortunately had really bad luck with it - Dryness, irritation, acne and weirdly enlarged pores.  \n*Water, Dicaprylyl Ether, Glycerin, Diglycerin, Squalane, 1,2-Hexanediol, Inulin, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Panthenol, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hydroxide, Copper Gluconate, Centella Asiatica Leaf Extract, Zinc Gluconate, Citric Acid, Tocopherol.*\n\nI would be extremely grateful for any recommendations that seem fitting for my annoying skin requirements, no matter how niche the brand is. (I'm aware that some of you will probably recommend products I've already tried). Thanks!",

Seemed very familiar with HS but said he was going to research and see what the latest is on zinc and curcumin recommended dosage. Took blood for food sensitivity testing. Said we'll wait for that but I'd probably benefit from vitamin A. Said to keep up with my vitamin D at 3000 and increase to 5000 in winter.\n\nAnyhow, it'll be interesting to see what the food testing says. He said to enjoy 2 weeks of \"ignorance is bliss\" and have some ice cream if I want until he sees me August 25, because based on my symptoms he's guessing I need to cut out dairy.\n\nHe nodded and said \"right, of course\" when I told him I felt great and has NO HS flares when I ate paleo for 18 months.  \n\nAnxious to see what the testing shows!",

I followed directions and put it on like a moisturizer but IT BURNS. I’m guessing it’s because of my moisture barrier, but the description for the gel is specifically to heal irritation and damaged moisture barrier. Anyone else experience this? Did it go away eventually? I’ve tried layering over other moisturizer as well, but it doesn’t seem to make a noticeable difference that way. I posted the ingredients below. \n\n Water, Glycerin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Dimethicone, C30-45 Alkyl Dimethicone, Sodium Citrate, PEG/​PPG-18/​18 Dimethicone, Panthenol, Zinc Gluconate, Madecassoside, Dimethiconol, Manganese Gluconate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Copper Gluconate",

The sensations were amazing: motivation, a fire inside, my libido returned. This lasted until the night, and it was hard to fall asleep. I repeated the same thing with zinc a few days later. Then the effect started to wear off, but it returned when I increased the dose: first from 2 tablets, then from 4. After that, I stopped taking it. The regular intake lasted for about a week. What could this have been?  \nThe sensations were different from the hangover effect, but the motivation was similar.  \nI’d also like to add that my condition is great in hot and dry weather, when the atmospheric pressure is high and the sun is burning pedestrians.

I have supplemented zinc for a long time, but higher doses affect me acutely. Not exactly like the hangover-effect, not with the greatest consistency, but I'm with you in general. It is possible however that you, personally, are deficient in it.\n\nZinc is like magnesium. Such a widespread co-factor for human enzymatic reactions, it's a nightmare to pinpoint what is helping.\n\nHowever we can try restrict the field thinking about what higher zinc doses do. In general zinc is needed for proper immune function; however at higher doses it's actually *immunosuppressive.*\n\nAt the same higher doses, it lowers cortisol, shutting down the HPA axis a bit; not only that, is significantly effects insulinergic pathways.\n\nAnother point is the effects on sex hormones. It can enhance stereoidogenesis and spermatogenesis.\n\n  \nI'm also interested in the \"hot and dry weather\" benefits.

When Zinc is discussed, some people are talking about the amount supplemented, while others (dietary guidelines, for instance) are referring to the amount of Zinc absorbed - two completely different things. \n\nFor instance, one might say they are supplementing 60mg of Zinc, meaning they are actually supplementing (absorbing) about 20mg. Someone in the debate reacts on the dose supplemented, calling it an overdose when it really isn't. Some people on Bodybuilding-forums et cetera just writes the amount absorbed directly, further adding to the confusion. \n\nJust use Opti-Zinc, so as not to upset your Copper-balance, and you should be fine even at high levels, long term. 30-60mg Opti-Zinc would be perfect in my opinion.

I also decided on Zeroid and Ceramol over other brands because they do not contain fragrance or essential oils.\n\n* Skin type dry\n* Weather: 30 F to 50 F\n* Testing schedule: 3 weeks\n\n**Skin Concerns**: Looking for a moisturizer that can help my already dry skin handle the drying effects of daily 0.05 tretinoin unbuffered this winter. My skin used to be painfully tight right after washing and I couldn’t handle not applying a toner right away while doing the 30 minute wait for tretinoin.\n\n**Zeroid Intensive Cream**\n\nWater/Aqua, Propanediol, Caprylic/capric triglyceride, Glycerin, Squalane, Cetearyl alcohol, Polyglyceryl-10 distearate, Glyceryl stearate, Stearic acid, Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Myristoyl/palmitoyl oxostearamide/arachamide MEA, Phytosterols, Tocopheryl acetate, Canola oil, Olea europaea (Olive) fruit oil, Cetyl palmitate, Sorbitan palmitate, Sorbitan olivate, Bisabolol, Methyl caprooyl tyrosinate, Xanthan gum, Sodium hyaluronate, Carbomer, Arginine, Caprylyl glycol\n\n* Texture: rich moisturizer that falls somewhere between medium and heavy.\n* Smell: None that I can detect.\n* Experience: Applies and spreads very smoothly. My dry skin sucks it ups and it leaves a slightly greasy feeling for a while. It eventually absorbs completely after a few minutes. Oily skin type won’t like it but dry skin type will most likely enjoy this cream. I like it enough to consider a repurchase for summer.\n\n**Zeroid Intensive Oint-Cream**\n\nWater/Aqua, Theobroma cacao (Cocoa) seed butter, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cetearyl alcohol, Cocoglycerides, Butyrospermum parkii (Shea) butter, Polyglyceryl-10 distearate, Sorbitan stearate, Panthenol, Glyceryl stearate, Squalane, Stearic acid, Camellia oleifera seed oil, Caprylyl methicone, Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phytosterols, Tocopheryl acetate, Myristoyl/palmitoyl oxostearamide/arachamide MEA, Euphorbia cerifera (Candelilla) wax, Zinc gluconate, Methyl caprooyl tyrosinate, Tetracarboxymethyl palmitoyl dipeptide-12, Xanthan gum, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA, Madecassoside, Caprylyl glycol\n\n* Texture: super thick moisturizer that is definitely heavy but isn’t occlusive enough for me\n* Smell: None that I can detect.\n* Experience: Take a bit to squeeze it out of the tube as it is thick. Even so, it spreads very smoothly. It takes my skin much longer to drink it up and is definitely greasier but not oily. Due to how long it takes to dry down, I use it at night. Oily skin type should avoid this like the plague but desert dry skin type will enjoy the richness. Definitely my go to for night time winter moisturizer.\n\n**Ceramol 311 Crema**\n\nWater, Shea butter, Petrolatum, Penethylene Glycol, Glycerin, Caprylic/capric triglyceride, Batyl alcohol, Stearic Acid, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol, Arginine, Carbomer, Lecithin.\n\n* Texture: I can’t decide how to classify this cream. It squeezes out of the tube so easily, applies like a light lotion yet it is the farthest thing from light. It is firm enough that the squeezed ”cream” holds its shape. It is a translucent white, unlike the clearly white non-tranlucent Zeroid. It reminds me of a gel but it’s definitely not a gel.\n* Smell: None that I can detect.\n* Experience: The texture is incredibly deceiving as it looks and feels light upon application but it really isn’t. I think it feels that way because it dries down matte. I enjoy using this in the morning because I don’t need to wait long for it to dry down before applying sunscreen.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nI like all 3 for different reasons. I was originally underwhelmed because my skin still felt dry halfway through the day. I want to test these properly so I continued using them. Since many are curious as to the performance and effects of Zeroid, I decided to do my review write up a week early (3 weeks versus 1 full month of testing). Note that these creams are NOT fungal acne safe.\n\nI think these creams strengthened my moisture barrier. In fact, I stopped using an occlusive at night last week except on my eyelids and at the corners of my mouth, whereas I had to slather Eucerin all over my face for months. I don’t have any flakes or patches of peeling skin anymore compared to before I started these creams. My skin also doesn’t look tight or dry the next morning.\n\nTesting after I have finished the current tubes:\n\n* Zeroid Richenic Cream Urea 5% (haven’t opened)\n* Zeroid Intensive Hydrating Ampoule (haven’t opened)\n* Ceramol 311 Lipocream (seller sent me samples, haven’t opened)",

Sperm needs semen in order to carry it to the egg*\n\nI’m trying to make my wife pregnant for one more kiddo. I impregnated my wife just by looking at her with the first two attempts (twins on the second pregnancy) This time around, the three attempts thus far have resulted in a visit from Aunt Flo.\n\nNow on TRT and have been on the Holy Grail stack daily for 2 months and literally no increase. On top of that, I’ve been on 750iu HCG and 75iu HMG E3.5D for the past month. I figured I would be shooting buckets at this point. The only improvement I’ve experienced is greater orgasm intensity.\n\nI started TRT in August and it took about a month for my testicles to start shrinking. So I began looking into HCG and HMG. My testicles have definitely started gaining in size, so clearly sperm production is occurring. However, sperm needs the help of semen to get it where it needs to be and my semen volume is lacking after all this.\n\nI’ve taken the Holy Grail stack for several months on multiple cycles pre-TRT and have always experienced massive increases in my semen volume and precum would flow like a hose, but now it’s almost nil.\n\nCurrent regiment:\n\n-\t200mg Test-Cyp Weekly\n-\t750iu HCG E3.5D\n-\t75iu HMG E3.5D\n-\t0.5mg Anastrozole Weekly\n-\t2400mg Sunflower Lecithin - ED\n-\t50mg Zinc Gluconate - ED\n-\t200mg Pygeum - ED\n-\t100mg Pregnenolone - E3.5D\n-\t1950mg Ashawaganda - ED\n\nAny thoughts??? Bump HMG to 150iu?\nTo summarize, I feel like the regiment is aiding the production of sperm. I understand this takes time. Sperm production is not the issue. It’s the semen. The sperm needs a carrier and the prostate and seminal vesicles are not excreting the suspension fluid to do this. Why isn’t the HG increasing the semen. Like I said, I’m pretty confident the sperm production is active and working, its the lack of semen I’m baffled by since I’m on the HG stack and have had success with it Pre-TRT.",

Kind of similar with HMG while on test. To fully activate HPTA you need to come off test, PCT and then most likely use clomid after PCT, 25mg every day clomid for 6-8 weeks should do the job and you can reduce to 25mg every other day and start trying.\n\nThis will restore your spermatogenesis in a more natural way and your pituitary gland should become fully functional",

    "body": "I’m a 20M who has been experiencing diffuse hair shedding (long, short, thick, and thin hairs, all types) since 9th grade, so for about 6-7 years now. It started with a visible thinning line down the middle, and over time, my overall density has decreased. I shed from everywhere, sides, crown, top, and hairline. Would this be considered chronic telogen effluvium or balding?\n\nI have a history of low iron since I was a kid and had my vitamin D levels fluctuating, which I am trying to raise to a more acceptable amount yet I'm still shedding, I was going to hop on Fin and Min depending on what my biopsy said but they didn't state and signs of miniaturization. I am on a plethora of supplements (omega 3, zinc gluconate, saw palmetto +pumpkin oil, b12 etc) I've had some hair growth on hair line, yet I'm still shedding.\n\nI have zero family balding history, nobody is bald.\n\nI do have folliculitis and maybe Sub Derm which I am using keto shampoo, though any advice on this will be greatly appreciated. Unsure what to do from here, I've heard oral minoxidil may fit my situation best but I wanna know the trigger for my unusual way to lose hair\n\nAny idea what can be the cause? do you guys think it's something hormonal/metabolic? if so what should I get tested?\n\nVitamin: Ferritin: 54ng, Vitamin D: 60nmol (From May 10th '25)\n\nDoctor said my TSH was fine, and I do have high cholesterol and insulin resistance if that's important\n\nThanks for reading and honestly im pretty lost and wanna understand the cause before i hop on drugs and medication\n\nBiopsy Report:  \nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS  \nMany years diffuse scalp shedding. Likely telogen effluvium (chronic) Has some overlying scalp folliculitis. No patchy alopecia. Please assess to rule out any autoimmune hair loss.  \nGROSS:  \nContainer label: Scalp vertex. A tan cylindrical skin biopsy: 0.2 x 0.4 cm.  \nMICROSCOPIC  \nAt the center of the specimen there is a follicular unit infiltrated by numerous neutrophils. The adjacent dermis shows an interstitial neutrophilic infiltrate with edema.  \nDIAGNOSIS - SCALP VERTEX  \nACUTE SUPPURATIVE FOLLICULITUS  \nFindings of a scarring alopecia or of discoid lupus erythematosus or lichen planopilaris were not identified in this punch.\n\nTLDR: 20M, shedding all over scalp for 6+ years. No baldness in family. No miniaturization stated on biopsy, but diagnosed with folliculitis, insulin resistance, and low iron history. Still shedding even after raising ferritin to over 50ng. Wondering if this is CTE, AGA, or something else. Hoping to avoid meds until I understand the root cause. Would love advice or similar stories, thanks!",

I have started following a skincare routine 11 days ago. It was a joyous Thursday for my face that, over the course of past 30 years, has been exposed to the winds, low temperatures, a late onslaught of chicken pox, persistent hormonal acne, and results of a poor diet. I also happen to have PCOS, which makes the challenge to have clear skin extra challenging.\n\nThis is our starting point. After reading through [the Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index) on r/SkincareAddiction, I had come up with the following routine to improve the condition of my skin:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# ROUTINE\n\n**MORNING**\n\n* Cleanser \\(Step I\\): **Bioderma Sensibio H2O micellar water** \\(applied with a cotton pad\\)\n   * *Ingredients:* Water, PEG\\-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Propylene Glycol, Cucumis Sativus \\(Cucumber\\) Fruit Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Disodium EDTA, Cetrimonium Bromide.\n* *Moisturiser \\(Step I\\):* **Lumene Hydration Recovery Oxygenation** **gel** **mask**\n   * *Ingredients:* Water, Propanediol, Betula Alba \\(Birch\\) Juice, Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth\\-20, Phenoxyethanol, Rubus Chamaemorus \\(Cloudberry\\) Seed Extract, Acrylates/c10\\-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Peg\\-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Trehalose, Urea, Eriophorum Spissum Flower/Stem Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium Edta, Copper Gluconate, Magnesium Aspartate, Zinc Gluconate, Pentylene Glycol, Serine, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Algin, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium Phosphate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Pullulan, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sorbic Acid, Potassium Phosphate, Linalool, Benzyl Salicylate, Alpha\\-Isomethyl Ionone, Limonene, Citronellol, Parfum \\(Fragrance\\), \\(Ci 42090\\) Blue 1, \\(Ci 60730\\) Ext.

Other concerns include enlarged pores, rosacea in the nose area, closed comedones, and a selection of pimples.\n\nI have come to the conclusion that my face must be as dehydrated as Gobi desert out of rain season, and so my first action was to moisturise, moisturise, moisturise! At the same time, I wanted to include products meant for sensitive skin, to decrease the risk of a breakout or adverse reaction. I also tend to avoid perfumed skincare, and that was another factor when I was picking the jars and bottles.\n\nAny critique of my routine would be most welcome! Do these products work together? Is there something crucial missing? \\(I am planning on incorporating exfoliation and sunscreen next. Also, please, don't panic — I have not seen the sun in months. Years. Or so it feels.\\) Is there something I should stop using? Am I truly a happy victim of clever marketing and a corporate\\-friendly whore? \\(You betcha.\\)\n\nSo far, the result has been a more even \\(texture, not colour\\) skin with smaller pores, but, of course, this is early days.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# QUESTION\n\nA crucial point of my morning routine, and not something normally suggested for beginners, is a mask. I apply it just before I sit down to meditate. It makes sense that, while I imagine 'a steady stream of liquid sunlight' pouring through my body, I am also using that time to take care of my skin. I have found that one action triggers the other and, altogether, that is a very happy combination.\n\nI have been using the Lumene Hydration Recovery mask for the past few days, and I want to hear your suggestions for alternatives. While I did not dislike that mask, I did not feel like it was doing much for me either. Plus, it was a gift from Finland and I am in Britain, and that does not work very easily. Lastly, I would like to try a number of masks \\(and continue to discover new awesome products\\), rather than settle on a single 'meh' option.\n\nCan you help me find the mask\\(s\\)? To sum it up, I'm looking for a mask that...\n\n* Has a 10\\-15 minute application period\n* Comes in a tube or a jar \\(i.e. not a sheet mask\\)\n* Is suitable for frequent use\n* Fits my routine \\(see above\\)\n\nSuggestions of mask combinations \\(alternating masks\\) are also welcome!",

My love for masks makes me always be on the lookout for a new one and I’ve tried many out there. \n\nI’m not really a fan of sheet masks, or I haven’t tried any that has impressed me so I won’t mention those. They feel nice and are relaxing, but that’s about it. \n\nI really love Freeman’s Apple Cider Vinegar Clay mask. You can use it as a cleanser scrub or use it as a mask, I’ve only used it as a mask. I think it can be used about 2-3 times per week, so it can be used to alternate with other masks. What I like: it’s inexpensive, makes my skin feel extra soft and clean, my skin tone looks brighter even after just one use. \n\nI got this face mask kit from [Fresh at Sephora] (https://m.sephora.com/product/picture-perfect-mask-set-P424612?SKUID=1998459&om_mmc=ppc-GG_1165716881_53825939660_pla-420369839425_1998459_257731947998_9007386_m&country_switch=us&lang=en&gclid=CKnR1YzD3toCFYPIswodzf8JcQ&gclsrc=ds) and I absolutely love every mask that comes in it. \n\nThe Umbrian Clay Mask I find really improves the appearance of pores, blackheads/white heads. It feels good and relaxing to have it on. It says to use for up to 5 minutes, but I always start doing stuff and end up using it for longer. I find this mask is nice to use as a “premask” for the Rose or Black Tea mask. I only do this about once a week, when I’m feeling fancy. \n\nThe Rose mask feels like heaven on your skin. It has this nice cooling feeling and I find it to be very hydrating, and it makes my skin look supple and radiant. \n\nThe Black Tea mask says to use 2-3 times per week. It tingles very intensely for the first minute, but after that it feels fine.  I find this mask seems to even the texture of my skin somewhat (I’ve only used it once so far). \n\nI’ve also tried FAB Ginger Turmeric Jelly Mask. I like this one better as I love the cooling jelly on my skin. I find that it gives my skin a nice radiant glow. You can use it up to 3 times per week. I tried FAB’s bouncy mask too (a sample) and I wouldn’t buy it because I didn’t see any difference and it didn’t feel as good as the other masks I love. \n\nClinique Pep Start Bubble Mask. This is a fun mask to use in the morning as you don’t have to leave it on for long. I like the bubbling effect, it makes my skin feel extra clean and revitalized. I’ve only used this 2 times in some samples I got. \n\nBoscia Luminizing black masks. I really love this one as I find it to be very clarifying, and helps with the appearance of pores. I love peeling it off, it’s so fun and i feel like it takes so much with it. \n\nI have a few others in my cabinet that I haven’t tried yet, but I’ll report back when I do.",

    "body": "Last week I took ALCAR for the first time. I took 400mg ALCAR + 200mg ALA, which is how it came in the bottle I picked up from Walmart (I know not the best source). It gave me probably the best effects I've gotten from a nootropic ever. I have depression, anxiety, ADHD, and PMDD. After taking ALCAR, for the first time since I was a child, I only had one thought in my head at a time. No other thoughts, or feelings, were berating me. I got to choose what to think about with ease. I was also happier and more confident, which might have also been as a result from the effect first mentioned. The effects were most profound for the first 24 hours, but overall lasted about 4 days. Interestingly, the effects didn't start until about 4 hours after I took it, vs usually things start to have an effect within the first hour. \n\nI want to repeat this effect as closely as possible. I know you'll likely never get the same effect as the first time you take a nootropic, but I do have a few questions about the best way to use it. Is it something you find the amount of that works for you and keep taking at that amount, or do you slowly ramp up the amount to a maximum dose? How often do you take it? Is there anything it works well taken with? Any other advice?\n\nHere are medications and supplements I regularly take, in case they're relevant:\n\n- 150mg Bupropion XL daily\n\n- 180mg Fexofenadine 24hr daily\n\n- 27mg Iron Glycinate daily\n\n- 2000mg Fish Oil daily \n\n- 25mg Zinc Gluconate every 2-3 days\n\n- 100mg 5-HTP + 125mg EGCG not more than once every 2 weeks\n\n- Used to to take 400mg Magnesium Glycinate daily but it started giving me digestion issues, I'll still take it occasionally.\n\n- I drink green tea occasionally.\n\n- Protein powder with a ton of amino acids daily\n\n\nThe day I took the ALCAR I'd taken bupropion, fexofenadine, and maybe a few cups of green tea. Had taken zinc, magnesium, and protein powder within the few days before. \n\n\nThings I avoid:\n\n- Stimulants. Caffeine, Tyrosine, Adderall all give me terrible anxiety.\n\n- Excessive sugar makes me depressed/anxious.\n\n- I might need to start avoiding certain foods with high histamine.\n\n\nIt's probably relevant to say that I'm 21F, 5'7\", 120lbs given the low doses.\n\nEdit: formatting",

I used to take Bupropion and loved it except for the anxiety sides, so trying to find things that are stimulating without anxiety was the goal.\n\nI started taking it daily at first, loved the increased focus and motivation, but then started to notice insomnia and increasingly severe GI issues. I’ve seen a few sources cite a [long half life of 29-36 hours](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19178874/) so I started taking it every second or third day. definitely noticed a lasting effect, both positive and negative, on days I didn’t take it after dosing for a while.

    "body": "I initially decided to try zinc for a viral wart that I could not otherwise get rid of, but I was surprised by profound effects. I’ve started and discontinued zinc three times now, keeping other supplementation constant, and I’ve got the same experience, so I’m pretty sure it’s the zinc. \n\nI normally have a lingering, subtle tiredness, like I constantly need to go to sleep. This is not physical fatigue and I do not feel like it hinders intellectual or physical performance, I live a normal life. This feeling is easily ignored though and if I override it everything is more or less normal afterwards.\n\nWhen I try zinc, the following happens:\n\nInitially (within 1-2 hours of a large dose), I get a subtle tension building up that takes away the aforementioned fatigue and makes me feel like I can do stuff without forcing myself to. I also feel:\n\n- severely muted libido but with retained ability to have sex\n\n- hunger almost eliminated but enjoyment of food retained\n\n- less emotional drive overall\n\n- stronger physically and less fatigued during exercise\n\n- I do not sleep as much anymore and sleep feels less restful \n\n- slightly stuporous and absent minded\n\n- my tendency to retain water around the belly after exercise is strongly intensified\n\n- sensitive nipples\n\n- slight feeling of muscle rigidity, twitching and once I got a muscle cramp, which only happened to me once before in my life\n\n\n\nI also get strong visual enhancement, not sure though if from the zinc. Colors are very saturated, lights are brighter, pictures seem 3d. I started to take zinc, vitamin d and magnesium at about the same time. A week ago I stopped taking zinc and cut down on the magnesium but kept the vit d. All the symptoms I've described have subsided except for the color enhancement that has stayed constant. Keep in mind I might have had a long term deficiency in vitamin d as I don't get that much sun exposure, so maybe before my color perception was actually muted and now it's what a non deficient person would call normal.\n\nWhen I discontinue zinc, the following happens:\n\n- the tension eases and I pass through a balanced intermediary stage where I feel just good, my aforementioned fatigue is gone and so is the unpleasant tension. Then I return to my baseline.\n- the muting of desires subsides as well and I start having an appetite and libido again, as well as caring about life.\n\nI've gone through this three  times now. The first time I took 100mg per day of zinc gluconate plus 2mg of copper for a couple of weeks, based on some studies I had read on treatment for warts and additional sources stating that this is safe in the short term. Then I discontinued it and I was back to baseline in 3 days. Then I took 2 doses each of 25 then 3mg, with 2 day breaks in between.\nThe effects were even weaker but unmistakably there, which is weird since from what I've read 3mg is well below the RDA. From now I'll stay away from it until I figure out what's going on. \n\nI've done some reading on the net about zinc in the past couple of days and I haven't found experiences as intense as mine. So I was thinking, could this signal a deficiency or other abnormality that would cause me to be affected in this way? \n\nTL:DR: took zinc, felt like a weird psychoactive drug. Is something wrong with my brain?\n\nLATER EDIT: I had my serum zinc tested a couple of weeks after stopping the supplementation and it came moderately above the normal range, the doctor said there was nothing to worry about.",

    "body": "Zinc is a nutrient that plays many vital roles in your body.\n\nBecause your body doesn’t naturally produce zinc, you must obtain it through food or supplements.\n\nThis article explains everything you need to know about zinc, including its functions, health benefits, dosage recommendations and potential side effects.\n\n10 Powerful Zinc Benefits, Including Fighting Cancer\n\nWhen you hear zinc in regards to your health, you probably think of it as one of the many effective natural cold remedies. In other words, only really necessary once in a great while. However, zinc is needed in small amounts every day in order to maintain health and perform important functions.\n\nWhat are the health benefits of taking zinc or consuming foods high in zinc? Well, zinc benefits the body in many ways — it helps with hormone production, proper growth and repair, improved immunity and promoting normal digestion. It’s *needed* by the body and zinc deficiency can lead to major health issues.\n\nZinc benefits also include its ability to act as an anti-inflammatory agent, which means that zinc may have significant therapeutic benefits for several common, chronic diseases like cancer or heart disease.\n\nAre you getting enough zinc in your diet? Maybe low zinc levels are to blame for your chronic fatigue, digestive issues or hormonal problems. There’s no denying that zinc benefits are vast and you actually depend on them to thrive.\n\n### What Is Zinc?\n\nZinc is a type of metal and an essential trace element. It’s present within all bodily tissue and needed for healthy cell division. It acts like an antioxidant within the body, fighting free-radical damage and slowing the aging process.\n\nZinc also has a major impact on hormonal balance, so for this reason, even a small zinc deficiency can result in an increased risk for infertility or diabetes.\n\nAccording to researchers at the Department of Dermatology at the University of California,\n\n>zinc plays an essential role in numerous biochemical pathways: organ systems, including the integumentary, gastrointestinal, central nervous system, immune, skeletal, and reproductive systems… Zinc deficiency results in dysfunction of both humoral and cell-mediated immunity and increases the susceptibility to infection.\n\nWithout enough zinc present in your diet, it’s possible to experience negative reactions like frequently getting sick, feeling like you’re always tired and run down, and experiencing poor concentration, stunted growth and the inability to heal wounds.\n\n### Symptoms of Zinc Deficiency\n\nZinc deficiency is common around the world, including in the U.S. It occurs when someone doesn’t eat enough foods that contain zinc or has trouble absorbing and using zinc from foods due to digestive disorders or very poor gut health.\n\nWho is most at risk for zinc deficiency? Anyone following a plant-based diet that doesn’t include meat or dairy products (like vegans or vegetarians) are usually at the greatest risk since their diets eliminate the top zinc food sources.\n\nPeople who suffer from severe stomach-acid issues, chronic digestive problems like leaky gut syndrome or alcoholism, are also more likely to have a zinc deficiency.\n\nFinally, it’s believed that women taking birth control pills or who are on hormone replacement therapy drugs may also be at a higher risk, since this can interfere with zinc’s hormone-related roles in the body.\n\n### The most common signs and symptoms associated with zinc deficiency include:\n\n* Changes in appetite, including food cravings for salty or sweet foods\n* Changes in ability to taste and smell\n* Weight gain or loss\n* Hair loss\n* Digestive problems, including diarrhea\n* Chronic fatigue syndrome\n* Infertility\n* Hormonal problems, including worsened PMS or menopause symptoms\n* Low immunity\n* Poor concentration and memory\n* Slowed ability to heal wounds, skin infections or irritation\n* Nerve dysfunction\n\n### Top Health Benefits of Zinc\n\n### 1. Increases Immunity and Fights Colds\n\nZinc is often taken as a natural over-the-counter remedy for fighting colds and symptoms of illnesses. When taken for at least five months, zinc may reduce your risk of becoming sick with the common cold, plus supplementing once you already feel sick can speed up the healing process.\n\nResearch shows that zinc can interfere with the molecular process that causes mucus and bacteria to build within the nasal passages. Ionic zinc, based on its electrical charge, has the ability to exert an antiviral effect by attaching to receptors in nasal epithelial cells and blocking their effects.\n\nResearch conducted by the Medical Education Center of Chandigarh India found that when zinc was administered within 24 hours of onset of cold-related symptoms, the duration of symptoms was significantly reduced compared to the control group that didn’t supplement with zinc. Fewer patients in the zinc group had cold-related symptoms five and seven days after experiencing the first symptoms compared to those who did not take zinc.\n\n### 2. Acts as a Powerful Antioxidant that May Help Fight Cancer\n\nZinc is an effective anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent, helping fight oxidative stress and decrease the chance for disease development, including as a natural cancer treatment. Especially in elderly patients, zinc benefits include its ability to support support healthy cell division, preventing cancerous cell mutation and stunting tumor growth.\n\nWhen researchers from the School of Medicine at the University of Michigan studied potential zinc benefits from zinc supplementation on 50 adults, they found that levels of oxidative stress markers were significantly lower in the zinc-supplemented group than in the placebo group. Those with lower zinc levels who didn’t take supplements had higher levels of inflammatory cytokines, higher plasma oxidative stress markers and endothelial cell adhesion molecules. After zinc supplementation, the incidence of illness-related side effects and infections was also significantly lower in the zinc-supplemented group, another example of zinc’s immune-boosting abilities.\n\n### 3. Balances Hormones\n\nZinc benefits hormonal health and fertility because it plays an important role in hormone production, including increasing testosterone naturally, which has very widespread roles in both men and women. Zinc also impacts female sex hormones and is even involved in the creation and release of eggs within and from the ovaries.\n\nZinc is needed for the production of estrogen and progesterone in women, which both support reproductive health. Either too high or too low levels of estrogens can cause problems with menstruation, mood swings, early menopause, infertility and possibly even increase the risk for certain cancers.\n\n### 4. Fights Diabetes\n\nZinc is needed to balance most hormones, including insulin, the main hormone involved in the regulation of blood sugar and as a diabetes natural treatment. Zinc benefits blood sugar levels because it binds to insulin so insulin is adequately stored in the pancreas and released when glucose enters the bloodstream.\n\nIt also allows for proper utilization of digestive enzymes that are necessary for insulin to bind to cells so glucose is used as fuel for the body, instead of stored as fat.\n\n### 5. Maintains Heart Health by Supporting Blood Vessels\n\nZinc is needed to maintain the health of cells within the cardiovascular system, while also lowering inflammation and oxidative stress. The endothelium, the thin layer of cells that lines the blood vessels, partially relies on adequate levels of zinc. Zinc benefits heart health by supporting healthy circulation, since it helps as a natural remedy for high blood pressure and cholesterol levels from clogged or damaged arteries.\n\n### 6. Prevents Diarrhea\n\nZinc deficiency is related to chronic digestive problems and diarrheal diseases, which has been shown in several studies. Researchers have found that zinc supplementation can be effective in both prophylaxis and as an acute diarrhea remedy.\n\n### 7. Increases Fertility\n\nStudies show that zinc plays an important role in fertility, especially modulating serum testosterone levels in men. Dietary zinc restriction and deficiency in normal young men is associated with a significant decrease in serum testosterone concentrations, which can negatively impact fertility and lower libido. What does zinc do for you sexually? It can potentially improve low sex drive by increasing testosterone levels.\n\nIn one study by the Department of Internal Medicine at Wayne University, after 20 weeks of zinc restriction, giving patients zinc supplementation effectively increased serum testosterone in the majority of men.\n\nZinc also impacts women’s fertility since adequate levels of zinc are needed during the growth process of the female’s eggs, otherwise eggs cannot properly mature and ovulation suffer.\n\n### 8. Aids in Nutrient Absorption and Digestion\n\nZinc affects protein synthesis and is required by the body to use amino acids from foods. It’s also involved in the breakdown of carbohydrates from foods, which are one of the main sources of energy for the body. For this reason, deficiency in zinc can cause low energy levels and contribute to adrenal or chronic fatigue, whereas consuming enough zinc benefits ongoing energy and a healthy metabolism.\n\n### 9. Supports Liver Health\n\nSupplementing with zinc is shown to reduce the incidence of infection and correlated with lower levels of liver damage. Zinc can help with a liver cleanse to reduce inflammation in the liver, reduces free radical damage, helps with nutrient absorption and allows for proper waste elimination.\n\n### 10. Helps with Muscle Growth and Repair\n\nZinc plays a crucial role in cell division and cell growth, so zinc benefits muscle repair and growth by making it possible for the body to heal itself and maintain strength in the muscular and skeletal systems.\n\nZinc also helps with the release of testosterone, growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), all of which build muscle mass and a healthy metabolism.\n\nZinc benefits muscle mass because it helps increase the amount of testosterone the body is able to produce following exercise — especially weight-training and high intensity interval training — because it enhances the conversion rate of androstenedione to testosterone.\n\n### Recommended Zinc Dosage\n\nAccording to the USDA, the dietary reference intakes for zinc below are based on age and gender:\n\nInfants:\n\n* 0–6 months: 2 milligrams/day\n* 7–12 months: 3 milligrams/day\n\nChildren:\n\n* 1–3 years: 3 milligrams/day\n* 4–8 years: 5 milligrams/day\n* 9 –13 years: 8 milligrams/day\n\nAdolescents and adults:\n\n* Males age 14 and over: 11 milligrams/day\n* Females age 14 to 18 years: 9 milligrams/day\n* Females age 19 and over: 8 milligrams/day\n\nZinc is usually available in various forms, including lozenges, syrups, gels and capsules. Zinc is also found in most multivitamin and mineral supplements. These supplements can contain zinc in the form of zinc gluconate, zinc sulfate or zinc acetate. As of now, all are believed to work in very similar ways so one type is not thought to be superior over the others.\n\n### Top Food Sources of Zinc\n\nHigh-protein foods contain the highest amounts of naturally occurring zinc. Here are the top 12 food sources of zinc, although keep in mind the absorption rate of zinc is best from foods that don’t contain any nutrients, which are usually animal-based as opposed to plant-based (percentages below are based on the average adult women’s RDI of 8 milligrams/day):\n\n* Lamb — 3 ounces: 2.9 milligrams (35 percent DV)\n* Grass-fed Beef — 3 ounces: 2.6 milligrams (32 percent DV)\n* Chickpeas — 1 cup cooked: 2.5 milligrams (31 percent DV)\n* Cashews — ¼ cup: 1.9 milligrams (23 percent DV)\n* Pumpkin seeds — ¼ cup: 1.6 milligrams (20 percent DV)\n* Yogurt (or Kefir) — 1 container of plain yogurt/6 ounces: 1 milligrams (12.5 percent DV)\n* Chicken — 3 ounces: 1 milligrams (12.5 percent DV)\n* Turkey — 3 ounces: 1 milligrams (12.5 percent DV)\n* Eggs — 1 large: 0.6 milligrams (7 percent DV)\n* Mushrooms — 1 cup: 0.6 milligrams (7 percent DV)\n* Salmon — 3 ounces: 0.5 milligrams (6 percent DV)\n* Cocoa powder — 1 tablespoon: 0.3 milligrams (3 percent DV)\n\n### Recipes High in Zinc\n\nYou can add more zinc to your diet naturally by including plenty of zinc-rich foods in your meals. Here are three ideas to get you started:\n\n#### Garlic Lamb Roast Recipe\n\nTotal Time: 6–10 hours\n\nServes: 2–4\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\n* 1 leg of lamb that will fit in your crockpot\n* Water to cover lamb\n* 2 tablespoons worcestershire\n* 2 tablespoons coconut vinegar\n* 6 garlic cloves\n* 1 teaspoon sea salt\n* 1 teaspoon black pepper\n* 1 teaspoon rosemary\n* Chopped carrots, onions and butternut squash\n\nDIRECTIONS:\n\n1. Place all ingredients in crock pot. Cook on low for 6–10 hours depending on settings and size of lamb leg.\n\n#### Crockpot Beef Stew Recipe\n\nTotal Time: 4–8 hours, (depending on crockpot setting)\n\nServes: 4–6\n\nINGREDIENTS**:**\n\n* 2 pounds organic beef stew meat\n* 2 tablespoon olive oil\n* 1 cup celery, diced\n* 3 garlic cloves, minced\n* 1 medium onion, diced\n* 1 sprig fresh thyme\n* 1 sprig fresh rosemary\n* 1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce\n* 1 cup chopped carrots\n* 1 can (14.5 ounces) fire-roasted diced tomatoes\n* 1 tablespoon coconut sugar\n* 1 tablespoon sea salt\n* 1/2 tablespoon black pepper\n* 3 sweet potatoes, cubed\n* 1/2 cup beef broth\n\nDIRECTIONS:\n\n1. Put all ingredients in crockpot and cook for 4–8 hours.\n\n#### Herbed Turkey Breast Recipe\n\nTotal Time: 2 hours, 15 minutes\n\nServes: 2\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\n* 2 large turkey breasts\n* 1/4 cup coconut oil\n* 2 tablespoons chopped green onion\n* 1 tablespoon sage\n* 1/8 cup lemon juice\n* 2 tablespoons Italian seasoning\n* 2 tablespoons coconut aminos\n* Black pepperto taste\n\nDIRECTIONS:\n\n1. In a small saucepan, combine first seven ingredients and bring to a boil. Remove from heat.\n2. Place turkey in a roasting pan and baste with herb mixture.\n3. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees.\n\n### Zinc Supplements\n\nSometimes, zinc supplements are used to prevent or treat a zinc deficiency. People who are unable to get enough zinc through their diet or who can’t properly absorb zinc may benefit from supplements.\n\nTypically, prescribed zinc supplements (like zinc sulfate) are taken by mouth, but sometimes patients receive zinc injections under the care of a healthcare professional. Orally zinc supplements are available in both tablet and capsule forms. You can also find zinc lozenges.\n\nZinc supplements are most effective when they are taken 1–2 hours after meals. For people that experience stomach pain or digestive issues after taking zinc, it may be helpful to take the supplements with meals instead.\n\nKeep in mind that it is possible to take too much zinc. The tolerable upper limit for zinc for adults is 40 milligrams per day. Anything above that amount may lead to zinc overdose side effects, so speak to your healthcare professional before increasing your dosage.\n\nEating foods high in zinc is still the best way to maintain proper zinc levels, so supplements should only be used as a back up if you are unable to consume enough zinc regularly.\n\n### Potential Side Effects of Too Much Zinc and/or Zinc Supplements\n\nTaking high doses of zinc for a prolonged period can interfere with the body’s absorption of other important minerals, including copper. For this reason, zinc acetate capsules are sometimes used to treat a liver disease that causes the liver to hold onto too much copper, causing damage. But for people without this condition, taking too much zinc has the potential to do the opposite of what’s zinc supposed to do — it can depress the immune system and impair blood cell formation.\n\nMore commonly, only short-term and minor symptoms occur when taking moderately high doses of zinc. Some people who use zinc nasal sprays and gels also experience changes in the ability to smell or taste foods, which can impact appetite.\n\nSome signs of a zinc overdose include nausea and indigestion, and possibly diarrhea, abdominal cramps and vomiting. This usually occurs within three to 10 hours of swallowing the supplements but goes away within a short period of time after the stopping the supplements.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that zinc supplements may interact with several types of medications, including antibiotics, penicillamine (a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis) and diuretics. If you use these medications on a regular basis, speak to your healthcare professional before using zinc supplements.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\n* Zinc is an essential trace element that’s needed in small amounts every day in order to maintain health and perform important body functions.\n* How does zinc help your body? Zinc benefits include regulating hormone production, promoting growth and repair, reducing inflammation and fighting free-radical damage.\n* What are the signs of a zinc deficiency? People who aren’t getting enough zinc may experience changes in appetite, chronic fatigue, weight gain or loss, hair loss, poor concentration, low immunity, slowed wound healing and hormonal problems — just to name a few.\n* The best way to avoid zinc deficiency is to eat foods high in zinc, especially animal meats, fish, cashews, pumpkin seeds and yogurt. Zinc supplements are also available for people who aren’t getting enough zinc in their diet or have issues absorbing the essential mineral.\n\nThe Skin Benefits of Zinc\n\nLet’s be honest. Zinc isn’t the first thing that comes to mind when you think about getting beautiful skin. In fact, you’ve probably never even thought about it before. But this “trace mineral” (so-called because you need only a very small amount each day) is found in every single cell in your body, and more than 100 different enzymes need it to function. Skin cells are particularly dependent on zinc’s powerful properties—in fact, the top layer of your skin is concentrated with up to six times more of the mineral than is found in the lower layers.\n\nHere’s how zinc keeps skin healthy and glowing from the inside:\n\n**It works as an antioxidant**\n\nThough not technically an antioxidant (like vitamins C and E, for example), zinc is a key part of your skin’s dietary defense squad. The mineral lessens the formation of damaging free radicals and protects skin’s lipids (fats) and fibroblasts—the cells that make collagen, your skin’s support structure—when skin is exposed to UV light, pollution and other skin-agers.\n\n**It helps heal and rejuvenate skin**\n\nWhen you cut yourself, zinc goes to work. First, the amount of the mineral in the skin surrounding the cut increases as enzymes and proteins ramp up to protect against infection, control inflammation and produce new cells and transport them to close up the broken skin. But even healthy, intact skin relies on zinc for new cell production and the function of cell membranes.\n\n**It may ward off acne flare-ups**\n\nPimples develop when a buildup of oil, bacteria and skin cells block pores, causing the skin around the pore to turn red, swollen and tender. Zinc, which boosts immune function, may help control that inflammatory response. What’s more, because zinc regulates cell production and turnover, and can help reduce the amount of natural oil your skin produces, it may prevent pores from clogging in the first place.\n\n**How Much Should You Get?**\n\nYou don’t need much. Men should aim for at least 11 mg per day, while women only need 8 mg. Oysters, crab and lobster are a few top sources of zinc, but chicken, lean beef, beans, chickpeas and fortified cereals can also help you meet your daily goal. A balanced diet can often provide the zinc you need, but if you’re considering a zinc supplement—or wondering if you might benefit from one—talk to your doctor.\n\nDon’t forget about zinc’s topical power too. Here’s how your skin benefits when you apply it to your outside:\n\n**It’s an effective sunscreen**\n\nUnlike chemical sunscreen ingredients, which absorb into the top layers of your skin to filter out the damaging part of the sun’s rays, zinc oxide (a zinc-containing compound) acts as a physical block, stopping UV light from penetrating your skin altogether. Although the zinc acts as a shield, the particles are micronized, so lotions containing it rub in like any other product and look invisible (you don’t need to fear the tourist’s swipe of white zinc oxide across the nose anymore). Even better, because zinc doesn’t absorb deeply, it’s less likely to irritate skin like other ingredients might—which is why it’s often found in sunscreens for sensitive skin and products for kids and babies. Look for “zinc oxide” listed under active ingredients on the label.\n\n**It clears up dandruff and relieves an itchy scalp**\n\nZinc pyrithione can be used to treat psoriasis, eczema and other skin conditions, but it’s best known for diminishing dandruff. (You’ll see it listed as the active ingredient on anti-dandruff shampoo and conditioner bottles.) Dandruff occurs when a common fungus that lives on the scalp grows out of control. The resulting irritation and inflammation causes skin cells to flake off and the scalp to become irritated and itchy. Zinc pyrithione not only helps control the growing bacteria, but also reduces the amount of oil that it feeds on, while its anti-inflammatory properties calm irritation and relieve itchiness. Even if you don’t technically have dandruff, this form of zinc will still relieve a dry, itchy scalp. When using a zinc pyrithione product, massage it into your scalp and let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing.\n\n**It helps heal rashes and other sores**\n\nA common ingredient in hemorrhoid treatments and diaper rash creams, zinc oxide helps heal skin in many of the same ways dietary zinc does: It reduces inflammation, regulates immunity and may stimulate the production of new cells. It’s also an anti-microbial, which can soothe and treat skin quickly; research suggests it may shorten the duration and reduce the severity of a cold sore, for example. Scan the ingredient list for zinc oxide when looking for topical treatments to help a rash or sore.\n\nSource: [http://www.hiwamag.com/health/zinc-benefits/](http://www.hiwamag.com/health/zinc-benefits/)",

    "body": "Hey everyone!  \n\nSo I've always been one to try and get everything from my diet, and am not very keen on the idea of taking pills regularly. But lately, I've had this nagging feeling like I might be low on something, and decided to finally spend some time doing research on nutrition in a vegan diet. I'm sure as a group, we're more educated about nutrition than the average person, but I've also seen misinformation tossed around here and there. Since there's so much conflicting or uninformed info on the internet, I thought it would be nice to try to get a good concise list all in one place of what to keep an eye on as a vegan.  \n\nSo recently, I spent the better part of a day researching, and luckily enough I have a friend who just graduated with a BS in nutrition who has helped me a ton with this. By no means am I an expert on this stuff, but I wanted to put this out there for anyone like myself, who's had a hard time getting definitive answers about what to think about in a healthy vegan diet.  \n\nIf anyone has any extra info or comments, or disagrees with any of the info here, I'd love to continue to expand and improve this list, so please let me know if there's anything you think should be added or changed. Or if there's already another general thread or location we organize this information, that works too. Hope this helps you like it's helped me!  \n~  \n~  \n~  \n\n\n\n**B Vitamins**\n--\n\n*     Of course, B12 is very scarce in a vegan diet especially, so at a minimum, B12 should probably be supplemented.\n*     B vitamins are water soluble, so excess is completely fine.\n\n**B12**\n\n* Take **methylcobalamin**, the form of B12 that you find in real food. This is a perfectly acceptable way to deliver cobalt to your body through the cobalamin. There are alternative cobalamins, such as adenosyl cobalamin, that might be more effective in conjunction with methylcobalamin in cases of extreme deficiency. Otherwise, methylcobalamin is great.\n\n**B6**\n\n*     Important especially for guys, and might be relatively scarce in a vegan diet.\n*     Specifically with men, an added bonus is that it helps mitigate estrogen-related problems, like increased free-fatty acids, high blood pressure\n*     Helps a lot with positive mood!\n*     Look for **pyridoxine HCL**\n\n\n\n**Zinc**\n--\n\n* This is a huge thing vegans can be insufficient or deficient in. The best course of action is probably to supplement.\n* While there are some dietary whole food sources of zinc, some of the largest sources of zinc and other minerals - greens, nuts and seeds - also contain phytic acid, which bonds to the minerals and diminishes your body's ability to use them.\n* Some of this can be mitigated by cooking greens or sprouting or fermenting seeds, which helps break down the food contents into more bioavailable forms, but even so, zinc is far from abundant in plant sources.\n* There are different choices: zinc gluconate, zinc picolinate, zinc acetate, and zinc oxide\n* All three former choices are fine - zinc acetate is the ideal supplemental form, but most expensive\n* Zinc oxide is cheapest because it's easiest to make, but it's less bioavailable AND more oxidizing (for obvious reasons).\n\n* Best Choice: **zinc acetate**\n* Economic choice: **zinc gluconate** or **zinc picolinate**\n\n\n**Vitamin A**\n--\n*  Vitamin A isn't as easy to get as one would think (some info below), so supplementing it is wise.\n*     A vitamins are fat soluble, so don't overdo it. What your body really wants is some form of *retinol*.\n*     While vitamin A is available in a lot of whole foods like dark leafy greens, carrots, and richly colored vegetables, this is usually in the form of beta-carotene, which isn't very accessible to your body. Beta carotene contains two retinols bonded together, in a way that's not easily broken and therefore not very accessible to your body.\n* Some experts even believe beta-carotene may interfere with vitamin A related activity. One study that was shut down showed beta carotene supplements caused lung cancer in smokers, while retinol didn't.\n*  What you'd like to do is provide your body with easily accessible retinol, so as a vegan, supplementing it is very helpful.\n*  Retinol palmitate and retinol acetate are two forms easily processed by your body, where one retinol is bonded to either a palmitate or acetate. Acetate may be more accessible, and palmitate is slightly controversial in terms of potential negative health effects (even tumors in rats?).\n\n* Best Choice: **retinol acetate**\n\n\n**Omega-3 Fatty Acids (and limiting Omega-6)**\n--\n*     The quantities of these needed by your body are all about a delicate balance, and both about quantity AND ratio. Most western diets tend to consume way too much omega-6, and not enough omega-3, and vegans especially should be concerned with getting enough omega-3s.\n*     Some research seems to suggest that the ideal ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 should be several times more omega-6 than omega-3, say, about 4:1 or 5:1. In hunter-gatherer days, this ratio was probably more like 1:1, but higher ratios seem to have positive health effects like reduced inflammation.\n*     Vegan diets probably have much larger ratios than is healthy - soy, for example, is high in omega-6s which is often big in vegan cuisine (tofu, tempeh...).\n*    As it is, western diets already consume WAY too much omega-6 from things like saturated fats\n*   However, simply drastically increasing omega-3 intake to compensate isn't necessarily the answer, since too much omega-3 is prooxidative.\n*     The best course of action is to moderately supplement omega-3 fatty acids, and try to limit omega-6s:\n*         **Coconut oil** happens to be a healthy oil, low on omega-6. It contains saturated short and medium chain fats.\n*         There are 3 types of omega-3 acids: **DHA**, **EPA**, and **ALA**:\n* ---- ALA converts to the other two, but how much ALA converts to the other two varies wildly based on external factors and is usually only a few percent.\n* ---- DHA and EPA come from mostly fish and the ocean, including algae\n* ---- EPA is, as I understand, not strictly as important as the other two\n*  Algae oil is an excellent supplement for DHA omega-3s \n*  Hempseed oil is an excellent supplement for ALA omega-3s.\n\n* Best choice of action: **algae oil**, **hempseed oil**, **limit soy intake**, try to stick to **coconut oil** the most\n\n\n**Other Helpful Things to Consider, Depending on Diet**\n--\n*     **Hemp protein** is a very complete form of protein. It contains very desirable ratios of essential amino acids\n*     If low in other minerals like calcium or magnesium, consider supplementing **calcium carbonate**, **magnesium carbonate**\n*     Though probably less important, consider supplementing **menatetrenone (vitamin K2)** if you don't eat a lot of K2-high foods like kale, brussels sprouts, spinach, green beans, asparagus, broccoli, green peas and carrots. K2 is important in maintaining tissue elasticity, and helps with bone clarification and remodeling, as well as the production of certain proteins\n*  **Vitamin E** helps with hair skin and nails, but it's fat soluble so don't supplement too much  \n\n~  \n~  \n~  \n\n**TL;DR Summary**\n--\n**Probably necessary supplements:**\n\n*     methylcobalamin (vitamin B12)\n*     zinc acetate (zinc)\n*     algae oil and hempseed oil (omega-3 fatty acids)\n\n**Recommended supplements:**\n\n*     retinol acetate (vitamin A)\n*     pyridoxine HCL (vitamin B6)\n*     magnesium (e.g. magnesium carbonate)\n\n**Healthy but not strictly necessary:**\n\n*     calcium (e.g. calcium carbonate)\n*     menatetrenone (vitamin K2)\n*     hemp protein\n*     vitamin E\n\n**General dietary reminders:**\n\n*     Use plenty of coconut oil - provides short and medium chain fatty acids, saturated fat, low in omega-6 (good)\n*     try to limit soy and other sources of omega-6s and phytoestrogens\n*   Of course, as always, eat plenty of nuts, cooked dark leafy greens, and beans and legumes, which are all huge nutritional powerhouses that are awesome sources of tons of essential nutrients like minerals, fiber, and/or healthy fats.  In an unbiased food pyramid, I imagine these three would be on the bottom, and they should absolutely be staples in a vegan diet.",

    "body": "I recently had a surprising success here and wanted to share with this community which I lurked for tips throughout this process. The below before/after picture represents only a small portion of the plantar warts I suffered, and even then far from their worst. I didn't take enough photos as it was an embarrassing and gross mess.\n\nTL;DR: careful application of poison ivy leaves to plantar warts seemed to reduce and eliminate them -- even warts not directly treated.\n\nBackground: Warts started with a single on right heel which grew large enough to interfere with normal walking. As I started treating this with acids/debriding over the course of years, it started to spread, despite sterile technique. Eventually I had several on both heels, clusters as pictured under toes, several single warts on the sole, and even one on the top of a toe. Trying to avoid surgery, I tried several home treatments to no avail: Zinc supplements (continued throughout), Vitamin A internally and topically, adapalene gel, salicylic acid, duct tape. With much pain, ACV (apple cider vinegar) on a cotton ball duct taped to the heel wart finally made some progress in at least reducing the largest wart to something manageable, but still with no sign of healing.\n\nMethod: Identified one wart on each foot which had already been reduced from ACV+duct tape treatment and partially debrided. With a fresh poison ivy leaf harvested from my ample yard supply, I use tweezers to tear off a small piece (less than the size of the warts), and lightly scraped it into each wart or cluster with sharp tweezers. I then taped the remaining leaf matter to the area with duct tape. Left overnight or \\~8 hours. Repeated every two days at first, to once a week later.\n\nZinc supplements (Zinc gluconate 50mg/day) were continued throughout.\n\nAfter about two weeks of this treatment, I noticed that the smaller independent warts started to reduce in size, despite not being directly treated. In a month, they were no longer visible. The clusters of warts were starting to separate and once I removed with tweezers/scissors normal skin started to appear.\n\nAbout two months later, it now appears that all skin is normal though there is certainly some light scar tissue and dry areas that have yet to clear.\n\nI'm fairly sensitive to poison ivy, but there was not much noticeable skin reaction to this treatment, except for perhaps some dry, flaky skin surrounding one of the warts which also could have been from the duct tape treatment. In fact, I thought the poison ivy wasn't working at first and put some on my arm to be sure I was still sensitized to it (I was) -- the reaction just seems to behave differently on foot skin.\n\nAll of this could be coincidence, I suppose, but I have a strong suspicion that the allergic reaction to the urushiol oil of the poison ivy triggered an immune response. Probably similar to other treatment methods that cause contact dermatitis such as DNCB.\n\nPlease use caution, start small if you try it.  Let me know if there are any questions. Hope this helps someone out there!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m0zceqjg1v551.jpg?width=4010&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c79174fd0904fedda5cfa9a9d59bc887bea0c013",

Is Zinc Gluconate a good choice, or should I special-order another type of zinc supplement online.\n\nSecondly, I would like to know if where it says \"Zinc 50 mg\" is shorthand for the amount of Zinc Gluconate in the pill (I've read that 10mg ZG = about 1.5mg of Elemental Zinc), or if it's indicative of the amount of elemental zinc in the pill.  I've searched the internet endlessly, but all I've been able to find are dead ends in this regard.\n\nThanks!",

I'm looking to restock this summer, but I'm having a hard time finding it on the websites of the pharmacies I normally visit, usually Iceland sometimes also in Denmark.\n\nInstead I'm finding this product: La Roche-Posay Anthelios Anti-shine Face Cream SPF50+ (which doesn't have the UVMune labeling, and instead says \"Anthelios XL\" instead -- the UVMune hydrating cream is still available curiously). I've included two forms of ingredients lists that have appeared for this product below.\n\nIt seems like perhaps this is mainly happening in Iceland - the rest of Scandinavian sites seem to have the UVMune version listed. I'm having a hard time figuring out where Iceland is getting this specific XL product from, as I assumed they generally imported primarily from the UK and Scandinavia suppliers - but they all seem to still be carrying the oil control gel creme, so...\n\nMy main questions are, does anyone know what has caused this renaming/reformulation in certain markets? And, would these options still provide the same coverage that UVMune does? Or should I keep looking for that product?\n\nJudging by the ingredients list below, the second would potentially provide the same coverage as it has Meroxyl 400 (METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE) and a few additional filters the first list doesn't. Putting aside the fact that listed ingredients on websites don't always reflect what's on the shelf, would this assumption about filters be correct?\n\nThank you all for your help!\n\n* / WATER • HOMOSALATE • SILICA • OCTOCRYLENE • ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE • BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE • ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE • BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE • DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE • ALUMINUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE • GLYCERIN • PENTYLENE GLYCOL • STYRENE/ACRYLATES COPOLYMER • POTASSIUM CETYL PHOSPHATE • DIMETHICONE • PERLITE • PROPYLENE GLYCOL • ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER • ALUMINUM HYDROXIDE • p-ANISIC ACID • CAPRYLYL GLYCOL • DISODIUM EDTA • INULIN LAURYL CARBAMATE • ISOPROPYL LAUROYL SARCOSINATE • PEG-8 LAURATE • PHENOXYETHANOL • SCUTELLARIA BAICALENSIS EXTRACT / SCUTELLARIA BAICALENSIS ROOT EXTRACT • SILICA SILYLATE • STEARIC ACID • STEARYL ALCOHOL • TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID • TITANIUM DIOXIDE • TOCOPHEROL • TRIETHANOLAMINE • XANTHAN GUM • ZINC GLUCONATE\n* AQUA / WATER / EAU • DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE • SILICA • ALCOHOL DENAT. • ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE • ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE • BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOLMETHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE • DIISOPROPYL ADIPATE • PEG-8 • DIPROPYLENE GLYCOL • C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER • GLYCERIN • DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE • ALUMINUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE • BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE • METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE • TOCOPHEROL • DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE • ACRYLATES COPOLYMER • ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER • BIXA ORELLANA SEED EXTRACT • CAPRYLYL GLYCOL • CITRICACID • HYDROXYACETOPHENONE • MALTODEXTRIN • PENTAERYTHRITYL TETRA-DI-T-BUTYL HYDROXYHYDROCINNAMATE • PENTYLENE GLYCOL • SILICA SILYLATE • SODIUMPOLYACRYLATE • TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID • TRIETHANOLAMINE • TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINEDISUCCINATE • ZINC PCA.",

I've researched about height pills before and I know fully well that all of them are fake and are scams.\n\nHere are the ingredients of the pills:\n\nNano Calcium Carbonate  : 250mg\n\nAquamin F                            : 100 mg \n\nMagnesi Oxide : 25mg\n\nZinc Gluconate : 20mg\n\nInulin: 15mg\n\nVitamin K2 (MK7) 2000ppm : 10mcg\n\nVitamin D3 : 200IU\n\nI really need help on this. I'm on the verge of accepting the pills just to keep peace in my family. I feel like if I take them I'll probably get like infertility or some kind of life-long unurable diseases. I don't wanna sell my health away just because of dumb height pills. But I am asking:\n\n1. Are these ingredients harmful ?\n2. Do they really give you calcium?\n3. Will I get diseases from drinking this\n4. Have you tried height pills? If so, how did it go?\n\nI appreciate it that you've read this..!",

        "body": "Hello there. I’m sorry your mom is doing this to you. Let me try and help. \n\nAs far as the ingredients, none of them are dangerous. “Nano Calcium Carbonate” is just finely milled calcium, magnesium, zinc, vitamin D3, and vitamin K is all the stuff you’d find in any old multivitamin or supplement. The doses are normal and not overly or dangerously high. \n\nInulin is just a plant-derived dietary fiber. \n\nAquamin F is a seaweed derived mineral that has very limited evidence to help with bone strength. \n\nSo, these pills are not going to do anything for or to you. It’s just like taking a daily multivitamin with some fiber and a piece of seaweed basically. It’s a complete scam. You’re 18, you don’t have to take pills that your parents force upon you. \n\nThese will not hurt you, but I would also advise to not take a daily multivitamin on top of it because you’ll end up taking a double dose of supplementary vitamins.",

In July, I started the debriding/ACV protocol that I learned from here. It was so painful, but I did it for a couple weeks before letting it heal a little to see if I made any progress. Unfortunately, no such luck. I kept researching and discovered that zinc is a commonly used supplement in combatting warts, also thanks to this sub! I got zinc gluconate from Walmart and took one 50mg tablet per day. I took it for a few months and didn’t notice any improvement so I kind of stopped for a few weeks, then started back up again. In Nov/Dec, I accidentally took too much in too short of a timespan, which had some extremely unpleasant side effects so I stopped taking it again and haven’t taken it since. Despite not taking it since that incident, I think my accidental overdose is what finally zapped my warts because they started going away after that. I couldn’t believe that they were really going away after so long but by February, they were gone completely and haven’t come back. I also didn’t do any debriding during this time; they just cleared up entirely on their own. Sharing in case this helps anyone else, though I do not recommend talking too much zinc lol! \n\nEdit to add that I had a mosaic wart situation covering my whole heel, I think I counted 12 total, and two more new ones developing on the top of my foot, and zinc cleared all of it up!",
