    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

        "body": "My Mom had subtype 3, with thickened skin. She had it really badly her whole life. I have some rosacea but have done my best to try to not wind up like her.  Sadly, I gave up on facial sunscreen a number of times because they irritated me or made my eyes swell shut. I currently use Dermologica which is really spendy and I am not sure it's coverage is that great, but it's the only thing I can use on my whole face so far.\n\n\nTwo things than help me a lot were cutting out black pepper and using more foundation. Environmental irritants wreck me, it seems. I used to wear moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, power, liquid, more powder and then setting spray. Very heavy coverage, but I realized that pretty much sealing my cheeks off from the world made them finally calm down, or maybe it was something in the primer. I kept at it for a long time, but now use lighter coverage. My cheeks are red, but not nearly as bad. Between that and two laser treatments I think of my problem as under control, but can't go out barefaced. And since age is a trigger I could be unknowingly doomed to the burning sensation and painful cysts Mom had, but try to live like that isn't lurking around the corner. \n\n\n\nI've never been able to use anything anti-aging, so the ideal that a retinol might actually help me is very intriguing. All my current doc will prescribe me is metrolotion, which never helped in the slightest. I might go talk to a derm at my own cost and see if that or rhofade might be good for me.",

    "body": "Edit: title should be fatty alcohols not fatty acids but autocorrect thinks for me and sees me type acids a lot so naturally I must’ve meant acids. SIGH. \n\n**WARNING: LONG BUT I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE IT WORTH.**\n\nHey all!\n\nSoooo, years ago, I was a big advocate for the [idea that some people cannot use fatty alcohols](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1y3ql7/simple_tip_for_those_of_us_who_cant_use_fatty/). This was due to my experiences with CeraVe Cream, CeraVe Lotion, Cetaphil Cream, and Cetaphil Lotion, primarily. More, I was using Ziana (.025% tretinoin + clindamycin), which I have a strong suspicion in retrospect was the cause of a form of folliculitis for me (perhaps chemical folliculitis -- there are several types of folliculitis but in this case, acne that is not \"acne,\" but rather born of continuous irritation of the hair follicles). Of course, like *everyone* going through acne, I blamed every skin product I was using except the prescription active that was *designed* to make my acne better. After all, a doctor gave it to me, and a doctor wouldn't give me something that would make me \"sicker.\" \n\nUnfortunately, it turns out that by the time I started to figure this out, it was all way too late. To this day, I have light pitted scarring in places from an 8 month moderate-to-severe zit explosion on my face that never ceased. It has taught me a lot and pressed me to learn a lot about how skin *actually* functions. I was told the entire time I was breaking out that it was just \"purging,\" only to realize what a misnomer \"purging\" kind of is -- implying the skin is holding onto infections waiting to churn out of it's layers rather than comedones -- open or closed -- that are visible, as well as microcomedones that are the beginning of an acne spot but invisible to the naked eye. At the time, purging to me implied that there were acne spots in the deeper layers of my skin waiting to come out. \n\nSo in the process of me flailing, I felt like this class of ingredients that are otherwise harmless were my bane: fatty alcohols. These are stearyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, and cetyl alcohol. After all, they turned up in *everything* that was breaking me out, including the cleansers, so surely it had to be them, right? \n\nFor example, at one point, I was using Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser + CeraVe Cream. What do these products have in common?\n\n**Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser**\n&amp;gt; Water, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, **Stearyl Alcohol**, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben.\n\n**CeraVe Cream**\n&amp;gt;Purified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20 And **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauryl Lactylate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n\n---\n\nSo being the ingredient hound I am, I connected the dots to \"must be fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives.\" After all, everything else I used had had these ingredients too.\n\n**CeraVe Lotion**\n&amp;gt; Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceteareth-20 and** Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\n**Cetaphil Cream**\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Petrolatum, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, PEG-30 Stearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Propylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n**Cetaphil Lotion** *note - I believe this used to have macadamia nut oil in it when I used it and has since been reformulated. \n\n&amp;gt; Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ceteareth-20, **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Dimethicone, Sodium Levulinate, Sodium Anisate,Caprylyl Glycol, Benzyl Alcohol, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Citric Acid, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer\n\nHappy, I thought, \"This must be it! I solved it!\" So I cut out fatty alcohol products (which, as I am sure many of you know, is a *massive* pain in the ass) and [tried to facilitate others in doing the same](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1ufvym/megalisting_products_without_cetylcetearylstearyl/). In fact, I feel like I was the primary champion of \"it might be fatty alcohols!\" back when this sub was only 25k people, and being as we were all learning from eachother and trusted eachother, many people trusted me in that assumption. After all, I had the proof (supposedly) to back it up.\n\nSo I used the lightest products, such as EltaMD PM (which is a wonderful product, don't get me wrong!). Unfortunately, my skin was parched *all of the time.* It was just sick. It kept breaking out for years after, bottle after bottle of EltaMD PM. Life happened, I was removed from the mod group for inactivity, and I just kept on with it - disappearing from this sub for a long-ass time.\n\nAnd then I started thinking... *what did I use before my skin started down this road?*\n\nBefore I knew jack-all about skin, I used Olay pretty religiously. Olay Regenerist, in the pot, with the fragrance. Yep.

How the fuck did my face not explode then?\"\n\nSo I did something insane: I tried a cream with fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives that was being recommended on this sub at the time (lol). Some of you may recognize this:\n\n**Cheryl Lee MD Ceramide+**\n&amp;gt;Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Coconut), Petrolatum, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Polyglyceryl -10 Pentastearate, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Isostearyl Isostearate, Cetyl Alcohol, 1,3 Propanediol (from Corn), C10-30 Cholesterol/Lanosterol Esters, Ceramide 3, Phytosphingosine, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Niacinamide, Glycyrrhetinic Acid (Licorice Root), 1,2 -Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Gluconolactone.\n\nAnd you want to know something?\n\n90% of my acne healed in a week. 90% of the acne that had been causing me scars and *ruining my fucking life for years* healed in a fucking **week**. I looked back at all the ingredients for all the products that I had avoided and all the ones I had just been able to use fine as a teenager and by fucking god, what did I miss? **Ceteareth-fucking-20** (sans the cleansers -- I still don't know why my skin hated Cetaphil Gentle, but it turns out that it has broken out with every creamy, non-sudsy cleanser ever, so I've resigned myself to using gentle SLES cleansers for life).\n\nI felt like such a massive asshole. \n\nSo that brings me to now, when I decided on a train on a vacation in NYC to start a skin blog. I had spent those years researching my ass off about skin not to even see what a massive fuckup I had made. I had been able to help my BF bring his eczema 80% into control with bleach bath washes and solve my mom's chronically dry skin and my friend's weird case of eczema on his ring finger, but not my own skin. \n\nI came back to this sub after ~5 fucking years (4 of them AFK) and I still see a lot of people avoiding *all fatty alcohols*. I'm making this post to tell you that it might not be all fatty alcohols. It may be cet-20, like me, or it may be those fatty alcohols in combination with other ingredients (combinations of some ingredients can change molecular sizes, some manufacturers use different sources or molecular sized products, like larger or smaller hyaluronic acid, for example). There's so much complexity with skincare, skin, and ingredients that it usually isn't *one whole class of ingredients*. In short: **your mileage may vary**. This is why spot testing is important, one product isn't for everyone, and while ingredient labels are important for weeding out culprits, you also need to do a bit of research on how ingredients work with others to change how they interact on the skin. \n\nSince then, I've spot tested many of the products I flat-out ruled out and 1. it turns out everything with cet-20 does explode my face, 2. it turns out macadamia nut oil also explodes my face (in the cet lotion), and 3. turns out I can use 50% of the things I thought I couldn't (like jojoba oil!).\n\nI'm so happy that many of you have found this sub educational, but **please** consider what you've used in the past (skincare for face, makeup, EVERYTHING) and don't neglect those products when cross-identifying culprits. It changed my life and it might change yours.\n\nSome takeaways, with bullet points because I love bullet points:\n\n* Don't rule out entire classes of ingredients. Skin is super individual and it may be one stupid ingredient.\n* Don't take all of your skincare advice from the Internet, and if you do, try to diversify. Reddit, acne.org, MakeupAlley, medical journals -- get in there and become your own advocate.\n* Sometimes, skin is just an asshole and you won't be able to figure out what it hates. Example: My skin has issues with CeraVe healing ointment and foaming wash, despite them lacking cet-20. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n* Sometimes, what is considered \"good\" or \"best\" for skin isn't good or best for your skin. Example for me: creamy cleansers. They're definitely recommended *everywhere* for *every* skin condition, esp rosacea (which I have), but my skin fucking loathes them all. No idea why, and that's okay.\n* Just because an ingredient is \"good\" for skin doesn't mean it is good for your skin. Example: Me and high % niacinamide = zits. Me and low % niacinamide = k.\n* Just because it's a prescription doesn't mean it can't fuck you up, fam. I thought prescription = good, no problems here, won't cause issues. I have literal scars to prove me wrong. Instead of assuming all is well, **TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR IF SHIT IS UP AND IF YOUR DOCTOR IS LIKE HEY SHIT IS FINE BUT YOU STILL THINK SHIT IS FUCKED, GO TO ANOTHER DOCTOR**. I wish I had done this. Instead, my doc kept urging me to use it every single night. Went to a new doc and he was like, \"Oh no, your skin is very sensitive, that is wayyyy too harsh.\" Listen to your gut.\n* Almost alll skin rules are more like guidelines (except the baking soda, lemon juice, harsh harsh scrubs stuff - that's all still true since they can all throw your skin very out of whack). Example: I do better with light physical exfoliation once a week than AHA any day.\n\nThanks, and I'm sorry for being such a massive, incorrect asshole. I'm doing my best to correct my errors now (and hopefully go to esthetics school though BF is pushing me to do dermatology).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n",

There needs to be someone on the medical side who can vouch for us not being complete loons about our skin. \n\nYes I have to agree with the sentiment of your post.... over the last few years my skin has been freaking out over every little thing. Too hot, too cold, aha, bha, B3, HA, phenoxyethanol the list goes on. \n\nFor 7months I used Tretinoin 0.025% and built up slowly (I thought), the purge happened. Traumatic. Then just unhappy skin.... but it is gold standard for my issues right? My face said no. \n\nAfter becoming ill last year, severely for 6+ months, all skincare and Tret use went down the drain. Just SS once a day, used as moisturiser. Rarely even washed my face in the evening I was too exhausted. \n\nWhat this did, apart from giving me Cc's and what have you. Was a chance for my skin to repair my moisture barrier on my face. Since medication has helped with the symptoms of my illness,  I have been able to use 1 product in my routine with phenoxyethanol as the main preservative, without it giving me painful pustles and nodules everywhere I experienced before. \n\nI have realised that the rash of whiteheads where ever I use a product with HA in and determined was the HA also happens with high levels of BG. So now planning to test a large molecular weight HA serum to see if I have the same issue without the BG. PG is fine... Propanidol is great. \n\nB3 🤔 causes flushing in my skin. And I'm not really interested in trying again.... \n\nBHA, again let me try again at some point. But method of application might be the issue here. \n\nSo vitamin c seemed out of the lexicon for my skin. I now have a silicone based C vit lined up to trial. \n\nFragerance/ essential oils can still mess me up doh. \n\nMoral of this story for me? Concentrate on keeping healthy skin barrier. The rest comes after.... so cleanse (favourite step), treat (calming, hydrating, emollient and then the acne/PIH target), protect. This approach has been working for me so far.",

    "body": "Companies sometimes share the percentage retinol they use, but it's good to realize this is sometimes not the percentage of the pure retinol, but of a mixture.\n\nPhrases like \"1% coated retinol\" , \"a 1% retinol complex serum\" or we use \"0.5% slow release retinol\" are indicications they could be referring to a mixture/complex. Percentages like 2.5% or 3% are very unlikely pure retinol. There are also products that mention retinol in the product name, while the products doesn't contain retinol, but a derivative like Retinyl Palmitate.\n\nCompanies may list everything below 1% in random order, so often they try to get that 1% line high up on the ingredient list, and then list the actives first to make it look more potent. You could try to spot that 1% line, it can be helpful to determine wether the % is referring to a mixture or to the actual pure retinol. You can also look for ingredients on the inci list that are used in these standard retinol mixtures, commonly used coated/mixture forms can for example be found here:\n\n[https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1)\n\nSome ingredients that are commonly used at or below 1%:  Phenoxyethanol, Parabens, Levulinic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, EDTA's, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Carbomer,  Hyaluronic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Ubiquinone, Peptides, Retinoids, Ceramides, Fragrance, most plant extracts in powder form etc.\n\n\n\n**First example, M. Asam Retinol 1% Intense:**\n\n* Claim: 1% retinol in encapsulated form\n* Indications it's not 1%: Retinyl Palmitate is usually used below 0.3%. Polyurethane Crosspolymer-1 and Glycine Soja Oil are part of RetiCap PF, most likely this serum contains 0.08% Retinol.\n* Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, **Retinyl Palmitate, Retinol,** Panthenol, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, **Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil**, Tocopherol, Lauroyl Lysine, Dipentaerythrityl Pentaisononanoate, Carbomer, Polyglyceryl- 10 Laurate, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, **Polyurethane Crosspolymer- 1,** Caprylyl Glycol, Bht, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Second example, Inkey List Retinol Serum:**\n\n* Claim: 1% stable retinol and 0.5% granactive retinoid\n* Indications it's not 1%: Tocopherol, Carbomer in general are not used above 1%. Caprylyl Glycol in combination with other preservatives is in general not used above 1%, this means there's less than 1% Dimethyl Isosorbide (part of) Granactive Retinoid, which contains 10% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, so 0.05% in this formula. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (and) Sodium Ascorbate (and) Tocopherol (and) retinol is called RetiSTAR. This contains 5% Retinol, so at 1%, there's 0.05% retinol in this formula. So 1.5% total retinoid, no not really, more likely it's 0.1% max.\n* Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Caprylyl Glycol,** Phospholipids, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Squalane, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Extract, **Carbomer**, Sodium Ascorbate, **Tocopherol,** Polysorbate 60, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycolipids, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol,** Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Third example,**[Dr Brandt 2% Retinol serum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26OFz0DakQc&t=0m13s)**:**\n\n* claim 2% Retinol Complex\n* Why it's not 2%: Tocopherol and Phenoxyethanol are not used above 1%. Could be  \"Retinol C50 by Amcol\" or \"Iuvenesens® B-15\". So most likely 0.3% at most. Think about how the fancy packaging and marketing makes you think this is really worth $70. With all the fragrance ingredients lie Limonene, Grapefruit Oil and Lavender Oil it's best to skip this product.\n* Water, Glycerine, Dicaprylylcarbonaat, Isoamyl Lauraat, Cyclopentasiloxaan, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Boter, Shea Butter Cetyl Esters, Triheptanoin, **Tocoferol, Phenoxyethanol,** Behenyl Alcohol, Methylpropaandiol, Glycerylstearaatcitraat, Polysorbaat 20, Natriumacrylaten Copolymeer, **Retinol,** Glycerylstearaat , Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Limonene, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, etc...\n\n**Fourth example, Sunday Riley A+ High Dose 6.5% Retinoid :**\n\n* Claim: 5% retinoid ester, 1% liposomal-encapsulated retinol, 0.5% blue-green algea\n* Probably the 5% refers to Granactive Retinoid, you can't use 50% of this, so that means there's 0.5% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Which seems correct since the 1% line is around Diheptyl Succinate, and Dimethyl Isosorbide is the 3th ingredient. The Retinol is less than 1%, it's liposomal encapsulated, so this could be \"Iuvenesens® B-15\" as well, probably this means there's about 0.2% Retinol at most. So instead of the claimed 6.5% Retinoid, for $85 you are actually getting 0.2% retinol, 0.5% HPR with no indepedant studies on it's anti aging properties, and some unproven plant extract.\n* Water/Eau/Agua, Propanediol, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Triheptanoin, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Hexyldecanol, Disiloxane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Diheptyl Succinate, Propylene Carbonate, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate**, PPG-24-Glycereth-24, Phenyl Trimethicone, **Retinol, Ubiquinone (CoQ10),** Honey Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Algae Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Opuntia Ficus-indica Fruit Extract, Bisabolol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Phospholipids**, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Lecithin, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, 4-t- Butylcyclohexanol, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Helianthus Annuss (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitol, Cetylhydroxyproline Palmitamide, Polysilicone-11, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Polysorbate, Hydroxyphenyl Propamidobenzoic Acid, Stearic Acid, Brassica Campestris Sterols, PVP, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Alcohol, Potassium Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, **Tocopherol**\n\n**Fifth example: Indeed labs Retinol Reface:**\n\n* Claim 1% retinoid fluid, 1% retinol time release complex encapsulated, 3% retinol like peptides\n* Looking at the position of Dimethyl Isosorbide, there's most likely 1% Granactive Retinoid, so 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Retinol is under the 1% line, I'm not completely sure which form is used but could be Retinol 10S, so this means 0.1% final concentration. Xanthan Gum in normal viscosity products is usually something like 0.2%. Peptides at 3%, this mixture contains 100ppm and 50ppm, so 0.0003% and 0.00015% respectively. So instead of thinking to get 5% pure actives, you are getting something like 0.2%.\n* Water, Dimethicone, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Cetearyl Glucoside, Peg-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, **Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol**, Sodium Acrylate/sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, **Xanthan Gum**, Glycine **Soja (Soybean) Oil, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,** Polysorbate 80, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, **Retinol**, **Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Acacia Senegal Gum, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Tocopherol\n\n**Cerave Skin Renewing Retinol Serum**\n\n* Claim: encapsulated Retinol\n* They don't mention any percentage, but it is below 1%. They could have used ROVISOME Retinol Moist,  Water (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Alcohol (and) **Retinol** (and) Polysorbate 20 (and) Potassium Phosphate. This contains 3% retinol, most likely used at 1-2%, there's 0.03-0.06% actual retinol. So if that is correct I think this is more a beginners retinol.\n* Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, **Polysorbate 20**, Peg-40 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, **Potassium Phosphate,** **Ceramide Np**, Ceramide Ap, Ceramide Eop, Carbomer, Niacinamide, Isoceteth-10, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Triethanolamine**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cichorium Intybus Root Extract / Chicory Root Extract, **Lecithin**, **Retinol,** Silica, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, **Alcohol,** Hydroxyacetophenone, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, **Pentylene Glycol,** Xanthan Gum, Phytosphingosine, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter / Shea Butter, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**The Ordinary Granactive 2% Emulsion**\n\n* uses [InuMax Advanced Retinol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/la/PersonalCare/Detail/2163/637871/InuMax-Advanced-Retinol)\n\nAnd to add one more thing besides the vague percentage marketing, remember that Retinol is very, very unstable. It's very difficult to formulate with pure retinol. So it's understandable companies work with premixed complexes. Though even with these complexes as a consumers you can't be 100% sure it stays stable during the whole shelf life. Some products use dropper bottles or tubes that allow air in formula, and products may have been stored for months in warehouses and stores. It can be fine, but as a consumer it's difficult to know for sure. Remember that for PAO and shelf life stability, tests are done to measure things like bacterial/yeast growth, shifting, pH fluctuations. Doing a stability assay to determine the degradation of specific actives in a formula is **not** a mandatory part of that. PAO and shelf life are thus not a 100% guarantee the actual actives remain stable and effective. If you want something OTC, adapalene is much more stable and you don't have to worry wether you are getting the right percentage, it's a standardized proven formula. It doesn't bind to all receptors and is mainly proven for it's anti acne benefits, but the results for it's anti-aging benefits are promising. Other option could be a Retinaldehyde or a Retinol product that is formulated by a larger well known company, is in airless packaging, and which you store in a fridge at home. \n\n\"It can be difficult to discern the concentrations of OTC retinol and retinaldehyde in a given product as there is no labeling requirement in the  USA to list these concentrations. In general, irritation is a biomarker of efficacy, and formulations that do not produce irriation are unlikely to have significant effects. In addition it is advisable to steer patients toward larger, well-established cosmetics companies with a good reputation. Brandname products from companies that have rigorous quality control and regulations are preferred over products from small manufacturers. Because retinol is a fairly unstable compound and requires proper packaging and storage conditions to maintain efficiency, there can be great variability among preparations.[Cutaneous Photoaging, Watson,  Griffiths, 2019](https://books.google.nl/books?id=6reqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=adapalene+photo+aging&source=bl&ots=AkWsbaI5qq&sig=ACfU3U1l2wWZkLfx3P1VHkbLM_ZyfdoopQ&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjahICuw_znAhXDzaQKHS13DLI4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=adapalene%20photo%20aging&f=false)\" --> to add one thing to this, some studies also indicate that when retinol degrades it becomes more irritating to skin, so irritation is not always a good marker.\n\n\nPersonally I think if you want to be sure, go for prescription tretinoin, that is proven and effective, and often more affordable than retinol as well.

Because with a brief look earlier I saw the Palmitamide MEA in it and thought it's one of the ceramides (the names are so similar haha!). However, today I saw incidecoder mentioning it as just a viscosity controlling ingredient (and I usually find them quite accurate), but more things came up where I saw something from mdedge [here](https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/74188_main.pdf) stating \"Palmitamide MEA (PEA) is an important component of MimyX nonsteroidal cream, Dr. Smith said. PEA is an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties\" but this doctor has a consulting agreement with Stiefel Labs, which manufactures Physiogel. Also came across this [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/) but it's testing a synthetic ceramide PC-104 in combination with other things like Palmitamide MEA, grapeseed extract etc. Plus, I remember reading an AMA from kindofstephen where he said \" I think most cosmetic companies would attribute patents as a marketing cost. Most novel patents I've seen in the cosmetic industry are to deal with delivery vehicles (like an airless soft container, etc)\". My takeaway is things can be patented even if they're not doing too much, because to consumers it seems like it's doing a lot? And now idk if this ingredient/Physiogel is any good as a ceramide cream or it's just a good plain heavy moisturiser.\n\nEdit: Realised this ingredient is present in Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume, along with SK-Influx, where it's described as \"Atoderm Intensive Baume quickly stops itching and reduces the urge to scratch thanks to its anti-itching dermatological active ingredient PEA\"\n\nMy understanding is Physiogel doesn't have any ceramides or cholesterol/phytosterols (looks like Zeroid uses phytosterols in place of cholesterol?), but has PEA as a fatty acid (skin similar ingredient), so it must be a good moisturiser but not an ideal-ratio ceramide moisturiser.",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

I recently wrote this... enormous monstrosity on rosacea and shared it over at /r/skincareaddiction, but also wanted to share it here since I have found lots of value in the discussions here as well as the science surrounding AB ingredients (such as snail mucin, propolis, etc.). \n\nIn the future, I plan to do a large post that combines both AB product recommendations and SCA recommendations (as well as mine) for rosacea, but I felt this would be it's own post that I would later connect to this one.\n\nThanks so much for being awesome.

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!\n\nIngredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm really excited about this section. I'm not happy that Korea is and has been for years, swamped in pollution from the winds carrying it over. There is a lot of microdust and even people with resilient skin reported getting redness & severe irritation from the pollution. Everyone has to wear these giant masks, sometimes special ones, and limit their exposure to the world outside of their homes.*\n\n*So there has been a lot of push for soothing, calming products and \"clean\" ingredients. A lot more focus on repairing the skin barrier. So I'm excited about those, but not the fact that people have to suffer.*\n\n*I'll be bolding some of the soothing, repairing and/or skin-identical ingredients in the ingredient lists. I don't know every good ingredient, but I will bold the ones that I do know of. Some other beneficial ingredients as well.*\n\n*\\*Also got random pictures of the textures of the creams and the users who posted it.*\n\n*If you're interested in barrier repairing/replenishing as I am, here are some good quotes from Susan, from Swift Crafty Monkey blog:*\n\n>**Natural moisturizing factor (NMF)** is found within the corneocytes, and makes up 20% to 30% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum. It **consists of amino acids (40%), sodium PCA (12%), lactate (12%), urea (7%), ions (18.5%), sugars (like glycerol – 8.5%)**, and a few other things. These are water soluble [humectants](https://swiftcraftymonkey.blog/better-crafting-through-chemistry/) (meaning they draw water out of the atmosphere to our skin) that have a huge impact on the biochemical and mechanical properties of our skin. Having an adequate NMF level in our skin can prevent or reduce skin tightness, cracking, scaling, and flaking. It improves our skin’s plasticity (thanks to the interactions of the amino acids with keratin) and helps maintain skin’s barrier properties.  \n>  \n>**Filaggrin** is a really important protein found in our skin! ...When we are in more arid climates, the filaggrin breakdown increases to produce more NMF. More NMF is a good thing!  \n>  \n>The contents of the NMF do more than act as humectants. The lactate and potassium can affect the pH and stiffness of the stratum corneum. The lactic acid stimulates ceramide biosynthesis and improves barrier function. The [hyaluronic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan) (HA – picture to the left) maintains hydration and structural integrity of our skin. It also interacts with intercellular lipids and regulates the mechanical properties of the stratum corneum.  \n>  \n>\\[The strateum corneum lipids\\] make up about 15% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum, and contain about **40% to 50% ceramides, 20% to 25% cholesterol, 15% to 25% fatty acids** (those with C16 to C30 chain lengths, with C24 to C28 being the most common), and **5% to 10% cholesterol sulfate**.  \n>  \n>Oils with **linoleic or gamma-linoleic acid** are always welcomed by our skin (like sunflower, sesame seed, borage, evening primrose, rice bran, and others), especially in the winter.\n\n**Squalane, beeswax, lecithin, lanolin** are also good skin replenishing ingredients. Shea butter is very soothing and moisturizing, as well as having a lot of antioxidants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TOP CREAMS**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. \\[Dr. G\\] Red Blemish Clear Soothing Cream - 4.22/5 (9,894 Reviews)**\n\n70ml/36,000 KRW - $31.29\n\nWater (Aqua/Eau), **Glycerin**, Butylene Glycol, C 13-16 Isoparaffin, **Niacinamide**, C 12-14 Isoparaffin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Pentylene Glycol, Vinyl Dimethicone, Caprylyl Methicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Panthenol**, Acrylates/C 10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Tromethamine, **Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate,** Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, **Beta-Glucan, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside,** Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Epigallocatechin Gallate, **Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid.**\n\n*This line from this brand is extremely well-known and popular in Korea.

Some very antioxidants in there too, like astaxanthin, as well as blueberry, pomegranate, fig, mulberry, albeit super small amount.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/47zpk36l1g731.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9241d8e8dcb7ec57a1dc0c5ffaf2d5ef01f7398\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r78icq5x1g731.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=2277421e615e9ace9ef7f3769fe09961eb9fa45a\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**6.** [**\\[AESTURA\\] Atobarrier Cream**](http://220.64.86.130/eng/brandInfo/atobarrerCream.do) **- 4.22/5 (2,443 Reviews)**\n\n100ml/35,000 KRW - $30.40\n\n정제수, 글리세린, 부틸렌글라이콜, 부틸렌글라이콜다이카프릴레이트/다이카프레이트, 펜타에리스리틸테트라아이오스테아레이트, 사이클로펜타실록세인, **스쿠알란,** 세틸에틸헥사노에이트 베헤닐알코올, 스테아릭애씨드, 하이드록시프로필비스팔미타마이드엠이에이, 사이클로헥사실록세인, C14-22알코올, 하이드록시프로필비스라우라마이드엠에이, 만니톨, 아라키딜알코올, 콜레스테롤, 폴리아크릴레이트-13, 알란토인, 카나우바왁스추출물, C12-20알킬글루코사이드, 아라키딜글루코사이드, 다이메틴콘올, 폴리아이소부텐, 피토스핑고신, 글리세릴카프릴레이트, 아크릴레이트/암모늄메타크릴레이트코폴리머, 카보머, 트로메타민, 에틸헥실글리세린, 실리카, 폴리솔베이트20, 솔비탄아이소스테아레이트, 글루코오스, 아라키딕애씨드, 팔미틱애씨드, 소목줄기가루, 올레익애씨드, 토코페롤\n\nWater, **Glycerin**, Butylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetyl Ethylhexonate, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Glyceryl Linoleate, Dimethicone, Stearic Acid, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, Cyclohexasiloxane, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohols, Citrus Unshiu (Satsuma Mandarin) Peel Extract, Glyceryl Linolenate, Glyceryl Oleate, Glyceryl Caprylate, **Niacinamide**, Orchid Extract, **Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract,** Camellia Japonica (Japanese Camellia) Leaf Extract, Dimethiconol, **Mannitol,** Opuntia Coccinellifera (Prickly Pear) Fruit Extract, Behenyl Alcohol, **Borage Officinalis Seed Oil**.

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

    "body": "Today's random TJ Maxx haul at a new TJ Maxx I randomly stopped by. Prices are in USA\n\nPhotos 2, 3, 4 are from today's TJ Maxx in Long Beach, CA. Photos 5 and 6 are from an Orang County, CA TJ Maxx. Stores are clean and organized.\n\nHAUL and mini review: (dry/dehydrating/30/Socal)\n\n**Laneige cica sleeping mask $20 60 mL**. My ride or die cica cream that I always need to have in stock. I ran out in March and was gonna buy more on my Japan trip, but couldnt find it in Japan. I didnt really wanna deal with the shipping and tariffs mess with online retailers so I intended to buy it whenever theres a sale at my local Amorepacific/Aritaum store. Regular price is $34, I was hoping to snag it on a 30% sale for \\~ $25, but TJ Maxx selling it for $20 is fantastic. Even Stylevana only has it on sale for $24 right now. I was devastated that this TJ only has 1 in stock. \n\nMini review: Nothing soothes my skin the way this cica cream does it, especially on hotter days. Its my fall back whenever my skin acts up. 10/10. Have been repurchasing for 5 years I think.\n\nIngredients: Water, Propanediol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Squalane, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Glycerin, Panthenol, Cetearylalcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, 1,2-hexanediol, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Hydroxyethylacrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Tauratecopolymer, Butylene Glycol, Acrylates/C10-30alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Glyceryl Caprylate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium EDTA, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Sorbitan Isostearate, Asiatic Acid, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Aureobasidium Pullulans Ferment, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Cymbopogon Martini (Palmarosa) Oil, Tocopherol\n\n**Parnell  cicamanu cotton clear pad $5 90 pads.** This was a clearance item. I didnt even know Parnell sells skincare. I thought they're a makeup company that focuses on cushions. Just checked Stylevana, its being sold for $18.\n\nIngredients: Water, Methylpropanediol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, C12-14 Pareth-12, Glycereth-26, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Glyceryl Caprylate, Betaine, Allantoin, Trehalose, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Leptospermum Scoparium Leaf Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Honey Extract, Gluconolactone, Ceramide NP, Anastatica Hierochuntica Extract, Lactobacillus Ferment, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Madecassoside, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Disodium EDTA\n\n**Dr. Jart Ceramidin cream $25 30mL + 50mL**. Have not tried. The Dr. Jart cica cream is a thin gel that was too thin for my dry skin so Im hoping this ceramidin cream is thicker. Currently $30 for 50 ML on Yesstyle.\n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dipropylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Methyl Trimethicone, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dicaprylyl Ether, Cetearyl Olivate, Panthenol, Glyceryl Stearate, Behenyl Alcohol, Sorbitan Olivate, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Extract, 2,3-Butanediol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Ceramide NP(2,070ppm), Ceramide NG(2,070ppm), Ceramide NS(2,070ppm), Ceramide AS(2,070ppm), Ceramide AP(529ppm), Cholesterol, Pentaerythrityl Distearate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cellulose Gum, Dextrin, Glyceryl Polymethacrylate, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Oil, Citronellol, Tocopherol, Tartrazine\n\n**S.Nature Aqua Squalane Moisturzing Cream $10 60 mL.** Have not tried. Currently $20 on Yesstyle. Interested in trying because the ingredients look good for this price. New brand to me.\n\nIngredients: Water, Squalane (150,000ppm), Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Betaine, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Adenosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Arginine, Allantoin, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Glucose, Butylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n**Sulwhasoo Perfecting Cushion $25 for 2.** Crazy good deal. Its usually $65 for 2. I know its on sale because this is the old version and the new version in store is that ugly boring orange packaging. Got it for my aunt.\n\nAt this point, Im going to TJ Maxx every other day. Its my form of stress release. Thank goodness the deals are reasonable. ",

They don't always appear as \"ceramide \\_\\_\", there are other names for them, such as:\n\nHydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, Myristoyl/​Palmitoyl Oxostearamide/​Arachamide MEA, Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide, Hydroxypalmitoyl Sphinganine, [Safflower Oil/​Palm Oil Aminopropanediol Esters](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/safflower-oil-palm-oil-aminopropanediol-esters), etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo today I wanted to make a list of products that are easily overlooked when searching for ceramide skincare, because many people are only looking for the word \"ceramide\".

Even if they come before the preservatives, the preservatives are probably present at like 0.9% so the company can list them after the fancy ingredients even though the expensive ingredients are at minuscule concentrations.

I know I have sensitive acne prone skin.  but it is often dry and flakey.  the only time I get oily is when I am wearing makeup, which I do very often. I think I might have hormonal acne, because I will break out with hard cystic acne a couple of weeks out of the month, then it will calm down after my monthly cycle ends.  \n\nother problems: I get very bad cystic acne deep in my skin. I usually only get these on my chin or around my mouth, but I have recently gotten a couple of the left side of face on my upper cheeks.  I have large pores the are constantly clogged.  I have these weird small bumps that look like they are filled with gunk but are hard to pop.  i also have clogged pore looking things that i can squeeze and a never ending noodle of puss will come out (sorry to be so gross im just trying to explain what i deal with) not to mention little white heads here and there.  but most the the problems are around my mouth/lips and on the apples of my cheeks/around my nose area\n\nwhat ive tried to do: first of all let me say i cant afford to go to a derm, but i am not opposed to seeing an esthetician if it is affordable.  i have been using aveeno clear complexion foaming face wash to wash my face, makeup removing cloths before i wash, then i use face moisturizer.  but i have just started using OCM with castor oil and avocado oil.  I have done A TON of research on this before i started so Im almost positive im doing it right BUT i got a HUGE HARD cyst on my chin the day after starting :(\n\nother products i may use:\nlush's celestial moisturizer,\nLUSH enchanted eye cream,\nolay day time moisturizer,\nwitch hazel (not often),\nst ives exfoliating pads (2x a week),\ni also don't use towels to dry my face i let it air dry and pat some of the water with my hands\n\ni have also used a couple of other products that i actually really like, but im not sure if they are doing my face any good, or actually may be causing some of my problems. i will list the product, how i use it, and the ingredients because they are lesser known:\n\nOSEA ADVANCED PROTECTION CREAM: I use this at night before bed after i wash my face, before i put moisturizer on...\nits supposed to even hyper pigmentation, fine lines, and stimulate collagen production:\nINGREDIENTS: aqua, algae extract*, dipalmitoyl, hydroxproline, coco caprylate/caprate, cetearyl glucoside, olive, glycerin*, aloe barbadensis leaf juice*, macadamia seed oil*, grape seed oil*, jojoba seed oil*, capryloyl glycin, vitamin E, avacodo oil*, chondrus crispus*, undecylenoyl glycin, glycine, calendula officinalis flower extract, anthemis nobilis flower extract*, potassium ascorbyl tocopheryl phosphate (natural vitamin C), citrus medicalimonum peel oil*, xanthan gum, sodium benzodate, potassium sorbate (*certified organic) ( 100% natural derived ingredients) \n\nOSEAS red algae mask: HG mask for me at the moment. when i have a cystic acne break out it soothes my face and helps ease the pain and i always feel like my acne is less inflamed and my skin has a slight glow after using this. i use this 1x a week but not every week...\nINGREDIENTS:  red algae gel extract, glycerin, corrective oil complex, cocoglucoside and coconut alcohol, sodium lauroyl oat amino acid, French red clay, frech pink clay, magnesium aluminum, silicate, cahadian willowbark extract, multifruit extract, sesame oil. jojoba oil, sodium magnesium aspartate, water lily extract, chamomile extract, red wine extract, lactic acid, vitamin e, calendula extract, greentea extract, grapefruit seed extract, xanthan gum, phenoxyetanol\n\ni also have a face lotion that i use on my infant son, and i was wondering if i could use it as a gentle face lotion:\nnatures baby face and body lotion:\ningredients:\norganic aloe barbadenis leaf juice, safflower seed oil, ethylhexyl palminate (from coconut), glycerl stearate, sorbitan olivate, shea butter, macadamia ternifolia seed oil, olive fruit oil, jojoba seed oil, glycerin, rosa centifolia flower water, natural vitamin E, cellulose gum, xanthan gum, organic comfrey extract, organic chamomilla matricaria flower extract, organic calendula flower extract, amino acid, amino acids, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, glycine, citric acid\n\n\n\nso that's it! any help/advice/words will be very appreciated !\n\nthanks for reading.

It might be worth it to at least get a consultation with a derm (some do that for free), get some recommendations/samples, and then ask your GP to prescribe you things. I generally am pretty against recommending Accutane, but I think it's worth it for people who have that sort of painful, deep cystic acne, especially if it's causing you a lot of emotional distress. I have no idea if a GP can prescribe Accutane, though.\n\nI notice you said you have an infant son. Were you on any kind of birth control before you had him? Have you ever been on birth control? Cystic acne is frequently related to hormones. Can you see an OB/GYN? They would at least be able to talk to you about that, and if you are ok with going on birth control or other hormonal meds, that might help.\n\nI agree with what most other commenters are saying, though. Drop the multitude of heavily fragranced Lush products and start over from scratch with some gentle products like CeraVe and maybe some oils. Seeing an esthetician might be worth it just so someone can see your skin and guide you through treating it irl, but don't let anyone try to sell you miracle products.

It was time-consuming process and there were a lot of restrictions.  You had to have blood work done regularly before you could get your new prescription for the month and you had to call to \"certify\" in order to pick up your prescription, etc.  It's a very expensive process if you don't have insurance.  I think the medication alone (without insurance), was around $300 per month.  It was the only thing that worked for me.  I ended up going through two more courses of the treatment, each time a lower dose/shorter period of time.

Obviously when you see the derm, just reiterate that you don't have insurance and you would just like to work out the least expensive option at this point that will still be effective. The derm should be able to give you quite a few free samples as well :-) I know for me personally, nothing besides the medicine would have helped with my acne because it was hormone related (due to PCOS) so I needed the androgen blocker in spiro in order to clear it up. After the initial skin-freakout, which was a bitch, my skin cleared right up and I haven't had another breakout since. I still get pimples, but they are always small and not cysts. \n\nI no longer take the spiro because I don't feel that I need it, but my current routine includes the following:\n\n1. Cerave foaming cleanser wash stuff\n\n2. Cerave moisturizer in the tub\n\n3. Alpha hydrox oil-free formula (aha) - several times per week\n\n4. Epiduo (acne topical med prescribed by doctor) - several times per week\n\n5. Aztec clay mask, Queen Helene mint julep mask, and a few freeman's masks - 1-2 times per week\n\n6.

My skin has changed for the better by removing all processed food and sugar (this includes eating out), becoming gluten free, and removing all dairy products from my diet.

I also started taking more vitamins since I am vegan and it is hard to get all the necessary fatty acids and nutrients I was once getting from fish and meat. R-Lipoic Acid, EPA-DHA, evening primrose oil (great to help balance your hormones) and a multivitamin containing iron. I saw my skin change again in about 3 months. As far as OCM, I have been using sunflower oil which I read somewhere is good for acne prone/combination skin. \n\nNow, this might not work for you but it's important to look at all options when you're trying to clear up your skin.

Note that TJ's also sells an intensive moisturizer, which contains oil.\n\nIt's a watery lotion that is light yet moisturizing.  If I apply too much, it feels annoyingly wet on my skin for about a minute until it dries.  After that, it is perfectly comfortable.  Since it's summer here, I don't need a heavy moisturizer.  I really like this and would definitely buy it again.\n\n[Photos](https://imgur.com/a/6AvUUKs)\n\nPros:\n\n* Inexpensive at 6 oz for $6\n* Contains a bunch of different antioxidants\n* Lightweight\n* Fragrance-free\n\nCons:\n\n* Antioxidant concentration might be low.  Many are listed after the preservatives.  Not necessarily a bad thing, just unknown.\n* Clear container might let light in, which might make the antioxidants less effective\n* Pump might not be super sturdy?  I knocked mine off my counter and the pump came off.   I was not able to get it back on, so I had to transfer the lotion to another container.\n\n\nIngredients:  Water, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Ethylhexyl (Octyl) Palmitate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Polysorbate-60, Cetearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Cetearyl Glucoside, Sodium PCA, Ethylhexyglycerin (Preservative), Shea Butter Fruit, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E Acetate), Xanthan Gum (Thickener), Tocopherol (Antioxidant), Sorbic Acid (preservative), Soluble Collagen, Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5), Ascorbyl Palmitate (Vitamin C Palmitate), Pomegranate Extract, Ginkgo Biloba Extract, Coffea Arobica (Coffee) Seed, Chamomile Flower/Leaf Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sorbitan Stearate, Phytonadione (Vitamin K1), Menadione (Vitamin K3), Hydrolyzed Silk, DMAE (Dimethylaminoethanol), Copper PCA, Retinol (Vitamin A), Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A Palmitate), Ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q10),Thioctic Acid (Alpha-lipoic acid), Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3), Polysorbate-20, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Phospholipids\n\nPossible dupe?

The packaging and ingredients look similar enough.  The ingredients are not listed 100% the same, but it seems that it would at least be very similar.\n\nI hadn't seen a review on this moisturizer here before, so I thought I'd write one.

I trust Trader Joe’s and I know they do their research and would only use ingredients that are good for my skin and work. \n\nMy Trader Joe’s skin care routine:  Wash with the TJ’s All-In-One Cleanser. Apply the Hyaluronic Moisture Boost Serum followed by the Antioxidant Facial Serum. I finish with the Oil-Free Antioxidant Serum. \n\nA few side notes:  I keep a bottle of the All-In-One Cleanser in the shower and use it in place of soap. Soap is too drying to my skin and this leaves my skin feeling like silk. It also removes eye makeup and doesn’t burn my eyes because it’s tear-free. \nMy husband uses the Hyaluronic Moisture Boost as an after shave!",

    "body": "My foray into skincare began around July last year when I decided I wasn't happy with my skin and wanted to do something about it. Initially I researched foundations, but none of the products I tried evened my skin to my satisfaction, which is when I found /r/SkincareAddiction. Here, I learned that my skin was dehydrated, more than likely due to using Dove bar soap and BP on my face and zero moisturizer every day. :) My skin has changed so much since I started and I am finally ready to review some products I have been using and maybe help others find their way.  \n**Disclaimer** This is my first Reddit text post, I'm really hoping the formatting turns out the way I anticipated.  \n\n**Where we started:**  \n* 25/F/FL; combo/oily dehydrated skin with mild acne, some PIE, sporadic CCs and occasionally painful nodules usually on my forehead, chin, or temples. Noteworthy: I have been on oral contraceptives since I was a teenager and switched to Skyla in 2015. I don't believe my acne is hormonal, but since I've always had some sort of hormonal birth control it's hard to tell how much it has affected my skin.  \n\n\n* No real routine, just washing my face with bar soap in the (scalding hot) shower, using a Neutrogena BP mask to annihilate acne. I was under the (false) impression that since my face was oily I certainly wouldn't want to add moisturizer!  \n\n\n* Mostly concerned with the nodules I was getting because they were big and painful and took forever to heal. Admittedly, I am a skin picker and just recently I realized this is probably the cause of the nodules because the two that I have dealt with recently developed in spots that I had messed with just a few days before.  \n\n\n**Level one: Build a routine.**  \n* At this point, I read everything. EVERYTHING. I spent a couple of months just researching products, learning about skin types, and poring through threads on SCA. I put down the BP mask and bought Neutrogena foaming face wash and CeraVe PM. This was around September when Irma hit and I was without power for a few days, but still managed to keep my fledgling routine. \\o/\n\n* Unfortunately, I felt that CeraVe PM was contributing to a new outbreak of whiteheads around my mouth, where I don't normally get whiteheads. I wound up replacing it with Peach Slices Citrus Honey Aqua Glow which I LOVE. More on that later.\n\n* I also incorporated Neutrogena Sheer Touch sunscreen around this time, but that gave me small breakouts as well and I just didn't like the way that it sat on my skin so I decided to put sunscreen on hold while I did more research.\n\n* While incorporating these products into my routine I tried my best to follow SCA's advice and start slow, one product at a time, and patch test first. I don't really feel that patch testing helped me determine if a product would break me out, as I wouldn't notice any difference in the area I patch tested but then within a few days of trying a new product on my whole face I would see an increase in whiteheads in strange areas. It sucked, but it's alright since the breakouts were mild and didn't take long to appear so I knew fairly quickly that a product wasn't working for me. I still recommend patch testing for sensitivity purposes.\n\n**Level 2: Sunscreen and acids.**  \n* Finally, after months of reading, I felt ready to take on an acid. I settled on CosRX BHA Blackhead Power liquid because it was purportedly more mild (and less expensive!) than other options and I felt that I should start gentle. I picked this up from Ulta in early December and used it every three days for 4 weeks. During that period I don't feel like I had a purge; I kind of expected my acne to go into overdrive but it didn't really get any worse. After the 4 weeks I started using it MWF. \n\n* I also bought Skinfood's Aloe Watery Sun Water Gel from Amazon, but shipping took about a month so I was able to incorporate it well after the BHA.\n\n**Level 3: Skincare God.**  \n* *Just kidding.* So here we are in mid April and I have repurchased the Neutrogena cleanser once (although I switched to hydrating instead of foaming), Peach Slices moisturizer three (!!!) times, Skinfood sunscreen once, and am 1/3 of the way through the CosRX BHA. Let me tell you, I am SO much happier with my skin. \n\n* My skin is more bright and even and I have had much fewer blemishes than I used to, which I would attribute equally to a marked decrease in picking. Taking better care of my skin and working towards a goal makes it easier to keep myself from messing up my progress, although I still have setbacks during times when I am very stressed out, but I try not to let that discourage me.\n\n* Oil production WAS down, but a couple of weeks ago I tried to incorporate Cosrx Ultimate Moisturizing Honey Overnight Mask at night for added hydration, but it wound up drying me out? Additionally, I am running dangerously low on Peach Slices Moisturizer and could not find it at any of my local CVS locations so I have been rationing it while I wait for more to come in the mail. :'( \n\n* From here, I want to try to find a more hydrating cream for nighttime and an easily accessible drugstore sunscreen because currently it takes the Skinfood 2-4 weeks to come in so I have to make sure I order it in advance. I also REALLY want to try Krave Beauty Kale-lalu-yAHA, but I am waiting until I get back from vacation next month before I incorporate a new exfoliant. Finally, someone talk me out of buying something from the Dr Jart Cicapair line because I'm not quite sure what it's for but I really want it.\n\nI hope this will be helpful for those still figuring out what works for their skin, as I know I felt completely overwhelmed when I first started. I am still interested in experimenting with new products but I feel that I have a really solid routine as it is so I am content to wait until I am in a better situation financially to mix things up.\n\n**Current routine**  \nAM: splash with water  \nPeach Slices moisturizer  \nSkinfood sunscreen  \n\nPM: cleanse with Neutrogena  \nCosRX BHA MWF  \nPeach Slices moisturizer  \nSometimes a sheet mask when I'm feeling fancy (I really like Ariul Seven Days masks)  \nVaseline (not so much lately after I read a thread here about Vaseline potentially trapping bacteria if your face isn't cleansed properly)\n\n**Reviews**  \n* Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser: Not much to say here, but from what I have read that is good to say about a cleanser. It took a little time to get used to not having that tight, \"squeaky clean\" feeling that I got using the foaming cleanser, but ultimately I think this has been better for my skin. I have had my eye on Glossier's Milky Jelly cleanser for MONTHS but I can't bring myself to buy it when I am pretty satisfied with how this has been for my skin.\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Glucoside, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol*\n\n* Peach Slices Citrus Honey Aqua Glow: Light gel formula, sinks into my skin really well. I am still a bit oily toward the end of the day, but I have kind of resigned myself to the fact that that may not fully go away. Maybe when I start incorporating a more hydrating night cream it will help. Either way the slight oil doesn't bother me much and I really like this moisturizer.\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Polysorbate 60, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Honey Extract, Ceramide NP, Sorbitan Stearate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Isohexadecane, Tromethamine, Hydroxyacetophenone, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Polysorbate 80, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitan Oleate, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Oil, Disodium EDTA, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Butylene Glycol, Bixa Orellana Seed Oil, Tocopherol*\n\n* Skinfood Aloe Watery Sun Water Gel 50+ PA+++: Very happy with this sunscreen, although the oil control is hit or miss. Some days when I apply it after moisturizer it has a nice, almost powdery finish and I forget it's even there. Some days I'm more oily but I'm still figuring out what the cause of that might be. I don't wear foundation so I can't speak to how this sits under makeup but I do wear a little blush and I can still see it at the end of the day. When I apply it I pat it around my face and then rub it in, there is a slight white cast at first but for me it disappears very quickly, however, I am fair skinned.\n\n*Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Octyl Methoxycinnamate, Octyl Salicylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Peg/Ppg-10/1 Dimethicone, Lauryl Peg-9 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Stearalkonium Hectorite, Titanium Dioxide, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Propylene Carbonate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Fragrance, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Tocopherol*\n\n* CosRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid: I use three pumps MWF and occasionally a tiny amount to spot treat nodules. Overall I feel like it helps existing acne heal more quickly and keeps it from getting to that huge, inflammatory state. It applies and dries down very nicely and I typically wait 15-20 minutes after application to apply moisturizer. I didn't realize until recently that it has niacinamide, which I had thought didn't agree with my skin because it was also in CeraVe PM, but I think it has really helped lighten my PIE, particularly a spot on my forehead that I really went to town on last year and it was a pain in the ass to heal.\n\n*Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Water, Butylene Glycol, Betaine Salicylate, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Arginine, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol*\n\n**Links that I found helpful along the way**  \n[Try a gentle hydrating cleanser -- even if you have oily skin.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/7j6juf/psa_try_a_gentle_hydrating_cleanser_even_if_you/)\n\n[Routines which involve inadequate cleansing, high moisture, and heavy occlusion are risky...](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/86twai/psa_routines_which_involve_inadequate_cleansing/)",

Some of these are repeats and some were first time bought. Let me start with the repeats:\n\n**1) Minimalist Vitamin C + E + Ferulic Acid 16%**\n\n**💸Price:** Rs. 599/- for 20 ml. I got Minimalist Invisible Sunscreen SPF 40 free with it.\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Butylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Citrate, Citric Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Gluconate, Ferulic Acid, Coceth-7, Phenoxyethanol, PPG-1-PEG-9 Lauryl Glycol Ether, Fullerenes, Tocopherol Acetate, Ethylhexylglycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PVP, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n**🍶Packaging:** Dropper black bottle, comes with an extra carton\n\n**Fragrance:** None \n\nIf there's one product I've always raved about, it's this Vitamin C Serum. This has become my HG that I've purchased Multiple times now, and will probably repurchase in future. \n\nI love how it lasts longer and doesn't oxidise quickly compared to other Vitamin C Serums, and there's a no difference in my skin on its usage. It does a good job at lightening and fading acne spots and marks. The only other Vitamin C Serum I like is Cosrx 23%, but it's quite heavy on the pockets. \n\nI'm quite tempted to try out the Klairs and the Numbuzin one. Would appreciate the reviews if anyone has used them.\n\n**2) Formularx Hydrashied Vitamin C + Peptide Watery Gel Sunscreen SPF 50 PA ++++**\n\n**💸Price:** Rs. 699/- for 50 ml. It's frequently available on BOGO offers on their website.\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Vitamin C, Peptides, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin B5\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Octocrylene, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Titanium Dioxide, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ascorbic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate/VP Copolymer, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Gold, Disodium EDTA, Pentapeptide-4, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glutathione, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract\n\n**🍶Packaging:** Tube\n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\nThis is my second tube, and I love the texture. It's very lightweight, absorbs easily, no greasiness on the skin and yes, No whitecast. It also doesn't burn my eyes, like the Minimalist Invisible Sunscreen. I doubt it's waterproof, as the tube does state to reapply after exposure to water. Using this post snail mucin essence or a hyaluronic moisturizer gives a dewy look. \n\nAs far as protecting against sun exposure goes, I do cover my face with a dupatta when I leave home. I'd say there's a light tan on my face coz the summer heat is at its peak. Though labmuffin says that good sunscreen don't always prevent tan so I don't know what to say about that. \n\nAs far as the texture goes, it's Amazing, just don't expect miracles when it comes to sun protection.\n\n**3) Pyungkal Yul Calming Moisture  Barrier Cream**\n\n**💸 PRICE:** Rs. 1250/- for 50 ml. Frequently available on discounts at Maccaron\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Centella Asiatica, Ceramides\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Isohexadecane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Stearic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Glucoside, Pentylene Glycol, Trehalose, Ceramide NP, Arachidic Acid, Glucose, Palmitic Acid, Oleic Acid, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Squalane, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Hydroxyacetophenone, Butylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, Disodium EDTA, 1,2-Hexanediol, Tromethamine, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Packaging:** Tub\n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\nThis is a BOMB moisturizer. Having a combination skin with oily Tzone always meant trouble finding a good barrier repair cream. Most barrier repair moisturizer having ceramides have thicker textures that feel either too heavy or too greasy, or both, on the skin.\n\nNow I had just started Olay Retinol Serum, and was in need to a ceramide moisturizer to protect my skin barrier. I just randomly bought this on Maccaron when it was available on a great discount.\n\nAnd I've found my HG. It's so good, so lightweight, not at all heavy and soothing. I always end up with a pimple while trying ceramide cream but this one was so light it didn't feel greasy at all. \n\nI'm in love and this has definitely entered my list of future repurchase. \n\n**4) Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Essence Water**\n\n**💸Price:**  Rs. 1500/- for 150ml Available on discounts at multiple websites\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Ginseng, Niacinamide, Adenosine\n\n**Ingredients:** Panax Ginseng Root Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Propanediol, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Water, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glyceryl Glucoside, Panthenol, Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Adenosine, Dextrin, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Disodium Edta, Glucose, Panax Ginseng Callus Culture Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Panax Ginseng Berry Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Lactobacillus/Panax Ginseng Root Ferment Filtrate, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n**Claims:** Cruelty free, no artificial fragrance, colorants, mineral oil, parabens, sulfates.\n\nA cult favourite toner, how could I skip this? And here's my judgement, it's good to damp your skin and give a nice plump. Not ideal if you're looking for the glass skin effect. I think this is one of those products that don't give an immediate result, but when you use it consistently, you do feel your skin looks better. \n\nHaving said that, I don't think this would be a repurchase. It's good, but nothing that stood out. I'd rather experiment with multiple other toners available in the market. ",

I guess because it’s pure ascorbic acid it really does a good job on giving a subtle brightening glow and lightening some spots.\n\nAlso it is not very mild so when i started using it alone it gave me dry flaky skin.

The price is 18,600 won, which is about $15.50 USD. (If you're buying it in the US, the price will likely be a bit higher due to shipping costs). In addition to what's listed in the title, the serum contains 67% centella asiatica extract.\n\nThey don't state exactly how much panthenol is in the serum, but based on its position in the ingredients list, there must be between 1-5% in there.

The only thing that would make this better is if they included n-acetyl glucosamine to boost the niacinamide, but alas, we can't have everything.\n\nFull Ingredients: **Centella Asiatica Extract** (67%), Butylene Glycol, **Niacinamide** (50000ppm), Glycerin, Water, **Panthenol**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycereth-26, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, **Madecassoside** (10000ppm), **Asiaticoside** \\+ **Asiatic Acid** \\+ **Madecassic Acid** (10000ppm total), Citric Acid, **Sodium Hyaluronate**, **Polyglutamic Acid**, Methylpropanediol, **Hydrolyzed Algin**, **Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate**, **Allantoin**, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sorbitan Olivate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Arginine, Ethylhexylglycerin.",

    "body": "Here’s a comment I posted about Avant:\n\nAvant’s Deluxe Hyaluronic Acid Vivifying Face & Eye Night Cream (this was being sold in the FFF edit sale last week), we were suppose to get this last December for premium box but instead we got the Pro-Intense Hyaluronic Acid Illuminating Day Cream instead, it’s the same RV $134 and has equally crappy ingredients, I’ve seen hand creams/body creams with better/actual effective formulas.\n\nIngredients for the Avant Face & Eye Cream: aqua (water), Butyrospermum Parkii (shea) butter, glycerin (humectant) cetyl alcohol (texture enhancer, emollient), glyceryl stearate (emulsifying agent), dicaprylyl ether (emollient), propylheptyl caprylate (emollient), dimethicone (type of silicone occlusive), sodium hyaluronate (salt form of hyaluronic acid), niacinamide (Vitamin B3, excellent antioxidant has many beneficial properties), maris aqua (sea water, has more minerals than tap water), Prunus Amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil (emollient which contains lots of skin nourishing fatty acids), allantoin (skin soothing), tocopheryl acetate (vitamin e), peg-75 stearate (texture enhancer, emulsifier), ceteth-20 (texture enhancer), steareth-20 (emulsifier) propylene glycol (humectant, texture enhancers), disodium edta (too lazy to explain this one) sodium polyacrylate (thickening agent, texture enhancer), xanthan gum (thickening agent), lactic acid (when used at this kind of low concentration most likely it’s being used as a pH adjuster), parfum (fragrance), potassium sorbate (preservative), ethylhexylglycerin (preservatives) CI 15985 (orange dye) (FD&C Yellow No. 6), CI 17200 (red dye) (D&C Red No. 33).\n\nHere’s the ingredients for a $134 moisturizer.  It doesn’t take Einstein to figure out all the products from Avant are crap, even if this were $5 it would still be crap. There’s nothing wrong with the ingredients, its just the formulation and ingredients for the moisturizer isn’t worth more than $5, it has no high levels of any active ingredients/patented technology (almost all moisturizers at that price point has patents). If this were ingredients for a dollar store hand cream, then i would buy it, unfortunately it’s $134.  Avant products AREN’T EVEN WORTH the $12 Boxycharm add on/pop up price.\n\nLook at the ingredients for Acure Radically Rejuvenating Whipped Night Cream ($15.99 on iherb.com) \n\nWATER/AQUA/EAU, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CETEARYL OLIVATE, SORBITAN OLIVATE, SCLEROCARYA BIRREA (MARULA) SEED OIL, NYMPHAEA ALBA ROOT EXTRACT, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-1, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-2, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-1, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-9, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-11, COPPER PALMITOYL HEPTAPEPTIDE-14, HEPTAPEPTIDE-15 PALMITATE, PALMITOYL TETRAPEPTIDE-7, PALMITOYL TRIPEPTIDE-1 (PEPTIDE BLEND), FERULIC ACID, ASCORBIC GLUCOSIDE (VITAMIN C), COCONUT ALKANES, PSEUDOALTEROMONAS FERMENT EXTRACT (GLACIAL GLYCOPROTEINS), SALICYLIC ACID COCO-CAPRYLATE/CAPRATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ASPARTIC ACID, LINOLEIC ACID, LINOLENIC ACID, LECITHIN, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, LACTIC ACID/GLYCOLIC ACID COPOLYMER, CURCUMA LONGA (TURMERIC) ROOT EXTRACT, SYMPHYTUM OFFICINALE CALLUS CULTURE EXTRACT.\n\nBesides the fact that this has way more antioxidants/age prevention/hydrating ingredients.  This ingredients list for a $16 moisturizer might look familiar to some people because it’s like 95% the same as a certain Drunk Elephant Moisturizer(it’s just missing a few amino acids at the end of the ingredients list but all the important ingredients are exactly the same, even the peptides are the same).  Looks a thousand times better than all the crappy $130 Avant Moisturizers, and this is just one example, there’s CeraVe, Elf, tons of Korean brand moisturizers, all around or under $20. \n\nDECIEM’s hand cream $16 for 100ML\nAqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Propanediol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Copper Lysinate/Prolinate, Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Methylglucoside Phosphate, Proline, Alanine, Serine, Pseudoalteromonas Ferment Extract, Tremella Fuciformis Sporocarp Extract, Tocopherol, Betaine, Cellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Sodium Phosphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Parfum (Fragrance), Limonene, Linalool.\n\nThere’s copper peptide (the next big thing in anti aging), snow mushrooms, amino acids, algae ferment, and Plantago Lanceolata which can reduce dark spots, all this from a hand cream, people were using this as a facial moisturizer cos it’s that good. \n\nMoisturizers which are around $134\n\n- Guerlain’s Abeille Royale Creams (has patent on formulas and also the frigging jar the moisturizer comes in) \n\n* Sisley Black Rose Cream Mask (really this needs no introduction) \n\n* Charlotte Tilbury’s Night Cream\n\n* Dior Capture Totale Firming and Wrinkle Correcting Cream (Again patented formula, with a lot of research and clinical trials)\n\n* Lancer Skincare the Nourish (Dr. Lancer dermatologists for Hollywood Stars) \n\n* Fresh Creme Ancienne Moisturizer (Literally made by hand in a Monastery in Europe) \n\n* Chanel Le Lift Restorative Cream (clinical and in vitro testing, patented formula) \n\n* Caudalie Premium Cru Rich/Normal Cream (again patented formula, developed with Harvard Medical School) \n\n* If you check out CultBeauty the Eve Lom holiday set (the one with the Moisture Cream and cleanser (all full size) are basically the same RV as the stupid Avant moisturizer. \n\nThe list can go on forever, also Anti pollution micellar water from Chanel only costs $45. If you take a look at the ingredients for Avant’s Micellar Water it’s missing a very crucial ingredient that the majority of “high end/effective” micellar water contain, PEG-6 Caprylic/ Capric Glycerides.  Seriously this is not even worth $1. \nLastly someone from this subreddit did some research on this company, I think she concluded it was being used to launder money. But the fact that they’re selling you crap for $100+ is enough proof for me.\n\nNow the 111skin products we get from boxycharm or Ipsy are NOT the same as the ones sold in retail stores or 111skin’s online site.  The hydra gel moisturizer that came from Ipsy for example has a completely different ingredients list from the “real” moisturizer.\n\nIngredients from 111skin Cryo Activating Hydra Gel Ipsy version: \nAloe Barbadensis Gel, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Butylene Glycol, Isohexadecane, Dipropylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond / Amande Douce) Oil, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Betaine, Lecithin, Pyrus Malus (Apple / Pomme) Fruit Water, Allantoin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Hydroxyacetophenone, Trehalose, Propanediol, Glyceryl Caprylate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Aluminium Dicetyl Phosphate, BHT, Tetrasodium EDTA, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol, Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow / Achillée) Extract, Xanthan Gum, Menthol, Menthyl Lactate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Fragrance / Parfum, Limonene, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Linalool.\n\nIngredients from 111skin’s site for the Hydra Gel:\nAQUA / WATER / EAU, NELUMBO NUCIFERA (LOTUS) ROOT WATER, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, GLYCERIN, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND / AMANDE DOUCE) OIL, SODIUM ACRYLATES COPOLYMER, CARBOMER, TETRAHEXYLDECYL ASCORBATE, ETHYLHEXYL PALMITATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, BETAINE, LECITHIN, PROPANEDIOL, BENZYL ALCOHOL, HORDEUM VULGARE (BARLEY / ORGE) SEED EXTRACT, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PRUNUS PERSICA (PEACH / PÊCHE) JUICE, PYRUS MALUS (APPLE / POMME) JUICE, TRITICUM VULGARE (WHEAT / BLÉ) SEED EXTRACT, DISODIUM EDTA, PANAX GINSENG ROOT EXTRACT, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, TRIHYDROXYSTEARIN, ACHILLEA MILLEFOLIUM (YARROW / ACHILÉE) EXTRACT, SODIUM HYALURONATE, MENTHOL, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, ALOE VERA LEAF EXTRACT, GLYCERYL UNDECYLENATE, MENTHYL LACTATE, XANTHAN GUM, GLUCOMANNAN, FRAGRANCE / PARFUM, BENZYL SALICYLATE, LIMONENE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL.\n\nSee the difference? The Ipsy one although it advertises that it’s made with lotus water, there’s no lotus anything in the ingredients. It’s full of texture enhancers and solvents, IMO they were mainly trying to copy the “gel texture” of the real moisturizer.  The real moisturizer that’s $200 isn’t that much better. No expensive ingredients or actives....Check out the Rovectin Lotus Water Cream, made from 75% lotus flower extract (I’m assuming extracts holds a lot more nutrients than lotus root water), and it’s $20 but it goes on sale for $10, has similar light texture etc etc.  Usually the “made for beauty boxes 111skin products” will have “Made in China for 111skin” on the packaging. The real products use to be made in Bulgaria and now I think it’s made in UK, and some are made in the US.  Even if the ingredients line up like the 111skin vitamin c serum from Ipsy and the old formula of the vitamin c from 111skin’s site, the texture, colour, smell are completely different.  The real one had a serum like texture, transparent, had some kind of smell (I forgot the smell, I compared the products like a year ago).  The Ipsy version has the texture of water, yellow tint, no smell I think. Even the real products from 111skin are total ripoffs...what the hell does that say about the “fake” ones? \n\nTL:DR - both Avant and 111skin products are crap, 111skin sends out fakes to beauty boxes but even the real products are crap.  Avant is a sketchy company and their products aren’t even worth the $12 add on price.  It doesn’t matter if Avant’s website looks legitimate, every MLM website looks a thousand times more legitimate than Avant but it’s still a scam.",

    "body": "Hi all!  \n\n\nI am back with another skin conditions post. This one is on perioral dermatitis.   \n\n\nAdmittedly, when I began researching this, I knew zilch about PD except that it was acne-like breakouts around the mouth,  and as I began to research it, it seems that there isn't a whole lot that is known about it. Fortunately, it is a highly treatable condition that seems to overlap to a degree with rosacea (earning it the earlier name  of \"steroid rosacea\") and even seborrheic dermatitis.  \n\n\n**As always, please feel free to correct or inform me of anything wrong, and also feel free to post/discuss what helps your PD.**\n\n# What is Perioral Dermatitis\n\nPerioral dermatitis (PD) is a chronic, recurrant inflammatory disease that most commonly occurs in the perioral region of the face (the area around the mouth). It can also affect the area around the nose, and in roughly 20&#37; of cases, it can manifest around the eyes (though it goes by another name if around the eyes: peri-orificial dermatitis).   \n\n\nIt afflicts around 1&#37; of the population of the United States, particularly those with fair skin, and predominately occurs in women between 18-45, with 20s and 30s having peak incidence.   \n\n\nIt presents as small, red, tender, sometimes itchy bumps that can flake and burn. While commonly mistaken for acne, it is distinct from acne in that it only presents in specific locations, spares the small area around the lips, and lacks pustules (whiteheads).\n\n# Causes of Perioral Dermatitis\n\nThe causes of perioral dermatitis are unclear. It is a relatively \"young\" disease that was only first described as a distinct condition in 1964. It is first and foremost an inflammatory condition, and is aggravated by ingredients and habits that can create inflammation either in the skin or in the body. \n\nWhile I was researching PD, the one constant that showed up again and again is that it is aggravated by corticosteroid use -- both topical and inhaled. To specify, that means not just creams like kenalog, triamcinolone, and over-the-counter hydrocortisone, but also asthma inhalers (including Advair, Flovent, and ProAir aka Albuterol) and nasal allergy mists like Beconase, Flonase, Nasonex, Omnaris, and Veramyst. \n\nLess commonly, but still a factor to consider are hormones, where monthly shifts can put the condition into overdrive. More frustrating is that oral contraceptives can worsen PD in some. \n\nOther causes can be fluoridated toothpaste, high SPF value sunscreens¹, sunscreens with the filters zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, the ingredient \"isopropyl myristate,\" improperly removing makeup or sleeping in makeup, occlusive ointments (Vaseline, Aquaphor, and oils, for example), heavy creams with occlusive ingredients, and cold creams (wipe-off cleansing creams that leave a residue, like Pond's). In one case, a woman's favorite lip balm (containing the ingredient propyl gallate) caused her PD.⁶\n\n# Treatment\n\nPD can look like many other conditions, such as acne, angular cheilitis, rosacea, or seborrheic dermatitis, and requires treatment of a professional due to the inflammatory nature of the condition. \n\nThe most important thing for anyone suffering from PD is to discontinue steroid use - whether cold-turkey or weened off with the management of a healthcare professional. While topical steroids can seem to improve the condition, they frequently create a rebound effect, which can make the condition worse. \n\nOnce steroids are removed, the skin will get worse before getting better. This is the toughest part of PD for most people. Topical antibiotics or topical immunosuppresants (such as Pimecrolimus or Elidel) are frequently prescribed due to their tremendously  helpful anti-inflammatory effects on PD, and azelaic acid can prove useful in some cases. In very severe cases, oral antibiotics can be prescribed in addition to topicals. \n\nWhile healing from PD, the skin should not be cleansed with any cleanser, and makeup and skincare products should be avoided completely until the condition resolves. And no matter how tempting, PD should never be scrubbed, as this worsens the inflammation. \n\nOnce treated, it is encouraged to use liquid or gel sunscreens as well as soap-free cleansers that do not dry out the skin, as TEWL (trans-epidermal water loss) is significant in people who suffer from PD.\n\n# Long-Term Care\n\nSome people have PD once in their lives, while others may combat it on and off for several years. If you fall into the latter, it is important to try to avoid triggers that can cause the condition to reoccur (particularly steroid use). That means cleansing your skin each day with gentle cleansers, always removing makeup (removing it with a wipe does *NOT* count - you need to cleanse it away thoroughly with an oil cleanser that rinses cleanly), and using light products, particularly around the areas typically affected. \n\nPrescriptions like azelaic acid and over-the-counter .1&#37; adapalene (Differin)² may  also help to manage the condition in the long-term. \n\nI've put together a list below of some cleansers and moisturizers that are recommended for people suffering from PD.

        "body": "I’ve been diagnosed with Peri-orbital Dermatitis by my dermatologist. I’ve had it for at least 10 years. Peri-orbital means it presents around my eyes, nose and mouth. My worst flare ups cover all three areas, my most frequent flare ups present just around my nostrils. \n\nYes, you’re correct that causes are basically unknown. Successful treatments can vary wildly. \n\n(personally, I’m convinced it has a fungal element, specially related to candida imbalance. That’s just my opinion. I have used OTC topicalS and been prescribed anti-fungal topicals and pills, none of that worked. I believe it is related to gut microbiome health. Our skin is a direct reflection of what’s going on intrinsically in our bodies) \n\nI want chime in here about Zinc Oxide. You mention it as a possible cause. I want others out here to know that high concentration Zinc Oxide Cream is the ONLY thing that stops my flare ups. So if you have PD, I recommend patch testing a high ZO cream on one or two of the papules and see if it helps you. Incidentally, I’ve found recently that micronized ZO particles actually work faster for my than larger particles. So I stopped using Desitin Max strength and started using Neutrogena Sheer Zinc for face with 22% ZO. It stops my flare ups completely in a matter of a day or so, versus 4+ days with the Desitin. \n\nI’ll list below everything I’ve tried in case it’s helpful. The other product I find helpful is daily probiotic pills containing Lactobacillus Acidophilus. I get less flare ups when I take daily probiotics. \n\nDIDN’T WORK: \nAntibacterial Rx creams, I believe I had both Erythromycin and Dapsone. OTC antifungal creams, clotrimazole, miconazole and terbinafine. I also had an oral Rx for Lamisil, it was generic and I can’t recall the generic name. OTC topical steroids, hydrocortisone. Violet extract. Cutting out SLS from from my toothpaste and hair products. (I never cleansed with SLS, always either soap or oil) Changing my diet to an acne safe diet. Getting sun. Staying out of sun. Sulphur washes. Leaving it alone.",

I had no idea what perioral dermatitis was and assumed all this redness was broken capillaries from a Clarisonic. \n\nIt wasn’t until I went to a dermatologist and asked her about it that she said it looked like perioral dermatitis. I was prescribed Finacea and in one month the results have been astounding. Redness has significantly reduced and no closed comedones or inflamed pimples anywhere. Again mine wasn’t severe but for anyone who has it I think azelaic acid is a great choice. \n\nI should point out I never use steroids, I’m 30F and I think this was due to over moisturizing after over exfoliating. I also think the occlusive nature of aquaphor made it much worse. My routine now consists of nothing but cleanser, moisturizer and Finacea. Drastic change from what I was doing before. \n\nThank you for taking the time to post this very informative breakdown of perioral dermatitis.",

Currently hot and humid.\n\n**Reviews-**\n\nHello everyone. I have been planning on doing this comparative review for a really long time but was too lazy to write it all. Finally got the mental energy to sit and write it down.\n\nPlease do note that I tested these sunscreens in different seasons. I have used all of them for more than a month, though for some, the use has not been very regular because of the lockdown. Kindly factor that in however you may want to.**The review is strictly based on my personal experience- so ymmv, will differ for different people. Please do take it with a pinch of salt.**\n\n**1. Neutrogena Ultra sheer dry touch sunblock SPF 50**\\- This is the sunscreen I have used the longest amount of time for. Very budget friendly. Provides adequate protection. However earlier when I was not aware of the three finger rule, I would use the same quantity as I would with a moisturiser- it suited me and gave me a matte finish. However, when I began using the required amount, it dried my skin. Every time.  I no longer use it now. The consistency is a like a cream but it blends okay.Also since it is a chemical sunscreen, I have not faced any white cast issue with this.\n\nIngredients-[Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Homosalate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/homosalate), [Benzophenone-3](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/benzophenone-3), [Ethylhexyl Salicylate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-salicylate), [Octocrylene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/octocrylene), [Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyl-methoxydibenzoylmethane), [Silica](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/silica), [Styrene/​Acrylates Copolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/styrene-acrylates-copolymer), [Potassium Cetyl Phosphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-cetyl-phosphate), [Beeswax](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cera-alba), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Dimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone), [Caprylyl Methicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylyl-methicone), [Cetyl Dimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-dimethicone), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Sodium Polyacrylate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-polyacrylate), [Behenyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behenyl-alcohol), [Xanthan Gum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/xanthan-gum), [Chlorphenesin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/chlorphenesin), [Acrylates/​C12-22 Alkyl Methacrylate Copolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-c12-22-alkyl-methacrylate-copolymer), [Dimethicone/​PEG-10/​15 Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone-peg-10-15-crosspolymer), [Ethylhexyl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-stearate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Disodium EDTA](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [BHT](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Chlorhexidine Digluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/chlorhexidine-digluconate), [Ethylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylparaben), [Trideceth-6](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/trideceth-6), [Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/diethylhexyl-2-6-naphthalate)\n\n**Price and Availability**\\- Rs 650 for 88ml. easily available on e commerce sites like Nykaa, Amazon etc.\n\n**2. Innisfree Daily Mild Sunscreen SPF 50 PA ++++-** I got this last year during lockdown because this is the only budget friendly Korean sunscreen I knew of then. Really light lotion like texture and sits well on the face without piling. Gives a semi-dewy finish. However felt a little greasy on my face during humid season. Did it protect me adequately? I actually do not know because I wore it outside only a few times. I did not tan but the exposure to sun was not a lot so cannot be sure. Has a nice fragrance but when has that protected us from…anything. It has atleast three sunscreen filters and percentage is mentioned. But I am not sure if they are sufficient? No white cast with this either. I enjoyed using it except for the greasiness (which is not much but can still be felt).\n\n**Ingredients**\\-Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate 3.5%, Ethylhexyl Triazone 3.0%, Methylpropanediol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine 2.5%, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, Cetearyl Alcohol, C20-22 Alcohols, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Behenyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Tromethamine, Fragrance, Carbomer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polyisobutene, Saccharide Hydrolysate, Fructooligosaccharides, Ethylhexylglycerin, Pullulan, Caprylyl/​Capryl Glucoside, Sorbitan Oleate, Tocopherol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, C14-22 Alcohols, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Cetearyl Glucoside, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract\n\n**Price and availability**\\- Rs 700 for 50ml. Usually on discount so can be bought for around Rs 500 too. Can be purchased from Nykaa, Boddess, Amazon etc.\n\n**3. The Blessing Tree Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++-** Currently my HG. I have worn it a lot. Provides adequate protection. Has a lotion like texture but is thicker than the Innisfree one. Provides a demi matte finish. Does not feel greasy to me. Has a weird smell but that’s okay. It does not bother me much. Since it is a hybrid sunscreen, it does give a tiny amount, almost negligible white cast which settles down fast too. **WRP.**\n\n**Ingredients-** Octyl Methoxycinnamate, Oxybenzone, Titanium Dioxide, Octocrylene, Avobenzone, Zinc Oxide Lotion\n\nInactive Ingredients: Aqua, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Diisopropyl Adipate, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Propanediol, Diethylhexyl Syringylidenemalonate, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Niacinamide, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Perfume\n\n**Price and Availability**\\- Rs 249 for 100ml on Amazon.\n\n**4. Lóreal Paris Aqua Essence UV Perfect Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++-**  Can't speak enough about its amazing consistency and texture. So light and absorbs easily. Haven’t had the opportunity to wear it often since I bought it this year. The first time I wore it, it stung my eyes. The next time it did not sting my eyes but felt greasy because the weather was humid. I dont think the sunscreen is to be blamed for that. It’s major con (and everyone knows that) is the quantity for the price it is sold. No white cast. Might think of repurchasing but not sure about it.\n\nIngredients- Aqua, Alcohol Denat, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Isopropyl Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Propylene Glycol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Styrene/​Acrylates Copolymer, Glycerin, Drometrizole Trisiloxane, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Tocophérol Acétate, Phenoxyethanol, Stearic Acid, Adenosine, PEG-8 Laurate, Palmitic Acid, Ammonium Polyacryldimethyltauramide/​Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Limonene, Linalool, Benzyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Acrylates C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Geraniol, Disodium EDTA, Ceteth-10, Potassium Hydroxide, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Parfum/​Fragrance (F.I.L. C161957/​2)\n\n**Price and Availability-** Rs 515 for 30ml. Usually available on a discounted price of 400 something on Nykaa.\n\nVerdict- I will continue purchasing The Blessing Tree sunscreen. This sub introduced me to this budget friendly option and I am so grateful! The other sunscreens mentioned here are also good, never broke me out (my skin is not sensitive so maybe that’s why) so it totally depends on what you are looking for. I am anticipating queries about Oxybenzone and Co ‘s safety- please do read up on it. They are safe. The only issue with older chemical sunscreen filters is their instability. The newer ones are more stable so I’d definitely explore some of the newer filters in the future. **Other than that- it is more important to wear sunscreen, even if it offers very basic protection than to not wear sunscreen at all.** I hope this review will be helpful! Please ask away anything you would like to in the comments. I will try my best to answer them. (I will also post this under the sunscreen thread).",

    "body": "I have short wavy to curly hair that generally gets very frizzy. It is dry, with normal scalp. I have a lot (A LOT) of really thick hair. It is high porosity and takes hours to dry, even when chin lenght as it is now. The texture is very mixed, with some slightly wavy strands all the way up to kinky curly ones. I'd say most of it falls in category 2B.\n\n\nI have been wearing my hair curly and was getting fantastic results with a product by Rene Furterer, the Veloute Perfecteur de Boucles. It was a light, non greasy cream and I could use a fair amount of it without any adverse effects. Something in it really helps with curl formation, and all I had to do was put it into still rather wet hair, and let it dry. Perfect, consistent results every time. The hair was curly, light, perfectly hydrated.\n\n\nHere is the ingredient list:\n\n\n*Water, ethyhexyl palmitate, cetearyl alcohol, acanthus mollis leaf extract, amodimethicone, BHT, butylparaben, cetearyl glucoside, cetrimonium chloride, disodium EDTA, ethylparaben, fragrance (parfum), inulin lauryl carbamate, isobutylparaben, maltodextrin, methylparaben, persea gratissima (avocado) oil (persea gratissima oil), phenoxyethanol, polyquaternium-37, polyquaternium-68, propylparaben, trideceth-12.*\n\n\nA few months ago, they changed the line. Now the cream feels sticky and heavy, and although it still does promote curl formation (could be the acanthe extract, that is what the brand claims in their marketing), it makes my hair greasy and stringy and really just not nice. So, cue in another product hunt. Lots of money already into it, I'm not getting there... I now need a leave in, a defining curl cream and a gel to get lesser results, and I have to be so careful not to touch my hair under penalty of turning into a frizz ball.\n\n\nHere are the ingredients of the new, totally not improved product:\n\n\n*Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behenamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Acanthus Mollis Leaf Extract, Alpha Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, BHT, Butylphenyl, Methylpropional, Ceteareth-33, Citronellol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance (Parfum), Glycerin, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Hexyl Cinnamal, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Lactic Acid, Limonene, Linalool, Maltodextrin, Oenothera Biennis, (Evening Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Phenoxyethanol, Polyquaternium-68, Salicylic Acid, Sorbic Acid, Tocopherol, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Dissucinate.*\n\n\n**Is there anyone who is knowledgeable enough to take a look at the differences between old and new and maybe shed some light on how I can find another perfect product? My wallet and I thank you in advance.**",

    "body": "About me: 31/m with an oil slick for a face.\n\nI read somewhere that Sephora reformulated their moisturizer and it was a pretty good dupe for LaLa Retro. I have only tried Protini so I can't directly compare the two, but I recently started A-Passioni and wanted a heavier moisturizer for days so my face won't dry out. Previously I was using Clinique 72-hr moisture surge. \n\nIt is based on three types of oils:\n\n-Avocado Oil: Nourishes the skin.\n\n\n-Marula Oil: Repairs the skin.\n\n\n-Rose Hip Seed Oil: Softens the skin.\n\n\n\nIt received the \"clean\" rating at Sephora, which means it's free of sulfates SLS and SLES, parabens, formaldehydes, formaldehyde-releasing agents, phthalates, mineral oil, retinyl palmitate, oxybenzone, coal tar, hydroquinone, triclosan, and triclocarban, and contains less than one percent of synthetic fragrances. This product is also vegan, and comes in recycling packaging.\n\n**Full ingredients:**\n\n\nWater, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Isononyl Isononanoate, C10-18 Triglycerides, Decyl Oleate, Isostearyl Isostearate, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, Stearyl Heptanoate, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Glyceryl Stearate, Sorbitan Olivate, Stearyl Caprylate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Rosa Rubiginosa Seed Oil, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Squalane, Hydroxyacetophenone, Carbomer, Hydrogenated Rapeseed Oil, Fragrance, Tocopherol, Butylene Glycol, Gellan Gum, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, O-Cymen-5-Ol, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Polyacrylate, Polysorbate 60, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitan Isostearate, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid\n\n\n**Packaging:**\n\nIt unfortunately doesn't have innovative packaging as it comes in a twist-top jar. For $16 I'm not expecting much; the spatula I use for my YTTP night mask has been put to use in this jar instead of my fingers. \n[The jar](https://i.imgur.com/yCysZsGh.jpg)\n\n\n**Consistency:**\n\nThis is a whipped, thick cream. It absorbs nicely within 5 minutes or so. I'm not sure I'll be able to use this in the summer if it's warm without it making me sweat but it is definitely more hydrating than Clinique and doesn't create a film over my skin like 72hr moisture surge does, despite being a gel. A little goes a LONG way.  My skin feels very hydrated and plump. It does leave a slight shine just like any other moisturizing cream. I follow with a mattifying SPF and my skin looks absolutely great. \n\n**THE BAD:**\n\nIt has a scent. When I first opened it I actually gagged, it smelled like it had soured. However it comes sealed with a metallic lid like yogurt and part of the residual metallic scent was at the top. After using it, it smells like a cheap floral/rose scent. Strong enough it will definitely fill your nostrils but not so much that  anyone will smell it on you when you walk by, and the scent dissipates quickly. \n\nI don't have acne or breakout prone skin but this hasn't caused any issues for my skin whatsoever, and I haven't seen that mentioned in the reviews either. I will probably repurchase in the future until the next best thing, and save my money for better quality actives. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n",

    "body": "Day 4/7 this brand is underrated but their products work better than other brands I know of. So this brand is cruelty-free and vegan. It focuses more on sensitive skin, clean ingredients, hydration, and improving the skin Barrier in the long term. Any skin type can use the products and the main ingredient is the olive squalene and hyaluronic acid. They also use a blend of three different hyaluronic acid sizes (they have the smallest HA size for skincare in the world). If you've ever been to Sephora and saw that expensive and much-raved brand that uses squalene oil in everything, this is a cheaper alternative. The pH of everything is a 5.5. If you are looking for something for sensitive skin I'd think this is a good brand. \n\nDisclaimer: what worked for me might not work for you. I was gifted 3 of the products last year which got me interested in the entire line.\n\nEdit : some if the products have been reformulated so im not sure how it might impact the product. \n\nDual moist toning lotion 180ml:\n\nTo me, it's not worth it and there are definitely better hydrating toners worth your money. However, if every toner irritates you and you have dehydrated skin or just really sensitive skin you will like this. This is a good hypoallergenic hydrating basic toner. My friend has eczema and acne prone skin and loves this toner but now I got her wanting the pyunkang Yul's acne line. It's more viscous than water and dispensed well also comes sealed. \n\nIngredients - Water, Glycerin, Glycereth-26, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Arginine, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ceramide NP, Olea Europaea (Olive) Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Avena Sativa (Oat) Meal Extract, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Sodium Citrate, Disodium EDTA, Octyldodecanol, Dodecane, Isohexadecane, Isoeicosane, Octadecane, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Citric Acid, Tetradecane, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Linoleic Acid\n\n❤️Dual moist comfort cream 75ml:\n\nMy favourite daytime moisturiser works well in winter and summer it's perfect if your oil-water balance is out if wack. In the summer is adjust excessive sebum so I sweat less on my face but keeps me hydrated in the winter time. Feels like a gel, absorbs fairly quickly. It's a basic essential. Uses panthenol, madecassoside, and Allantoin to soothe, repair and strengthen skin. \n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth-10, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, Dimethicone, Squalane (Olive Squalane), Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Arginine, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Ceramide NP, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Butylene Glycol, Carbomer, Dimethiconol, Octyldodecanol, Dodecane, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Isohexadecane, Isoeicosane, Sorbitan Isostearate, Polysorbate 60, Octadecane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, PEG-20 Glyceryl Stearate, Potassium Hydroxide, Tetradecane, Disodium EDTA, PEG-100 Stearate, Polyglutamic Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Linoleic Acid\n\n❤️Dual moist hyaluronic Essence 100ml:\n\nclaims to rapidly hydrate even dry or sensitive skin without irritation. It does work. One if my favourite essences an alternative to the cosrx snail in terms of the hydrating effects your skin gets. If you are vegan and want the hydrating effects and healing effects of Centella Asiatica and vitamin E from tocopherol this could be great for you. My skin was soothed and cooled down, quickly. Absorbs fairly fast feels and hydrating on the skin. \n\nEdit: I repurchased this and didn't notice any actual change to the product still worked. I tried like putting drops of both on my face and I guess the new formula kept my skin more hydrated. But it still works the same but if you have an allergy to anything in the new formulation I'd pass. \n\nIngredients \n\nWater, Pentylene Glycol, Polyglycerin-3, Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Collagen, Madecassoside, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, C14-22 Alcohols, Xanthan Gum, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Gaultheria Procumbens (Wintergreen) Leaf Extract, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate\n\nUpdated formula:\nWater, PentyleneGlycol, Squalane, Polyglycerin-3, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Gardenia TahitensisFlower, Tocopherol, CamelliaSinensisLeaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita(Matricaria) FlowerExtract, CentellaAsiatica Extract, AloeBarbadensis LeafExtract, LavandulaAngustifolia (Lavender) Flower Extract, Glycerin,Cetearyl Olivate,Sorbitan Olivate, C14-22 Alcohols, Xanthan Gum, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside,PulsatillaKoreanaExtract, ZanthoxylumPiperitum Fruit Extract,UsneaBarbata(Lichen) Extract, Arginine, Gaultheria Procumbens(Wintergreen) Leaf Extract\n\nFluid oil 30ml:\n\nIf you have TO squalene oil I'll pass on this one they both have 100% organic squalene oil. This one is more cosmetically elegant but save $30 while you can if you are interested in squalene oil by itself. \n\nEmollient extra comfort cream 75ml\n\nContains panthenol too (D-panthenol contains vitamin B5) it feels sticky when applied. If your skin is dry or dehydrated or if you have combination skin but live in a dry climate you will enjoy this. It's a really heavy cream and I dislike the feeling since it takes a while to absorb but my skin doesn't feel hydrated. \n\nIngredients : \n\nWater, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Panthenol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glycerin, Squalane(Olive Squalane), Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Arginine, Ceramide NP, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Carbomer, Octyldodecanol, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Wax, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Dodecane, Isohexadecane, Isoeicosane, Octadecane, Tetradecane, Dimethicone, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Disodium EDTA, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Butylene Glycol, Glucose, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Linoleic Acid\n\nNew formulation - Water, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Panthenol, Pentylene Glycol, Squalane, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate,Cetearyl Olivate, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Canola Oil, Xanthan Gum, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Gaultheria Procumbens (Wintergreen) Leaf Extract\n\nEmollient cleansing bar\n\nDoesn't contain any harsh sulfates or anything but I don't like cleansing bars in general. Good for body and face and it won't dry your skin out if you have oily - combo skin. Honestly, there are so many better cleansing gels/milks/foams that I think work better than this bar. It's cleansing properties are abysmal at best and it struggles to remove even the minimal makeup I wear occasionally. My friend hated this too and pointed out to me that looks like it can easily get bacteria on the product. \n\nIngredients:\n\nTriticum Vulgare Wheat Starch, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Potassium Lauryl Sulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Aqua, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Avocado Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Calophyllum Inophyllum, Olea Europaea, Squalidae, Sodium Hyaluronate, D-Panthenol, Tocopherol Acetate, Glycerin, Spinacia Olearacea Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Sapindus Trifoliatus, Apium Graveolens (Celery) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Spinacia Oleracea L., Chorella, Allantoin, Olive Butter\n\nI think they are. Trying to do something cool with their brand but because what they focus on are pretty basic stuff not all people may like it. I think the dual moist comfort cream is a great moisturiser for any skin type and the essence and toner are good items. However, by making products like the cleansing bar or their clay mask (which you can't purchase anywhere anymore)... By only using this brand in my routine my skin looked dull despite being hydrated. My friend who tried some of the products with me saw her skin Barrier become healthier over the next few months and her sensitivity to products decreased slightly. Anybody with a sensitive skin type or dehydrated - dry skin would enjoy trying some of the line. You can get the brand on stylekorean.com, yesstyle, roseroseshop, or ohholly\n\nHope this was helpful i feel like it was kind of a messy review 😅\n\nEdit: It remind me of the ordinary because of the reformulation changes and how they use olive squalene (squalene derived from olives) instead of shark squalene to make it cruelty free.

    "body": "Hey all! I see a bunch of comments on here of people looking for hydrating mineral sunscreens, so I figured I'd type up a full review of one of my favorites: **Kinship Self-Reflect Probiotic Moisturizing Sunscreen** (SPF 32). This is an all Zinc-Oxide, non-nano, mineral sunscreen with a creamy silicone-free base that is lightly tinted and gives a dewy, slightly shimmery (NOT GLITTERY) finish. It's very hydrating and soothing, which is a bit unusual for a zinc sunscreen.\n\n**Filters & SPF:** 22.4% Non-Nano Zinc Oxide SPF 32\n\n**Full (inactive) Ingredients:** Water (Aqua), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Coconut Alkanes, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice\\*, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Coco-Glucoside, Lactobacillus Ferment, Rubus Idaeus (Red Raspberry) Seed Oil\\*, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Liquid Endosperm, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Rhizomes Oil\\*, Butyrospermum Parkii Nut Extract, Hydrolyzed Jojoba Esters, Tocopherol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Vanilla Planifolia Fruit Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Butylene Glycol, Isostearic Acid, Lecithin, Polyglyceryl-3 Polyricinoleate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Sclerotium Gum, Cetearyl Glucoside, Ethylhexylglycerin, Xanthan Gum, Octyldodecanol, Tapioca Starch, Citric Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, May contain +/- Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI 77492)\n\n**Ingredient Callouts:** Silicone Free, Alcohol-free (contains fatty alcohols), fragrance free (does use Vanilla Planiforia Fruit Extract for scent), Vegan, Cruelty-Free, Reef-Safe (but not waterproof)\n\n**Price & Where to buy:** $25 USD for 50g, Online, direct from Kinship\n\n**About my skin/climate:** I'm 23 and have Rosacea (both generalized Erythema and papules) with very dry skin. I live in a sunny but not warm climate with a fair amount of humidity. I have extremely sensitive skin and can only tolerate mineral filters. Fitzpatrick III (but pale because Rosacea). \n\n**What it looks like on:** [**https://imgur.com/a/l2abDtE**](https://imgur.com/a/l2abDtE)\n\nIt's very hydrating and gives a nice dewy finish. This gives a mild blurring effect and does help disguise my redness. It has a slight shimmer to it, but it's not glittery. The tint is fair, and cool/pink toned. When you initially rub it in, it has a white cast but it settles to match my skin fairly well. If you're darker, the color of the tint and the white cast from a high % Zinc may become a problem. Even on me, I do get some flashback with this one. I would say it's better than most high Zinc non-nano sunscreens. \n\n**Texture/Smell**\n\nThis is a thick, creamy base. It takes a while to dry down and can remain a bit sticky to the touch. I don't find that it transfers, but my hair does occasionally get stuck in it when it's fresh. You do have to rub this is, with the thick consistency it's not one that you can just spread and leave (without looking like a ghost). It doesn't feel too heavy on the skin. \n\nAs far as smell goes, it's actually quite unusual. This one smells completely like Vanilla Cupcakes (though it dissipates fast). I was initially super skeptical of this because I don't like scented products, but I haven't had any irritation from the Vanillin from which the scent derives. I'm generally very, very sensitive to fragrances and it looks like research has it as generally non-irritating, but as always YMMV with these sort of plant extracts. \n\n**Packaging:** Sort of standard tube with plastic twist-off lid. I wish they sold it in larger quantities. It is made of 30% post-consumer materials and they have a recycling program if that's important to you. \n\n**Overall**\n\nThis is a staple of my rotation and one I'm likely to repurchase because of how hydrating and soothing it is and the high zinc percentage. It does have a lot of plant extracts, which could be irritating if you're sensitive to them (always patch-test). On me there's very minimal white-cast and I really like the finish. I think this would be best on dry to normal skin because of how hydrating the product is. I've had no issues with the sun protection (haven't gotten any burns, noticeable new sun-spots, or Rosacea flairs while wearing this). I'd like to see a higher SPF, but honestly there are limits when it comes to an all-mineral formula. It's not waterproof, but doesn't move around a lot if I sweat. \n\n**Other Zinc sunscreens I've reviewed:** [Versed Guards Up Daily Mineral Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/gpzvwy/review_sun_care_versed_guards_up_daily_mineral/)",

And this is the second time I’m purchasing it. \nI have sensitive skin and this one doesn’t sting ( even thought there’s perfume in it ? .. ) most of the time I take Korean sunscreen like Skin1004 centella sunscreen because this one is very oily and it peels a lot one the skin :( but for a summer sunscreen it’s cool 👌\n\nIngredients : Aqua (water), dicaprylyl carbonate, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate, propanediol, decyl oleate, coco-caprylate/caprate, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine, phenylbenzimidazole sulfonic acid, prunus armeniaca (apricot) kernel oil, ethylhexyl triazone, lactobacillus ferment, cetearyl glucoside, lactobacillus, potassium cetyl phosphate, triacontanyl pvp, parfum (fragrance), tocopherol, cocos nucifera (coconut) fruit extract, aloe barbadensis leaf juice powder, avena sativa (oat) kernel extract, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, glycerin, hydrogenated vegetable glycerides citrate, xanthan gum, sorbitan olivate, ethylhexylglycerin, sodium hydroxide, panthenol, cetearyl alcohol, maltodextrin, citric acid.\n\n—\n\nAnd finally, some peoples said that :\n\nLa Roche posay Cicaplast B5+ balm \n\nWas nice for sunburn, ( brought for 10,99€ ) I will not lie I wanted to buy this balm before not for sunburn but because I swim a lot and being in contact with chlorine too much can be irritating sometimes so I wanted to try it, don’t know if the aloe Vera gel would be better or not but I will try and see if one is better than the other for me. \n\nIngredients : Aqua/ water/ eau, hydrogenated polyisobutene, dimethicone, glycerin, Butyrospermum parkii butter/ shea butter, panthenol, Zea mays starch/ corn starch, propanediol, butylene glycol, cetyl PEG/ PPG-10/ 1 dimethicone, trihydroxystearin, Centella asiatica leaf extract, Polymnia sonchifolia root juice, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, manganese gluconate, alpha-glucan oligosaccharide, silica, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium sulfate, mannose, capryloyl glyc,, caprylyl glycol, vitreoscilla ferment, citric acid, trisodium ethylenediamine disuccinate, lactobacillus, acetylated glycol stearate, maltodextrin, polyglyceryl-4 isostearate, tocopherol, pentaerythrityl tetra-di-t-butyl hydroxyhydrocinnamate, CI 77891/ titanium dioxide",

I bought this in the hopes of soothing my skin, improving overall redness, and reducing the chances of acne appearing.  I LOVE a good hydrating toner, so away we go.\n\nIngredients: \nCamellia Sinensis Leaf Water (50%), Aqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Camellia Sinensis Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Root Extract, Punica Granatum Fruit Extract, Tocopherol, Betaine, Arginine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\nTexture:  Very watery.  This is probably very similar to what it would be like to put cold green tea on the skin.  It sinks it very quickly, especially if your skin is thirsty like mine. \n\nThe first two weeks I was having a great time!  I slotting in this product before my standard hydrating toner (Klairs Unscented), so it was acting like an FTE going directly onto clean skin, morning and evening.  It sank in immediately and everything going well.\n\nThen, around week 3 my face started getting dry and no biggie, just some weather changes.  Let's pile on the hydrating layers!  So I upped things to 2 or 3 of the Benton and 2 or 3 of the Klairs.  However while it seems like dehydration was taken care of, my face *craved* oil.  My rosehip seed oil started getting sucked in right quick.  Small bits of acne started to appear as is normal for me when my skin gets dry.\n\nYou see, **I had completely forgotten green tea regulates sebum production**.  And sebum regulation is exactly what I DO NOT need.\n\nSo!  Once I realize my error (2 weeks later), I dropped out the Benton and my face went back to normal.\n\nRecommendation:  This has been one of the few times where I have seen such noticeable impact of a product on the daily functioning of my skin.  While not for me, if you are looking to reduce sebum production I would recommend the Benton Deep Green Tea Toner without hesitation.  It is cosmetically elegant, minimal potential irritants, a straight-forward addition to a routine, and affordable.\n\nApologies for the clickbait title.  It was an interesting product to try and interesting skin adventure!  Cheers!",

I barely saw any reviews about this so I always held off on buying it.\n\nI'm sorry it didn't work for you, but this sounds like something my skin would like.  I'm oily as hell and no matter how many hydrating products I use, I'm still oily so I'm sure it isn't a dehydration related issue.

It's really soothing and my eye area gets red consistently especially when I wake up and I noticed the redness has toned down alot. Also, I've had a bump (from irritation) on my left eye recently (my dog passed away a month ago and it developed from crying alot) on top of my usual redness and it's helped tone it down really well. If I want to keep using an eye cream I most definitely will repurchase it because it's the only eye cream I've felt actually do anything for me. Plus the packaging is one of the best packaging I've ever seen of any product. It comes in this tin case that matches the black packaging of the actual tube. The product and tin is holographic words and drawings on black, it shines beautifully in the light. I absolutely did not throw it away, I took the styrofoam out, which was really quality black styrofoam too, and will probably use it for some stationary storaging.",

I also noticed the Honeysuckle extract is now at the bottom, and Ceramide NP is a bit lower on the list. The Ethylhexyl palmitate scares me a bit since it may be comedogenic (but I don't take these lists seriously anymore, canola oil is a 5 on the scale and doesn't break me out, whereas jojoba oil is 0-2 but it breaks me out). \n\nSo yeah I was just asking if anyone has used both versions and if the new one is as good as the old one.

Only thing that worked for me were steroids but ofc that’s not sustainable or healthy long term.\n\nAnyway it’s 60 bucks, I linked it below the ingredients list if you want it, it’s called Cade revitalizing cream. \n\nIngredients list, I have no clue why it would work for me but it does:\n\nAQUA/WATER - GLYCERIN - CETYL ALCOHOL - DICAPRYLYL ETHER - CETEARYL ALCOHOL - CETYL PALMITATE - BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII (SHEA) BUTTER - CORN STARCH MODIFIED - MYRISTYL ALCOHOL - OCTYLDODECYL MYRISTATE - JUNIPERUS OXYCEDRUS WOOD OIL - ROSMARINUS OFFICINALIS (ROSEMARY) LEAF OIL - FAGUS SYLVATICA BUD EXTRACT - HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL - HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED EXTRACT - CETEARYL GLUCOSIDE - MYRISTYL GLUCOSIDE - CARBOMER - METHYLPROPANEDIOL - OCTYLDODECANOL - GLYCOGEN - GLYCERIN - ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN - BISABOLOL - PROPYLENE GLYCOL - SODIUM HYDROXIDE - TOCOPHEROL - XANTHAN GUM - HYDROGENATED COCO-GLYCERIDES - HYALURONIC ACID - BACILLUS FERMENT - METHYLSILANOL MANNURONATE - TOCOPHERYL ACETATE - TOCOPHEROL - CHLORPHENESIN - POTASSIUM SORBATE - BENZOIC ACID - PARFUM/FRAGRANCE - BENZYL ALCOHOL - HEXYL CINNAMAL - LIMONENE - ALPHA-ISOMETHYL IONONE - CITRAL - LINALOOL.\n\nLink: https://www.loccitane.com/en-us/cade-revitalizing-cream-20HR050H20.html\n\nTLDR: link above is cream that reduced my facial symptoms 90%+",

I have a preference for high-end skincare because in my experience, they tend to have higher quality ingredients. But, I'm open to all as long as it is a good gentle cleanser that meets all my requirements.\n\nI need a gentle cleanser does NOT  have any of these ingredients\\_Fragrance, perfume, [Cocamidopropyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), -Coco, Decyl, Lauryl, or Cetearyl Glucoside- Olefin Sulfonate, Essential oils, Plant extracts, alcohol dent., or any drying alcohol. And, based on my personal preference I do NOT want any Parabens or micro plastics e.g. acrylates copolymer and similar, in my cleanser.\n\nBecause my skin is sensitive and because one of my Dermatologist lectured me and being careful with ingredients and not going with the marketing statements, I'm very careful and research each ingredient in any product. Anyone here also careful with the ingredients in their skincare products?\n\nI also wish Reddit were more transparent. I know many people recommend products because they  work for the brand, make money by posting, or trying to make $ in any other way. So it makes it tricky and time consuming to know who is really into Skin care, sharing their experiences, and making rec without the bias of financial interest and the ones who are not. Having a financial incentive and posting to help has its place and it's also helpful as long as it's transparent. Otherwise, it feels deceiving. ",

I have highly reactive, sensitive, rosacea, and combo/dry skin. \n\n\n\nI like my glycerin-based cleansers. Prequel, Dieux, and Augustinus Bader have those cleansers which are popular and range from cheap to pricey. Also, water-free is Retrouve cleansing elixir. ISClinical has popular mid-range cleansers. Cetaphil gentle cleanser is also a decent sensitive-skin friendly one that I didn't find to be stripping. I found vanicream to be too stripping long-term. Many Cerave has SA or HA which I don't like/can't use. \n\n\nAs others have said I wish I was paid to post. My wallet wouldn't be crying as much as it does. I tried querying your prompt into chatGPT but even it got janky with the list of ingredients. There is a reason that things like preservatives and alcohols are in your skincare products - to help preserve (and save you money from trashing products that go bad in a week from opening) as well as cosmetic elegance so you aren't stuck with a pudding product that never settles down (that's what many alcohols do). I think you may need to make a list of high priority and then flexible ingredients you might be willing to bend. I too try to avoid heavy citrus-based ingredient stacks and excessive essential oils however I would never be able to get anything at all if I wasn't flexible about them. I have a list of a few ingredients (including HA and its derivatives) that are a hard no so I know how frustrating it can be. Trial and error have been my journey tbh.",

You want strong UVA protection.  That's going to be your #1 defense against wrinkles.\n\nNiacinamide could be an easy thing to add to your routine.  It's in CeraVe PM (if you want to switch from the Trader Joe's one) or The Ordinary sells a 10% niacinamide serum.\n\nYou could also switch the retinol to tretinoin (the prescription strength version).  My sebaceous filaments went away with tretinoin, plus it's the gold standard for anti-aging.   You can get plain tretinoin from a doctor, or a compounded tretinoin cream with 4% niacinamide from Yoderm or Curology.\n\nSounds like you're off to a good start though!",

    "body": "Hi all—\n\nI’ve been using this really lovely face cream from Ghost Democracy [Cocoon Replenishing Ceramide Rich Cream](https://www.ghostdemocracy.com/products/cocoon-replenishing-ceramide-rich-cream) and have about half of these ingredients and the product page list %s of the main ingredients. I’vemade my own face lotion formulations before so would love to try to recreate this on my own, but do not know what’s safe to substitute or how much, so if you like puzzles, join me! \n\nHere’s the %ages:\n\n2.2% Ceramide Blend\n\n17.0% Lipid Blend (assuming this includes Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, squalane, Murumuru Seed Butter, Cocoglycerides, and maybe the alcohols?)\n\n2.9% Squalane\n\n1.0% Oat Seed Extract\n\n\nList of ingredients: \n\nWater\n\nCoco-Caprylate/Caprate\n\nSqualane\n\nArachidyl Alcohol\n\nBehenyl Alcohol\n\nArachidyl Glucoside\n\nCeramide NP, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol\n\nSodium Lauroyl Lactylate\n\nCarbomer\n\nXanthan Gum\n\nPropanediol\n\nGlycerin\n\nAstrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter\n\nCetearyl Alcohol\n\nCetearyl Glucoside\n\nLauryl Laurate\n\nCetearyl Ethylhexanoate \n\nAvena Sativa (Oat) Seed Extract\n\nBetaine\n\nBehenyl Behenate\n\nTribehenin\n\nCocoglycerides\n\nHydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer\n\nPolyacrylate Crosspolymer-6\n\nTetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate\n\nPhenoxyethanol\n\nEthylhexylglycerin\n\nCitric Acid\n\nThe first two alcohols are waxy, emulsifying and emollient. Not sure what to sub for those. \n\nWondering if I can just use coco glucoside for the Glucosides listed here? Or any other suitable surfactant? But why’s there a surfactant in a cream?\n\nCetearyl Ethylhexanoate is for slip and protecting from moisture loss so something like C12–15 Alkyl Benzoate? \n\nBehenyl Behenate is a wax like ester with occlusive properties. Not sure what to sub there\n\nTribehenin is glycerine based and helps reduce water loss. Maybe just more propanadiol and/or glycerine?\n\nHydroxyethyl Acrylate / Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer I can get at lotioncrafter, it’s a gelling agent skin conditioner, but if anyone knows a more common substitution, lemme know!\n\nAssuming I could use something like Liquid Germall plus for the preservatives. \n\nThoughts? Doable or pipe dream?",

        "body": "Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol and Arachidyl Glucoside is Montanov 202. It's one of my absolute favorites and I'm willing to bet plays a huge role in the application and performance of this cream. It's a liquid crystal emulsifier, which means it actively moisturizes the skin, and may also play a role in enhancing penetration of other ingredients. It's available through Lotioncrafter and Formulator Sample Shop. I highly recommend getting this.\n\nC12-15 Alkyl Benzoate sounds like a good switch. Or you can probably use more Coco Caprylate Caprate if you have it. I love CCC.\n\nMore Lauryl Laurate might work in place of of Behenyl Behenate, or you can try Behenyl Alcohol, Cetyl Esters or Oliwax LC (Cetyl Palmitate, Sorbitan Palmitate, Sorbitan Olivate.)\n\nI think you need a polymeric thickener, even if you don't use the exact one they used (Sepinov EMT-Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acriloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer.)\n\nPolymeric thickeners not only dramatically increase stability, they create very very elegant products when used alongside nonionic emulsifiers (like Montanov 202.)\n\nMy favorite polymeric thickener is Aristoflex AVC, also available through Lotioncrafter and cheaper than Sepinov EMT.\n\nI've seen people switch out polymeric thickeners for Xanthan Gum (both polymeric thickeners and Xanthan Gum are water gelling agents, hence the increased stability with both,) but I don't think Xanthan Gum compares. At all. \n\nI also love Sodium Carbomer, another polymeric thickener. \n\nYou have to be careful with polymerics because many are electrolyte intolerant. So usually you can't use things like Aloe Vera, hydrolyzed proteins, etc. Sepimov EMT is slightly more electrolyte tolerant than Aristoflex AVC.\n\nMore Propanediol sounds great, personally I love it, find it very effective and much more elegant than Glycerin.\n\nI would skip the surfactant completely.",

However, I still had difficulty finding skin care products that wouldn’t irritate my skin - so much so, that I did another round of patch testing last year, with an expanded set of allergens I wasn’t tested for the first time, and found out I was allergic to a lot of other stuff (and am still allergic to the overlapping allergens tested on both rounds). Since then, I’ve been going through the painstaking process of testing things again and I actually have been able to find some things I can use!

I agitate to bottle to make it foamy before applying.\n\nThere is also a [balm available in the same line](http://www.aveneusa.com/skin-care/all-products/xeracalm-lipid-replenishing-balm). I’ve had a sample, which I tried a bit, but didn’t know what it did different from the creme.\n\nThese products are available in North America online. In Europe though they are common to find in drugstores, and they’re about 20-30% cheaper.\n\nIn the past I have used this company’s [thermal water](http://www.aveneusa.com/avene-thermal-spring-water). It was very soothing on my skin *when my skin was normal.* When it’s irritated it doesn’t help. I get more out of just using brewed green tea as a toner. \n\nI think this is because, as I’ve understood it, eczema makes it difficult for the skin to keep the ph/normalize the ph to 5.5. (This is the [acid mantle](http://www.justaboutskin.com/skin-ph-acid-mantle/), which apparently protects against infection. Groin and armpit are exceptions, they’re at 6.5) People likely get a lot of help out of apple cider vinegar because of the acidic ph.\n\nThe thermal waters are in the neutral 7.0-7.5 range. \n\nIn Europe manufacturers are more likely to note the ph: in fact [Eucerin has a whole range of products with a ph of 5](https://int.eucerin.com/products/sensitive-skin), which are difficult to find in North America. [Sebamed](https://www.sebamedusa.com/) also indicates their products have a 5.5 ph. \n\nI’ve seen posts encouraging eczema sufferers use litmus strips to test the ph of the products they use. \n\nThis Avene product implies it’s got a 5.5 ph. \n____________\nThe manufacturer claims it has three features (copy from website):\n\nPatented I-Modulia® is a powerful complex derived from Avène Thermal Spring Water that calms itching sensations and irritation while helping to support the skin's defense system\n\nCer-Omega, derived from evening primrose and rich in omega-6 and ceramides, provides exceptional hydration and helps restore the skin's epidermal barrier\n\nAvène Thermal Spring Water ensures tolerance and provides soothing, softening and calming properties\n_____________\nOn a special note is the cap: essentially the product dispenses through a valve. I believe this means that the product is in a sterile balloon which means that there are no added preservatives. \n\nA few notes about that:\n\n*eczema sufferers probably have to take preservatives more seriously. A dose of a paraben or phenyloxyethanol which would be fine on normal skin may be quite irritating on eczema.\n\n*eczema sufferers are probably more sensitive if the product goes bad (because the product has become old.) I would think the valve may keep it fresher longer.\n\n*eczema sufferers are probably more sensitive if the product goes bad (because of contamination.) I’ve come to understand [that excess Staphylococcus aureus](http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/9/378/eaah4680) may trigger eczema, as well as the yeast [Malassezia sympodialis](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/238227.php) [another article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4484996/). Obviously our skin is sensitive to minor contaminations. \n\n*eczema sufferers who are infected with the above may pass that back into the product. I think the valve would help prevent this.\n\nHere are the ingredients:\n\nAVÈNE THERMAL SPRING WATER, GLYCERIN, MINERAL OIL, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, OENOTHERA BIENNIS OIL, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETEARYL GLUCOSIDE, AQUAPHILUS DOLOMIAE EXTRACT, ARGININE, CARBOMER, EVENING PRIMROSE OIL/PALM OIL AMINOPROPANEDIOL ESTERS, GLYCINE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TOCOPHEROL, WATER.\n\nWhat I found is approximately Avene’s claims: reduces itchiness and does a **excellent** job at bringing back the lipid layer. It's given me a lot more confidence in regards to attractiveness. Sometimes, I need to apply it more than twice a day, particular on the parts of my face with facial hair or during flare-ups, which are, with this product, much less severe and don’t last as long.\n\nAs a side note, a few other things I’m doing/trying:\n\n*during a flare period, I’ll use a prescription steroid. \n\n*increased Omega 3 supplementation\n\n*increased vitamin D\n\n*chlorella/spirulina tablets (associated with [detoxification](https://examine.com/supplements/chlorella/))\n\n*kombucha from time to time. helps with intestinal flora as well as a bit of acidity, like drinking ACV \n\n*I have been using an anti fungal just to see if a fungal infection is playing a role in the dermatitis. I believe it might be. I’ve been relatively flare free for some time now.\n\n*to deal with scalp flaking and itchiness, [Ducray Kelual DS shampoo.](https://www.ducray.com/en-gb/node/66916) I have found that scalp flare-ups lead to face flare-ups, and vice versa.",

        "body": "oh yes! i tried the [whole Goodness series.](http://www.goodnessproducts.com/shop/products/grab+%26+go+goodness+try-me+kit/x_sku/01388.html) I bought a starter kit and tried 5 products\n\n* **every day cream cleanser**\n * a lil too mild for my liking. good for sensitive skin. good to use in the morning, but a lil too gentle for night time, for my double cleanse.\n\n* **every week face scrub**\n * Gentle Scrub with lovely scent\n * All the goodness product has a similar scent and i love the entire range so far.\nThis scrub is gentle. It may not suit those we want to exfoliate more aggressively.\nIt's gentle enough to use every other day.\n\n * The powered pumice in the scrub are a good size, doesn't scratch and not rough at all.\nIf there were a higher concentration of the powered pumice it would be perfect.\n\n * There is no \"soap\" in this scrub, so you will have to add a step prior to scrubbing.\n * this is my least fave of the series.\n\n\n* **certified organic chia seed oil**\n\n * Non Greasy Facial Chia Seed Oil, great for hydration.\n * I always had oily skin from young and would stay away from oil based products. As I age, my sebaceous glands is drying up and i find myself with dry skin especially in Australia's weather. I initially bought the trial pack at Chemist Warehouse on sale for the cute little 5ml bottle.\n * Goodness Chia Seed Oil was so good that i went back to buy 3 full sized bottleThe Chia Seed oil is one of the least greasiest oil I had ever tried. Less greasy than argan and rose hip oils. It's not too oily to use even during the day.\n * I used it under my eyes where there were some fine lines and chia seed oil dimished the lines overnight. amazing.\n * I like the smell too. It's one of my HG now and i would have one handy always.\n * Tips: Use to plump up fine lines. Great for hydration. Replace your moisturiser for this!\n\n* **every morning moisturiser**\n\n * I tried this product 2nd after their chia seed oil. I like the texture, the smell and the moisture. It is not greasy for me. The moisturiser is quickly absorbed into the skin. It doesn't bother me that there is no sunscreen as i burn easy and need a strong powerful sunscreen to add on top anyways.\n\n * My dermatologist has always advised me to apply a good dose of sunscreen and use a \"sunscreen\" instead of moisturisers with spf added.\n\n * This simplicity of the brand is just refreshing. They have only 1 cleanser, 1 scrub, 1 day moisturiser, , 1 night moisturiser. Not like other brands with a confusing array of different products.\n\n * This products does all it says it will do, which is moisturise with only good stuff like chia seed, sweet almond, avocado and coconut oil. You cannot even feel the oil content in it as it is not greasy.\n\n * The Bilberry plus Hibiscus extracts a great antioxidant / anthocyanocides. These not only protect the skin from free radical damage, but have astringent properties that help pores to appear smaller. They have an anti-inflammatory effect as well, which soothes inflamed skin and helps calm conditions like eczema and psoriasis. Good for pigmentation as ell.\n * I like that it does not have silicones, mineral oils. petroleum byproducts and artificial fragrance which is great for my sensitive skin.\n * The goodness range does deliver what it promise. I find the moisturiser good to layer under makeup.\n\n* **every evening cream**\n\n * Goodness evening cream is lovely.\n * Not too heavy. Just right.\n * I actually look forward to using it each night because i love the fragrance.\n\n * I look through the ingredients and am really happy to keep buying it.\nMy only gripe is the packaging. I wish it came in a pump bottle or tube that allow contactless usage. Each time i stick my fingers in the jar, i am conscious of introducing bacteria and deteriorating the product.\n\n * It absorbs well and quickly. I do realise i use a larger quantity compared to other moisturisers maybe because my skin just drinks it all up. It suits my combination skin and does not feel greasy at all. For the areas that require more moisture, i add chia seed oil for extra moisture.\n\n * Tips: Add more chia seed oil in it if you require more moisture.\n\n\n***\n\nthey just introduced a few more products now. but those 5 are the original products they had.\n\n\nhope this helps :)",

        "body": "It’s so annoying that they discontinued it. I let the company know several times that it’s the only spf I can use and how grateful I was that it existed and to please not change the ingredients. I’ve recommended Paula’s Choice to so many people… I still have a bit left but have no idea what I’m going to do when it runs out - I burn really easily and the dermatologist said I can’t go out without spf because it will make my skin problems even worse. It took a lot of experimentation and wasted money before I found the old version Calm spf. Even the hospital-prescribed “sensitive skin” spf felt like I had put burning hot oil on my face and I had to remove it straight away. I explained to PC that every time I have a bad reaction it makes my skin more sensitive so it’s really difficult to try a new spf knowing that it will almost definitely set off a painful inflammatory reaction and make my skin permanently worse. The thing is for those of us who have really intolerant skin, we don’t have the choice to easily switch brands. Some people didn’t like how it looked on their skin - I’m not bothered about this - it’s a medical necessity for me to wear spf if I want to go out - but actually it looked fine. I was holed up in my house for months before I found the old calm spf. It’s so upsetting that the company ignored feedback. The new formulation has had terrible reviews and a lot of their existing customers have stopped buying from them. I wish they would just bring the old formulation back. It’s comforting to know I’m not alone in this.",

Because I had decent results with this cleanser my mother purchased some more for me, but she got the Equate beauty Regenerating Daily Cream Cleanser, which is the Walmart generic of Olay Regenerist Regenerating Cream Cleanser (it says RIGHT on the bottle). However, the ingredient list is NOT the same as Olay's. \n\nWalmart Generic: *Purified Water, Ppg-15 Stearyl Ether, Stearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Oxidized Polyethylene, Salicylic Acid, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Distearyldimonium Chloride, Stearth-2, Steareth-21, Ppg-30, Behenyl Alcohol, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Seed Powder, Sodium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5), Fragrance, Disodium Edta, Sodidum Ascorbyl Phosphate, Carnosine.*\n\n\nOlay Regenerist Regenerating Cream Cleanser: *Water, PPG-15 Stearyl Ether, Glycerin, Oxidized Polyethylene, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Betaine, Salicylic Acid, Distearyldimonium Chloride, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cetyl Alcohol, Alcohol, Steareth-21, Sodium Chloride, Behenyl Alcohol, PPG-30, Steareth-2, Sodium Glycolate, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carnosine, Disodium EDTA, Ascorbic Acid, Fragrance, Iron Oxides.* \n\nI would like to use my moment on the soapbox to remind you ladies to double check ingredients on generics, because just because it says 'compare to' doesn't mean it's a perfect dupe. \n\nNow, I'm not 100% on apricot seed powder for facial use, but in a previous thread walnut seed powder was discussed and deemed bad for a face, just like the normal St. Ives Apricot Seed scrub. Now of course I can't find said thread grrr! Either way this cleanser contains Sodium Laurl Sulfate, which means I will not be continuing to use it, as I'd like to avoid that ingredient. \n\n(also, I'm surprise Olay cleanser use it, to be honest)\n\n**If you have a cleanser recommendation, I'll take it! I prefer creamy ones. I did not like CeraVe, I broke out really badly using their products! They just aren't for me :/ I really liked Ponds Cold Cream (even after the ingredient change), but I decided mineral oil and the OCM method is not for me, so anything with the words mineral oil in the ingredients is out. I work at a very dirty job and I also use a cleanser to remove makeup, verses using oil, so I'd prefer something that could still be able to remove it all, which the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating cleanser did not. If I must, I guess I'd use a cleanser with SLS, as I obviously was not super dry with this cleanser, but that might because I moisturize like nobodies business.**",

As an aside: I had a shipping issue, and when I e-mailed the Farmacy customer service, I had a response and solution in 10 minutes. This obviously doesn't make their products *better* but I wanted to shout out to their stellar customer service gals.\n\n* Dew It All eye cream: Nothing much to say here; this was a cart-filler to max out my coupon value. I wear contacts and my eyes get irritated easily, so I'd been in business for an eye cream with minimal irritants. I find mineral oil (and derivatives like aquaphor and vaseline) irritate my eyes at night if I apply them too close, but products with Glycerin are less irritating. What can I say - eye creams don't cause miracles overnight, but this one is hydrating and the hyaluronic acid does visibly juice up fine lines when it's applied. I was worried the fatty alcohols would irritate my skin, but didn't experience any.\n\nINGREDIENTS: Water, Glycerin, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Jojoba Esters, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Patented Echinacea Purpurea ‘Greenenvytm’ Root Extract, Candelilla/ Jojoba/Rice Bran Polyglyceryl-3 Esters, Glyceryl Stearate, Undecane, Adansonia Digitata Seed (Baobab) Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Gluconolactone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Tridecane, Arachidyl Alcohol, Ribose, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Behenyl Alcohol, Strelitzia Nicolai Seed Aril Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Glucoside, Sodium Hydroxide, Allantoin, Gellan Gum, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Cellulose Gum, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Amino-Esters-1, Calcium Gluconate, Amino Ester-1, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Muricatum Fruit Extract, Rosa Canina Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Algae Extract, Salicylicacid, Ocimumsanctumleafextract, Tocopherol, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Lawsonia Inermis Extract, Ocimum Basilicum (Basil) Extract, Pearl Powder (Margarita Powder), Sorbic Acid, Lactic Acid, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Glycolate.\n\n\n* Honey Savior all-in-one Salve: This one is my favorite. The texture is liquid but applies like an oil or melting balm. I've been using it on my cuticles and face where I get dry patches (chin, apples of cheeks, between eyebrows). I love the texture, smell, and it's been very nourishing and hydrating used at night. \n\nINGREDIENTS: Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Hydroxystearic/Linolenic/Linoleic Polyglycerides, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Honey Extract, Canola Oil, Propolis Extract, Royal Jelly Extract, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Rhus Succedanea Fruit Wax, Rhus Verniciflua Peel Wax, Echinacea Purpurea Root Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Wax, Tocopherol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Beeswax, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Honey, Flavor.\n\n* Honey Potion Mask: Honestly thought I'd love this one more than I did. The packaging is gorgeous and it comes with a tiny magnetic spatula to apply product. But I have very sensitive skin and this product has a *very* intense warming sensation when massaged into the skin. I left it on for 5 minutes and had to wash it off because it was stinging. It made my face quite red, and burned my eyes while washing it off. Once the redness subsided, my skin did feel softer, but I think the results were not worth the pain. Masks should feel relaxing and indulgent. This one made me feel panicked. \n\nINGREDIENTS: Glycerin, Diglycerin, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Honey Extract, Propolis Extract, Royal Jelly Extract, Panthenol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract, Allantoin, Phenoxyethanol, Echinacea Purpurea Root Extract, Honey, Water, Flavor, Vanillyl Butyl Ether\n\n* Green Clean cleansing balm: I hadn't jumped on the oil/balm cleansing train because I don't wear heavy makeup, and always felt like a cleanser+toner was enough to clear my skin. But after trying this guy, I'm definitely going to be adding it as a pre-cleanse step for nights where my face feels greasy or dry. It has a lovely silky texture and a tiny amount gives a thorough cleanse without stripping the skin at all. It does have citrus oils, so I've only been using it at night in case it makes my skin more photosensitive. \n\nINGREDIENTS: Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Peg-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Peg-10 Isostearate, Polyethylene, Phenoxyethanol, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Amino Esters-1, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Amber Powder, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Water/ Aqua/ Eau, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Echinacea Purpurea Root Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Moringa Pterygosperma Seed Extract, Disodium Phosphate, Citric Acid",

My skin is combination type and of course I also have the joy of having rosacea 🙄I was going through a lengthy flare-up and my face was particularly sensitive; it felt quite sore and burny like a sunburn. My usual moisturiser (Cerave) stung and I was coming to the end of it anyway so I thought I’d try something new.\n\nI bought the Hydra 10 and I noticed even on first application my face felt calmer. It continued to calm down and after a month of using it twice daily it’s caused no irritation nor broken me out. My face feels really well moisturised (I use nothing else to moisturise) and I find I don’t need to use a ton of it. I wanted something oil-free as I find moisturisers with oil tend to feel quite heavy and suffocating on my skin but ones without oil are often way too light and don’t moisturise well enough for me. This is oil-free but moisturises beautifully. Works well under my makeup and sunscreen. \n\nI was suspicious that the lemon peel powder may cause irritation but it’s been fine!\n\nSince using it my face has been flaring up less (may be a coincidence)  but I can definitely say it’s a keeper in any case.\n\nThe ingredients are:\n\nAVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA). CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE. GLYCERIN. BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII (SHEA) BUTTER (BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER). CETEARYL ALCOHOL. CETEARYL GLUCOSIDE. CITRUS LIMON (LEMON) PEEL POWDER (CITRUS LIMON PEEL POWDER). DIUTAN GUM. SCLEROTIUM GUM. SODIUM HYALURONATE\n\nJust wanted to post a review on it as it may help someone out there.

    "body": "Hi SCA, I've seen the brand [Herbivore Botanicals](https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com) and I've always been super curious about their products. Currently I use a mix between Drunk Elephant and The Ordinary skincare products, so I'm familiar and have grown used to stated percentages of ingredients, acids, BHA/AHA's, etc. \n\nMy current routine:\n\nMORNING:\n\n* rinse face with water\n\n* DE C-Firma\n\n* DE Shaba Eye Complex\n\n* The Ordinary Vitamin C complex for décolletage \n\n* DE B-Hydra on both face and décolletage \n\nEVENING:\n\n* Cleanse with La Mer the Cleansing Gel using Clarisonic\n\n* Rinse with La Mer the Micellar Water\n\n* DE Framboos on both face and décolletage \n\n* DE Shaba Eye Complex\n\n* DE Marula Oil\n\n* The Ordinary Rose Hip Seed Oil on décolletage \n\n* DE Lala Retro\n\n\nI typically use the TLC Sukari Babyfacial every 3rd day or so (my skin tolerates this interval well, so I'm not too concerned about that), and will use The Ordinary 23% AHA/BHA mask every week or so. \n\nI really love my routine so far, and don't have any complaints, however when doing at home chemical peels (10-40% glycol peels) my skin can get dry under my makeup, so hydration is something I'd be interested in. \n\nGiven all that, I was wondering if anyone uses these products or can tell me if they'd be worth purchasing. Some of the products I'm interested in are the:\n\n* [Blue Tansy AHA + BHA Resurfacing Clarity Mask](https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask), which lists: Aloe Barbadensis (Organic Aloe) Leaf Juice, Hydroxyethyl Ethylcellulose (plant derived), Glycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Salix Nigra (Willow) Bark Extract, Tanacetum Annuum (Blue Tansy) Flower Oil, Jasminum Sambac (Jasmine) Flower Water, Ananas Sativus (Organic Pineapple) Fruit Extract, Carica Papaya (Organic Papaya) Fruit Extract, Carica Papaya (Organic Papaya) Leaf Extract, Leucidal (Radish Root ferment)\n\n* The [MOON FRUIT Superfruit Night Treatment](https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/moon-fruit-super-fruit-night-treatment) which has: Organic Aloe Leaf Juice (Aloe Barbadensis), Red Raspberry Seed Oil (Rubus Idaeus), Organic Prickly Pear Oil (Opuntia Ficus-lndica), Kokum Butter (Garcinia Indica), Organic Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Organic Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Organic Rosehip Seed Oil (Rosa Canina), Hyaluronic Acid, Organic Ylang Ylang Flower Oil (Cananga Odorata), Organic Bilberry Fruit Extract (Vaccinium Myrtillus), Organic Sugar Cane Extract (Saccharum Officinarum), Organic Sugar Maple Extract (Acer Saccharinum), Organic Orange Peel Extract (Citrus Sinensis), Organic Lemon Peel Extract (Citrus Limon), Organic Cranberry Fruit Extract (Vaccinium Macrocarpon), Organic Papaya Fruit Extract (Carica Papaya), Organic Goji Berry Extract (Lycium Barbarum), Xanthan Gum, Indigo Powder (Baphicacanthus Cusia [Nees] Bremek), Ultramarine Blue, Manganese Violet\n\n* The [Phoenix Facial Oil](https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/phoenix-facial-oil) which lists: Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Rosa Canina (Rosehip) Seed Oil, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Salvia Hispanica (Chia) Seed Oil, CoQ10, Hippophae Rhamnoides L (Sea Buckthorn) Oil, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Rosa Damanscena (Moroccan Rose) Absolute, Citrus Aurantium (Neroli) Essential Oil.\n\n* The [Lapis Facial Oil](https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1) which lists: Amaranthus Squalane Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Capric Triglycerides (Fractionated Coconut Oil), Aleurites Moluccana (Kukui) Nut Oil, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Tanacetum annuum (Blue Tansy) Leaf Oil, Jasminum Sambac (Jasmine) Absolute, Rosa Damascena (Moroccan Rose) Absolute\n\n* The [Orchid Facial Oil](https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/orchid-facial-oil) which has: Capric Triglycerides (Fractionated Coconut Oil), Cymbidium Grandiflorum (Orchid) Flower Extract, Camellia Oleifera (Camellia) Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Amaranthus Squalane Oil, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Jasminum Sambac (Jasmine) Absolute.\n\nAre any of these products worth it, compared to what I could get from The Ordinary or Drunk Elephant?

        "body": "I have the Blue Tansy mask on my face right now! I've gone through 3 or 4 jars, I absolutely love it. It is the one thing that when used consistently (every day for 4 days, once or twice a week after) makes the biggest difference for my skin. I don't tend to shell out for refills often, but when I dropped and broke a brand new jar of this mask, I ordered a replacement as soon as I stopped crying. I cannot say enough good things about it. I am interested to know how the DE Babyfacial compares, but I'm EXTREMELY happy with Blue Tansy. After one use, it reduces the life of pimples I already have and when I wake up the next morning, all the red marks from old ones seem significantly lighter. I feel radiant when I make time to use this product consistently. \n\nI've also gone through two minis and half a full size of Lapis oil. I don't really use it anymore and actually think my full size bottle may have gone off by now (the color seems different lately), but it also made a difference in my routine when I used it consistently. It did seem to help control oil production when used in the AM, smells and feels wonderful going on, and I felt like it helped with redness a lot. I've fallen off the oil wagon, so I haven't used it in a while and don't know if I will pick it back up as I don't have the willpower to try and figure out how/where to fit it back into my routine. I think it's definitely worth buying the mini size though.\n\nI tried a sample of Moonfruit and thought it was meh. The sample dried out and molded before I could get through it, but to be fair they have since reformulated (I got a deluxe sample when it first  released) and I put it down for a long time. I recently threw it out and was never wowed enough to consider purchasing the full size.\n\nYou didn't ask, but the Rose Hibiscus spray is one of my other favorites. It's $32 for a full size. I got the S/S set last year to try the brand, and I decided to use the spray because it was included but I wouldn't repurchase because it's a freaking rose water spray and those can be had for so much cheaper. BUT I've repurchased it 3 times and have a backup bottle ready to go. I don't know WHAT it does, but it definitely does something. There is no comparison in my opinion, between Herbivore's spray and something from the drugstore or MB.  \n\nThat S/S kit included Blue Tansy, Rose Hibiscus, Pink Clay mask, mini Lapis oil, and one of their lip balms. It was about $100, but they sent me a coupon and I think I got it for $85. That was my first purchase and the only things I wasn't thrilled with were the Pink Clay mask and the lip balm. I have repurchased everything else included at least once. If they have that kind of deal again, I would DEF look into it. I think they give you 20% off for signing up to their newsletter, and a code for reviewing products that has been the same since I've been a customer, so I use that whenever I order from the site. \n\nI've also used their Pink Clay and Bamboo Charcoal soap bars. I'm currently still using the charcoal one and haven't touched the pink one for a while, but I think the pink one actually worked better for me. \n\nBASICALLY Herbivore is the only brand I've ever repurchased from so many times, and I plan to continue. I think they're very worth it. I'm no help with fitting Herbivore into your routine, but I definitely think you should check them out!",

If so how are they? I may have to narrow it down to using just one of them so I was wondering which may be the best of the two. I use their sunscreen and love that it has niacinaminde in it, it helps with my redness. But I'd like to switch to one of their less greasy sunscreens but none of the others had niacinamide. So I figured if I had a moisturizer with niacinamide then I could change sunscreens. Here are the moisturizer's ingredients:\n\nElta MD AM therapy facial moisturizer: \nPurified Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ethylhexyl Isononanoate, Niacinamide, Lauryl PEG-9 Polymethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Dimethicone, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Sodium Chloride, Piptadenia Colubrina Peel Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycerin, Allantoin, Caffeine, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Dimethicone/PEG-10/15 Crosspolymer, Butylene Glycol,\nPhenoxyethanol, Capryloyl Glycine, Undecylenoyl Glycine, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide.\n\nElta MD PM therapy:\nPurified Water, Ethylhexyl Isononanoate, Niacinamide, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyl Dimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, 1, 3-Bis (N-2-(Hydroxyethyl) Palmitoylamino) -2- Hydroxy Propane, C-10-30 Cholesterol/Lanosterol Esters, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycereth-26, Linoleic Acid, Cetearyl Glucoside, Thioctic Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Hydrolyzed Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum, Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum, Butylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Bisulfite, Sodium Hydroxide.\n\n\nUPDATE: I tried the PM therapy tonight and after about an hour my cheeks were burning like crazy! No redness, no apparent allergic reaction, just burning like the dickens. It was almost like I had a chemical burn. Washed it off and burn began to fade. May wait a couple days and try the AM therapy but scared I will have the same reaction. Sad because it has so many great ingredients and their sunscreen has worked great for me. \n\nUPDATE 2: The AM is my new HG moisturizer. In love!",

The box was manufactured in 2014 and has 8 masks inside.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n>Snail Recovery Mask: WATER, GLYCERIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, CHLORPHENESIN, TRIETHANOL AMINE, ARNICA MONTANA FLOWER EXTRACT, FOMES OFFICINALIS EXTRACT, GLYCOPROTEINS, HYDROLYZED MILK PROTIEIN, POLYSORBATE 20, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS FRUIT EXTRACT, SAMBUCUS NIGRA FLOWER EXTRACT, SOLUBLE COLLAGEN, GRAPE FRUIT EXTRACT, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CITRIC ACID, MENTHA PIPERITA LEAF EXTRACT, ACER SACCHARUM EXTRACT, CODIUM TOMENTOSUM EXTRACT, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE, CENTELLA ASIATICA EXTRACT, CITRUS AURANTIUM DULCIS FRUIT EXTRACT, CITRUS MEDICA LIMONUM PEEL EXTRACT, DIMETHYLSILANOL HYALURONATE, DIPOTASSIUM GLYCYRRHIZATE, GENTIANA LUTEA ROOT EXTRACT, SUGAR CANE EXTRACT, STYRENE/ACRYLATES COPOLYMER, CARBOMER, IODOPROPYNYL BUTYLCARBAMATE, POLYGLUTAMIC ACID, MENTHOL, FRAGRANCE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, GLYCOSPHINGOLIPIDS \n\n>Snail Fresh Repair Cream: WATER, DYCAPRYLYL CARBONATE, PENTAERYTHRITYL DISTEARATE, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, ALGAE EXTRACT, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CETEARYL GLUCOSIDE, DIMETHICONE, MYRISTYL MYRISTATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, SODIUM STEAROYL GLUTAMATE, ALLANTOIN, CHLORPHENESIN, XANTHAM GUM, GLYCOPROTEINS, DIPOTASSIUM GLYCYRRHIZATE, FRAGRANCE, GRAPE FRUIT EXTRACT, BROCCOLI EXTRACT, CODIUM TOMENTOSUM EXTRACT, OCTYLDODECANOL, IODOPROPYNYL BUTYLCARBAMATE, HYDROGENATED COCO-GLYCERIDES, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS SEED EXTRACT, GLYCOSPHINGOLIPIDS\n\nGlycoproteins = snail goo?  I've never poured over ingredients.  \n\nThe instructions were simple enough - mask first, cream 2nd.  I slapped on the mask and realized it wasn't the thin 2015 versions I'm used to.  It didn't conform to my face as well, but I managed.  There was maybe light fragrance, nothing noticeable to me.  40 minutes redditing...  The mask was still soaked when I took it off, so I rubbed it all over my legs.  Gotta get ready for summer!  The cream had a really light fragrance and was thicker than I expected.  It's a white, thick cream, and as generous as I was with applying, I still had a lot left over.  It was actually pretty easy to spread and felt light.  Absorbed fast and non-sticky.  It definitely wasn't anywhere near the cat hair magnet level stickiness I was used to with my sleeping packs.\n\nThe verdict - There was an immediate brightening effect.  It did brighten my face enough to match the rest of my body, lol.  It brightens as well as the other MBD masks.  At $1 a mask, it's a good deal :D\n\n[pics](http://imgur.com/a/hAn44) box and mask only >_<",

This is the first I have heard if it, and it certainly looks interesting.  Do you have any clinical data on its effectiveness?\n\nSebhorrea (I am going to misspell this consistently, sorry) is one of those skin ailments that is 'caused' by any number of things.\n\n'Causes' of course being distinct from 'triggers' in that no one knows what triggers a flare up, in a pathophysiological sense, so the symptoms are treated as if they are the cause.  Seasonal changes and stress, though apparently commonly self-reported by those afflicted, are not treatable in a medical sense and cannot be used in a differential diagnosis.\n\n Off the top of my head:\n\n* Fungus/Yeast\n* Auto-immune reaction\n* Inflammatory response (catch-all for 'body is doing something to defend itself from something not actually harmful') \n\nI recall that treatments generally fall under one or a combination of:\n\n* Steroid creams\n* Anti-fungal (nizoral usually)\n* Topical immune suppressant (Protopic)\n* Keratolytics (salicylic acid)\n* Other treatments that work because ???, like coal tar\n\nLet me know if I am mistaken in any of this, or if there is new research I should look at.  I have seen promising stuff regarding biofilm disruptors using xylitol and ... some other thing that is used in perfume base... farnesol? These work to control the yeast by denying them structure to build their colony and by selectively targeting the mazzelia the the normal biome can regenerate.\n\nCan you go over your ingredient list and explain why you picked each?\n \n*Note: I am not a medical doctor, so please take this information as it should be taken, which is half-remembered text-books read on the toilet by someone who reads too much non-fiction.*",

No white cast at all. Yay for not being shinyyy and not breaking ouuut~ I'm thinking of either repurchasing, buying the body version because it has more product (what's the difference, right?

I also realized I may have to separate the ingredients into different products to try to get a similar effect. So for example, urea, glycerin, squalene, mallow, rose, oat, etc. are things you'll look into to break it down. There's a reason it's so expensive and probably part of it is because it has high quality ingredients that you won't find altogether in anything else. Even something like titanium dioxide might make a difference, and it's probably only there as a colorant, but it'll still make a difference in how the ingredients work together.\n\n\nSorry this is so long. I'm avoiding my feelings about the state of the world today, so I'm super focused on this one singular thing lol. I hope you find something that works.",

I was red for maybe an hour or so, and then would become inflamed again if I used certain products (nearly everything except sunscreen). It may be that you used it a lot of times in a row, rather than slowly introducing it once in a while, or maybe we both have weird skin that can't tolerate lactic acid. (Which should be naturally occurring acid. Which shouldn't be reactive at low percentages. Ugh. Frustration. Or maybe our skin can't tolerate the combination of stuff in the product. I wish I knew.)\n\nAnyways, a normal reaction to introducing lactic acid would be stinging/redness for maybe 15 minutes or less. Or at least, that's what I've read.\n\nMy reaction was about 2 weeks ago, and my skin is starting to settle down, though it still reacts a little bit to certain products. My wishes to you, hoping that your skin won't bother you! Do wear sunscreen over the next few weeks, and if you have any troubles, ibuprofen and benadryl are lovely. As well as a topical ointment. Nuetrogena Hydro Boost Gel has provided hydration without irritating my burn at all, as well. Best of luck with the healing. \n\nI don't know what you will decide, as I think it depends on your own judgement and experience, but I ended up returning my product, lol. I decided that even if my skin COULD build up a tolerance, I wasn't willing to put it through this again.",

Quite a mouthful. I'm just wondering if it does what it says it does, or if I should ask my dad to return it. Experiences & science are equally welcome! Thank you!!\n\nAlso: I'm on Pocketderm & my medication cream has Niacinamide in it. Will using 2 sources of Niacinamide be...bad?",

Extremely fair skintone. Acne prone, dry in some spots but also very oily in others. Dehydrated for sure. Eczema prone in the past but not recently. Sensitive in general. \n\nAll the products are overwhelming to me, so I need a routine and I need products. **I will NOT be trying out all these new products at the same time.** I'll start with a new moisturizer and go on from there. I'd rather ask for help before buying anything though! Hopefully you can enlighten me a bit :)\n\n_________\n\n\n**Moisturizer**\n\nI preferable need something for both mornings and evenings (trying to limit the number of products I use) so it should moisturize me, not make me greasy and if at all possible go well under make-up. \n\nMy coworker is going to the US this month and is getting me CeraVe from the tub, yay! However, I really need one right now, and I need one that I can keep buying when it runs out. CeraVe is just for me to try out, but I probably won't be able to get it frequently :( So my search continues. These are the options I've considered so far:\n\n\n* [Avène Hydrance Optimale Riche](http://www.avene.co.uk/face/products-for-daily-use/dehydrated-skin/hydrance-optimale-rich) - The Light (Legere) one is also an option but reviews say it doesn't moisturize enough. \n\n> AVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA) MINERAL OIL (PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM) GLYCERIN PPG-15 STEARYL ETHER CYCLOMETHICONE CETEARYL ALCOHOL CARTHAMUS TINCTORIUS (SAFFLOWER) SEED OIL (CARTHAMUS TINCTORIUS SEED OIL) GLYCERYL STEARATE PEG-100 STEARATE BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII (SHEA BUTTER) (BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER) CETEARYL GLUCOSIDE BENZOIC ACID BETA-SITOSTEROL BHT C13-14 ISOPARAFFIN CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE CHLORPHENESIN DISODIUM EDTA FRAGRANCE (PARFUM) GLYCINE SOJA (SOYBEAN) SEED EXTRACT (GLYCINE SOJA SEED EXTRACT) HYDROGENATED COCO-GLYCERIDES LAURETH-7 LECITHIN PEG-32 PEG-400 PHENOXYETHANOL POLOXAMER 188 POLYACRYLAMIDE SODIUM CHONDROITIN SULFATE SODIUM HYDROXIDE WATER (AQUA) XANTHAN GUM\n\n\nThe alcohol bothers me, but I've previously had great experiences with Avène... However, there's also parfum in it. Low on the list, but still...\n\n\n* [La Roche Posay Hydreane Light](http://www.laroche-posay.com/products-treatments/Hydreane/Hydreane-Light-p6266.aspx). I'm worried this might not be moisturizing enough for the evenings, therefore also considering [La Roche Posay Hydreane Rich](http://www.laroche-posay.com/products-treatments/Hydreane/Hydreane-Rich-p6264.aspx) but I've read this might make you greasy. \n\n\n>AQUA / WATER\nGLYCERIN\nCYCLOHEXASILOXANE\nHYDROGENATED POLYISOBUTENE\nAMMONIUM POLYACRYLDIMETHYLTAURAMIDE / AMMONIUM POLYACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE\nMYRISTYL MYRISTATE\nSODIUM HYDROXIDE\nSTEARIC ACID\nPOLYPHOSPHORYLCHOLINE GLYCOL ACRYLATE\nXANTHAN GUM\nCAPRYLOYL GLYCINE\nCAPRYLYL GLYCOL\nACRYLATES COPOLYMER\nPOTASSIUM CETYL PHOSPHATE\nGLYCERYL STEARATE SE\n\nNot too set on either Avène or LRP, but they are OK in price range (I guess... I'd rather go cheaper but I'm desperate) and readily available for me.\n\n____________\n\n**Sunscreen**\n\nIt needs to be a physical/mineral sunscreen as chemical ones irritate my eyes. SPF doesn't need to be crazy high - Netherlands.\n\nI need help here honestly. I have so much trouble finding one. The top one right now seems to be my fav because it's cheap and I can get it anywhere. If it sucks I won't be too sad...\n\n\n* [Eart Line Argan Bio Sun Face Age Control](http://www.vannaturebeter.nl/biosunfaceagecontrole.html) (SPF 15 but they also have SPF 20)\n\n>Aqua, Macadamia Ternifolia (macadamia oil)**, Titanium Dioxide, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin (soy), Helianthus Annus (sunflower oil)**, Simmondsia Chinensis ( jojoba oil)**, Butyrospermum Parkii (shea butter)** , Prunus Dulcis (almond oil)**,Stearyl Alcohol, Argania Spinosa Oil (argan oil)**, Cocos Nucifera (coconut oil)**, Chlorella Vulgaris/Lupinus, Albus Protein Ferment, Nasturtium Officinale Flower/Leaf Extract (anti-dark spots), Porphyra Umbilicalis / Porphyra Umbilicalis Extract (red algae), Calendula Officinalis Extract **, Symphytum Officinale Extract (comfrey)**, Plantago Lanceolata Extract (plantain)**, Zinc Oxide, Fragrance (natural perfume)**, Aloe Barbadensis (aloe vera)**, Ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q10), D-alpha Tocopherol (vitamin E), Daucus Carota (vitamin A), Camellia Sinensis (white tea), Squalane, Ascorbyl Palmitate (vitamin C),  Sucrose Stearate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-2 Caprate, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Xanthan Gum, Glyceryl Caprylate, Aluminium Stearate, Phytic acid, Citric Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Stearic Acid, Isostearic Acid, Sodium Lactate, Citronellol*, Limonene*, Linalool*, Farnesol*, Geraniol*\n\nYou probably haven't heard of this one, I think it's a European brand. Hopefully you can glance something from the ingredients that I can't. Sorry for the editing, they put stars next to some ingredients which makes it bold, but I don't know what the stars mean :)\n\nI like this one because it's a physical sunscreen, SPF 20 seems fine enough for me, it's not expensive and I can buy it in many stores around here. Not too fond of the alcohol in this one again, but maybe I shouldn't be bothered so much? \n\n* [Paula's Choice RESIST Super Light Daily Wrinkle Defense SPF 30](http://www.paulaschoice-eu.com/resist-super-light-daily-wrinkle-defense-spf-30.html) - Or maybe not this one specifically as I don't like the coloring. Paula's Choice seems to have many SPF creams though. \n\n\nOther PC's options are also in my mind. I don't know. I've never used anything from PC. Everyone seems really happy with it and considering the trouble I have finding a good mineral sunscreen, I'm willing to try it. Definitely above my budget to be honest though...\n\n____________\n\n**Exfoliant**\n\nPaula's Choice, no doubt really. Can't seem to find another one that's cheaper and with all the positive responses I'm willing to spend the money on it. BHA Regular probably. *Not starting this until I have the rest of my routine sorted out though!*\n\n____________\n\n**Cleanser**\n\nCeraVe! My coworker is also bringing me CeraVe cleanser and I can't wait to use it. Until then I'll finish the cleanser I'm using now. It's not great, but it's alright (Dutch brand). I'm really putting my money on the CeraVe for the moment and I'll wait to see what that does before I worry about it any more. Finding a good moisturizer and sunscreen is difficult (and expensive) enough for now.. But if you have any options for me, please let me know! I was told I should look for one with low PH?\n\n______\n\n\nWhat else do I need? Something that's glaringly lacking? I feel like a serum sounds wonderful, but maybe I should prioritize something else. Or maybe I should chill and see what the new products over time will do for me. I don't know. I still need advice and you guys really helped me clear my mind earlier. Thanks again everyone. You're lifesavers. ",

Personally, I only buy sunscreens which are somewhat cheap (I guess around $3-4/oz) because I go through more sunscreen than any other product.  You also have to consider how much protection you want and whether a white cast on your face will bother you or not.  Most physical sunscreens do leave a white cast, so keep that in mind.  They can be a little drying too.  I think the Earth Line could be worth a try.  Asian products tend to be cheap (although small) and ship worldwide for reasonable prices.  This [Innisfree](http://www.innisfreeworld.com/product/productView.do?prdSeq=10131) sunscreen is physical and supposed to be good.  You can get more info on which website to buy from at /r/Asianbeauty. \n\nThe cleanser should be around pH 5.5  [Sebamed](http://www.sebamed.nl/nl) is known for this!  And the products are supposed to be good.  I would think you can find this locally.",

There are a lot of products on the market that contain a lot of chemicals, many of which have by now become familiar sights in ingredients lists. There are an awful lot of them derived from coconut and palm exclusively, but there are also a lot of them that can be derived from other sources. There isn't any regulation currently in place (at least in the United States, that I am aware of) that requires manufacturers to disclose the source of their chemicals, which can lead to a lot of companies falsely claiming that their products are coconut and/or palm free, when they are just the opposite. Some of the chemicals you will see are things like Vitamin A-palmitate. This one in particular can be tricky as it can be found naturally in beef fat, or it can be derived from coconut or palm plants. You see it a lot in milk, particularly milk that is 2% or less milk fat, which would make you think that it is derived from beef fat, but when you start digging, you find out that it is far more readily available (and therefore cheaper for dairies to buy in the quantities they use) to acquire a palm derived version. Now, devil's advocate here, it may be simply that the dairies do not actually know that they are adding a palm derived product into their milk, as they are likely going through a bulk supplier.\n\nI have also come to realize that there are a lot of companies who advertise things as being coconut and/or palm free and are completely unaware that the chemicals they use come from those sources.

You are better off with a widely available moisturizing cream or a toner, as they are cheaper and better made. \nWe got used to blindly buying whatever these companies are selling as \"aftershaves\", even if, as ingredients go, they forget the main component in an aftershave lotion, that being the astringent.",

I love using cyclomethicone and some light-skin-feel esters as a skin/cuticle oil. Dimethicone are not volatile and will hang out on top, while cyclomethicone tend to evaporate after some time and will not feel so greasy after a few minutes. \n\nIsohexadecane will feel a little bit lighter and will also contribute to an emolliency feeling without being absorbed into the skin. \n\nCaprylyl glycol is a great light skin-feel polyol that makes skin feel smooth and soft. Short chain esters like isopropyl myristate, coco caprylate, and others, will bring similar feelings if you're looking for similar ingredients. Caprylyl glycol and also help get some of those oils deeper into the skin to soothe dry skin. \n\nIn the balm, which is super occlusive, paraffins and other waxes will build structure but paraffin tends to be really stiff on the skin. Formulating with dimethicone and hydrocarbons like petroleum jelly can make skin feel nourished, but as a balm, you'll have a harder time getting it into the skin, and it'll mostly just stay on top.",

It gives me this plumping effect but should I be worried if the moisturizing feeling is a placebo?",

I used to cleanse and sometimes moisturize only. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am allergic to everything under the sun from plants, animals, mold, dust, foods, and chemicals. I've had pretty extensive allergy testing done at the doctor. Tested \"positive\" for 60 of 60 \"natural\" allergens (I reacted to all plants, pollen, animals, mold). I reacted to the tape done for the chemical test, so that has to be redone. I have not yet done the food allergy test. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs far as chemicals go, I know for sure I am allergic to Stearyl Alcohol. I have also decided to try to avoid Cetyl Alcohol and thus Cetearyl Alcohol (Cetyl and Stearyl alcohols combined). I also prefer fragrance free or very low fragrance/odor (due to other allergies and migraine triggers)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have combonation skin, leaning towards dry. I get very flaky skin easily (it will peel off in patches or sheets). I also have relatively sensitive skin, turning red very quickly and also breaking out into hives, rashes, and contact dermatitis. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBelow is my current skin care routine with products I use with a link to the product and the ingredient list. (the links are just generic to sephora mostly because that is where i bought these products)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n I am wanting help with a few things\n\n1. are all of the products i have listed safe from the above alcohols?\n2. Is this the right order?\n3. do I need to add or subtract anything from my routine?\n4. any other suggestions or advice?\n5. several product replacements i need\n   1. eye cream\n   2. exfoliate \n   3. lotion!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will update later with my makeup list, but one step at a time.

It is wonderful for treating all kinds of skin issues, but mixing water and colloidal oats is for all intents and purposes making a weak batch of oatmeal.\n\nLeucidal Liquid SF is wholly inadequate for this purpose.\n\nQuoting from a [thread at chemistscorner](https://chemistscorner.com/cosmeticsciencetalk/#/discussion/5596/improve-lotion-skin-absorption-and-impart-non-greasy-texture):\n\n> Leucidal SF has proven to be ineffective. AMT has added the Coconut AMTCide to the product and the combination is Leucidal Complete. It still has some gaps in yeast/mold coverage. It also needs to be used as part of a hurdle technique and the final Formulation should be sent off for PET (Challenge Testing). \n\nFurther down is noted:\n\n> Much more reliable is Dermosoft 1388 combined with Dermosoft PEA (Sodium Levulinate, Sodium Anisate + Phenethyl Alcohol) all from Evonik/Dr. Straetmans.  \n\nHowever any 'natural' preservative should be regarded as suspect unless done with extreme caution in sanitary preparation followed with a challenge test.\n\nIf you are worried about skin reactions, parabens are very well tolerated and have been used for decades safely in small amounts in topical products. \n\nYou can use hemp oil -- it is pretty good, but it oxidizes (goes rancid) quickly, and it is very thin.  \n\nI do not know if lecithin will work.",

I'm thinking that I must have an allergy to something in the day cream that isn't in the night cream, because I have not made any other changes to my skincare routine. \n\n Here is the ingredients list for ingredients only found in the day cream (not in the night cream) thanks to SkinCarisma:\n\nGlucose, Lauroyl Lysine, Betaine, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Cetyl Alcohol, Sorbitol, Stearyl Alcohol, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Averrhoa Carambola Leaf Extract, Carbomer, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium PCA, Sodium Hyaluronate, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Tromethamine, Dimethicone, Steareth-21, Silica\n\nHere is my step by step day routine:\n\n\\- Rinse face in shower (no soap)\n\n\\- [PTR Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream](https://www.sephora.com/ca/en/product/water-drench-hyaluronic-cloud-cream-P416160) (I use it like a serum).

I found SkinCarisma which allowed me to compare both products.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS As soon as I figured this out I immediately stopped using the Day cream! I'll be returning it. I really want to figure out what might be causing the irritation so I can avoid those ingredients in the future.",

One very fine line, may be vertical frown line, may be a scar.\n\nMake-up: Only recently got any again, have rarely used it.\n\nSuitability requirements: Vegan\n\nOther notes: I quit using products before as a teen because it wasn't working. The only thing that has ever made a significant ongoing difference, as a happy and unexpected side-effect, was switching to a dairy-free diet. I really don't like that one fine line due to the placement. I get that 'pores are normal', but the visibility makes me want to do something drastic involving strong acid. I have nerve damage so anything I use is prone to feel tingly/burny, making it hard to use that as a gauge, but my skin doesn't actually seem very sensitive in terms of real reactions to products. Not sure it absorbs products well. I'm not using SPF at present because I'm most often housebound currently, but feel free to advise on how to add this in for times that's not the case.\n\nCurrent products:\n\n**Cleansers**\n\nPrevise Dermapothecary Purify Botanic Wash\n\nI've liked this. Noticeable improvement just from using it and the toner dabbed on the worst problem areas, it seems to have fixed the flaky itchy skin under my eyebrows, skin is softer. Possibly pretty much anything would've had the same result, admittedly. The instructions don't actually say to wash it off with water, so, eh...?\nDid not seem to help with removing new mascara, as it dawned on me that I was not actually sure *how* to remove mascara.\n\nIngredients: Water, Algae Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Xantham Gum, Pentylene Glycol, Helianthus Anthus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Quillaja Saponaria Bark Extract, Organic Cedrus Atlantica (Cedarwood) Oil, Organic Citrus Aurantium Dulcis Peel Oil, Diglycerin, Polyglycerol-2 Laurate, Citric Acid, Silver Citrate\n\nSukin Clearing Facial Wash\n\nNot yet used.\n\nIngredients: Water (Aqua), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Cydonia Oblonga Leaf Extract (Quince), Punica Granatum Fruit Extract (Pomegranate), Epilobium Angustifolium Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (Willowherb), Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract (Green Tea/White Tea), Moringa Oleifera Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Glycerin, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Eucalyptus Citriodora Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Limonene, Linalool\n\n**Toner/Salicylic Acid**\n\nSukin Pore Perfecting Toner\n\nSmells satisfyingly medicinal, but results have varied from 'I'm almost sure this is helping' to 'I'm not sure this is doing a darn thing', which is possibly just usual breakout fluctuation.\n\nIngedients: Water(Aqua), Glycerin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cydonia Oblonga Leaf Extract(Quince), Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract(Green Tea/White Tea), Zingiber Officinale(Ginger)Root Extract, Mentha Piperita(Peppermint)Leaf Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Eucalyptus Citriodora Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia(Lavender)Oil, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Salicylic Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate, Polyglyceryl-6 Oleate, Sodium Surfactin, Sorbic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Benzyl Alcohol, Limonene, Linalool\n\nSukin Spot-Banishing Gel\n\nI was hoping this would have the same kind of near-instant spot drying-out effect I remembered from the gels I'd used as a teen, but while it might be a little better, eh, not really, so far. Think might be a little drying.\n\nIngredients: Water (Aqua), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Epilobium Angustifolium Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (Willowherb), Cydonia Oblonga Leaf Extract (Quince), Salicylic Acid, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Moringa Oleifera Leaf Extract, Zingiber Officinal (Ginger) Root Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract (Chamomile), Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract (Green Tea/White Tea), Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Eucalyptus Citriodora Oil, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Sorbic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Limonene, Linalool\n\n**Moisturiser**\n\nDr Organic Rose Otto Day Cream\n\nWas a little burny.

        "body": "It definitely sounds like you’ve been taking the right approach so well done for being patient (it took me YEARS of throwing new harsh stuff at my face every other week to realise a slow and simple routine worked better for me!)\n\nI’m not super knowledgable and unfortunately I have zero experience of the brands you’ve mentioned, but one thing I’ve noticed from the ingredients is that the Sukin products have a lot of botanical oils and in general the products all have a lot of ingredients. Have you tried simpler “dermatology” brands like Avene, La Roche Posay, Cerave, Cetaphil or at a cheaper high street level Simple? It may be worth reading up about some of these, they’re a staple on subs like this and obviously not everything works for every person but a lot of people see results when using their targeted but quite sensitively formulated products. For example the Sukin moisturiser says it’s oil free, which sounds great if you have oily skin, but there are a lot of plant extracts which can be quite reactive on some skin so could be less than ideal. Also I know it sounds strange but being oily is often to do with being dehydrated and your skin overcompensating, so you don’t always have to shy away from rich moisturising products - I didn’t use moisturiser at all for years because I thought it would make oily ness worse, but the moment I started to use a plain moisturiser my skin (including spots) was so much happier!\n\nI am waffling now, basically I don’t have very wise or specific words for you but you are definitely taking the right approach but maybe products from different brands or with simpler formulas might help? It’s such a pain figuring this stuff out, I wish you luck!",

I do shower acrobatics so none of the stuff in my shampoo gets in my face. I use the regular red-cap Gilette shaving cream (only tingles for a little while, doesn't seem to have that great of an effect on my skin) and shave every night with a good non-burning razor before using the cleanser (started doing this in June, seems to really help with keeping me breakout-free). I keep my hair short and out of my face (had that long-hair period in 8th grade, around the height of my forehead acne). I rarely touch my face throughout the day. I don't pick at my skin or pop pimples. Sometimes I do get oily and duck into a public washroom to blot it out, more on that later in this post. Pics may or may not be coming soon, since I'm currently staying in a dim-lit basement apartment with mirrors only in the dimmer-lit rooms, and with only a 2 MP iPod camera to take pictures with. Diet doesn't seem to affect my acne. I cut down on dairy for a while, and that seemed to reduce it a little, but I have now reintroduced it to my diet and there's been no change, positive or negative. I wear glasses which I clean with alcohol-based lens cleaner each time before putting them on. I drink enough water pretty much every day, but sometimes I forget to/don't notice I'm thirsty. I usually break out a little those days. I've been to a derm once, but all that I got from them was a confirmation that what I had was indeed acne and not some obscure skin condition, and a prescription for accutane which my mother didn't let me get. I've never tried accutane or any prescription cream. Antibiotics helped for a little while (got prescribed them for an unrelated illness) but lost their effectiveness pretty quickly.\n\n**-- Begin actual post --**\n\nHey, SCA! Mostly a complete newbie here, but ready & willing to learn! Thanks for giving my post a look. I'm a 17 year-old Canadian male going off to university in about two weeks, and I'm looking for a solid plan to improve my skin. My dad never got acne, but my mom did a lot. I've sadly inherited that part of my mom's genes. Asian acne is the worst.\n\nI started getting acne around 7th-8th grade (11-12 years old?), starting on my forehead. It used to be pretty mild, but in 9th grade it migrated down to my cheeks and flared up like hell, started getting big cysts. Thankfully, since then, my forehead has been left untouched and has no noticeable marks. By 10th grade it had mellowed out, though pimples also began appearing around my chest/neck/jawline, and pretty much stayed constant throughout 11th and most of 12th (with the exception of some appearing in, uh... private... areas in 11th :( ). In the summer before 12th grade, I began using sunscreen to mitigate PIH/redness, as suggested on the sub, and that has worked quite well!\n\nNow, in the summer before first year uni, I'm finally actually reading your posts properly and not skimming them in episodes of frustration and emo-ness like I used to. I've been paying attention to what affects my skin. I started using the routine above in mid-late June, and where I was getting 1-3 large cysts a week before, I now get maybe 1 large cyst a month (mostly around my neck/jaw area) and a lot smaller breakouts which are on their way out after a couple days using the spot treatment.\n\nI'm mainly looking for advice on three fronts:\n\n**1)** If you guys & gals have any general advice on how to improve my routine, I will listen with open ears. Explanations for why you're making suggestions is appreciated!\n\n**2)** Sunscreen. I've been sticking to Ombrelle (first used the Ultra-Light Cream 45 SPF, instead of the Ultra-Fluid Lotion 60 SPF) up until now because I've not heard anything bad about it, but something that just clicked in my idiot brain is that it both products I've used regularly do a couple of annoying things. First, they make my skin way oilier by the end of the day than normal. Second, they have a tendency to leak into my eyes with the oil they create, which stings a lot if I mess around with my glasses during the day or touch my eyes at all. I recently went on a two-week road trip where I wore the Ultra-Fluid Lotion every day (I usually stay in the house most of the time, and since it's a basement with very little light coming through the windows, I don't bother with the sunscreen most days because of the effects stated above) and noticed that my face broke out like it used to circa grades 10-11. Granted, it could have been that we were eating out for virtually every meal, but I do make an effort to balance my diet in terms of calories/nutrition, so I doubt that was it, since I wasn't eating too terribly (sorry for being graphic, but I observed my stool, I'd give it a B+). Does anyone have an idea as to why these sunscreens make me oily/sting my eyes/break me out, and what sunscreens are good as an alternative? Also, as Fitzpatrick IV, is 45+ SPF still a requirement for me if I want to mitigate PIH/redness?\n\n**3)** Moisturiser. If you'll notice, it's not a regular part of my routine. I've been staying in this basement apartment for the past month with my dad in lieu of our main house in another province, since it's closer to my university & blah blah other reasons. When I moved here, I did not bring my moisturiser because I'd forgotten about putting it on/that it even existed for a couple of weeks. Before that, I used to put it on every night before bed. I used Aveeno Active Naturals Clear Complexion Daily Moisturiser with salicylic acid. It always seemed to oil up my face more than normal when I used it in the day and could see what it did. (Sidenote: My skin really has me confused as to whether it's oily or dry or normal, since whenever I used/use moisturiser/sunscreen as per my routine, it's oily, but when I don't use either, I find it's sort of tight immediately after cleansing and starts feeling normal a few minutes after patting dry [but it still gets oily at the end of the day if I don't use moisturiser/sunscreen! Just less so]. I've only begun paying attention to that now, so maybe I'll update this post later.) I went out to Shopper's Drug Mart and bought Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturiser 15 SPF a couple of days ago on a whim, and it immediately broke me out all over (didn't patch test, I'm sorry, I'm new to this!!) after putting it on and going to bed with it. My skin was so oily that morning. Luckily, going back to the routine above has all the little spots it made on the way out now. Anyone have any ideas on what moisturiser would be best for me, and also why the Cetaphil broke me out?\n\nThanks for reading this far!

Check the sidebar for a list of symptoms and see if you match up. I don't think you have dry skin since your face doesn't feel tight after rinsing with water, but it may be combo/dehydrated.\n\nThirdly, yes you need sunscreen. Darker skin can provide only up to [the equivalent of SPF 13](http://www.bidmc.org/YourHealth/Therapeutic-Centers/Skin-Cancer.aspx?ChunkID=157004), which is still lower than what we recommend. Besides, darker skintones are more susceptible to hyperpigmentation, and since that's a concern of yours, you should definitely not neglect sunscreen.\n\nFourth, patch test. It's hard to tell what is breaking you out (e.g. the alcohol, the silicones) from these ingredients lists.\n\nYou should add something to proactively prevent acne (e.g. BHA, BP) instead of treating it reactively with the spot treatment. Also, you may want to add a vitamin C serum.",

    "body": "I seem to have ruined my skin. I've always had dryness problems, but I found a routine that seemed to keep it mostly happy. For the last 3 or so weeks, its been unbearable. \n\nI'm not sure how much of this is from the face paint I (stupidly) used on halloween, or the extra dry Colorado air, or both. But, right now my skin feels miserable. I'm re-applying moisturizer 3-4 times a day. My face is constantly itchy. The texture of my skin has changed from being tight without moisturizer to rough and flakey constantly, even on my ears, which did not have any face paint on them. However, the extreme dryness is contained to my face.\n\nMy routine: \n\n**AM - **\nRince with warm water\nMoisturize with **Ren Evercalm Global Protection Day Cream** (I switched to this recently, and it really helps with the redness I have from Exczma - Used 3 months)\nMakeup - I use **Makeup forever Ultra HD foundation.** I was told this was really good for dry skin, and If I have foundation on I can generally go 8 hours with out feeling like I need to re-moisturize. (Used 3 Months)\n\nPM - \nOil cleanse with **Burts Bees Facial Cleansing oil** (used 9 months)\nFollowed with **Simple Micellar water**, because I'm not a fan of the lingering oily feeling (used 9 months)\n**Ren Flash hydro boost instant plumping emulsion** w/ a bit of warm water per the instructions (Used 3 months)\nFollowed by **Boscia Tsubuki Deep Hydration Sleeping Mask** (used 1 year)\n\nI had been using Nip/Fab Gycolic fix, but stopped it back in August. I suspected most of my acne was caused by issues with my moisture barrier, and I was advised here to stop it.\n\nAs of now, anything with moisturizer in it, including my foundation, stings for a few seconds when I fist apply it. I even found a small travel container that I had put First Aid Beauty in, and tried that and it stung. \n\nI also tried a moisturizing and soothing sheet mask from Sephora, but it made me itchy more than anything. I run a cold humidifier at night, to prevent nosebleeds as well as dry cracked hands. \n\n\nThe \"posting guidelines\" suggest ingredients, so here it goes:\n\n**Ren Evercalm Global Protection Day Cream:** Water, Cetearyl Alcohol, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate, Myristyl Myristate, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Glycerin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Glucoside, Triheptanoin, Oryzanol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Bisabolol, Ribes Nigrum (Black Currant) Seed Oil, Carbomer, Hippophae Rhamnoides Fruit Extract, Citrus Nobilis (Mandarin Orange) Peel Oil, Tocopherol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Cinnamomum Camphora Linalloliferum (Ho Wood) Leaf Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Pueraria Lobata (Kudzu) Symbiosome Extract, Cassia Alata Leaf Extract, Laminaria Ochroleuca Extract, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Fragrance, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Citronellol, Geraniol, Limonene, Linalool.\n\n**Facial Cleansing Oil with Coconut & Argan Oils:** Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Crambe Abyssinica Seed Oil, Isoamyl Laurate, Polyglyceryl-2 Sesquioleate, Fragrance*, Polyglyceryl-2 Caprate, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Tocopherol Natural Fragrance.\n\n**Simple Cleansing Micellar Water:** Water (Aqua), Hexylene Glycol,Glycerin, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) FlowerExtract, Panthenol, Niacinamide, Sodium AscorbylPhosphate, Peg-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, DmdmHydantoin, Cetrimonium Chloride, TetrasodiumEdta, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, SodiumChloride, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\n**Ren Flash Hydro-Boost Instant Plumping Emulsion:** Water, Squalane, Glycerin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Oleyl Alcohol, Arginine, Cetyl Phosphate, Xylitylglucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Myristyl Myristate, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Germ Oil, Anhydroxylitol, Oryzanol, Vaccinium Vitas-Idaea Seed Oil, Yeast Extract, Alcohol, Carbomer, Phospholipids, Xylitol, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Parfum* (Fragrance), Safflower Oil / Palm Oil Aminopropanediol Esters, Sodium Hyaluronate, Soy Amino Acids, Glucose, Glyceryl Laurate, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum, Ceratonia Siliqua (Carob) Seed Extract, Benzoic Acid, Dehydracetic Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Geraniol, Limonene, Linalool. *100% Natural Fragrance.\n\n**boscia Tsubaki Deep Hydration Sleeping Mask:** Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Oil, Dimethicone, Sucrose, Lactobacillus Ferment, Pentylene Glycol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polysorbate 60, Squalane, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Epilobium Angustifolium Extract, Undaria Pinnatifida Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Algae Extract, Althaea Officinalis Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Carbomer, Eugenia Caryophyllus (Clove) Leaf Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol.\n\nAny advice is very appreciated.

    "body": "https://imgur.com/a/xrDcr0r\n\nI started shopping at Aldi’s recently (they have zero carb bread!! My little keto heart leaps with joy!) and noticed they have what seems to be an in-house brand of skin care called Lacura. At my location I saw a day cream, night cream, and a hydrating moisturizer.\n\nI was interested, as I’ve never heard of the brand or seen it mentioned on this subreddit so far. Though I’m sure it has, lol. Obviously, very cheap skincare can be a little suspicious.\n\nFor $4.99 I decided to take a chance on the night cream. I’ve used it for 3 days now and my initial impression is that it’s kind of meh. It has a fragrance, which I personally think is pleasant but others may not care for or may be reactive to.  It kind of feels more like it’s sitting on top of my skin than sinking into it, but it’s not sticky or heavy feeling, which is nice. It doesn’t seem to be clogging my pores or causing any reactions, but it’s still pretty early to know for sure. \n\nTonight, I’m trying to take advantage of this “laying on top of” thing by layering it over my normal moisturizer (Elf Daily Hydration Moisturizer). Maybe it will act like a thinner Vaseline and really help lock it in? I hope so haha, otherwise I might not finish the jar. \n\nI’m wondering if anyone has any thoughts, opinions, or experiences with Lacura’s products. Are any of the other products worth a shot? Am I burning a hole in my face with this cheap night cream and should bin it immediately?\n\nFor reference, here’s the ingredients for the night cream: Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Ethylhexyl Stearate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Panthenol (Provitamin B5), Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Phospholipids, Ubiquinone, Propylene Glycol, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Retinyl Palmitate, Chondrus Crispus (Carrageenan) Extract, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Germ Extract, Retinol, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil Unsaponifiables, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Dimethicone, Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Tocopherol, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Fragrance, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Lecithin, Glyceryl Oleate, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid.",

I believe that means stearyl is one I should try and stay away from as well? (which literally means I don't have a single moisturizer in my house that I can use tonight)\n\n-  I'm looking at the ingredients for my sunscreen. I don't see any of the three fatty alcohols already mentioned but I'm not sure about a few other ingredients like \"cetearyl glucoside.\" The word cetearyl is upsetting me. Also slightly unrelated but oh well - I just noticed \"coconut ether\". If I have an issue with coconut oil clogging my pores is coconut ether a problem too? Knowing that I am trying to cut out fatty alcohols, are there other ingredients I should be worried about in my sunscreen?\n\nIn case you're wondering, it's the EltaMD UV Facial SPF 30+\n\nIngredient List:\n\nPurified Water, Petrolatum, Isopropyl Palmitate, Octyl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Dimethicone, PEG-100 Stearate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polyisobutene, PEG-7 Trimethylolpropane Coconut Ether, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Polyether-1, Citric Acid, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane.",

So it's partially comprised of cetearyl alcohol.\n\nCoconut ether and coconut oil are different.

In fact, Dr Dray highly recommends buffering with CeraVe/Vanicream \"in the tub\" (both of which contain petrolatum).

Two months in using every other day and I have yet to experience ANY dryness, tightness or irritation... though I do experience some MINOR flaking  fom time to time, so I know the tret is still \"working\" (that and the fact that my skin is smoother, clear and blemish free 😉)... Even at a lower strength of 0.020% (via Curology)! \n\nThe things you want to avoid are PURE petroleum (Vaseline) or other ointments such as CeraVe Healing Ointment or Aquiphor, as those are \"true occlusives\". That said, petrolatum is pretty high on the list of ingredients that you posted. 🤷‍♀️ Maybe try swapping it out for CeraVe \"in the tub\"?

This is the best explanation i could find: \n\n\"MSM to inhibit the release of inflammatory skin chemicals, now combined with the unique patented ingredient 4-t-butylcyclohexanol which short circuits nerve triggered reddening events including reducing the impact of nerve stimuli triggered by diet and hormonal issues. Polyglutamic acid improves the skins tolerance levels by reducing sensory triggering and improving lipid and epidermal structures which normalise skin response to triggers and raises the skin tolerance thresholds.\"\n\nSo in a nutshell it seems like it can elevate certain trigger thresholds which sounds cool.

If its not causing  retention issues right now i wouldn’t worry about it but if you’re losing lashes at some point I would consider it as possibly one of the reasons. But yes generally you should avoid products with oils in the ingredient list. Moisturizers especially because they tend to migrate to the eye area even if you don’t apply it there. Im really surprised they hired you with no prior lash knowledge, id even consider taking a lash education course so you can better deal with clients. Best of luck",

Today (Sunday), it’s almost “perfect”, with mostly just a little bit of scarring left. However, my skin is very dry now. I wake up with completely dry skin, and my skin absorb EVERYTHING I apply to it throughout the day (which is often, as it almost immediately absorbs it). \n\nWhat can I do in order for my skin to not be as dry when I wake up (and throughout the rest of the day)? Can I mix this moisturizer with another, thicker one? Or add Vaseline on top? The derm told me to try to avoid using many products, and to try to keep it as simple as absolutely possible. I don’t know much about ingredients, so idk what’s ok to mix and not. \n\nThank you in advance!😁",

But after having started to use i have been getting severe acne again and I cant even do anything about it. 🥲 My parents are sending a few bottles of it through someone I know in a month but until then I feel like I have no option but keep using this moisturizer which is ruining my skin everyday 😭😭😭I am dropping the ingredients of my original moisturizer. If someone can recommend some moisturizer with the same ingredients to me that I can find here in Paris, France, I will be really grateful.\n\nIngredients for Aquasoft Max Intensive Moisturizer:\nPurified Water, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Cetosteary Alcohol, C13-15 Alkane, White Soft Paraffin, Cetomacogol 1000, Shea Butter, Sodium PCA, Glyceryl Monostearate, Squalane, Medium-chain Triglycerides, Sorbitan Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Xylitylglucoside, Stearic Acid, Polyacrylate-13, Phenoxyethanol, Anhydroxylitol, Dexpanthenol, Polyisobutene, Xylitol, Dimethicone, G Cetearyl Glucoside, Ethylhexylglycerin, Butyl ytoluene, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Acacia Senegal Gum, Polysorbate 20, Xanthan Gu Sodium C Sorbitan Isostearate, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Monohydrate, Ceramide-2\n\n\nIngredients of Vanicream daily facial moisturizer:\npurified water, squalane, glycerin, pentylene glycol, polyglyceryl-2 stearate, glyceryl stearate, stearyl alcohol, hyaluronic acid, ceramide EOP, ceramide NG ceramide NP, ceramide AS, ceramide AP, carnosine hydrogenated lecithin, phytosterols, caprylyl glycol polyacrylate crosspolymer-11, 1,2-hexanediol",

    "body": "Skin type: combination, sensitive\n\nSkin concerns: type 1 rosacea - redness mostly on cheeks and chin, sometimes get acne (whiteheads) on chin or around nose\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been using Avene Tolerance Extreme Cream for the past 2 years and it's been my HG moisturizer. It's not the most hydrating but provides me with occlusion and never caused any breakouts or irritation. Unfortunately it has been discontinued and I desperately need to find a new moisturizer because I'm almost out of the Avene one. I've been considering buying the Etude House Soon Jung 2x Barrier Intensive Cream and three from a Polish brand BasicLab (ingredient lists are below).  Do you think that any of these moisturizers would be appropriate for my skin. Does any of the ingredients strike you as irritating or acne triggering?\n\nIf you think that none of these are suitable for me, can you recommend something that might be? I try to  avoid hyaluronic acid and niacinamide because they sometimes make my skin flare up so any product without them I would greatly appreciate. I live in Europe so I may not have access to some American or Korean products.\n\nHere are the ingredient lists of the moisturizers that I mentioned:\n\nEtude House Soon Jung 2x Barrier Intensive Cream:\n\n *Water, Propanediol, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Cetearyl Alcohol, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Potassium Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Butylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA* \n\nBasicLab Calming Moisturizer with 5% prebiotics and 1% Centella Asiatica\n\n *Aqua, Tripelargonin, Dicaprylyl Ether, Cetearyl Glucoside, Inulin,  Glyceryl Stearate, Propanediol, Shea Butter Ethyl Esters, Pentylene  Glycol, Sorbitan Olivate, Trehalose, Jojoba Oil/Macadamia Seed Oil  Esters, Alpha-Glucan Oligosaccharide, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside,  Phytosphingosine, Ceramide NP, Ceramide AP, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic  Acid, Oleic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Centella Asiatica Leaf Extract, Ectoin,  Resveratrol, Phytosteryl Macadamiate, Stearic Acid, Hydrolyzed  Hyaluronic Acid, Phytosterols, Tocopherol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Potassium  Cetyl Phosphate, Helianthus Annus Seed Oil, Squalene, Carrageenan,  Hydroxyacetophenone, Citric Acid* \n\nBasicLab Moisturizer with Trehalose (&gt;5%)\n\n *Aqua, Dibutyl Adipate, Shea Butter Ethyl Esters, Gluconolactone,  Saccharide Isomerate, Trehalose,  Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol,  Propylheptyl Caprylate, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Cetearyl Alcohol,   Acetyl Octapeptide-3, Allantoin, Arginine, Borago Officinalis Seed Oil,  Persea Gratissima Seed Oil, Cannabis Sativa Seed Oil, Vitis Vinifera  Seed Oil, Glucose, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, Cetearyl Glucoside,  Sorbitan Oleate, Sorbitan Palmitate, Cetyl Palmitate, Citric Acid,  Sodium Citrate, Xanthan Gum, Hydroxyacetophenone* \n\nBasicLab Ceramide Moisturizer with 5% prebiotics and 3% Panthenol\n\n *Aqua, Squalane, Tripelargonin, Inulin, Panthenol, Cetearyl Alcohol,  Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Pentylene Glycol, Alpha- Glucan  Oligosaccharide, Ceramide NP, Ceramide AP, Phytosphingosine, Sodium  Lactate, Sodium PCA, Arginine, Glycine, Fructose, Urea, Niacinamide,  Saccharide Isomerate, Borago Officinalis Seed Oil, Persea Gratissima  Oil, Vitis Vinifera Seed Oil, Allantoin, Cannabis Sativa Seed Oil,  Tocopherol, Inositol, Glucose, Lactic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate,  Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Hydroxyacetophenone, Sodium Citrate,  Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've noticed a lot of oils in the BasicLab ones. Are they the kind of oils that are comedogenic or irritating?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",
