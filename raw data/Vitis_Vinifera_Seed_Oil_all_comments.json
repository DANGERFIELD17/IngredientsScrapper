    "body": "Waitrose have a skin/hair care line called 'Pure' which is fragrance free, hypoallergenic, cruelty free and uses mostly 'naturally derived' ingredients, whatever that means. It's also really cheap, and regularly on offer. I know this isn't a hair care sub, but their shampoo and conditioners are fab, and extremely good value. The dry/damaged conditioner is how I make it up to my hair for bleaching it to all hell. \n\nAnyway, I got a few of the skincare products a few months ago when they were doing 3 for 2. They're now on 1/3 off, so I thought I'd post some mini-reviews. \n\nI would describe my skin as oily, somewhat congested, and quick to anger. It‚Äôs also probably somewhat dehydrated by bad office aircon and just, like, winter in general. \n\n**Waitrose Pure Hydration Hot Cloth Cleanser** RRP ¬£5, currently ¬£3.33\nhttps://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-pure-hydration-hot-cloth/508007-539993-539994\n\n**Ingredients:** Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Candelilla Cera, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Ricinus Communis Seed Oil, Vitis Vinifera Seed Oil, Oryza Sativa Powder, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Triticum Vulgare Germ Oil, Gossypium Herbaceum Seed Oil, Aqua, Tocopherol,  Lecithin, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Phytate\n\n**Verdict:** God, I wanted to like this. I love hot cloth cleansers, and this one was so simple and cheap - and it even comes with a cloth! However, the rice powder totally ruins it for me - using a face cloth is exfoliating enough, and I don‚Äôt want even a gentle scrub on my face. If you are super into scrubbing your face, this might be perfect - it‚Äôs not going to rip you to shreds like walnut shells, and it‚Äôs not illegal  and murderous like microbeads. \n\nI was very sad about this until I realised that what I did now have was a super-luxurious body scrub. I used it the other day - I spent a long time massaging it into dry skin before taking a hot shower and washing it all off with a sponge. Because the cleanser‚Äôs so rich, my skin was very soft and moisturised afterwards, and a couple of days later the patches of KP I had were almost gone. I might do it again next weekend - it‚Äôs not really a weekday type thing because rubbing it all in takes ages, washing it all off also takes ages, and they‚Äôre both kind of the point (it‚Äôs sort of like a soothing diy massage) so you don‚Äôt want to hurry it.\n\n**Waitrose Pure Hydration Facial Oil** RRP ¬£5, currently ¬£3.33\nhttps://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-pure-hydration-facial-oil/862289-541045-541046\n\n**Ingredients:** Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Vitis Vinifera Seed Oil, Shea Butter Ethyl Esters, Gossypium Herbaceum Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil,  Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Prunus Persica Kernel Oil, Tocopherol, Citric Acid\n\n**Verdict:** Blergh. I sometimes do really well with facial oils - I really love the Boots Botanics Organic one - but this was just a nope all round. Bar the absence of smell, it just feels like I rubbed coconut oil into my skin. I shine with a thin film of grease. I might try it on my hair, maybe? Or try doing the OCM with it? I will say this, the packaging‚Äôs nice - a lovely frosted glass bottle - so I suppose if nothing else I can empty it out and put other things into it. As you can see, I‚Äôm trying really hard to find positives here.\n\n**Waitrose Pure Hydration Day Cream SPF 15** RRP ¬£5, currently ¬£3.33\nhttps://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-pure-hydration-day-cream-spf-15/450717-539849-539850\n(It says ‚Äòthis product is unavailable‚Äô but it‚Äôs definitely for sale in multiple shops.)\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua (Water), Zinc Oxide (Nano), Coco-caprylate/Caprate, Shea Butter Ethyl Esters, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Olivate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Sorbitan Olivate, Propanediol, Cetyl Alcohol, Simmondsia Chinesis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Titanium Dioxide (Nano), Phenoxyethanol, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Aluminum Stearate, Sodium Phytate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Isostearic Acid, Alumina, Methylpropanediol, Tocopherol, Sodium Hydroxide, Gossypium Herbaceum (Cotton) Seed Extract, Lecithin, Polyglyceryl-3 Disostearate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Glyceryl Stearate\n\n**Verdict:** Hell to the yeah. I really really love this moisturiser, and have just rebought it as I‚Äôm getting near the bottom of the jar and it‚Äôs on offer again. I think it‚Äôs just that my skin is a big fan of zinc oxide, since I find that Sudocrem also calms my skin down a whole bunch. It‚Äôs thick and creamy, and feels very protective against the winter wind, and it‚Äôs the only thing that seems capable of withstanding a day in the weird dry recirculated air in my office. It‚Äôs not every day you find a physical-only sunscreen for such a low price, either, even if it is only SPF15. There‚Äôs a slight whiteness as you rub it in, and people with darker skin tones might find it leaves a cast - I‚Äôm not sure, as I haven‚Äôt noticed one, but my underlying skin colour‚Äôs quite pale and so it‚Äôs not always visible on me. On days when I especially don‚Äôt care about ruining the SPF aspect (ie most days right now because it‚Äôs deepest winter and I‚Äôm barely leaving the house anyway) I will often mix in a bit of Sea Kelp Bioferment. \n\nThe Pure Natural line is even cheaper. In particular, I think it‚Äôs great that they offer some really basic thick face creams with no fragrance. I‚Äôm probably going to try out their SLS free face wash at some point.",

    "body": "Let's review a soap some of you didn't know existed or probably didn't even give a thought about trying. Which is fine because we all do it, myself included. \n\nOfficina Artigiana Milano Stay Traditional, from here on out it will be mentioned as OAM is a shaving soap out of Italy. They are relatively new maybe a year or two old but new in the soap world. Their main focus on their soap is the \"5 Wellness Oils\" they use which are: *Jojoba, Argan, Almond, Grapeseed, and Castor*. Can these 5 oils make a difference in this soap or is it just advertising? \n\n**The Base**\n\nOAM like majority of Italian soaps use a vegan base, this base is a bit more involved with the oils they use. The ingredients are:\n\n> Aqua (Water), Stearic Acid, Cocos Nucifera Oil, Castor Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Parfum (Fragrance), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Oil, Vitis Vinifera Seed Oil, Sodium Hydroxide, Linalool\n\nAs you can see not too complicated but lots of oils in this so for a vegan soap a bit more appealing to me than something loaded up heavy on coconut oil that drys my face out faster than hungover thirst. \n\n**The Scent**\n\nOAM as of now has 2 scents and their packaging is pretty plain so may be hard to distinguish the two and both scents are very different. The one I'm reviewing is Stay Traditional and the scent profile is: \n\n> The fragrance chosen for the Officina Artigiana Stay Traditional shaving line is citrusy, with predominant notes of grapefruit softened by lemon peel on a bed of peach and wild strawberries. The central notes are ozonic and saline that close dancing on a base of white musk.\n\nTo my nose off the tub I get the grapefruit and lemon followed by strawberry. I honestly wish I got more peach than strawberry but it's a nice citrus scent. A bit of a change up from the citrus scents you see in most soaps. \n\n**Presentation/Packaging**\n\nThis is where OAM shines, the jar is a very large and heavy glass jar with a metal lid. If anyone is familiar with Abbate Y La Mantia Krokos it's the same jar as that. For reference the mouth of this jar is about the same as the outside diameter in your standard Parkway or Colt jar. So this is big and luckily it's also filled with 5oz of soap with a unique \"floral pattern\" from the fill nozzels that they use. All of this is packaged in a thick card stock box with ingredients, scent profile, and instructions/tips. \n\nI think this a nice bonus and standout but I've seen other nice containers but the soap lathers like shampoo. Is this one of those? \n\n**Price**\n\nAll mentioned above OAM comes in a price at $25 USD, $32 CAD, ¬£18.00 or ‚Ç¨20. A little high but the glass jar, the amount of soap and shipping from Italy to vendors it's not too bad I think. Definitely not a cheap buy but some artisan soaps are much more than this.\n\n**Loading & Lathering**\n\nLike most Italian soaps they are on the softer side, OAM is one of those at a medium soft firmness. But it's not super soft, you can easily load it right off the puck. One thing I will suggest is because of the design from filling the jar I'd flatten the soap with a spoon, just because I found I got a lot of water sitting in the side of the jar. If you bowl lather or scoop and smear this is easy enough to do it. \n\nOne thing you may see with OAM soaps is they mentioned to give this soap extra water. For me this is no problem and honestly it was super easy to get this to lather and get a lather I like to shave with. The need for extra water just meant it wouldn't fall apart like i've seen with some Italian soaps.\n\n**The Shave**\n\nNow the good stuff, the lather from OAM provided great slickness and protection. My straight just glided over my face taking any and all hair with it. I did my usual 2 pass shave with some clean up and was quite pleased with the results. An effortless shave is honestly all I ask for with soaps these days. So the performance does go along with the presentation. \n\n**Post Shave**\n\nThe \"5 Wellness Oils\" I'd say do help the post shave feel, most Italian soaps can be a bit drying but this one I had no issue with. Following it up with a splash and a balm per my usual shave routine and my face was feeling nice. Not that overly soft feel you get from some artisan soaps but comfortable if that makes sense. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nYeah this is a good soap, I'm not going to say it's a world beater but it doesn't really disappoint me. I'll get a good shave from it, I'll enjoy it what else is needed? I like my Italian shave soaps, I know how they perform and how to handle them and I'd say this is probably a top Italian soap for me. \n\nBut who is this for? Lets list some point:\n\n* People who want to ball on a semi decent budget. \n* Anyone looking for a quality vegan soap.\n* Someone looking for a more unique/interesting citrus scent. \n* Someone who enjoys Italian soaps.\n\nSo if that's you or what I wrote sounds interesting give it a try.\n\n**Disclaimer: I paid for this with my own money, OAM didn't provide this soap or provide compensation for my review as all thoughts are my own.**",

I'd prefer it to be simple, with no acne triggers, something that emulsifies and is available in Europe (and is cheaper than Asian alternatives). Mineral oil is OK, but Kruidvat didn't have any and was much nicer to use than Nivea (which does have it)... Of course I've tried to find something myself already, but I only find expensive alternatives, or with acne triggers, or something that's not readily available, or someting that is not a true oil cleanser at all. Or something without an emulsifier! It just sucks when something works well and is perfect and then you just can't buy it anymore.\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "body": "I use the inkey list product. I purchased it because I could‚Äôt deal with the photosensitivity and peeling/burning/redness. I live in Arizona.  I have sensitive skin and this hasn‚Äôt broken me out. It has made my lips peel though. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of lip balm. \n\nI‚Äôve been using it for almost two months twice a day with nothing else except for Supergoop‚Äôs mineral matte tinted sunblock during the daytime. I‚Äôm still using the same bottle. I don‚Äôt have to use very much. Product is white and has a moisturizer consistency. Spreads easily. Very little smell unlike the very chemical-smells of TO retinol products. It‚Äôs easy to get too much product out of the little container. \n\nThis gives me similar results to The Ordinary‚Äôs granactive retinoid 2% emulsion that uses an encapsulated form of retinol so it is less irritating. I haven‚Äôt gotten any bad photosensitivity from it which is nice unlike retinol. \n\nThis gave me a lot of smoothness like the ordinary‚Äôs above mentioned product, but I still haven‚Äôt seen a big change in scars. I didn‚Äôt see a big change with my scars or discoloration/uneveness with other retinol products. I don‚Äôt have wrinkles so I can‚Äôt say anything about that. \n\nI wouldn‚Äôt say this is enough alone as a moisturizer if you have dry skin. My skin is normal to dry and I‚Äôm okay with putting on a second layer in areas that are drier. No greasiness. Absorbed by my skin quickly. I‚Äôll probably have to go back to putting my Saturday skin glacial water cream and or my le prunier plum elixir on in the next few months though. \n\nIt‚Äôs really cheap and I like that it gives my skin a poreless look. I think I‚Äôll keep buying it until something nicer comes along without EOs and other irritants.",

        "body": "It seems like your skin really likes one or a combination of the oils they use in this moisturizer. You should look fo products that contain these oils:\n\nFrom highest concentration to lowest concentration: sesame oil, grape seed oil, rosehip oil, macadamia nut oil, mango seed butter\n\nMany moisturizers that have a similar ingredient list to Emollience are quite pricey or hard to purchase in Australia). So while they are not perfect dupes, here are some I found that contain some of the ingredients that you‚Äôre looking for.\n\nKiehl's Centella Sensitive Cica-Cream (A$62)\n- Similar oil ingredient(s): sesame oil\n- Fragrance free.\n\nAesop Mandarin Facial Hydrating Cream (A$55)\n- Similar oil ingredient(s): rose hip oil, sesame oil\n- Contains fragrance: mandarin peel oil, citral, linalool\n\nSukin Australia:\nSukin carries a lot of beauty products that use sesame oil as a main ingredient (within the first 3 ingredients) and rose hip oil just like Skinceutical‚Äôs Emollience. This includes moisturizers, night creams, cleansers, body lotions, etc. In my opinion, their formula looks the closest to emollience. This would be my top recommendation.\n\nIf you can handle fragranced products:\nSukin Purely Ageless Rejuvenating Day/Night Cream (A$17.46)\n- Similar oil ingredient(s): sesame, rose hip, macadamia\n- Contains fragrance: limonene, linalool\n\nIf you prefer fragrance free:\nSukin Sensitive Facial Moisturizer (A$11.95)\n- Similar oil ingredient(s): sesame, rose hip\n- Fragrance free.\n\nAnother option for you could be to purchase premixed or single ingredient face oils that include these ingredients and mix or layer them with any moisturizer. \n\nFor example: Since the Sukin moisturizers don‚Äôt contain grape seed oil, and it seems like there‚Äôs a high concentration of that in Emollience, you could purchase a generic bottle of (face safe) grape seed oil and mix a few drops into the sukin moisturizer of your choice. This would probably mimic Emollience very closely. \n\nExamples of premixed face oils: \n\nPalmers Rosehip Skin Therapy Face Oil (A$17.99)\n- Similar oil ingredient(s): Grape seed, macadamia, sesame, rose hip\n- Heavily fragranced\n- Contains coconut oil\n\ne.l.f. Nourishing Facial Oil (A$13.20)\n- Similar oil ingredient(s): Rose hip, grape seed\n- Fragrance free.\n\nI‚Äôve also heard of people buying all of the single ingredient facial oils they need and mixing a custom bottle for themselves, this would likely be the most inexpensive way to go about it but I don‚Äôt know much about the process. \n\nHope this helps!",

    "body": "Hello r/curlyhair, this is my first post here.\n\nLately I‚Äôve been trying to make my routine more environment-friendly (and hair- friendly!) by switching to solid shampoo. So I‚Äôve purchased the first one that was available to me locally, which was Balade en Provence brand. On paper it seemed great - 100% vegan, ethically made in France, no harsh ingredients (list included below) and all that jazz.\n\nBut after few tries the effects are... underwhelming to say the least. Granted, I‚Äôm aware that after years of using regular shampoos, it takes some getting used to for the hair and scalp to work with milder cleaning agents and that I shouldn‚Äôt give up just yet, but I‚Äôd really love an opinion from curlies who have more experience with shampoo bars than I do. Is it my technique that‚Äôs wrong or is this shampoo just not suited for my hair?\n\nMy complaints/questions are as follows:\n\n- I can‚Äôt get the bar to lather well. I‚Äôve tried both rubbing it against my hair and lathering it in my hands first and then putting it in my hair but in either case the foam disappears very quickly and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve actually washed my hair clean\n\n- I‚Äôm rinsing A LOT, way more than with regular shampoo, but this one seems to make a gummy layer in my hair that doesn‚Äôt wash out with water. When it‚Äôs soaked, my hair feels nice and soft, but once it dries even a little bit, the gummy feeling returns\n\n- My hair takes much longer to air dry, but once it finally does, the length and ends are nice enough, with good definition but my roots still feel a little gummy and look stringy and flat. Not a great look, overall. I can tell that the shampoo is still there, because I can smell it when I run my hands through my hair. How the hell do I get it to rinse?\n\n- Can I still put oil in my hair before washing it with a shampoo bar? I feel like it makes all of the above effects worse.\n\n- Should I cut down on styling products? So far I can‚Äôt imagine a shampoo bar could deal with product buildup well.\n\nAny advice is much appreciated!\n\nFor reference, I have long, fine (but lots of it) 2c/3a type, medium porosity hair and the products I normally use are:\n\n- Garnier Fructis Hair Food Aloe Multi-Purpose Mask\n\n- Boots Essentials Curl Creme\n\n- Umberto Giannini scrunching jelly\n\n- Umberto Giannini Weather Proof Curls finishing cream\n\n- Organix Coconut Water, Hydration Oil for the ends\n\n- walnut oil before washing\n\nAnd the shampoo bar ingredient list:\nCocos nucifera oil, Vitis vinifera seed oil, Aqua, Sodium hydroxyde, Butyrospermum parkii butter, Brassica campestris seed oil, Limonene, Citrus nobilis peel oil, Citrus paradisi peel oil, Citrus sinensis peel oil expressed, Illite, Eugenia caryophyllus bud oil, Pinus sylvestris oil, Eugenol.",

This page explains it well: [https://ethique.com/blogs/how-to/why-are-our-bars-so-much-more-than-other-shampoo-bars](https://ethique.com/blogs/how-to/why-are-our-bars-so-much-more-than-other-shampoo-bars) . The shampoo bar you are using is basically a soap (contains sodium hydroxide) so the pH is likely way too high for your hair. I have also had this issue with Chagrin Valley shampoo bars. I would recommend trying a shampoo bar that does not have sodium hydroxide in its ingredients.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have similar hair to yours and I get good results just cowashing and using a curl cream or mousse.

There are still alcohols and synthetic components in these.\n\nYou‚Äôre starting from too complicated of a controlled perspective. You say you wish to determine what ingredients are subjectively preferred by yourself, and I doubt even the most oil-affluent human on the planet would be able to independently judge each of these 10 ingredients in each bottle. Too much combination happening at once. \n\nAdvice:\nIf you can‚Äôt pronounce an ingredient, don‚Äôt use it. If you were to use your own judgement system and be successful with finding the right oils, you‚Äôd be using natural stuff in the end. Save yourself the time now. \n\nIt was said before, but stay simple. Use your classic base oils, a little essential, and added vitamin E if you‚Äôd like. Parfume and Fragrance typically refers to alcohol-based, and you don‚Äôt want that on your skin or hair. \n\nSpend $50-75 on amazon and you‚Äôll be able to make yourself quality beard oil for at least a few months.",

The package says I should rinse it thoroughly. Am I missing something? I know that I can use a water based cleanser, but the whole point here is to avoid it. \n\nWhat is the correct way to do oil cleansing if your barrier is broken and have a really hard time with cleansing in general? Is it okay to leave some oil cleanser on the skin?",

It's not the most hydrating but provides me with occlusion and never caused any breakouts or irritation.

I try to  avoid hyaluronic acid and niacinamide because they sometimes make my skin flare up so any product without them I would greatly appreciate.

    "body": "Lately I‚Äôve been trying to make my routine more environment-friendly (and dry hair-friendly!) by switching to solid shampoo. So I‚Äôve purchased the first one that was available to me locally, which was Balade en Provence brand. On paper it seemed great - 100% vegan, ethically made in France, no harsh ingredients (list included below) and all that jazz.\n\nBut after few tries the effects are... underwhelming to say the least. Granted, I‚Äôm aware that after years of using regular shampoos, it takes some getting used to for the hair and scalp to work with milder cleaning agents and that I shouldn‚Äôt give up just yet, but I‚Äôd really love an opinion from curlies who have more experience with shampoo bars than I do. Is it my technique that‚Äôs wrong or is this shampoo just not suited for my hair?\n\nMy complaints/questions are as follows:\n\n-I can‚Äôt get the bar to lather well. I‚Äôve tried both rubbing it against my hair and lathering it in my hands first and then putting it in my hair but in either case the foam disappears very quickly and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve actually washed my hair clean.\n\n-I‚Äôm rinsing A LOT, way more than with regular shampoo, but this one seems to make a gummy layer in my hair that doesn‚Äôt wash out with water. When it‚Äôs soaked, my hair feels nice and soft, but once it dries even a little bit, the gummy feeling returns.\n\n-My hair takes much longer to air dry, but once it finally does, the length and ends are nice enough, with good definition but my roots still feel a little gummy and look stringy and flat. Not a great look, overall. I can tell that the shampoo is still there, because I can smell it when I run my hands through my hair. How the hell do I get it to rinse?\n\n-Can I still put oil in my hair before washing it with a shampoo bar? I feel like it makes all of the above effects worse.\n\n-Should I cut down on styling products? So far I can‚Äôt imagine a shampoo bar could deal with product buildup well.\n\nAny advice is much appreciated!\n\nFor reference, I have long, fine (but lots of it) 2c/3a type, medium porosity hair and the products I normally use are:\n\n- Garnier Fructis Hair Food Aloe Multi-Purpose Mask\n\n- Boots Essentials Curl Creme\n\n- Umberto Giannini scrunching jelly\n\n- Umberto Giannini Weather Proof Curls finishing cream\n\n- Coconut Water, Hydration Oil, for the ends\n\n- walnut oil before washing\n\nAnd the shampoo bar ingredient list: Cocos nucifera oil, Vitis vinifera seed oil, Aqua, Sodium hydroxyde, Butyrospermum parkii butter, Brassica campestris seed oil, Limonene, Citrus nobilis peel oil, Citrus paradisi peel oil, Citrus sinensis peel oil expressed, Illite, Eugenia caryophyllus bud oil, Pinus sylvestris oil, Eugenol.",

        "body": "So I was in the exact same boat as you were! From what I‚Äôve read, the issue with most shampoo bars is they‚Äôre highly alkaline due to the saponifying process for the oils, which throws off the pH of your hair and causes the weird feeling you‚Äôre experiencing. This is made even worse if the area you live in has hard water. \n\nTo combat this you can either rinse with apple cider vinegar to try and restore the pH balance of your hair, get a water softener/rinse your hair with filtered water, or you can find a pH-balanced shampoo bar. \n\nI know Ethique‚Äôs bars are pH-balanced, but I can‚Äôt attest to their quality as I‚Äôve never tried them. I‚Äôm currently using HiBAR‚Äôs moisturizing shampoo and conditioner bars and am in love with them. \n\nSource: wanted to be environmentally conscious while following the curly girl method. Hated the gross feeling shampoo bars caused, so I did a ton of research\n\nETA the ingredients for the shampoo I use:\n\nSodium Cocoyl Isethionate (Coconut Oil*), BTMS (Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol (Vegetable Based*)), Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Cetyl Alcohol (Coconut Oil*), Glycerin Stearate (Vegetable Based*), Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Stearic Acid (Vegetable Based*), Cocamidopropyl Betaine (Coconut Oil*), Polyquaternium 7, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Natural Fragrance (derived from essential oils and plant extracts), Natural Pigments.

Sulfoacetate is a milder form of sulfate, which will wash away the silicones, but if you have lots of buildup, it may take more than one wash. If you feel like your hair is pretty ok (mine was limp and felt slick from the buildup), then you should be fine. If you're not sure, then give it two or three washes.",

Better late than never. I feel so bad for how I treated my body in my teens/20s, and my skin is now definitely aging prematurely because of it.\n\nMy main focus has been to help reduce my melasma/hyperpigmentation and reduce a lot of fine lines around my eyes. \n\nI'm building a solid skincare routine and have just started using a Vitamin C cream (not serum) prescribed by a dermatologist. I've never used a cream before (only previously heard of it in serum-form), and I'm not sure how I should incorporate it into my routine... Should I use it after my other actives? It simply says \"use morning and evening on clean, dry skin\". Because it's a cream consistency and not a serum, it makes me think it should come after my serums and before moisturiser, but that would make it one of the last steps in my routine which doesn't feel quite right (and contradicts what it says about applying straight onto clean dry skin).\n\nIt's expensive stuff (the brand is PH Formula) and I'd really like to be getting the best out of the product, so I wondered if anyone could help advise on this. \n\nThe ingredients of the product:\n\n*Aqua (Water), Glyceryl Stearate, Diethylhexyl Adipate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Isohexadecane, Vitis Vinifera Seed Oil, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, PEG-30 Stearate, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Steareth-10, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Fructose, Sodium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Urea, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Allantoin, Maltose, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Lactate, Sodium PCA, PEG-8, Trehalose Tocopherol, Glucose, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Ascorbic Acid.*\n\nBecause my main focus has been on reducing my melasma and hyperpigmentation caused by sun damage, most of the skincare range I am using is the \"MELA\" one, again by PH Formula. It's not cheap, but since I've never done any skincare, I thought investing in something really top notch to get me started was a good idea. I also use a factor 50spf (La Rouche Possay) every day now.\n\nI'd appreciate any tips or advice at all, and thank you in advance! ",

A combination of procedures and at home skincare (btw the homecare products don‚Äôt have to be expensive and always keep in mind that dermatologists and estheticians will try to sell you their expensive products)\nA positive upside in treating your hyperpigmentation is that you will automatically minimize wrinkles and your skin will age slower because of all the sunscreen you‚Äôll hopefully use from now on.\nIf you have any questions feel free to reach out.",

    "body": "Hi! I'm new to Reddit and so psyched I found the curlyhair group on my first day. I wanted to just share my two cents with the group. I read an article recently about the benefits of using \"sulfate-free\" products on your hair and I'm here to preach! My hair has felt not only softer, but healthier over the weeks using this product. \n \n**The Basics**\nEverCurl is Sulfate-Free Curl Care system. Key word ladies, \"SULFATE-FREE!!\"\n\nThe Ingredients (as listed on product): \nAQUA / WATER / EAU ‚Ä¢ CETEARYL ALCOHOL ‚Ä¢ GLYCERIN ‚Ä¢ BEHENTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE ‚Ä¢ CETYL ESTERS ‚Ä¢ ISOPROPYL MYRISTATE ‚Ä¢ QUATERNIUM-80 ‚Ä¢ POLYSORBATE 20 ‚Ä¢ PARFUM / FRAGRANCE ‚Ä¢ PHENOXYETHANOL ‚Ä¢ ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL ‚Ä¢ BENZYL BENZOATE ‚Ä¢ BENZYL ALCOHOL ‚Ä¢ POLYQUATERNIUM-37 ‚Ä¢ PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM / MINERAL OIL / HUILE MINERALE ‚Ä¢ COCOS NUCIFERA OIL / COCONUT OIL ‚Ä¢ VITIS VINIFERA SEED OIL / GRAPE SEED OIL ‚Ä¢ CHLORHEXIDINE DIHYDROCHLORIDE ‚Ä¢ LINALOOL ‚Ä¢ HEXYL CINNAMAL ‚Ä¢ BUTYLPHENYL METHYLPROPIONAL ‚Ä¢ PPG-1 TRIDECETH-6 ‚Ä¢ COUMARIN ‚Ä¢ AMINOMETHYL PROPANOL ‚Ä¢ HIBISCUS ESCULENTUS / HIBISCUS ESCULENTUS SEED EXTRACT ‚Ä¢ CITRUS AURANTIUM DULCIS OIL / ORANGE PEEL OIL\n\n**Price**\nFound this miracle formula for a steal - only $6.99!\n\n\n**Where to Buy**\nI found this gem at a local grocery store. I bet you can pick it up at most CVSs or Walgreens as well. \n\n**How to Use**\nSimple. Apply like any other conditioner and leave in for 2 minutes. Then, Rinse. \n\n**Pros**\nTo put it simply, I have fallen in love with this product! It leaves my curls feeling well nourished and FRIZZ-FREE for most of the day. Since I don't put any gels or creams in my hair after showering(yup, I leave my curls naked), this product does the trick for keeping my hair looking fresh and healthy for the day. \n\n**Cons**\nUnlike the other conditioners I've tried, I noticed my hair is pretty tangled when getting out of the shower with this product. It leaves me dreading the combing routine after the shower a bit more. \n",

    "body": "Hi all! I want to start off by saying I made a major mistake and was reckless, I understand that so please be nice! \n\nThis happened about half an hour ago, I had my macbook air m2 open on my desk and accidentally knocked over a bottle of professional nail polish soak-off (ingredients: Acetone, Tocopheryl Acetate, Vitis Vinifera Seed Oil, Denatonium Benzoate Fragrance, CI 61565 (D&C Green No. 6), CI 47000 (D&C Yellow No. 11)). It poured out about 2-4 fl oz (this is a very rough estimate) all over the key board, gap between the keyboard and screen, and a bit of the bottom of the screen.\n\nI immediately tipped it over to drain the excess liquid and wiped it down with paper towels for a good couple of minutes. I had to keep shutting it off because wiping down the keyboards kept booting the laptop up again.\nI know that acetone is extremely corrosive for plastics and other materials, and a good portion of my keyboard‚Äôs plastics are damaged. There is also a good amount of damage (about 1/3) in the screen. \n\nWhen I was cleaning it off, it seemed to be working, but I know there could be a delay in damage as the acetone could have still been seeping through my computer. \n\nI am setting it aside for the night and in the morning I‚Äôll check it over, and I‚Äôll try to take it to Apple or a third party to evaluate the damage and possibility of repair.\n\nI wanted to see your guys‚Äô opinions on what the possibility of repair might be, though I understand it can‚Äôt be known until I have it checked over by professionals. Does it seem like there is a possibility of repair? I am fine with outside damage as I am mostly concerned with the functionality of the inner-workings. \n\nThanks in advance, I am really devastated.\n\n[Edit]: Hi everyone, thank you for the replies! I got it checked out and decided to just buy a new laptop and transfer the data over! ",

Don't turn it on again.\n\n The absolute best you can hope for is that the Mac still turns on and seems normal aside from the screen being damaged in which case you can use an external monitor. This is the only modest/moderate hope at this point. Don't turn it on in 48 hours again or this glimmer of hope will be at huge risk.\n\nThe logic board is not worth replacing as it's almost the whole cost of the Mac (As is the screen almost the whole cost of the Mac. If everything \"seems\" fine minus the screen the temptation would be to replace the screen, but this would be a mistake since now that the logic board has been exposed to liquid it can take months for things to corrode. If things seem to work fine for 3-6 months with the logic board you could theoretically consider replacing the screen, but unless you have a highly souped up model (more ram, more storage) than the base model it's not worth it.\n\nGetting a baseline M1 MacBook Air from the Apple Refurbished store and selling this on Ebay to a technician is likely your best option unless the Mac still works minus the screen damage and you're OK with using a cheap external monitor turning this into a \"desktop\" computer.",
