    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea?

Sadly, I gave up on facial sunscreen a number of times because they irritated me or made my eyes swell shut. I currently use Dermologica which is really spendy and I am not sure it's coverage is that great, but it's the only thing I can use on my whole face so far.\n\n\nTwo things than help me a lot were cutting out black pepper and using more foundation. Environmental irritants wreck me, it seems. I used to wear moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, power, liquid, more powder and then setting spray. Very heavy coverage, but I realized that pretty much sealing my cheeks off from the world made them finally calm down, or maybe it was something in the primer. I kept at it for a long time, but now use lighter coverage. My cheeks are red, but not nearly as bad. Between that and two laser treatments I think of my problem as under control, but can't go out barefaced. And since age is a trigger I could be unknowingly doomed to the burning sensation and painful cysts Mom had, but try to live like that isn't lurking around the corner. \n\n\n\nI've never been able to use anything anti-aging, so the ideal that a retinol might actually help me is very intriguing. All my current doc will prescribe me is metrolotion, which never helped in the slightest. I might go talk to a derm at my own cost and see if that or rhofade might be good for me.",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

    "body": "If you like videos, [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rwMIm0VlpA) a youtube rendition of this beginner's guide. \n\n----\n\nThis guide has been written based on results from scientific studies as well as HCS community feedback. It's an introduction to haircare that will help most people, but it may not give you all the results you want or may create atypical effects. If you want a more personalized haircare regimen, check out our guide on [common problem troubleshooting](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1km6ui/troubleshooting_common_problems/), visit our [product recommendations page](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/wiki/product_reviews), or post a question thread.\n\nThe basic process for caring for hair is cleansing, conditioning, drying, and then styling. In other words, it is the process of cleaning the hair, protecting it, drying it, and then getting it into the shape you want. Fulfilling you and your hair's needs in these four areas is the objective of a good haircare procedure.\n\n**Cleansing**\n\nMany commercial shampoos have harsh surfactants that degrade the cuticle through abrasion and excessive oil extraction and can even sever protein bonds in the cortex underneath [1][6][9][10]. They function primarily as foamers, emulsifiers (so oils and water can exist in the same bottle without separating), and oil extractors [11]. However they are often used in excess because many people believe in the myth that shampoos with more foam and that leave the hair squeaky clean are better [1][6]. While these harsh surfactants do clean the hair better, our hair doesn't need to be cleaned that well that often. Because of the significant cuticle damage caused by frequent use of these surfactants over time, here are our alternate recommendations:\n\n- buy a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner duo as a starting point. If you’re used to using harsh shampoos, it may take time to adjust to the gentler formula so be patient. \n\n- Try not to wash your hair every day. This strips the natural oils from your scalp that are produced to lubricate the hair shaft and exposes your hair to more damaging agents [6]. However, it is also possible to [exacerbate any scalp conditions you have](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/668qkd/scalpama_we_are_a_team_of_scientists_working_in/) by not washing *enough*. Wash cycles will be a very personal thing, so experiment with different lengths of time in between washes for a couple weeks to see what works for you. On off days you can keep your hair dry, wet and massage it in the shower, or wash with conditioner.\n\n- If this still feels too harsh for your hair, check out [co-washing](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1m0g7c/conditioner_only_method_cowashing/). This is a method of cleaning and nourishing the hair only with conditioner and is helpful for people with excessively fragile and dry hair and sensitive scalps. \n\n- If you're co-washing or use any styling products, also use a stronger clarifying shampoo every few weeks\n\nFor more details on different kinds of cleansing, check out [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1vw6sz/big_giant_super_basic_eli5_guide_to_cleansing/) post. \n\n**Conditioning**\n\nConditioners protect the hair by smoothing down the cuticle, which reduces the chance for damage and makes the hair shaft softer, more combable, and more manageable [3][4]. It also reduces moisture loss. Conditioners can be applied in the shower, after washing while hair is wet or dry, and in a concentrated amount as a deep conditioner before washing. You may find benefit by using one kind, or all three depending on your hair's susceptibility to damage (e.g. it's thinner, you heat style, you live at higher elevations with more UV exposure, etc.) and porosity. \n\n- In-shower conditioners are the most common and are often formulated as part of a pair with a shampoo. \n\n- Leave-in conditioners, or conditioners you add after washing, are very helpful if you plan on doing any sort of styling. Look for something light if you have thin hair that is weighed down easily, like a thin liquid or a spray that doesn't have heavy silicones or other conditioners. Thicker hair can stand up to and may even require heavier conditioners like cremes or liquids with more viscosity. \n\n- Finally, deep conditioners typically have the strongest effect, hence their name. If your hair still feels dry or rough, try a commercial or natural deep conditioner formula once every one to two weeks. Depending on the amount of conditioning you're looking for and what ingredients you use, you can put it on for a few minutes in the shower, apply it all over your head a couple hours before a wash, or apply it at night, sleep on it using a shower cap or old towel, and wash it out in the morning. Warming the deep conditioner before application increase penetrative abilities for those who have low-porosity hair (cuticle scales lay tight against the shaft). This is also a good chance to take care of the scalp too with antibacterial ingredients. A discussion of natural deep conditioners is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1m014r/info_about_natural_hair_mask_ingredients_pt_1_oils/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1pa93e/info_about_natural_hair_mask_ingredients_pt_2/).\n\n**Drying**\n\nOne of the most common sources of hair damage is heat styling such as hot irons, straighteners, and hot blow dryers [8]. Avoid these as much as possible to avoid the damage they cause (we like natural texture here!). While heat styling may seem like the only way to make your hair look good right now, over time as the condition improves it will most likely look better without the need for heat. *However,* there's some preliminary research that indicates complete air drying also damages the cell membrane complex between cuticle and cortex fibers[5], so here's some drying suggestions to minimize as much damage as possible:\n\n- Towel/shirt drying: Soak up some excess water first by wrapping your hair in a towel for a few minutes, or better yet use a fabric with a finer weave like a cotton t-shirt or satin/silk, as the rough fabric loops on towels can cause friction damage (curlies should visit /r/curlyhair or google \"plopping\" for curl-specific ways to do this).\n\n- air drying: This is best for smoothness and shine, but consider using a protein treatment and/or penetrative deep conditioner from time to time to conserve the integrity of your cell membrane complex and avoid fragility and breakage.\n\n- blow drying: Or, blow dry your hair on a low heat setting after applying a heat protectant with non-volatile silicones, PVP/DMAPA acrylates copolymer, Quaternium 70, and/or hydrolyzed wheat protein as one of the top ingredients [2]\n \n\n**Styling**\n\nStyling regimen is a very personal preference that people tailor to their own unique hair over time, so we won't presume to advise on any specific styling technique here. A few good rules though are:\n\n- avoid products with short-chain alcohols[7]. The short-chain alcohols (SD alcohol, alcohol denat., propanol, propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol) are included in products to decrease drying time and make the product spread more easily, but they also dry out the hair by pulling out moisture. Dry hair is more susceptible to breakage, damage, and frizz. \n\n- \"Good alcohols\" on the other hand include lauryl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, and behenyl alcohol. These are long-chain molecules that act like conditioners by smoothing the hair cuticle. Just be careful not to use too much, as that can make the hair feel weighed down and greasy. \n\n- Silicones have the same conditioning effect, but can be more difficult to wash out and therefor can build up over time with undesirable consequences. Read [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/) post for more information about silicones. \n\n\nAgain, these are tips to help you start out and aren't definitive rules. Some people may not see as much change as they'd like, or may even see negative effects from this routine. Just remember that change in hair quality is a slow process, so be patient for a couple of weeks if you don't see immediate improvement. If after a while your hair still hasn't changed or has taken a turn for the worse, look at our [other care guides](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/wiki/beginner_haircare_guides) or post a question on our sub!\n\n------\n\n*cited sources:*\n\n1.

But ever since getting some high end Western skin care as gifts, I noticed that many of them actually have a lot of fermented/yeasty ingredients in them.\n\nBut I can't find much on the \\~science\\~ or evidence behind why ferments can be good for your skin. But I also wonder, since ferments aren't really a thing that majority of consumers in the Western market are looking out for (like fragrance, rose water, coconut water, rosehip oil, fruit/veggie extracts that have label/experience appeal, but aren't necessarily good for skin), why would these huge companies bother putting ferments in their expensive skin care if they didn't have evidence that they do SOMETHING?\n\nI especially am curious because AB/Korean beauty are sometimes looked down upon as just being trendy and not using ingredients that are scientifically proven to be truly beneficial for skin.\n\nDo you think ferments are legit?

Fermenting antioxidant rich ingredients such as ginseng, green tea etc. breaks down the antioxidants/complex molecules that are beneficial to our skin into smaller molecules, which allows it to be absorbed into the skin easily. Not only that, yeast/bacteria ferments produce additional metabolites (AHAs, peptides) that provide additional benefits such as whitening, hydration, skin repair, you name it!\n\nEdit: forgot to put my favorite fermented product!! I love the Manyo Factory Galactomyces Niacin Special treatment. :) \n\n2nd Edit: here are the links to some scientific literature articles on fermented cosmetics which were found through PubMed!

    "body": "#Rant#\n\nUntil recently, i only used sulphate free shampoos thinking it would be much better for my wavy/curly hair but i always used so much of product (even after dissolving it in water and emulsifying in my hands), they never removed the oil one go either leading me to go for a second rinse which inturn wastes water and it took me so much of time to just shampoo my hair. \n\nI was fear-mongered HARD. I have tried so many sulphate free shampoos and never stuck to one, i was never impressed with any. So many of them i just ended up using on my body because i got bored of them and didn't like them. At first, i believed the \"sUlpHatEs aRe bAd fOR YoU' movie trop and then, when i got to know about the CGM, i got even more afraid of them (double homicide, if i may). But over the past year ive tried some shampoos with sls in them and i always noticed less hairfall.\n\nI have been concerned about my hairfall for years, ive lost the volume i used to have back in school and mom's comments on my hair is just the cherry on cake i need. I am trying my best to feel confident in the hair I have and not letting insecurities affect me yet trying to take care of them and reduce as much of hairfall as possible. \n\nI am, i think, loosing the normal amount of hair its just my brain telling me that I need to immediately rush to the doctor. Lowkey a triggering topic, tbvh. \n\nI am just thankful i started using sulphates again and i dont have any plans to stop. Plus sulphates are better for my oily scalp.\n\n#Review#\n\nPrice- Rs. 149 for 192.5 ml.\n\nINGREDIENTS: WATER SUM LAURETH SULFATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE, DIMETHICONE, FRAGRANCE, C177891/TITANIUM DIOXIDE, GUAR HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, NIACINAMIDE, CASTOR SEED OIL, MICA, COCO-BETAINE, SODIUMBENZOATE, SODIUMHYDROXIDE, HYDROXYCITRONELLAL, HYDROLYZED SOY PROTEIN, HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARETH-6, ACETIC ACID, PEG-100 STEARATE, TRIDECETH-10, TRIDECETH-S SALICYLICACID, LIMONENE, FUMARICACIO PANTHENOL BENZYL SALICYLATE, LINALOOL BENZYLALCOHOL, PENTYLENE GLYCOL AMODIMETHICONE, ALPHA-ISOMETHYL JONONE, CARSONER, GERANIOL, CITRIC ACID CITRONELLOL, COUMARIN, HEXYLENE GLYCOL HEXYL CINNAMAL, GLYCERIN, GLYCOL DISTEARATE (FLL CE552/).\n\nHairtype- wavy/curly, oily scalp, dry ends.\n\nHair care Products- khadi protein mask (once a week), aloe gel (whenever i feel like), livon (trying to finish it up).\nI have stopped oiling completely\n\nI recently shifted L'oreal Dream Lengths Shampoo (because of the rave reviews here) and i think I have finally found the shampoo for me (don't want to jinx). I get less hairfall, it emulsifies easily, i dont need to spend a ton of time rubbing it in to remove any sort of build up and I haven't noticed any dryness of my hair as such. I haven't seen any difference in curls either (NOTE: I dont follow CGM rigorously, i have just picked up a couple of steps that suit me).\n\nI shampoo twice a week, once a week i either do aloeing or apply the khadi mask (an HG btw). Then i wrap my hair in a t-shirt and also wear a satin hair bonnet while sleeping. I have almost stopped using hair ties and only stick to those huge-ass clutchers (clips). I dont use any products after shampooing because i hate the feeling. I'll just sometimes use livon to finish that up but i don't think I'll be able to before it expires.\n\nMy shampoo method- I take a little bit of a shampoo in a mug, add water onto it and pour it on my scalp ONLY. I dont wash my ends everytime i shampoo, like once a week is enough. \n\nStatus- WRP",

Mukti gold herbal hairwash - this shampoo is used by my whole family and my dad especially have seen a drastic change in his hairfall  and we used to have tresseme shampoo before this, bcuz of which we switched onto this herbal hairwash shampoo\n2. A homemade serum after wash (aloevera gel, rose essential oil, glycerine, rose water), this makes my hair smell heavenly nice. Only I use it \n3. Cold pressed coconut oil before hair wash - for 1-2 hr , only me and my mom do the oiling part.\n4. Washing my hair more often - 3 times a week\n\nNow I would like the share the mistakes I used to make which when corrected helped me in hairfall.\n\n+ oiling for long hours -  I used to oil my hair a night before hairwash day. But one of my friend told me that oiling for long hours is one of the major reason of hairfall. So now I make sure that I don't keep oil in my hair for more than 2 hrs.\n\n+ Oiling with the right oil - I used to oil my hair with dabur amla hair oil  after which I switched to pure coconut oil.\n\n+ Diet - I eat 2 soaked walnuts, 10 soaked almonds, 2 soaked anjeer, 2 cashews. I drink anjeer water with anjeer. I have been following this religiously for a very long time. And I believe this has helped immensely in improving my hair texture. \n\n+ Washing my hair after every 2nd day - I have noticed that after every 2nd my hair gets oily and itchy and if I don't wash it the same day. My hair starts to fall out. I sort of wash my hair at every alternate day.\n\nLet me know if you guys have any questions related to this. \n\nHAPPY TO HELP 😊",

It's impossible to last without sulphates. Most CG shampoos also have milder sulphates because they're cleansing agents. Shampoos also tend to have polyquaternium which is a conditioning agent that builds up (certain kinds of Polyquaternium build up more than others). Without sulphates you won't get rid of the buildup and it will lead to poor scalp health. \n\nI use Pantene Lively Clean every once in a while (maybe once a month, twice in the humid summers). It's got \"harsh\" sulphates which strip my hair and scalp clean of all buildup. Unfortunately with really short hair you can't avoid getting shampoo all up in your hair. \n\nAs to whether sulphates cause less hairfall, I won't comment because everyone shair and scalp are different. I found a method that works for me and In glad you could introduce it to your routine too without much issue :) \n\nSulphates and silicones aren't necessarily bad. It's also important to remember that you lose more hair during high humidity conditions. That's normal.",

I'm also an atheist so I got you covered there as well. First, I have to say that I do not regret going to yeshiva, learning gemara and chassidus was intellectually satisfying and the feeling that I got when I did a mitzvah (good deed) was like no other. With that said I had to make a conscious choice. I asked myself a question that I believe EVERYONE should ask themselves, do I value truth over happiness when the two contradict. I chose truth and decided that although I felt fulfilled and important being a frum yid (religious jew) on shlichus I was living in a fictitious world and contrary to what I said above about the contradiction of truth and happiness, I believed following the truth, however bleak it may be, would lead to happiness. \n\nA few things I realized after shaving the beard: \n\nIt is exponentially better to live a life where I can be truthful to myself and to my friends. We can have different opinions and it's not a deal breaker. None of my friends think that if I were to disagree with them I am an apikores (apostate) or even consider cherem (excommunication), we disagree and continue being friends. Furthermore my true friends in Yeshiva stayed my friends even if they disagreed with what I was doing. \n\nLiving a secular life comes with a feeling of empowerment, you decide your values, YOU decide what is right for your kid and how to raise them and not from some ancient document. You'll have added responsibility but you owe it to your family and it will be more real, more truthful.\n\nIf someone rejects you for holding a different opinion, fuck em. \n\nGood luck.\n\ntldr: Get the fuck out!",

Her family attended a conservative synagogue, but was not very serious and was more of one of those 'we do it for the tradition' type families.  And then she went to a orthodox Jewish convention and pretty much abandoned every friend she had, moved out to New York, and is now going to \"Stern College for Women\".  Her parents have often expressed concerns about her path, but essentially from what I can tell she has found a group of people that will give her structure and make her life easy in that she doesn't have to accept the world as it is.  She recently got married to somebody(a male) that she got matched with, and as I understand it they held hands for the first time on her wedding day.\n\n\n1.  How do you feel about the whole touching people and all of the other rules now that you are an atheist.  You mentioned that the deoderant thing was silly, but do you still follow some of the other things out of habit?\nEDIT:  Do you have sex with your wife while she is on her period or within however many days it is?  That was always one of the ones that I thought seemed like nobody would actually follow.\n\n2.  Does it concern you that religion is incredibly persuasive, and that that is what you are raising your children into?  As you see with my friend, your parents raising you in a certain way can have little impact when confronted with something that magically makes the world easier.\n\n\nI understand that this is how you have been raised, but your religion, and all extremist religions are intensely harmful to people.  My viewpoint may not mean much to you, as I am coming from the position of 'your religion took my best friend away from me,' but when you decide what community to surround yourself and your children, consider things like how the community would react if one of your children decided they were gay.",

On the last major exit to Moores/Rouses point off of I-87 is Champlain and that's where people stop and get gas coming from Manhattan to Montreal or vice-versa. As you know (and others reading this may not), our two cities have a close connection with their Jewish communities.\n\nThere are a few gas stations at the exit. Valero, Exxon and Irving.\n\nFor the past 3 times I have been to Irving there have been Hasidic Jews filling up. Irving is not the cheapest, nor is it the most convenient. But I think the name \"Irving\" might appeal.\n\nBut here's the odd part, and it just dawned on me. Every time I am there, these guys are filling up at the exact same pump. The place is dead. It's late at night. They could go to any pump. I wish I thought to see what pump number it is. Superstition?\n\nAFAIK, the founder is not Jewish. This is a coincidence? I think not. Why all the same pump number?\n\nI don't see these folks at the other gas stations. I always go to Valero to get milk and I get myself a drink and a bite at Irving. I have never seen these dudes pump gas anywhere but Irving in the 2 years I have lived here.\n\nAlso, a clerk at the Walmart in Plattsburgh has an ongoing joke with me. One time I was in line and it was taking forever. A group of younger Hasidic guys were buying all of the prepaid cellphones and it was taking a while. After they left, he mentioned this happens all the time. \n\nEvery time I see him, he always tells me about how these guys come in and keep buying phones. Never the same ones, either. Usually Verizon. Do they not know these can be reloaded?\n\nSee, these are just stupid questions that no one could possibly answer. If you can't, laugh at the goyim who are confused, such as myself.\n\nWait, one more. My eldest son. His mom's Jewish, she lives in NYC. Every time he goes to visit her, the orthodox guys try to recruit him/them at the subway. I mean...they're obviously Jewish. But come on, do these guys ever get it wrong?

    "body": "Hey there! So I have extremely damaged hair that is breaking off every time I brush it (got a straight perm when my hair was bleached). In an effort to save my hair, I have learned so much about hair care through research and hair care classes and I wanted to share all the information I’ve gathered!\n\n#Understanding Ingredients in Hair Care:\n\n##Surfactants:\nSurfactants are the main cleansing agents in shampoos. They often end in -ate or “glucoside”.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair. They often end in -entrimonium chloride, -quaternium, or “methosulfate” (note: if an ingredient says methosulfate after a word, it is an **anti-static** NOT a sulfate).\nAnti-static ingredient examples: Behentrimonium chloride, Cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-17, quaternium-22, Behentrimonium methosulfate, etc.\n\n##Ingredients to use with caution:\n**Note: this is NOT a list of ingredients to avoid, but to rather use with caution.**\n\nThat being said, there are some ingredients which I do try to avoid, such as formaldehyde releasing preservatives (Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, and Diazolidinyl Urea).\n\nCocomidopropyl betaine impurities may cause scalp irritation: https://www.healthline.com/health/cocamidopropyl-betaine#how-to-avoid\n\nCoco-Betaine to be used with caution (pg.6-12): https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/alkbet032014final_0.pdf\n\nCocomide DEA and cancer: https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/cocamide-diethanolamine-cocamide-dea-coconut-oil-diethanolamine-condensate\n\nSoyamide DEA irritates unless formulated to be non irritating (21): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581813486300\n\nIsopropyl alcohol or SD alcohol (Volatile alcohols drying in high concentrations): https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/good-alcohols-vs-bad-alcohols\n\nWitch hazel can be drying: https://www.healthline.com/health/witch-hazel-for-hair#safety\n\nTriclosan not recognized as generally safe by FDA: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan\n\nTriethanolamine toxicity: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/706639-TRIETHANOLAMINE-TRIETHANOLAMINE/\n\nPVP/VA mild skin irritation (15-16): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818309140719\n\nIsopropyl palmitate mild skin irritation: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isopropyl-palmitate#section=EPA-Safer-Chemical\n\nQuaternium-15 formaldehyde releasing: https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/quaternium-15/\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate only safe in low concentrations: https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/butylcarbamate_rr.pdf\n\nDMDM Hydantoin and formaldehyde: https://www.chemscape.com/blog/DMDM-hydantoin-shampoo\n(This is the ingredient that OGX got sued over)\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea and formaldehyde: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/701923-DIAZOLIDINYL_UREA/\n\nPolyvinyl acetate insufficient evidence of safety in cosmetic products: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/705158-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE/\n\n#How to use Silicones and Sulfates Properly:\n\nSilicones are great, as they do the following for hair:\n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair shaft, making hair easier to brush and detangle\n\n-Great heat and UV protectant\n\n-Seals in moisture, prevents dryness\n\n-Gives hair a shiny appearance\n\n-Softens and smooths the cuticle\n\n##Silicones to use only if using a strong sulfate shampoo regularly:\n\nThese are very difficult to wash out of hair, even with a sulfate surfactant:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone\n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone\n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone\n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18\n\n-Cetyl Phosphate\n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone -Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n##Volatile silicones:\nThese evaporate after 10 minutes to a few hours after application. (Volatile just means they evaporate quickly):\n\n-Cyclomethicone\n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n##Easy to remove silicones:\nThese condition the hair, provide UV protection, and wash out with sulfate free surfactants:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate)\n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n##Resilient silicones:\nThese silicones can be removed with a sulfate AND some sulfate-free surfactants:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n##Cationic ingredients List:\n(Anti-static ingredients)\nThese ingredients usually end in “-imonium chloride”. These are in basically every conditioner to reduce static in hair:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate (this is NOT a sulfate, it’s an anti-static)\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n#Sulfates:\n\n##Mild Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are best used to remove volatile and easy to remove silicones. They can only remove resilient silicones with multiple washes, unless paired with many different sulfate free surfactants (a shampoo that has 3-4 or these in their ingredients list):\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n-Sodium Cocoate\n\n-Potassium Cocoate\n\n##Sulfate free surfactants that can remove resilient silicones:\n\nThese can remove resilient silicones, but not on their own, so usually a shampoo will use a combination of 2-3 of these:\n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate\n\n##High Strength Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are technically sulfate free, but they are **just** as thoroughly cleansing as sulfates, so they can still strip hair dye. Best used for removing resilient silicones\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n##Sulfates that remove resilient silicones:\n\nStrong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Do not use if you have colored hair, as it will fade your color\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n#Understanding Protein in Hair:\n\nHair is made of protein, proteins are made of amino acids and peptides. Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt’s best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the “feeling” of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this “protein overload” is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair. This just means putting a light weight oil on towel dried hair. I use the OGX coconut milk serum oil as my sealant:\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/coconut-milk-anti-breakage-serum-xlsImpprod2960061\n\n##Protein Products:\n\n**-Hask Keratin Protein Deep Conditioning

sizes.\n\n##The above information about protein and sulfates was found on Science-y Hair Blog!\n\n#Ingredients for Scalp Health:\n\n##Aloe Vera Gel:\n\nAloe is a great natural scalp soother and also helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it’s wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

    "body": "Take a second to look through these photos. Can you tell a difference between the two sides? Which is which? The answer will be in the comments.  \n\nHopefully I got enough pictures with different lighting. These are all different stages of my routine in the morning.\n\n\nSCENT:\n\nIt has been mentioned in this sub that the DT serum smells like pee. For me it has a clean, neutral scent. I would assume those were bad batches. \n\nIf I were to compare the two, I think Kérastase smells better. It also has a pleasant scent that lingers on my hair for a couple hours. DT does not linger, probably because it’s so neutral.\n\nSecond opinion: \nI asked my boyfriend to smell it too without context, he has a more sensitive nose than me. He stated that it doesn’t smell bad, I asked him if it reminded him of anything and he said it doesn’t. I told him that it smells like a clean scent to me and he agreed. \n\nThen I explained the rumor about it on Reddit and he said:\n“No, it doesn’t smell like urine. I am well acquainted” (referencing my dogs lol)\n\nSo do with that information what you will, maybe he’s just being agreeable 😂 but rest assured, you now have two more opinions on the scent. I would say to smell yours before applying to the hair just in case. I’ll update this post if there are any changes as I use it.\n\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\nDollar Tree (from the bottle):\nWATER, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, GLYCERIN, PHENOXYETHANOL, POLYQUATERNIUM-37,\nPROPYLENE GLYCOL, CYCLOHEXASILOXANE, DIMETHICONE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, PEG-20 STEARATE, STEARTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, FRAGRANCE, C13-16 ISOPARAFFIN, TRIDECETH-6 ACOHOL, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) OIL, DIMETHYL STEARANINE, HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN, ARGANIA SPINOSA KERNEL OIL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, PANTHENOL\n\nKérastase (from their website):\nAqua / Water / Eau ● Dimethicone ● C13-16 Isoalkane ● Niacinamide ● Glycerin ● Polyacrylamide ● Phenoxyethanol ● C13-14 Isoalkane ● Laureth-7 ● Panthenol ● Ascorbyl Glucoside ● Butylene Glycol ● Linalool ● Hydroxycitronellal ● Benzyl Salicylate ● Benzyl Alcohol ● Hexyl Cinnamal ● Citronellol ● Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein ● Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone ● Coumarin ● Hydrolyzed Corn Protein ● Hydrolyzed Soy Protein ● Limonene ● Iris Florentina Root Extract ● Citric Acid ● Ci 19140 / Yellow 5 ● Ci 14700 / Red 4 ● Parfum / Fragrance\n\nOne notable difference in the ingredients is the addition of niacinamide in the Kérastase. Niacinamide is supposed to promote hair growth when used on the scalp. But if you are anything like me, I don’t apply serums all the way to the scalp, I start them from about the middle of my hair through the ends. \n\nBased on this, I do not believe niacinamide is especially helpful in the Kérastase. Niacinamide is probably more helpful in shampoos and scalp products (And now I’m tempted to use a certain DT niacinamide/squalane serum in my hair instead of on my face 🤣)\n\n\nPRICE:\n\nKérastase: $60/3.04 fluid oz, or $19/oz\n\nDollar Tree: $1.25/4 fluid oz, or 31¢/oz\n\n\nTEXTURE:\n\nI put these next to each other on the back of my hand. Kérastase has more of a serum feel, it’s clear/yellow upon application, and it has a little more of an oily texture. DT starts out a little thicker and looks white/creamy at first, then it blends out to be sheer. With both products, I rub them between my hands before applying to hair. \n\n\nMETHOD:\n\nLast night I did my normal shower routine, including a clarifying shampoo and a moisturizing conditioner. I’ve been using this particular duo of products for about 6 months. \n\nI let my hair dry for a couple of hours and applied one serum on each side, washing my hands between applications. Then I put my hair in braids for the night. I didn’t use any other leave-in products before taking pictures.\n\nIn the morning I took out the braids, hand-combed them, brushed through them, and then did some touch-ups to the ends with my curling iron, taking pictures throughout every step. \n\nSo let me know what you think and I’ll put my final thoughts in the comments!

Both sides of my hair look shiny and hydrated. The ends feel great. They are equally manageable. The dollar tree side MIGHT have a little more shine to it, or it could be the angle of my camera.\n\nI seriously can’t tell a difference besides the fragrance (I had to keep smelling each side to make sure I had them right) and the fragrance is not worth $58.25 to me. So you know where I’ll be spending my money.",

But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/​Vinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only.

Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles.

I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember.

I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above.

I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

        "body": "i'd bet MONEY that the glycerin is the biggest factor, followed by the fact that there are so many more \"sealing\" type ingredients in the second one - the first one is probably doing a lot to reduce combing/brushing friction and static, using silicones to add in some shine, and adding a small amount of hold to help with manageability and frizz, while the second seems like it's more trying to hold onto actual water than create the properties that we as consumers think of as \"moisturized\" (softness, smoothness, manageability, etc). the glycerin is a humectant, meaning it attracts water and holds onto it, and all those oils could initially form a thin barrier to keep that water inside the hairs. that being said, the actual water stuff seems to be genuinely important for some types of hair, particularly very curly natural hair, even if it has little to do with how we imagine \"moisturized\" hair feeling. use whichever product gives you hair that feels and looks the way you like it; neither one is objectively better or worse. i much prefer creams closer to the first one, because my hair dries super slowly already and i'm sort of instinctively resistant to any marketing that pushes \"natural ingredients\" as a selling point, but whatever you prefer is what's best for you!",

Personally I don't believe in preformulated water based ascorbic acid products. Even when it's fresh the amount of studies that prove that vitamin c really works topically is quite limited. Vitamin c penetrates skin rather poorly. There simply is no standardization to prove the effectiveness of a specific formula, unlike sunscreens and retinoic acid. Shelf life is no indication of the stability of actives and doesn't say anything about it's stability on skin. Ascorbic acid is simply notoriously unstable, it's more likely to degrade on skin and be irritating. From all the research available today, the best efficient way to get ascorbic acid in skin is to just take it orally.\n\nBeneficial actives in bold, potential irritants in italic/stripethrough\n\n**Water based products**: below pH3.5 the ionic charge of AA is removed ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5605218/)), improving skin penetration and stability, but water based products remain extremely unstable ([ref](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/7291637/stability-of-vitamin-c-derivatives-in-solution-and-topical-formulations/3),[ref](https://skinelegance.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/CSBM_-Skincare-theories-busted-Dec-2014.pdf)), most companies don't store their product in fridges in warehouses, it isn't unlikely products are severely oxidized by the time they arrive at your home\n\n* [€18/50mL - Skinlex 20%](https://www.skinlex.com/product/20-vitamin-c-serum-30ml/)\n  * **pH:** 3-3.3\n  * **Pros:** simple irritant free formula, right pH, pump is convenient compared to pipet, light serum, inexpensive\n  * **Cons:**  pump is not airless, concentration other actives unknown, instability, the look and feel of website and adress of company make me doubt if it's really formulated by a well educated cosmetic chemist\n  * **INCI:** Water, **20% L-Ascorbic Acid**, Butylene Glycol, **Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin**, *Triethanolamine*, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol.\n\n* [€28/50mL - SkinPep C15](https://skinpep.com/super-c15-serum/)\n * **pH:** 4.3\n  * **Pros:** Great blend of actives, light serum, shared concentrations\n  * **Cons:** pH is too high, dropper, instability, incorrect ingredient order (Propylene Glycol)\n  * **INCI:** Aqua, **15% l- Ascorbic Acid, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-3, Panthenol**, Hydrolyzed Collagen, **1% Alpha Tocopherol, 0.5% Ferulic Acid**, Glycerin , *Triethanolamine*, Phenoxyethanol, *2% Propylene Glycol*, Ethoxydiglycol, Laureth-23\n\n* [€34/50mL -Wishtrend 21.5 Advanced Serum](http://www.wishtrend.com/skin-care/1215-pure-vitamin-c215-advanced-serum-by-wishtrend.html)\n * **pH:** unknown\n  * **Pros:** Simple irritant free formula\n  * **Cons:** concentration is a bit high, dropper bottle, lack of stabilizers, not many actives \n  * **INCI:** Hippophae Rhamnoides Water (70%), **Ascorbic Acid** (21.5%), Sodium Lactate, 1,2-Hexanediol, **Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol**, Cassia Obtusifolia Seed Extract, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol\n\n* [€41.60/50mL - SkinActives 15%](http://www.skinactives.com/Vitamin-C-Serum-Ascorbic-Acid-L.html)\n * **pH:** 1.5-2.5\n  * **Pros:** Airless pump!, great blend of actives, not very expensive, no propylene glycol, ph is low enough for penetration, skinactives is busy with a reformulation without the citrus extracts.\n  * **Cons:** ph is irritating, according skinactives not suited for daily use, lack of stabilizers like water reducing agents, recrystalizes quickly.

I've been debating with myself wether to put this on the good or bad list. In my opinion there are a lot of uncertainties about the stability of diy formulas, especially if you start mixing it through existing products. Even destilled water contains impurities that will react with ascorbic Acid, and many people don't use water reducing agents, or stabilizers like propyl gallate, sodium metabisulfite, chelators etc. A low pH, vitamin E, Ferulic acid help of course, but I don't think many people really understand the exact chemical reactions going on and don't have analyzers like they do in labs, so how certain can you be about your own creation. Most often DIY formulas also just recrystallize on skin. Formulating an ascorbic acid serum really is difficult, it is more than just dissolving some ingredients in water. Dissolving in TO Ferulic Acid will be difficult since maximum solubility in Propanediol is just 5%, in contrast to 33% in water. The key here is to make it fresh every 1-3 days I guess.\n  * [€5.80/20g TO Powder](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-100pct-l-ascorbic-acid-powder-20g?redir=1)\n  * [€89 /20mL Philosophy Turbo C booster](https://www.sephora.com/product/turbo-booster-c-powder-P204606)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Anhydrous formulas**: best stability, but not much research on penetration\n\n* [€9.60/50mL - The Ordinary C23](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-vitamin-c-suspension-23pct-ha-spheres-2pct-30ml?redir=1)\n  * **Pros:** Cheap, anhydrous (stable), together with TO Ferulic+Resveratrol a very affordable good combo\n  * **Cons:** No other actives,  no vitamin E, relatively unpleasant texture, stinging, for me too thick/greasy for daytime use.

The reviews on Sephora have been fantastic and it has 20% THD ascorbate (which they call a mega-potent, ultra stable form of vitamin c. They claim that the THD ascorbate is 50x more powerful than traditional vitamin c (I am skeptical and what are they referring to with “traditional vit c”).  Also has 3% vitamin E and 2% ferulic acid. The only negative I read in the reviews is people saying it was not ideal for dry skin types. Do you have any experience with this? \n\nPS- thank you so much for your comprehensive list, it is much appreciated!!

It doesn't use a dropper, I have a bottle and it's an airless pump.\n____\n\nAlso about The Ordinary, I have information about its penetration ability if you'd like:\n\n\nA quote from Brandon Truaxe:\n> In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.\n\nThat means that with TO Vit C 23%, your skin is only using about 2%, while L-AA's max absorption rate is 20%.",

    "body": "You want to know if it worked...I'm burying the lede here. Stay with me though.\n\nI have not had a chance to read the papers K18's team wrote in the last 10 years, so I decided to do this \"part 1\" with current results, then a part 2 with paper/patent comments plus how my hair fared in an upcoming bleaching service.\n\nK18 is a post-wash leave-in treatment applied on towel-dried hair. The claim is \"...molecular breakthrough clinically proven to reverse hair damage in 4 minutes\" from bleach, dyeing, heat, other chemical services like perms.\n\nAnd\n\n>Traveling into the inner-most layers of hair to reach the core polypeptide chains (keratin chains), our revolutionary K18Peptide™ is just the right size and makeup to fit in and reconnect broken chains.\n\nIngredients as of this writing:\n\nWater, Alcohol Denat., Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Ether, Cetyl Esters, Behentrimonium Chloride, Polysorbate 20, sh-Oligopeptide-78 (K18Peptide™), Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Starch, Isopropyl Alcohol, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Fragrance, Geraniol, Linalool, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Alcohol.\n\nIt is sold in 5 ml sample sizes or 50 ml full size. The pump pushes out about 1ml of product and anywhere from 1 to 4+ pumps is needed for the treatment depending on hair length, volume, & strand thickness. The lotion goes over clean but not conditioned towel-dried hair. Once applied, it needs to sit on hair for 4 minutes before using any other product.\n\nThe instructions are to use every time you wash your hair for 4 to 6 washes. If using a lot of product (no explanation on how 'heavy product use' is defined), the website text recommends a clarifying shampoo before application. After the initial 4-6 applications, the rate is 1 application every 3 to 4 washes.\n\nPros (and DOES IT WORK?):\n\nK18 improved the look and feel of my bleached hair ends, and the hair ends curled with no coaxing needed and felt soft/shiny again. The time my hair takes to dry without products shortened by 1.5 hours. Frizz diminished. Squishing my hair after washing produced less water. And I got to day 4 curly hair, which had not happened to me, ever.\n\nI saw significant change after application #4. I had committed to doing 6 washes/applications, so I continued. Areas of my hair that had been bleached more than the rest showed improvement last.\n\nLike Olaplex, K18 does something good, but I cannot state that it does what it claims (insert peptide chain in cortex, have peptide chain chemically link up bits and pieces in cortex). I did not test elasticity.\n\nK18 significantly improved hydrophobicity. Based on the list of ingredients I bet there is heavy adsorbtion of cationics going on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLess pro, but not cons:\n\n1. The amount to apply is tiny, and spreading it throughout the hair is challenging because one cannot see where product has been applied versus where it has not, plus the product is all over your palms, so cannot feel, either. For my hair I needed 4-5 pumps (4-5 ml), so I applied in sections, ends first, and hoped for the best.\n2. For people whose curly hair routine includes putting styling products in sopping wet hair, or not touching curls, using K18 requires rethinking all that as it is applied on clean towel dried hair, and must  be applied before any other hair product.\n3. If you co-wash, I would suggest using a shampoo that does not deposit much of anything on the hair prior to using K18\n4. The dosing chart is hidden on the product page (you must select the accordion chevron--the arrow pointing down-- to the right of \"how to use\"  to see the text)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAssorted: If buying the 50 ml product in the US, your cost is $1.50/pump. The 5 ml sample cost is $2.40/pump. Also, their customer service answered my questions pretty fast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWill I buy again? \n\nEDITED 5 /8 / 2022: Link to Part 2: [https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/ule42z/k18\\_my\\_experience\\_part\\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/ule42z/k18_my_experience_part_2/)",

    "body": "I have dry, eczema-prone skin, some light rosacea, and a couple of diagnosed skin allergies.  Here are reviews of the empties that have been in my bathroom recycling bin for the past few months:\n\nLa Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5 - At the start of winter my skin went crazy.  I picked this up in a moment of desperation.  I'm so glad I tried this stuff.  It was a great night time occlusive.  It also made a great daytime moisturizer/primer on makeup days.  WRP\n\nInkey List Snow Mushroom Moisturizer - The first time I tried this my skin was tight, dry and itchy by late afternoon.  It's probably fine, but it's not for me, it's probably better suited for oily skin types.  I used it up by adding an oil to it.  The lesson I learned here is that I need to stop being enticed by pretty sounding ingredients.  WNRP\n\nMay Coop Raw Moisturizer - I picked this up at TJ Marshall's just before I was diagnosed with a number of allergies (fragrance high among them) in 2018.  The amount of fragrance in this stuff is eye watering.  I used this up on my feet and lower body.  After being fragrance free for over a year, I can't believe that once upon a time I would have used this stuff on my face...  WNRP\n\nCeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream - I've been through numerous jars of this cream.  It's a good stand alone product for my dry skin, it doesn't require the addition of oils or anything else to make it work.  I wish it was a little less pricey, but it's totally worth it to me.  I pick it up when it's on sale.  WRP\n\nPaula's Choice Lip & Body Treatment Balm - It's a great lip balm.  But there are lots of great lip balms out there.  I probably wouldn't have purchased this on my own, it was a free gwp, and I'm glad I tried it.  It's nicely moisturizing and fragrance-free.  Once I go through the million other lip balms I have laying around I'll probably circle back to this one.  WRP\n\nBenton Cacao Moist and Mild Toner - I picked this up when I was having moisture barrier issues.  It really is nice and mild, not particularly moisturizing though.  I'd say it's on par, maybe a step below, the Etude House SoonJung Toner.  WNRP\n\nMissha Near Skin Phyto Azulen Cream - This was just ok.  My skin didn't feel particularly calmed by this moisturizer, but it wasn't irritated either.  The packaging was annoying, it's an old school aluminum tube.  I may have liked it more had I tried it during the summer.  WNRP\n\nCosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence - I will buy this stuff as long as it's being produced.  It really is soothing.  This makes a good mixing medium for cocktailing serums that are too irritating to be put directly on my skin (vitamin C's and some retinols) and other random (mostly TO) serums that I'm trying to use up before expiration.  WRP\n\nCSI Collagen Nourish Anti-Wrinkle Serum - The ingredients list looked promising: Chondrus crispus (seaweed) extract, purified water, hyaluronic acid, pseudoalteromonas ferment extract, hydrolyzed wheat protein, hydrolyzed soy protein, tripeptide-10 citrulline, tripeptide-1, phenoxyethanol and ethylhexylglycerin.  This was ok at first.  But something irritated me while I was using this.  I stopped using it (and nearly everything else) for about a month, when I went back to try it again, it had gone cloudy, so I didn't finish it.  There are other peptide serums that I know and love.  WNRP\n\nMissha Time Revolution Night Repair - I've been using this stuff for years, it's something I always come back to.  It's a good basic all around serum.  I use it both day and night.  Missha has a number of sales throughout the year.  WRP\n\nThe Ordinary Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate Solution 20% in Vitamin F - I gave TO's 23% Vitamin C a bunch of chances, but it totally messed me up.  This was a much friendlier alternative for my skin.  I didn't usually use it neat, since it was and oil I usually added it to a moisturizer or a moisturizing serum.  WRP\n\nThe Ordinary 100% Organic Virgin Chia Seed Oil - I have really dry skin, and this winter was especially bad.  I use a lot of different types of oils.  I went through this one very quickly, it was nice.  I'll probably pick it up again in the future after I finish everything else up.  WRP\n\nThe Ordinary \"B\" Oil - I wanted to like this.  But I had some irritation while I was using this.  I'm not sure if this was the culprit, but it does have rosemary.  I did finish it, mixed in with moisturizer.  But there are plenty of other oils that I like and that I'm 100% sure of.  WNRP\n\nLotioncrafter Neossance Squalane - I've tried The Ordinary, Acure, and a sample of Drunk Elephant.  I can't say I noticed a major difference between any of them.  This one is cheapest and works just as well as any of the others.  I'll stick to this one or The Ordinary.  WRP\n\nVMV Hypoallergenics Red Better Deeply Soothing Cleansing Cream - I picked this up when my skin was recovering from an allergic reaction.  It's just ok.  Nothing from this brand has been worth the high price tag in my opinion.  The CeraVe non-foaming cleanser works just as well.  And the Paula's Choice Moisture Boost One Step Cleanser is even better than the CeraVe.  WNRP",

    "body": "This is a pretty long review that I have been adding to and compiling for a long time, so please bear with me. Hair and climate details are:\n\n**Hair and scalp type:**\n\n3A/2C curls, very dry and course strands, low-porosity, silicone and protein sensitive, oily scalp. I am not sensitive to fragrance, and find the fragrance of these products very mild. However that might be different for other people.\n\n**Climatic conditions:**\n\nHot and Humid.\n\n**Age range:**\n\nTwenties.\n\n**Usage timeline:**\n\nThe Moisture Duo have been my favourite styling products for about two years now.\n\nThe Protein Duo was bought approximately a year ago and has been used intermittently for 6-8 months since then.\n\nThe Wash-Day products were also bought at around the same time, and I have regularly used the Cleansing Shampoo and the Conditioner every wash-day since.\n\n# ✨Wash-Day Bundle✨\n\n# 🔹Cleansing Shampoo\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua),Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Panthenol, Polyquaternium -7, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-73, Fragrance, Apple Cider Vinegar, Disodium EDTA, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Oil, Polyquaternium -10, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick gel that lathers into a thick foam.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit while massaging into hair, completely washes off on rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nIt is sulphate-free so it is only mildly cleansing. If you are not prone to a lot of build-up and don’t have dandruff, this is good enough. Does not strip off moisture from the hair strands and doesn’t dry out the scalp either. I use this as my regular shampoo and use a sulphate shampoo every once in a while to clarify any build-up since this shampoo isn’t enough for me.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nEven though this is a cleansing shampoo, the website clearly states that this is not a Clarifying Shampoo. They actively encourage using a sulphate shampoo if you are prone to build-up, which I thought was a refreshing change from the usual marketing of sulphate-free shampoos.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n## 🔹Everyday Moisturising Shampoo\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua) Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium -7, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Panthenol, Phospholipids (and) Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Germ Extract, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/Palmitate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-73, Cetrimonium Chloride, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Fragrance Polyquaternium -10, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Citrus Aurantium (Neroli) Oil\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Mild to no lather.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit while massaging into hair, completely washes off on rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nI did not like this shampoo at all. It didn’t clean my scalp well at all and the strands felt weirdly brittle after washing. It isn’t hydrating enough to use without following up with a conditioner. However, if I am going to be using a conditioner anyway, the additional step is pointless for me. It might work for someone who needs extremely mild cleansing, but it is not for me. I stopped using after 2-3 washes at most, and switched full-time to the cleansing shampoo alone. Though the fact that this shampoo has proteins might be contributing to my dislike of it.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n1/5. Will Not Repurchase.\n\n## 🔹Hydrating Deep Conditioner\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Quaternium-87, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Phospholipids, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Polyquaternium -7, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/​Palmitate, Polyquaternium-73, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Avena Sativa (Oats) Extract, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance, Tamanu Oil, Honey Extract, Goji Berries Oil, Taraktogenos Kurzii Seed Oil, Jojoba Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Oil, Disodium EDTA, Magnolia Grandiflora Bark Extract, Potassium Lauroyl Wheat Amino Acids, Nigella Sativa Seed Oil, Leptospermum Scoparium Branch/​Leaf Oil, Capryloyl Glycine, Cysteine\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Low to medium slip.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit even after rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis conditioner is protein-moisture balanced, and this is the max protein my hair will tolerate. It doesn’t have a lot of slip, so if you are someone who detangles with conditioner, this one might be difficult to detangle with. My hair is always dry, and it felt softer immediately on the first use with this. It does tend to make hair a little greasy afterwards. But after adding styling products, it works out for me so I don’t really mind the greasiness. I have also used it as a deep conditioner and kept it in my hair for 30 minutes and then washed off. It didn’t make much of a difference in comparison with leaving it in for 5 minutes like I usually do, so I didn’t bother to do that again.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nFMC says the conditioner can also be used as a leave-in conditioner, though I have never tried this myself, and do not plan to try either.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Protein Duo✨\n\n## 🔹Leave-in Cream\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Dicetyl Phosphate & Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Panthenol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Quaternium-87, Polyquaternium -7, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/Palmitate, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acids, Sodium PCA, Hydrolysed Milk Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Cetrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Polyquaternium-68, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Ceramide, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Fragrance, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Tocopheryl Acetate, Potassium Lauroyl Wheat Amino Acids, Nigella Sativa Seed Oil, Leptospermum Scoparium Branch/Leaf Oil, Disodium EDTA, Magnolia Grandiflora Bark Extract, Taraktogenos Kurzii Seed Oil, Capryloyl Glycine\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Thins out a little on emulsifying.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHeavy fragrance that lasts for the whole day. This is the only FMC product whose fragrance is too much for me.\n\n**Review:**\n\nI purchased the Protein Duo when I was still experimenting and figuring out the needs of my hair. I very quickly realised that my hair is protein-sensitive and this cream does not work for me. Thankfully I had only bought the 50g travel pack. It is very protein-heavy, not very hydrating. If your hair is already healthy, this may work well. However for very dry hair, this will not provide enough moisture.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nI know now that the cream doesn’t work for me in regular usage. However I do keep the 50g tube around for the rare moisture-overload days to give my hair a little boost of protein. I only need a tiny amount for that purpose, so the tube is going to last me a very long time.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n1/5. Will Not Repurchase. Didn’t work for me, might work for someone else.\n\n## 🔹Defining Hair Gel\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Polyacrylate-2 Crosspolymer, Phospholipids (and) Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Polyquaternium -7, Polyquaternium-73, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Panthenol, Fragrance, Disodium EDTA\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nVery sticky, thick gel.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays for a few minutes, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis is a very strong-hold gel. It is a part of the Protein Duo, but it isn’t as protein-heavy as the leave-in cream. Even with my protein-sensitive hair, I was able to use it occasionally on days when I wanted some serious definition. If I used it 2-3 times consecutively, it caused protein-overload. Overall, a nice gel that gives pretty good definition and hold. I haven’t bought it again, though I might do so once my current hoard of gels is finished.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n3/5. May repurchase sometime.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Moisture Duo✨\n\n## 🔹Curl-Quenching Hair Butter\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Extract, Salvia Hispanica(Chia) Seed Extract, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Quaternium-87, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Panthenol, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond Oil), Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Glycerin, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, PEG/​PPG-8/​3 Diisostearate, Astrocaryum Vulgare Kernel Oil, Tocopherol, Olea Europea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Euterpe Oleracea (Acai) Fruit Oil, Mauritia Flexuosa (Buriti) Fruit Oil, Fragrance, Polyquaternium-73\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick white cream. Emulsifies into a thinner non-sticky cream.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nMild fragrance that lingers around for a few hours, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis one is an extreme boost of hydration. It is a heavy product, and tends to make hair greasy if too much is used. Since my hair is very dry, this works really well to keep it considerably soft and frizz-free. It doesn’t help me a lot with definition though, I don’t feel my hair is more defined on the days I use this butter as opposed to some other leave-in cream (usually the green Arata styling cream). Since it is heavy, it might weigh down wavy or fine hair. But for tighter curl patterns and/or coarser drier hair, this is great.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nThe product label mentions that it can be used as a one and done styling product. But for better definition, I prefer always using the gelly with it.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased. \n\n## 🔹Curl-Quenching Flaxseed Gelly\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Extract, Sorbitol, Propanediol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Salvia Hispanica (Chia! Seed Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-73, Panthenol, Sodium Gluconate, Fragrance, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Vinegar\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThin to medium, non-sticky gel.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays for a few minutes, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis is protein-free and quite hydrating honestly. Has a lot of slip, so it is a nice experience to style. It doesn’t have a lot of hold. Curls last for a day or two maximum, and that is after all protective measures like a satin pillowcase, satin scrunchies, etc. If long-lasting curls are not a goal for you, and you don’t mind refreshing more frequently, I would highly recommend this. The Moisture Bundle would probably be my most highly recommended FMC products.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nThe product label mentions that it can be used as a one and done styling product. I do use it as my sole styler sometimes, and it works out fine.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Miscellaneous Notes About Fix My Curls✨\n\nFix My Curls website used to have the full ingredients list of their products on the product pages prominently displayed. However during their recent website update, they have replaced it with Key Ingredients. So, minus points for that from me.They do have a photo of the back label in the product images, which shows the ingredients, but I feel that is not good enough. I prefer having the ingredients easily accessible. \n\nThey always have some kind of sale, discount offers, freebie offers, etc on their website. A lot of Indian Curly Hair Influencers also have affiliate codes for FMC. If you are planning to buy anything, I’d recommend comparing prices from the official seller on Amazon and the website during sales. I would have included other platforms like Nykaa, Foxy, Purpple, etc, but they are pretty much always out of stock or very highly priced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ✨Frequently Asked Questions✨\n\n🔹How do I find my curl type/porosity?\n\nI used [this quiz](https://www.naturallycurly.com/quiz)!\n\n🔹How do I know whether my hair needs moisture or protein?\n\n[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/mzhv17/haircare_guide_to_proteinmoisture_balance/) might help.\n\n&#x200B;",

    "body": "Hi everyone!\n\nI have accumulated a great deal of different shampoos from various indie companies throughout my time here and I thought it might be helpful to share my thoughts on them!\n\nSince everyone's hair is different, your experiences might differ from mine, so just keep that in mind! For reference, My hair is a little past my shoulders and heavily layered. It is generally limp, fine, and very straight. I find that my hair gets easily weighed down by a lot of products. I dye it red about every 5 weeks with henna and, a few times a year, I will have balayage highlights added in or touched up. My hair gets oily at the roots, in my bangs, and around my face, but the bleached ends become very dry. I wash the bangs and top of my head every day and the full length every 2 to 3 days. I blow dry, straighten, and/or curl my hair several times a week. The water in my house is on the “softer” side.\n\n**[ Cocoa Pink ]**\n\n**Shampink Conditioning Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  A favorite amongst the IMAM community, Shampink (formally Princess Poo) provides gentle cleansing without stripping or drying. The absence of sulfates means that it won’t be as likely to pull dye prematurely out of your hair. I find that this shampoo does not lather very much unless you use a generous amount, but it still cleans well enough. It is highly moisturizing, which unfortunately means that it does not provide me with a lot of lift or volume at the roots; my hair looks a little limp when I use this product, so I have to coax it more with the blow dryer to keep it from falling too flat. I tend to use this shampoo on days when I know I am going to be putting my hair up, braiding it, or doing some sort of up-do where a lot of slip is required. This is also nice to use for washing my bangs every day, as it doesn’t dry them out.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 6 oz. and 10 oz. plastic bottles with attractive labeling. Shampoo is thick and clear. Minimal lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $7.50 for 6 oz. ($1.25 per oz.) and $14.00 for 10 oz. ($1.40 per oz.).\n\n*Scents:*  Shampink comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Not as generously scented as CP’s Argan Conditioner. Also available in unscented. I have this in Cereal Killer (fruit loop type scent) and Cake on Mondays (delicious cinnamon almond cake, but beware if you are sensitive to cinnamon).\n\n*I recommend this for:*  Normal-Dry hair types, frequent washers, color-treated hair, damaged hair.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Water, Sodium Glucose Carboxylate and Lauryl Glucoside (natural surfactants), Rosemary Extract, Lavender Extract, Rose Extract, Lemon Grass Extract, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Fragrance, Mica, Phenoxyethanol and Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid (Paraben Free Preservation System).\n\n**Squeaky Clarifying Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  This is a nice alternative to CP’s Shampink if you have oily or limp hair, but still desire more gentle cleansing than most sulfate-based shampoos. I find that this formula lathers a bit better than its counterpart. It is more clarifying than Shampink, but I still would not consider it a \"clarifying shampoo\" as it is quite moisturizing. I like this when my hair is feeling a little oilier at the roots, I previously used hair spray or a scrunching product, or I got sweaty from working out at the gym.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 4.5 oz. and 10 oz. plastic bottles with attractive labeling. Shampoo is thick and light pink in color. Medium lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $6.50 for 4.5 oz. ($1.44 per oz.) and $13.00 for 10 oz. ($1.30 per oz.)\n\n*Scents:*  Squeaky comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Not as generously scented as CP’s Argan Conditioner. Also available in unscented. I have this in Lychee Rose Macaroons (sweet rose with a hint of coconut).\n\n*I recommend this for:* All hair types, gentle clarifying.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Water, Sodium Lauryl Glucose Carboxylate, Lauryl Glucoside, Rosemary Extract, Lavender Extract, Rose Extract, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium, Modified Cornstarch, Fragrance, Mica, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid (preservatives).\n\n**[ Savor Soaps ]**\n\n**Creme Fraiche Whipped Soap**\n\n*Overview:*  I have found that a lot of people use Savor’s Whipped Soap in place of shampoo. I find that it lathers very well and clarifies my hair, leaving it feeling light, bouncy, and smooth; however, I experienced a lot of dryness on my scalp and some frizziness on the ends of my hair. Many people have had great success with this and I may end up giving it another try this summer, when my scalp is especially oily. A little bit goes a long way and it is definitely a multi-use product (shampoo, body soap, shaving cream, etc.), so it is a great value! I did find a lot of unblended pieces of what looks like shea butter throughout the mixture, although this is not listed in the ingredients so I'm not sure what it is. Didn’t really bother me as it dissolves in water, but I thought I would note this. The scent lingers for quite a while after it's rinsed out!\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 2 oz. and 8 oz. plastic jars with attractive labeling. Soap is thick with a butter-like texture. Interestingly, the sugar scrub soaps had a softer texture. Generous lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $4.50 for 2 oz. ($2.25 per oz.) and $10.00 for 8 oz. ($1.25 per oz.)\n\n*Scents:*  There are a variety of scents to choose from, most of which are sweet and fruity, but there are also more masculine options available. I did not find an unscented version of the whipped soap, but you may be able to request it. Generously scented and remains in hair after rinsing. I have this in Honey (perfumey honey floral).\n\n*I recommend this for:* Normal-Oily hair types, thick hair.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Distilled water, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Sodium cocoyl isethionate, Disodium lauryl sulfosuccinate, Sodium chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Tetrasodium edta, Sweet almond oil, Fragrance, Color\n\n**[ Fortune Cookie Soap ]**\n\n**Shampoo Bar**\n\n*Overview:*  I have not had much success with sulfate-free shampoo bars in the past, so I was pleasantly surprised at how well Fortune Cookie’s shampoo bar worked for me! It lathers easily, smells great, and doesn’t leave a weird film on my hair that I sometimes get with other shampoo bars. This product provides gentle cleansing and it is very economical as a little bit goes a very long way. I find the scent to be quite long lasting as well. I use this when traveling as it takes up very little room in my bag.\n\n*Product details:*  Couldn’t find the size dimensions on the website. Bar is square and colored/decorated according to scent. Generous lather. It seems that it will last a long time.\n\n*Cost:*  $8.99 for one bar.\n\n*Scents:*  There are a small handful of scents available and good portion of them change with the seasons. They are mostly sweet, fruity, and fresh scents. I did not see an unscented version. I have this in Oh Hair (peach nectar, grapefruit, sprig of thyme) and it is pleasant and long lasting.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  All hair types, travel.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Sodium Coco Sulfate, Fractionated Coconut Oil, Kokum Butter, Cosmetic Grade Silicone (Moisturizer), Shea Butter, blend of Palm and Coconut Oils (Saponified), Purified Water, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Vitamin E (Tocopherol), Fragrance and/or Essential Oils, Cosmetic Color\n\n**[ Toadstool Soaps ]**\n\n**Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  This shampoo provides superb lather and great cleansing power without leaving my hair parched. It removes any kind of product or oil build-up easily. It is more clarifying than many other indie brands, so I always make sure to follow up with a conditioner. It is fantastic at removing grime, styling products, and skin oil. The foaming power is very impressive considering this is a sulfate-free product. A little bit goes a LONG way. The shampoo leaves my hair super clean, fluffy, and full of volume. The packaging is very basic. The larger bottle size is definitely the way to go as it is the most economical of all of the shampoos I’ve tried.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 3 oz. and 10.5 oz. plastic bottles with minimalist labeling. Shampoo is medium-consistency and clear (type of fragrance may alter color). Very generous lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $6.50 for 3 oz. ($2.17 per oz.) and $9.75 for 10.5 oz. ($0.93 per oz.) Some of the shampoos containing essential oils are a little more expensive.\n\n*Scents:*  The shampoo comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Most are very generously scented, but more subtle scents are available as well. Also available in unscented. I have this in Milk and Honey (comforting almond milk and honey) and it is one of the more subtle scents.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  Normal-Oily hair types, limp hair.\n\n*Ingredients:* Distilled Water, Coconut Oil, Cocoa Butter, Saponified Olive Oil, Vegetable Oil & is enhanced with 100% Raw Honey and Lemon Juice for a healthy shine, Fragrance Oil & Potassium Sorbate as a preservative. *Note: There is lemon juice in the ingredients, but I do not find that it lightens my hair color at all. I have read on other message boards that this is because when it is \"cooked\" the lightening quality is diminished.*\n\n**Wheat and Oat Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  I love the ingredients in this shampoo! My hair really likes marshmallow root and the slippery elm was a nice surprise (both give a lot of natural “slip” to the hair). This is a great formula that would suit most hair types, particularly if your hair likes protein. Protein can be somewhat drying if it’s used in excess, so keep this in mind when deciding what conditioner to pair it with. Toadstool also has an accompanying rinse-out conditioner that works very well with this, but if you have especially dry hair, you may want something more intense. This shampoo isn’t scented; it has its own natural scent from the ingredients, which pretty much smells lightly of grain. Not unpleasant, but I’ve just become so accustomed to crazy-scented products that it was a little bit of a surprise!\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 10.5 oz. plastic bottles with minimalist labeling. Shampoo is medium-consistency and light yellow. Good lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $10.50 for 10.5 oz. ($1 per oz.).\n\n*Scents:*  Natural scent of wheat.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  All hair types, protein lovers.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Aloe barbadensis (Organic Aloe) Juice, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Vegetable Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Avena sativa (Oat) Extract, dl-Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5), Camellia sinensis (Organic Green Tea) Extract, Urtica dioica (Organic Nettle Leaf) Extract, Stellaria media (Organic Chickweed) Extract, Ulmus fulva (Organic Slippery Elm) Extract, Silybum marianum (Organic Milk Thistle) Extract, Althea officinalis (Organic Marshmallow Root) Extract, Aphanizomenon flos-aqua (Blue Green Algae), Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid\n\n**[ Winner ] Toadstool Soap's regular shampoo because of the affordable cost, excellent lather, and availability of scents.**\n\nStay tuned for my review of indie conditioners!\n\nWhat shampoos have you tried? How did you like them? If you would like to share your thoughts, that'd be great! It would also be helpful if you included your hair type so that people with similar hair can decide if that product will (or won't) work for them.",

I mean, **REALLY dry.** Already had dry skin but with tret every other day, it's crazy, crazy dry. I can't do regular tret either, gotta be microsphere. \n\n*Climate:* Dry, desert Cali.

The other spots are from sun damage. Aaaand, as you can see from the before and after pictures, my dark spots have actually gotten slightly worse, and more numerous. It's easier to tell irl than in pictures. \n\n[Before/After pics](https://imgur.com/a/SAWwCqK)\n\nI feel like I haven't given it enough time to see real results since I used it for less than 3 months. 3 months is the standard time you should give skin-brightening products time to work. But from the results I can glean from this limited time, I am not super impressed. \n\nHowever, I'm willing to give it another try if it comes out for $35 instead of $45, because I *mostly blame the switch to a new sunscreen* on my spots darkening/getting more dark spots. \n\nI know many people love the Purito centella sunscreen, but it just is not protective enough for my skin type. I am super diligent about sun protection, and the 99% of the sun I get is from commuting in the car once or twice a week (\\~20 min) and sitting in front of windows for meals. I have blackout curtains in my room and only exercise during the night. \n\nSorry for the rant, but I'm honestly kind of upset that the progress on my dark spots that I worked so hard on for years have been reversed a little. \n\nAnyways, the ingredient list is absolutely fantastic. It's definitely a much better deal than Skinceuticals' 3% tranexamic + 5% niacinamide serum. So perhaps if I use a better sunscreen and give it longer, LEVEL may work better for me. \n\n**PRICE:** *$35-45 /30ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** Maybe. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# VITAMIN X Serum\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Propanediol, Ascorbic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Propylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Acetyl Zingerone, Glycerin, Hexanediol, Tocopherol, Epigallocatechin Gallate, Ferulic Acid, Resveratrol, Genistein, Glutathione, Quercetin, Silymarin, Hesperidin Methyl Chalcone, Dimethylmethoxy Chromanol, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol, Citric Acid.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** Also has a \"glycol feel\". Lightweight, absorbs quickly. Feels like I should use it after watery toners, but since it's vitamin C, I used it before anything else. \n\n**COLOR:** Orange tinted transparent gel. It did not change color the entire time I have had it, but I can't be sure of course, because of the original color. I imagine I will only be able to tell once it oxidizes heavily and turns brownish. \n\n**SCENT:** None.\n\n**RESULTS:** Light texture refinement. Like the LEVEL serum, I started out only using it once a day. Then I switched to using it twice a day after about almost a month in or so. \n\nGave my skin a subtle, soft glow. \n\nCompared to the Timeless Vitamin C serum, I just didn't see nearly as much texture/pore refinement and glow factor. I have the type of skin that sees zero results from ascorbic acid derivatives (SAP, MAP, etc).\n\nA bit disappointing on the visual results department, but perhaps other people may like it for all the other antioxidants loaded in this serum that may be protecting the skin without visual refinement. \n\nI was still happily using it up, BUT, I had to stop several days ago. I noticed that it was suddenly filled with tons of little grains??? \n\nI'm not sure if you can [**see it in the pictures**](https://imgur.com/a/PkTvttF), but it almost seems like the vitamin C in the serum spontaneously changed back to powder form.\n\nWhat the hell happened? Stability issue? I am not sure. \n\nAmbitious little serum, but it didn't work out for me in practice.\n\nI'm testing out Maelove Glow Maker at the moment, and so far Timeless is winning out but since it's only been a very short time, we'll see. Am planning to try a Skinceuticals sample next. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$50-60 / 30ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** No. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# WAVE Serum\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Betaine, Glycerin, Urea, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Saccharide Isomerate, Sodium PCA, Sodium Lactate, Sorbitol, Lactic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Pectin, Proline, Serine, Arginine, Glucose, Fructose, Maltose, Trehalose, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Chloride, Allantoin, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** A thin gel. Thicker and heavier-feeling than LEVEL & VITAMIN X. Absorbs a little slower. Still lightweight.  \n\n**COLOR:** A slightly cloudy, transparent.\n\n**SCENT:** None.\n\n**RESULTS:** It has a ton of beneficial ingredients, and was pretty hydrating. But for some reason, I found myself reaching for this less than my other, more watery hydrating essences/toners. \n\nIt may just be my personal preference, but I've been more into thinner, watery layers more than thicker ones as of late. \n\nFelt similar to Hada Labo Premium lotion but a little less hydrating? I still quite enjoyed using it. \n\nThis would be plenty of hydration for most people probably, but I have exceptionally dry skin, and this by itself was not enough to really plump out my skin. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$40-50 / 30ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** Maybe, if it was cheaper. Urea in serum form is a really rare find. But I can probably get a similar effect with a couple of different serums and a urea moisturizer combined for cheaper. If my skin wasn't so darn dehydrated and dry, this would be a fantastic all-in-one sort of convenient step for me since it really has every humectant your skin can use/has naturally. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TABULA RASA Cleanser\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Betaine, Propanediol, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate (and) Aqua (and) PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Acrylates Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium EDTA, Phenylpropanol, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic acid, Citric Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexylglycerin.* \n\n**TEXTURE:** A fluid gel. It doesn't foam up a whoooole lot, but the ideal amount foams up to a thick, luxurious feeling foam if you keep rubbing. It has more \"slip\" than Sunday Riley's Ceramic Slip cleanser if you've used that before. (If you use too little, it fails to foam.)\n\nIt feels really similar to my drugstore HG cleanser, Garnier SkinActive Gentle Sulfate-Free Cleanser initially. But that one doesn't create nice, thick feeling foam. That one cleans well but foams out to very small, non-substantial foam. \n\n**COLOR:** A opaque, white gel. \n\n**SCENT:** A strong, glue-like smell? No masking fragrance. \n\n**RESULTS:** I'm not always a gel-cleanser type of gal, but I actually really enjoy using this cleanser. It really *does* feel MOIST after washing, like my initial assessment. I personally have not used a cleanser with that sort of after-feel before. As a dry-skinned person, I *really* like that!\n\nIt didn't end up drying me out. I found it a really nice, hydrating second cleanser. The only issue was the strong smell, but I have a sensitive nose. I prefer it to smell a little weird than it be loaded with fragrance, personally. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$17-20 /100ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** Yes, I really like this cleanser and would not mind having it on my sink if it came in pretty packaging! I can find other cleansers that can do the job just fine, but if it was pretty and maybe came in a bigger size, I can definitely see myself repurchasing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# C.R.E.A.M.\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Squalane, Capric/Caprylic Triglycerides, Propanediol, Glycerin, Glyceryl Glucoside, Isosorbide Dicaprylate, Phospholipids, Ursolic Acid, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Ceramide NP, Ceramide EOP, Bisabolol, Isoamyl Laurate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Cholesterol, Stearic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Tocopherol, Dimethoxymethyl Chromanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** Picture of texture [here](https://imgur.com/EhE4aHM). A *very* thick, nourishing cream. A little hard to spread. Layered well with other things, cosmetically elegant.\n\n**COLOR:** White, opaque. \n\n**SCENT:** None. \n\n**RESULTS:** I have this MIGHTY NEED to try out as many ceramide/pseudo-ceramide/barrier repair creams as I can get my hands on. So I was REALLY excited to try this cream out. \n\nThis cream was really moisturizing and felt protective on the skin. However, I had to use quite a lot to moisturize my skin. So I ran out of it pretty fast. \n\nIt felt really good, but it failed to keep my skin completely flake-free under sunscreen & makeup and throughout the night by itself. \n\nBut **please** keep in mind that I have *incredibly* dry skin; My skin is an asshole and it's not enough to merely slug life with Vaseline/Aquaphor/CeraVe Healing ointment. It needs lots of humectants and lots of FATS & occlusives to keep it from feeling tight. (I have eczema-prone body skin as well and go through moisturizers by the bucketloads..)\n\nNone of these creams *by themselves* can prevent me from waking up to skin tighter-feeling than I'd like despite *slathering* them on: CeraVe cream & First Aid Beauty UR creams - *way* too light & matte, Atopalm MLE, Zeroid Intensive, Zeroid Oint-Cream (almost!), Real Barrier Extreme, Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Cream, La Roche Posay Lipikar AP+ Baume, Udderly Smooth, etc. \n\nI have to layer multiple of these on in order to wake up to moisturized skin. The only ones applied by themselves that give me the same results as layering multiple on are Aveeno eczema therapy cream & Ceradan barrier repair cream so far.\n\n(I have a big review post coming up sometime in the future on all these but it's gonna take a while.\\^)\n\nI've seen other reviews saying how much this C.R.E.A.M. has helped their dry skin, so I think it should work well for most folks. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$45-55 / 50ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** No, unless somehow they come out with an actual bucket-sized option for cheap lmao. \n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\nHope that helps! I had a lot of fun trying this kit. The company's customer service was incredibly helpful and nice. I hope they can tweak and improve on some things and their actual release goes well!",

Haha. I tried a bunch of the zeroid products (oint cream, soothing cream, and 5% urea cream) and the oint-cream is my favorite for night time, urea for day, and the soothing cream is alright but has a stickier consistency that I don’t like as much. Would repurchase the other 2 probably but none of them made me go WOW. \n\nMeanwhile I’m still hoarding the tiny sample of the skinceuticals cream I got and it’s been my go-to whenever I get a random dry patch.

If you have colored hair (highlights, single process, etc) DO NOT USE THIS. All the money you paid your stylist will go down the drain, as shampoos like this have pH levels way beyond the natural pH of our hair and skin, which can cause more harm than good.

    "body": "Warning: Long post because I might be slightly insane. I think I put way too much thought into researching products than necessary...\n\nI’ve been curious about the hype surrounding peeling gels lately and began hunting through information on the interwebs where the general consensus amongst industry experts like [The Beauty Brains](http://thebeautybrains.com/2014/02/cure-natural-aqua-gel-look-at-the-label/) and [Colin’s Beauty Pages](http://colinsbeautypages.co.uk/skin-peeling-from-peeling-gels/) seems to be that they function on the mechanism of the acrylates/C10-30 and akyl acrylate crosspolymer (specifically referring to the formula of Cure aqua peeling gel) balling up as the water evaporates when rubbed again skin. \n\nHowever, the comment sections and many other blog posts insist that the gel *does* remove dead skin, many even insisting that their skin has never been better while using the gel. [This](http://www.labmuffin.com/2014/02/fact-check-friday-do-peeling-gels-really-peel-off-my-skin/) photo experiment reveals that gels still ball up when rubbed on a non-skin surface - albeit more slowly - and concludes that they function more as a physical exfoliant as the beads are gently rubbed, especially when mixed with oil on the skin. \n\nAnyway, I was doing my nails last night and used this [gel cuticle remover](http://www.amazon.com/Sally-Hansen-Cuticle-Remover-0-9oz/dp/B003VDGIU4/ref=sr_1_4_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1459262400&sr=8-4&keywords=gel+cuticle+remover)(not affiliate link) from Sally Hansen to remove my cuticles and noticed that the formula begins balling up when I am scraping my cuticles with a wooden stick. I tried a blob on my hand, began to rub it, and it balls up as well! It occurred to me that this could somehow be similar to peeling gels, so I looked up its ingredient list. \n\n\n**Sally Hansen gel cuticle remover:** Water, **Trisodium Phosphate**, **Polyethylene**, Butylene Glycol, Laureth 4, **Acrylates/C10 30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer**, **Urea**, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, **Sodium Hydroxide**, Disodium EDTA, Actinidia Chinensis (Kiwi) Fruit Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Extract, Melaleuca Altemifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, 1 2 Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Fragrance, Potassium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Green 3, Yellow 5 Lake\n\n\n**Cure natural aqua gel:** Water (activated hydrogen water^lol, non-acidic and purified), glycerin, **acrylates/C10-30, alkyl acrylate crosspolymer**, dicocodimonium, chloride, steartrimonium bromide, aloe barbadensis leaf extract, gingko biloba extract, rosmarinus officinalis/rosemary leaf extract, butylene glycol\n\n\nOk, so they both have acrylates/C10-30 and alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, which doesn’t mean anything yet. It just means that they both ball up. The cuticle remover also has trisodium phosphate and sodium hydroxide, which makes the formula very basic (~pH12-14) and breaks down dead skin (i.e. the cuticle) and urea which softens skin. The peeling gel does not have such elements to facilitate the breaking down of skin (imagine the horror! Us pH lifers will fall over catatonic). I checked out the ingredient lists of other cuticle removers, and the basic functioning formulas are to include either basic cleaning agents like potassium hydroxide/sodium hydroxide and/or gentler AHAs to exfoliate dead skin off. I also checked the ingredient lists of other peeling gels - they are all very different, but they all seem to contain the basic mechanism of some kind of plasticky compound that will ball up when the water evaporates. \n\n*I’m not sure what to make of all of this, but here are my questions:*\n\nWhy does my cuticle remover contain acrylates/C10-30 and alkyl acrylate crosspolymer when the basic compounds are enough to dissolve dead skin? \n\nIs it just to affect the consistency of the product? But there are so many other ways to make a gel formula without it balling up! \n\nOr does the balling up make consumers think that it’s all dead cuticle coming off instead of just *some* dead cuticle coming off? The cuticle gel does work - my cuticle comes off, but what I mean is if the balling-up action gives the *impression* that more gunk is being removed than not?\n\nJUST LIKE HOW THEY MAKE CONSUMERS THINK THAT ALL THE BALLS ARE THEIR SKIN COMING OFF WITH PEELING GELS?!\n\nI'm having an existential crisis, u gaiz. \n\nTo be fair, I do think that peeling gels probably work, but just not as advertised. I’ve personally not used one yet as I don’t need another product in my routine. I believe the ingredients just ball up, physically exfoliate the skin, and dead skin cells start to adhere to the balls. The stickiness of the balls is what differentiates peeling gels from regular scrubs, as scrubs essentially lift some dead skin and move it around the face and hence give the impression that they are less effective. Some peeling gels have fruit enzymes and AHAs that claim to exfoliate skin, so I can see how those have both physical and chemical mechanisms to make skin smoother. \n\nI don’t know, what was my question/concern again? I really would like people with a chemistry background to weigh in on this (I vaguely remember titration in high school and that's about it) It’s burning a hole in my brain. Am I completely off-base here, or does this absurdly random connection I made have any merit? People with peeling gel experience - what do you think? \n\n...\n\nI think I just spent my breakfast period attempting to debunk the peeling gel myth for the *nth+1* time by comparing it to a cuticle remover. Thank god I mostly work from home. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME.\n",

Because a lot of us here are more informed than the average consumer, products are often developed by look and feel. Test markets reveal all kinds of weird things consumers think makes a product *seem* like it is working more so than, if it actually is. \n\nI used to work for a cosmetics company that also had a shampoo line. People would try to return the shampoo all the time because there was \"not enough foam\" (p.s.-that's often a GOOD thing in a shampoo and was also in this case) because to them, more foam=more clean, even if that isn't the case. Later when said company was sold, new company made the shampoo more \"foamy\" because, people are dumb but, I am sure they sell more of it, so.\n\nAs for peeling gels, I personally think they are bogus but, I just don't use them.

        "body": "Hwy there! I saw this post a day had to chime in be a useful I don't think anyone addressed the huuuge difference between these products. Almost all cuticle gels and callus removing products are full of sodium hydroxide (which you listed as an ingredient). This is lye, and the pH is high, very high. As in, burn your skin off and kill you high pH. It's the exact same chemical used to emulsify fat and oils to create plain soaps. (I used to buy sodium hydroxide because I made soap.) the pH is so high that you use vinegar to counteract it if it gets on your skin. This is how it literally dissolves skin anywhere you put it. \n\nTd;dr : Don't put sodium hydroxide on your face! Sodium hydroxide is buffered to some extent in these products, but at the least it will harshly remove your moisture barrier as it emulsify/soaponifies it... At the worst, you will get a serious chemical burn and scarring on your fragile facial skin!",

This is just reference for you guys! :)\n\nMost hair needs some amount of protein, especially damaged(sun, wind, heat, bleach, etc) hair. Normal hair, or protein sensitive hair does not need large doses of protein all the time. If your hair feels stiff, frizzy, and dry, then your hair might be getting to much protein.  \n\nFor some fine/damaged curlies, protein will make your curls spring to life like never before!! Careful- It can be addicting and turn into a case of \"too much of a good thing\".  Don't worry- if you go overboard on protein treatments, you can just do a good deep conditioning treatment to help counteract the protein overload. :)  So if you have damaged hair that needs protein, how often should you do it?  If it's an INTENSE level of protein, once a week. If it's a conditioner that has some protein in it, every other day or even every day(if it's low enough on the ingredient list) will be fine.  This is why hair porosity is important: Low porosities probably do not need any protein, normal could use some protein, but high porosity LOVES protein. :)\n\nOKAY. Here's the list of commonly used proteins.  Looked for the actual word \"protein\", \"keratin\" or for the word \"hydrolyzed\" to indicate a protein in most cases.\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed casein\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed collagen\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed hair keratin\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed keratin\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed rice protein\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed silk\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed soy protein\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed wheat protein\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl silk amino acids\n\n* Cocoyl hydrolyzed collagen\n\n* Cocoyl hydrolyzed keratin\n\n* Hydrolyzed keratin\n\n* Hydrolyzed oat flour\n\n* Hydrolyzed silk\n\n* Hydrolyzed silk protein\n\n* Hydrolyzed soy protein\n\n* Hydrolyzed wheat protein\n\n* Hydrolyzed wheat protein\n\n* Keratin\n\n* Potassium cocoyl hydrolyzed collagen\n\n* TEA-cocoyl hydrolyzed collagen\n\n* TEA-cocoyl hydrolyzed soy protein",

    "body": "I have long, straight hair that is very fine in texture, but a ton of it. I would like my hair to have lots of volume, but more than often it falls flat and because of how fine it is, any volumizing product usually weighs it down more than it helps. \n\nI started using [OGX Thick and Full Biotin and Collagen] (http://www.ulta.com/thick-full-biotin-collagen-shampoo?productId=xlsImpprod4920057) shampoo and conditioner, hoping it would help give my hair lasting body and fullness. My hair does have okay volume after washing with these products, but it also feels drier and and more prone to tangling. It's not as shiny as it used to be. And it doesn't feel clean, it always feels like there is still some residue in my hair. I remember reading that some hair types don't like a lot of protein. This shampoo and conditioner claim to contain hydrolyzed wheat protein. Any thoughts on whether this shampoo is not working for my hair? Any suggestions on what to try instead?",

If you're in the US and trying to stick with drugstore brands, Garnier and Tresseme aren't bad. If your hair is prone to dryness, \"weightless moisture\" will be your friend.

No issues there, had lunch in an actually dedicated GF restaurant (The Game Parlour in SF, fantastic mochi waffles).\n\nDinner on the way back to my hotel was another supposedly GF place: Asian Box. I was psyched to have a banh mi on GF bread! But it wasn't the bread that did me in. It's the sauce that I'd never heard of before, but (stupidly) assumed that because the place was dedicated GF, it would not have gluten in it.\n\nI just woke up at 12am with shooting gut pains and feeling the worst chills I've ever felt -- thought I was dying tbh. And the intestinal stuff has hit, so I looked up the banh mi ingredients, and the sauce listed on both print and online menus for the location, Maggi, is literally made of hydrolyzed wheat protein! What the actual f***? \n\nI told the server that I was excited to have a banh mi because I hadn't had one since before I was diagnosed with celiac! The place has great reviews on FMGF, and I thought I'd found a gem. Instead I'm awake four hours before I have to leave for the airport feeling like death, and how am I going to manage flying cross-country with celiac diarrhea? Damn it. I hate travel 😭",

And yes, I got it tested by an accredited lab... very much above 20 ppm. \n\nFWIW, there are two \"GF\" restaurants that I used to live near that say in sort of small print on their websites that they are more of \"no gluten ingredient\" places and that they don't verify the GF status of any of their ingredients. They are highly rated on FMGF. So uh... if you're in Montreal and eating out on av Mont-Royal at an Asian fusion place or two... maybe don't if you have celiac ;). Both have a small number of \"I got sick/Nima said gluten\" reviews.\n\nSo just because a place says dedicated doesn't mean it's celiac safe sadly.

None of these products were sponsored ~ I purchased them myself.   I do have affiliate and referral links but disclose in my blogs  &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n [Cleansing Review](\nhttps://beautyfindsforme.wordpress.com/2015/10/31/more-cleanser-reviews-cosrx-primary-raw-the-face-shop-doyouganic-cleansing-soap-plus-ciracle-revisited/)   &nbsp;&nbsp;\n  \n\n\n\n\nI did four cleansers in here ~ all with really LONG names:  The Face Shop Calming Seed Bubble Foam Cleanser, Primary Raw doyouganic cleanser soap, cosRX Low pH Good Morning Gel cleanser and a revisit with Ciracle Anti-Blemish Tea Tree Wash.  I also did a quick,unscientific comparison between cosRX & Ciracle as they are made by the same \"company\" - cosRX is the parent of Ciracle.  Lots of pictures plus how they performed    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n \n\n\n\n\n[Makeup cosRX Make Me Lovely Cream & A'Pieu Doramon EyeShadow Palette #1 My Daily](https://beautyfindsforme.wordpress.com/2015/10/27/instareview-cosrx-make-me-lovely-cream-apieu-doraemon-palette/)  \n\nswatches and all!    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nAlso, I've been reading here about requests on where to get unusual masks and hard to find masks ~ I subscribe to MaskGenie since day 1 (janaury of this year) and I have been so happy with this subscription service.  She ships directly from Hong Kong. I am not affiliated with her, nor do I make any money from mentioning her service.  These are unboxings, which means that I just give information about the masks, ingredients, and I might try one or two of them by the time I do the unboxing - if I do, then I mention the scent, texture, how it worked..\n\n\n* [October's MaskGenie Unboxing](https://beautyfindsforme.wordpress.com/2015/10/28/unboxing-october-2015-maskgenie/)\n\n* [See all of my MaskGenie Unboxings here](https://beautyfindsforme.wordpress.com/category/monthly-boxes/maskgenie-monthly-boxes/)     \n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n \nAnd finally ~ I will be reviewing this product more in depth on my blog by mid november, along with Innisfree Green Tea & Mint Hair Scaler and La’dor Perfect Hair Filler, but when I asked about this initially, there was interest in this product right away.  So, I will give you a quick rundown on Holika Holika Hair Rinsing \nVinegar From Nature  in Camellia    \n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nIngredients: Purified water, ethanol, vinegar, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, glycerin, Octyldodeceth-16, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Butylene Glycol, Cetrimonium Chloride, magnesium nitrate, magnesium chloride, Cyclohexasiloxane, silk amino acids, Ethylhexylglycerin, disodium EDTA, phenoxyethanol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, sodium benzoate , fragrance   \n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n \n\n \nI can assure you that this does not smell like vinegar at ALL!!  It smells like camellia flowers and it is not overpowering at all.  At first, when looking at the ingredient list, I thought this would be a conditioner, despite the name rinse.  However, it is a rinse ~ it is a watery product and I even put a spray pump on it, as I didn't want to waste it by pouring it into my hand (it is just like water).   I have to use a conditioner, this is not in replacement of one.  I use this product after I use a conditioner and this would be a detox product for my hair to remove build up and also bring shine back into my hair.  I don't think this would be a daily routine item for me, but every few days.   \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis is just an initial impression and hopefully, I will have more by mid November. \n\n",

All of the products were purchased from Amazon through the official Bonajour seller. \n\n(Obviously not sponsored)\n\n1.)

It has a relaxing smell and it lathers well. I put this body wash on a Salux washcloth and the body wash doesn’t dry out my skin. 5/5\n\n3.) Mugwort Cream Calming Mask (1.9 fl. oz)\n\n- Ingredients: Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract(32.20%), Water, Kaolin, Butylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Bentonite, Sorbitan Olivate, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Apium Graveolens (Celery)Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Capitata (Cabbage) Leaf Extract, Brassica Rapa (Turnip) Leaf Extract, Solanum Lycopersicum (Tomato) Fruit/Leaf/Stem Extract, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract, Brassica OleraceaItalica (Broccoli) Extract, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Origanum Vulgare Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Cinnamomum Cassia Bark Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosmary) Leaf Extract, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Enantia Chlorantha (Bark) Extract, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pusatilla Koreana Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Citrusparadisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Octyldodecanol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Ribes Nigrum (Black Currant) Seed Oil, Oleanolic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder (4,000ppm), Camellia Sinensis Leaf Powder, Tocopherol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Artemisia Vulgaris Oil(500ppm), Sod\n\n- Review: I’m still going through my first purchase of this and it’s grown on me. Although I prefer the I’m From Mugwort Mask, this mask is skin calming too. I use mask this during my menstruation cycle (where my skin is more prone to having skin inflammation) and it felt very nice. I also like how the date when opened can be written on the product + it’s a cheaper mugwort product. 4/5\n\n4.)

The price is really good especially for the size (100 ML). I would recommend this serum for oily skin types. This is more of a skin calming serum rather than a hydrating one. It did calm my face but did little for my acne. This product is also unscented. I didn’t repurchase the serum. 3/5 \n\n5.) Seaweed Lotion (150 ML) \n\n- Ingredients: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Butylene Glycol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Water, Sargassum Fulvellum Extract, Gelidium Cartilagineum Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Phaseolus Radiatus Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycerin, Panthenol, Polyglutamic Acid, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Allantoin, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n- Review: I also have mixed thoughts about this lotion. This product is unscented and the smell of the moisturizer doesn’t bother me. This is a very basic moisturizer. Sometimes this would make my face feel itchy but my face was dehydrated at the time I was using this. I wouldn’t repurchase it and am now using it as a hand lotion (which works). 3/5\n\n6.) Seaweed Skin Toner (150 ML)\n\n- Ingredients: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Water, Sargassum Fulvellum Extract, Gelidium Cartilagineum Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Phaseolus Radiatus Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Polyglutamic Acid, Panthenol, Allantoin, Betaine, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n- Review: This is a great toner but after I started using the Matsuyama Hadauru Moisturizing Infusion Balancing Lotion, I used this one less. I haven’t repurchased it. I also used it before applying lotion on my body (which feels nice and cooling). This is a lightweight toner that can easily be layered. This product is also unscented. 4/5",

No matter what I do, it remains extremely dry, tangles easily, has no slip, no shine, and feels rough like straw.  I have never colored nor chemically straightened my hair.  I do not swim (ie. no chlorine damage).  I do not have hard water.\n\nThings I'm currently doing:    \n\n* Hot oil treatments\n* Deep conditioners during every shower\n* Hair masks once per week\n* Co-washing in between sulfate washes\n* Clarifying once every 2 weeks with sulfate shampoo\n* Use apple cider vinegar rinses\n* Do not blowdry\n* Do not brush hair when wet\n* Flat iron once a week on lowest setting (~150 F)\n* Immediately apply leave-in conditioner on towel-dried hair, then seal ends with olive oil\n\nPlease help me!  I'm completely at my wits end!  Even anti-frizz serums and other silicones are failing to give me shine.  I've tried everything that everyone has recommended, but my hair remains dry, brittle, and straw-like.\n \nIs there anything else I can try?  Any ideas?  What am I missing?\n\n\n**Edit:  For this of you wondering, the culprit turned out to be protein overload.  It seems to be the combination of:**\n\n\n* Tresemme Heat Tamer Spray (4th ingredient: Panthenol, 5th ingredient: Hydrolyzed Silk)\n* Dove Nourishing Oil Care Shampoo (Coconut Oil)\n* Biosilk Silk Therapy (Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Silk)\n\n\nMy protein overload \"hangover\" was also the result of products in a previous regime:\n\n\n* Regis Kera-Forte Conditioner (Hydrolyzed wheat protein, Keratin amino acids, Hydrolyzed vegetable protein)\n* 4-hour long hot oil treatments using Coconut Oil (which is bad for protein overloaded hair!)\n\n\n",

Have you had any major changes in climate or the amount of time you're spending outdoors?\n\nI'd also recommend adding a bonnet to your conditioning routine every now and then -- use your deep-conditioning treatment, and then wrap your hair in plastic wrap. Attach the bonnet to your hair dryer and let the heat set it in (YMMV based on the conditioner, so it'll involve a little experimentation). I have [this bonnet dryer](http://www.amazon.com/Gold-Hot-Bonnet-Dryer-Attachment/dp/B000YC3VHS/ref=sr_1_14?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1392309024&sr=1-14&keywords=soft+bonnet+dryer), and while it makes me feel silly, it does the trick. \n\nI might also go through your routine, removing a product for a week at a time to see if something is not working well with your hair. Either that, or go back to just shampoo/conditioner for a bit and add in things one at a time. \n\nOne last thing about flatironing -- does it work on the lowest setting with one pass? Hair can handle heat, but it's better not to be exposed to heat for a long time. If you're having to go over your hair several times on low heat, you're tugging on it more than necessary and should use a higher temperature for a shorter amount of time.",

    "body": "Hello Ladies! I thought I would create this post as I haven’t seen a very detailed thread about hair care yet. We often talk about skincare and beneficial or terrible ingredients here and on the wider web, however I always think hair care is never as thoroughly investigated. I’m a total newbie at hair styling, however I will blow my own trumpet and say after years of research and trial and error I’m pretty good at hair care. This will probably be very long even without me going into lots of detail, but feel free to ask in comments for more detail on specific things that interest you and I will expand. Also chime in with any extra info, especially if you’re curly haired! My experience and knowledge is more based in straight and slightly wavy hair. \n\nA disclaimer – proper hair care can be time consuming and require lots of trial and error at first, it did for me and everyone who I know is really into it too, but in my opinion it is worth it. It doesn’t have to be pricy though, there are lots of great cheap products! Once you find what works for you though, you will really reap the benefits for life. \n\n\nSo, let’s start!\n\n\n**Finding out the true state of your hair**\n\nMost likely you use silicones on your hair (a lot of products contain them), and silicones coat your hair, make it soft, sometimes weigh it down. They cover a lot of hair care sins. To find out the true condition of your hair, you will need to strip it of silicones. To do this, you will need to use a shampoo with a fairly strong detergent, sodium laureth sulfate (SLES), sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), or sodium coco-sulfate are often shunned, however they are great for removing silicones from hair. You can then apply a non-silicone conditioner, and then wait for your hair to dry naturally. At this stage, you will see how good (or bad) a condition your hair is really like. It may still be looking great, but you may get quite a shock and decide you need quite the chop. I know I did the first time I cleansed my hair properly. It went from being fairly soft albeit a bit flat with just some split ends, to dry, tangled, and extremely brittle on the bottom 10cm. It looked matted. I took off a third of my length immediately and then a few months later another 5cm or so. I will edit this later once I find some before photos of my hair, and I will also do a current photo with my hair free of silicones.\n\n**Figuring out your hair porosity**\nHair porosity is your hair’s ability to absorb moisture. There is theoretically a simple test [here](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/40/3d/62/403d621b14f0c8c63e04ec9b61c02508.png) you can do, however over time you may find the result of it wasn’t 100%. I have medium porosity, meaning my hair absorbs moisture okay and keeps it for a decent amount of time. Low porosity hair doesn’t absorb moisture easily, however once it does, the moisture stays for a very long time. This can lead to product build up which will need to be cleansed regularly. Low porosity often requires using heat to absorb moisture (such as putting on a hair mask, a plastic shower cap and blowing hot air at it). High porosity hair absorbs moisture quickly, but it also lets it out quickly. Often requires good conditioning, but may also require cleansing from time to time. It will often feel frizzy, and humidity will have a big impact on high porosity hair. Unfortunately, you can’t really change the porosity of your hair, but you can definitely care for it! \n\n\n**Ingredients and Products**\n\nI have to say, compared to the east, the west has actually rather limited hair care options. Most high street and even salon brands are really not fantastic. I live in the UK, but I source most of my products from Eastern Europe, so for those of you in the US my specific recommendations might not be too much help, but you might be able to find some or find alternatives by looking at the ingredients list. \n\n**Ingredients**\n\nThere isn’t really a super easy way to go about this. After a year or so I learnt the names of ingredients that really work or don’t work for me and I look for or avoid them. [Here]( http://www.tightlycurly.com/ingredients/) is a good ingredients list which tells you what the ingredient is and what it is used for. It does also have a ‘good’ ‘okay’ ‘avoid’ rating system, however I wouldn’t necessarily take it into consideration, as how a lot of ingredients affect you is personal (for example some people’s hair responds well to sulfates or paraffin, others not so much). \n\nThe order of the ingredients list is not accidental. The further from the top, the less of that ingredient there is. Any beneficial ingredient listed after ‘parfum’ is not going to bring you any results, as it is basically a trace, however something that you are sensitive to can still have a negative effect on your scalp even at such trace amounts. \n\n*Things to look for*: \n\n*Oils* – any ingredient name that ends with oil (except mineral oil which is paraffin, more on this later!) is beneficial for hair. The more and the closer to the top of the list, the better, especially in masks and conditioners.\n\n*Extracts* – again any name that ends with extracts. These are extracts of naturally occurring plants, herbs, or even legumes which have different beneficial effects such as smoothing, adding shine, protecting or strengthening. \n\n*Emolients* – lanolin, anything with ‘butter’ (e.g. shea butter), cera alba (beeswax), pafarrinum liquidum (paraffin, more on this later)\n\n*Humectants* – glycerin, urea, mel (honey), aloe vera, fructose (sugars).\n\n*Antioxidants* – ascorbic acid (vit C), tocopherol (vit E), Ubiquinone (Q10), retinol/retinyl acelate/palmiatate (vit A), niacinamide (vit B3). \n\n*Proteins* – hydrolysed silk, hydrolysed keratin, hydrolysed wheat protein, hydrolysed oat protein. Proteins help to strengthen hair. \n\n*Soothing ingredients* – allantoin, arnica montana, calendula officinalis, panthenol. Particularly useful if you have a sensitive scalp.\n\n\n*What to avoid (generally speaking):*\n\n*Sulfates* – Sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, although if anything in the ingredients list of your shampoo ends with sulfate, check on the list for strength. Sulfates don’t always need to be avoided.  They are cleansers and foaming agents used in a large majority of shampoos. They can strip your hair of oils and humectants and dry the skin on your scalp, however they are also useful in the removal of silicones.  They shouldn’t be used every day, but once a week to every 2 weeks is recommended if you use silicones on your hair. If your scalp and roots respond well to sulfates, you can protect the lengths of your hair by applying an oil or conditioner pre-washing, thoroughly washing your scalp and roots with a sulfate shampoo and only using the leftover foam on the length, then conditioning again. There are more and less harsh versions, and the gentler ones can be used more frequently, please refer to ingredient list! Not recommended for curly hair.\n\n*Parabens and preservatives* – Ones I found particularly harmful to me personally: DMDM Hydantoin, 5-Bromo-5-Nitro-1,3-Dioxane, 2-Bromo-2-Nitropropane-1,3-Diol, Diazolidynyl Urea, Imidiazolidynyl Urea, Phenyl Benzoate, Phenyl Dimethicone, Formaldehyde, Methylchloroisothiazolinone. Parabens are used to prevent products from going off. They’re not the only preservatives used in hair care and by no means the worst ones, but they can affect your scalp and hair. Eco-shampoos and conditioners are often filled with alcohol instead of parabens which can really dry out your scalp and hair. I don’t find parabens to be bad for my hair at all, but this is personal and you will have to eliminate and reintroduce (see that thing I said about time consuming at the start?) to really find out. You will not be able to find a preservative free product, therefore it is worth checking which work for you. \n\n*Alcohol* – alcohol denat and isopropyl alcohol, most others are fatty alcohols which are moisturising. The only time harsh alcohols are useful is when using hair ‘rubs’, where they help with product absorption. \n\n*Scents* – most scenting ingredients are listed under parfum, however some particularly harsh ones are required to be listed separately. These are: limonene, linalool, citronellol, geraniol, coumarin, citral, benzyl benzoate and eugenol. They’re usually at the very end of the list and in the trace amounts will not usually do any harm unless you have a sensitivity. \n\n*Silicones* – similarly to sulfates, silicones are not always bad. I personally like silicones. They work with my hair without concealing its true condition much or weighing it down. If your hair is thin you may find it better to only use the more soluble ones or none at all.\nI avoid shampoos with silicones at all cost though. The job of a shampoo is to cleanse your hair and prepare it for absorption of beneficial ingredients. I allow water soluble and gentle shampoo soluble silicones in conditioners and hair masks, and I use SLS requiring silicones in leave in conditioners that I only put on the ends of my hair. \n\nWater soluble silicones are: dimethicone copolyol, lauryl methicone copolyol, hydrolyzed wheat protein hydroxypropyl polysiloxane and silicones with PEG and a number at the start. The higher the number (especially above 10), the more water soluble the silicone. \n\nSilicones soluble in mild shampoo: amodimethicone, dimethicone, dimethiconol, beheonoxy dimethicone, phenyl trimethicone.\n\nNeed sulfates: simethicone, trimethicone, trimethylsilylamodimethicone, trimethylsiloxysilicates.\n\nEvaporate from hair (only washing with a conditioner to become soluble): cyclometicone, cyclopentasiloxane, cyclotetrasiloxane, octamethyl cyclotetrasiloxane, cyclohexasiloxane.\n\nI would advise completely removing silicones from your hair care routine for a week (you might find out your hair curls when it never did before), and then slowly reintroducing them one by one from the mildest to the heaviest ones to see how your hair reacts.  \n\n*Paraffin*  - Mineral Oil, Paraffinum Liquidum, Paraffin Oil, white oil are most common names of Paraffin. Paraffin has made a bad name for itself, it is known to be comedogenic to skin, however this does not happen to everybody, and even then you don’t have to put it on your scalp. Paraffin can be found in conditioners, masks and hair oils, and I’ve never had problems with it as an ingredient. It is also found in a lot of baby products, as near enough no one is allergic to it. You will have to experiment to see how it works for you. If it agrees with your hair, it works much quicker than natural oils – you will see results from first use, rather than after months of regular use. Products containing paraffin can be used after washing and conditioning to protect your hair from split ends. Paraffin requires stronger cleansing agents such as SLS for removal, and therefore not recommended for curly hair. \n\n\n**Products**\n\nNow, let’s look at specific products and how to get the most of them. \n\n*Hair Oils*\nI cannot recommend hair oils enough. This is probably the number one thing that changed my hair. I have been using hair oils for 6+ years and have never looked back. I’ve tried A LOT of oils, and my favourite one is [khadi]( https://www.essentialslondon.com/products/hair-care/khadi-vitalising-hair-oil-100ml?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIuOPxmKHw1QIVCrftCh1njgn9EAQYAyABEgIwGPD_BwE#fo_c=762&fo_k=e4b0478aa27161be9771ad687e8f656d&fo_s=gplauk). It promotes hair growth and keeps my hair healthy and shiny, but some people don’t like the scent. Pure argan oil and rosehip oil are also great for me, as is pure coconut oil or the coconut hair oil from [vatika]( https://www.amazon.com/Dabur-Vatika-Enriched-Coconut-150ml/dp/B006BA3BAY/ref=pd_lpo_vtph_121_bs_t_1/136-1463637-2732606?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=B8H7QG82QJF78X98V78D). There are a lot of oils on the market, just make sure what you’re using is pure oil, not stuff like the brand ‘moroccan oil’ because even your cooking olive oil is better than that. You can find a lot of indian hair oils on amazon. Apply by taking a few droplets and warming them up in your palms, then rubbing into the scalp and the lengths of the hair. When I first started my hair care and my hair was quite damaged, I would apply oils overnight every other night (before washing), and sleep with a cotton hair cap on to prevent transfer onto my pillow, then wash it off and condition in the morning. I now wash my hair in the evenings, so I apply it for about an hour before washing and I find that’s enough, but my hair is not particularly damaged.\n\n*Shampoos*\n\nFor day to day cleansing I try to find as simple a shampoo as possible, such as this [Babydream]( https://www.codecheck.info/kosmetik_koerperpflege/babypflege/babyshampoo/ean_4305615272467/id_792172/Babydream_Shampoo_mit_Kamille.pro). I’ve tried other ones over the years, but always come back to this one as it’s super cheap and gentle. I also like [Equilibria aloe vera shampoo]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,51609,equilibra-aloe-shampoo.html). Other products that I’ve used as a shampoo that aren’t a shampoo: [Facelle intimate wash]( http://www.rossmann.pl/Produkt/Facelle-intim-plyn-do-higieny-intymnej-Sensitive-300-ml,101735,7210), [Johnson’s Baby 3in1 Wash]( http://www.johnsonsbaby.com.pl/johnsons-baby-%C5%82agodny-p%C5%82yn-do-mycia-cia%C5%82a-i-w%C5%82os%C3%B3w-3w1). At the start I found my hair a bit tangled after use, but I think that was partly due to the damage. For heavier cleansing I use [Avalon organics rosemary]( https://www.amazon.co.uk/Avalon-Organics-Rosemary-Volumizing-Shampoo/dp/B001ET78QU) or any of the herbal [Barwa Natura]( https://www.barwa.com.pl/seria/barwa-naturalna/) shampoos. I do this every 10-14 days depending on how my hair feels regarding silicones and paraffin that I’ve used. A special mention goes to [Babuszka Agafia Black Soap]( https://bioika.pl/pl/p/Naturalne-Syberyjskie-Czarne-Mydlo-Agafii-na-bazie-37-ziol/659) which is just amazing. \n\n*Conditioners*\n\nI like to go rich here. I look for alllll of the extracts, oils, humectants, anything and everything. My everyday conditioner is the [Garnier avocado and shea butter]( https://www.fragrancedirect.co.uk/garnier-ultimate-blends-the-nourishing-repairer-conditioner-0083190.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=merchant&utm_keyword=foo&istCompanyId=17773c4e-a26f-4631-9b91-73e6422dbe77&istItemId=xiqwpwpqil&istBid=tztx&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9Oud06Lw1QIVxbztCh0PbQzcEAkYASABEgI4UfD_BwE) and it’s been with me for years. I also like the [seboradin ginseng conditioner]( https://seboradin.pl/en/seboradin-revitalizing/29-lotion-seboradin-revitalizing.html), Nivea Long Repair, [Balea Coconut and Milk](http://lepotica.rs/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/balea-mleko-za-telo-lepotica.jpg) and [Timotei Precious Oils]( https://www.amazon.com/Timotei-Precious-Oil-Hair-Conditioner/dp/B00UGHRW6M). Currently I apply in-shower for however long it takes me to shave and wash, then rinse off. When my hair was damaged, I would put a cap on and leave them on for 30 mins, then rinse.\n\n*Masks*\n\nAs with conditioners, as many of the goodies as possible. This is probably the product I’ve switched up the most, as there are not very many BAD hair masks, usually they’re between average and amazing. My favourites over the years have been [Alterra]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,43114,haarkur-granatapfel-aloe-vera.html), [Natur Vital aloe vera]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,40836,naturvital-sensitive-hair-mask-aloe-vera-juniper-zimbro.html) mask, [biovax masks such as this]( https://www.amazon.co.uk/LBiotica-Biovax-Damaged-Hair-250ml/dp/B00N42XUL2), [Babuszka Agafia yeast mask]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,51660,pervoe-reshenie-przepisy-babci-agafii-maska-do-wlosow-drozdzowa-na-pobudzenie-wzrostu.html) and [Kallos Latte]( https://www.notino.co.uk/kallos/serical-mask-for-damaged-chemically-treated-hair/?item=78561&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIqp7vxKPw1QIVbb7tCh2u0QGcEAQYASABEgKtzPD_BwE) mask. I used to apply masks twice a week, but now I do it weekly or even every 10 days. Usually I will apply a mask instead of conditioner, throw on a shower cap, and keep it on for anywhere between 1 and 3 hours before rinsing. Sometimes I will blow warm air from the hairdryer to help the ingredients absorb better.\n\n*Rinses*\n\nThere are many rinses you can make at home, not really available as products to buy. I like a chamomile rinse the best as I’m blonde, I also like a dissolved aloe one, but you can experiment with ingredients recommended for your hair type. They can strengthen your hair, add shine, reduce frizz, make it sleeker.\n\n*Rubs*\n\nThese are products that you rub into your scalp and roots (and sometimes hair length) without rinsing off. My favourite is from [Jantar]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,69415,jantar-odzywka-do-wlosow-i-skory-glowy-nowa-wersja.html), I also like [Joanna Rzepa]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,17640,rzepa-kuracja-wzmacniajaca.html). There are also placenta capsules after which I got an insane amount of baby hair. Rubs help with growth and strength of hair!\n\n*Hair protection*\n\nI use something with silicones and proteins in to protect my end, usually the silk from [biovax]( http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/like/112353278842?chn=ps&dispItem=1&adgroupid=44158024220&rlsatarget=pla-324287136906&abcId=1128926&adtype=pla&merchantid=115212699&poi=&googleloc=1007281&device=c&campaignid=856227250&crdt=0), but some hair oils (especially coconut) will also do. I do this once my hair is at least half dry and leave it in. If I’m not washing my hair for longer than 2 days, I will reapply. \n\n*Vitamins, Supplements etc.*\n\nThere are a lot of supplements you can try to help your hair growth or its condition. Vitamin E is obviously a staple. Biotin is fantastic for hair growth. Pregnancy vitamins strengthen hair. Drinking nettle and horsetail tea will do wonders. If you are really, really adventurous and can stomach a lot, drinking yeast (fresh is best, but dry will do) is the best for hair growth. You need to drink it every day for a prolonged period of time though, and it is incredibly unpleasant so requires a lot of commitment.\n\n*Hair styling and others*\n\nAs you might have seen from my previous post, I don’t often style my hair, and have never done. I do hairdry on cold or lukewarm settings, but I only use heat stylers for events and I chuck in a lot of hair protection. I’m gonna experiment a little with styling after my most recent post, but after looking for styling products, I’ve found very few that are not harmful to hair. I don’t brush my hair wet unless using the wet brush, I have a cotton tshirt I use to absorb water from it with instead of a towel, I don’t sleep with it wet, I keep it in a loose twisted bun overnight mostly to avoid rubbing. I have 3 different hair brushes (sable and synthetic) and a tangle teezer. If it’s very windy, I plait my hair, and I wear a hat in the sun. I wear a cap to go swimming. \n\n\nWell done if you got to the end, you are a hero. I hope you find these tips useful and can pick and mix as you please! Give most products 3-4 weeks to do their work before you deem them useless though. Looking forward to any tips you ladies might have on hair care, discussion, and what you found works for you and if you’re as obsessive as I am about it! \n\n\nEdit: link with some [hair photos](https://imgur.com/a/CQU90), 6 year difference",

And claims that it has been linked to hair loss, allergic reactions, and cancer.\n\nI am just curious if this is really a problem ingredient or are people blowing these out of proportion.\n\nAccording to the ecoco website:\n> Below, you will find a list of ingredients and a brief explanation of their benefits.  If you have any further questions please email us at info@ecocoinc.com.\n> \n> CARMOMER - This non-toxic emulsifier helps to increase thickness and consistency of good hair gel.\n> \n> **TEA (Triethanolamine)* - an alkaline substance used as a  PH adjuster.  It is an organic compound that is FDA approved.  We use the lowest produced dose of TEA (Lower concentration version) and of that less than 1% goes into our hair gel.  That tiny percentage is essential for ensuring smooth application and consistent PH levels.**\n> \n> Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein- Hydrates and improves moisture content of hair.  NON-ANIMAL derived source. Provides amino acids to skin, hair and scalp.\n> \n> PVP - Water soluble binding agent. FDA approved for use as clarifying agent in beer & wine as well.\n> \n> Glycerin - Vegetable based compound containing many good lipids that soften hair.\n> \n> Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate - Derived from a naturally occurring amino acid this acts as a great hair conditioner and provides a natural alternative to parabens.\n> \n> Polysorbate 20 - This is a solubilizer for fragrance that also adds soothing effects on the skin.  Derived from fruits and berries.\n> \n> Tetrasodium EDTA – This water soluble ingredient is used     to help neutralize ions and prevent microbial growth. Derived from glycerin, this is commonly used in food items as well.\n> \n> **\\*TEA can indeed contain nitrosamines which are known to be carcinogenic. However, cosmetic grade TEA from Dow Chemical Co. has previously been analyzed independently and there was no detectable nitrosamine across several batches (J Soc Cosmet Chem, pp 237-252, 1980). The word 'detectable' is important because the instruments used can find nitrosamines if there is even one nanogram (1 billionth of a gram) present......yes really that little! Therefore if this type of cosmetic grade TEA is used for the gel, it will have no detectable amounts of nitrosamine.**",

Their prices are very affordable and they sell glitter gels, eyeshadows, lip glosses, perfumes (with glitter and stuff inside!), skincare, and a couple of other products. I purchased two [glitter gels](https://hauntinghowlbeauty.bigcartel.com/category/wicked-glitter-gels) in [highlighter topper shades](https://hauntinghowlbeauty.bigcartel.com/category/biodegradable-eco-friendly-highlighter-toppers) \"Strawberry Milk\" and \"Lucky\". It cost me about $12 including shipping, and I received everything in early October (which I expected. Her TAT was as posted.)\n\nThey came in small containers, with **four** (!!) free friends in other shades. I'm not sure which shades I got as freebies, but one of them is a neon pink and orange chunkier shade that I've already worn several times, one is a bluer toned shimmer, and two are warmer soft pinks.\n\nThe [highlighter topper version](https://hauntinghowlbeauty.bigcartel.com/category/biodegradable-eco-friendly-highlighter-toppers) is preferable to me, since I ordered these to use as eyeshadows. The other versions contain non-eye-safe glitter, but the highlighter topper version is glitter-free, which I love! The gels themselves are aloe vera-based, which I really like. I direct messaged them asking for the ingredients of the eye gels since I couldn’t find them, and I was told: “ALOE LEAF JUICE, VEGETABLE GLYCERIN, CARBOMER, SEA KELP EXTRACT, HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN, JOJOBA OIL, APRICOT SEED OIL, VITAMIN E OIL, POLYSORBATE 20, SORBIC ACID, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, AQUA, PHENOXYTTHANOL, MARSHMALLOW ROOT EXTRACT”.\n\nThey take a sec to dry down, but once they are dry they are very comfortable to wear. I have not tested layering them with other kinds of shadows, but as a one-shadow look, they are very beautiful and dimensional, and they last for HOURS. They are also easily removable with water, which is MAGICAL to me.\n\nAdditionally, a little goes a long way. I thought the containers were kind of small, but I've used one shade four or five times, and I still haven't even dented the amount that's stuck to the inside of the lid! I will definitely get my money's worth!!\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend their gels, and I plan to try their pressed cosmetics and perfumes next. I see they also have a solid black lip gloss that looks very interesting! Their TAT is currently 1-8 weeks, so I don't expect anything I order to arrive anytime soon, but I don't mind that personally.\n\nHas anyone else tried this brand? What do you guys think?",

Here’s what I’ve figured out over the years:\n\nSomeone already posted it, but the Q-rapha brand is solid for legit soy sauce without wheat in it. Also Kikkoman does make an actual “gluten free” soy sauce that tastes the exact same as real soy sauce (so it’s not missing that end flavor note kinda like Tamari does). Can get these on Amazon very easily. \n\nChung Jung one is a good brand that makes gochujang without wheat flour. Sold in all kinds of Korean stores (even like in Kroger as a premixed bibimbap sauce). \n\nSempio makes doenjang without wheat flour. Same thing as above, super conventional brand. \n\nAlso look up Jinmi, they make GF jajang paste\n\nAlso if you go searching enough, a lot of “artisanal” Korean brands who make these products in the old ways will often exclude stuff like wheat flour. \n\nFor dishes, your safe bets are often soondubu (like 99.9% of the time). Kimchi jjigae can also be good as long as they don’t put gochujang in it. Honestly for both of these that can be the worry, OR they put dashida in there which has wheat. I’m forgetting the name, but the beef soup dish with bones is also solid (again as long as they don’t put dashida in there). \n\nIf you’re cooking at home tho, you can basically get around everything now with those products I listed above. Rice flour works super well for pajeon, and you can also use rice flour/potato starch/corn starch for frying (which can often produce a better coating anyways). \n\nHope this helps folks!",

I have adverse reactions to lots of things, especially meds, so researching other peoples' opinions/reviews doesn't usually work for me....it's all trial and error. 😣",

Any others who use/ have used their products? \n\nHey, first time poster here but a huge fan of the sub! I've been through many products the last year or so trying to find new products for my hair that fit me. I have long silky and straight hair but it gets easily split ends and can get very tangled in the mornings..\n\nI have recently tried a new brand though - the biosilk shampoo and conditioner plus silk treatment. I have paid much for hair salon shampoo and conditioners but these did not work as good as the biosilk products. I'm very surprised how good they work for my hair, the shampoo and conditioner makes my hair instantly combable after showering, which I've never experienced before! So long story short, why does the products work for me? Are the ingredients good long term? Any others who use or have used the products? If so, what was your experience with them?\n\n\nIngredients in the shampoo:\nAqua/Water/Eau, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, Polysorbate 20, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Silk, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Symphytum Officinale Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Extract, Parfum/Fragrance, Benzyl Benzoate, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone.\n\nIngredients in the conditioner:\nAqua/Water/Eau, Cetyl Alcohol, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Amodimethicone, Hydrolyzed Silk, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol , Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Trideceth-8, Citric Acid, Benzophenone-3, Symphytum Officinale Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Extract, Fragrance (Parfum), Benzyl Benzoate, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol.\n\n\nI noticed the conditioner has citric acid and cetyl alcohol in it, I've heard acid can let good moisture in the hair as well as bad stuff..\nAre the ingredients good for my hair/scalp?

For those who don't know it's an autoimmune disease where ingestion of gluten (a protein in wheat, barley, and rye) makes my body attack the villi in my intestines and I get very sick. Similarly to an allergy, ingestion of even a tiny amount of gluten is dangerous for me. Despite being on a gluten free diet since being diagnosed I've still been getting sick fairly often and my doctors and I have been trying to figure it out what's going on for a while. With that background, on to the nail related part of the post:\n\nI've been using OPI Nail Envy as my base coat/strengthener for 6 years now, maybe longer? I go through a bottle probably every 6 months to a year, so I hadn't actually seen the packaging that the bottle comes in since I was diagnosed. I just ordered a new one and lo and behold one of the ingredients is hydrolyzed wheat protein! WTF. I'm so freaked out and disappointed. I literally have the stuff on my nails right now! I know it might seem paranoid but I definitely have the habit of putting my fingers in my mouth and certainly I cook with my hands a lot and we all know that nail polish doesn't just stay perfectly on your nails- it chips and wears down over time so it's totally a risk factor for ingestion for me and I feel like I can't safely use Nail Envy anymore.\n\nThe problem is... that was like my holy grail product. Before Nail Envy I used a few strengtheners/strengthening base coats like Sally Hansen and they just made my nails brittle. Please, tell me you have a product you like that helps your nails grow long and strong and does NOT have gluten or wheat/barley/rye derivatives in it 🙏",

I use the thin examination style gloves that they use in doctor's offices. I use nitrile (I find they feel less like I'm wearing gloves), but vinyl and rubber also work! To keep water out of the gloves, I use those small clear elastics around my wrists. I also find that keeping my hands above waist-level can help prevent the water from trickling into the gloves via the tendons in my wrists, this usually tends to happen while shaving so I'll turn the shower head away to help prevent it. \n\nTechnically the gloves are single-use, however I reuse the same pair over and over until it eventually gets a hole, either from a nail popping through or getting nicked by the razor. I like to put some oil on my nails before putting the gloves on to shower so that even if some water does get in, the oil can help repel it. If you feel the gloves are getting \"gross\" turn them inside out, put them on your hands & \"wash your hands\", dry them and then you can lay them flay to dry! I also reuse the same elastics until they snap. \n\nIt definitely is a bizarre sensation that takes getting used to, so keep that in mind. Side note, I won't even shower with gloves on if my nails are naked, that's too much risk for me.",

    "body": "Wondering if anyone has information on how hydrolyzed wheat protein could damage hair extensions. For background, I am a stylist, and had a former coworker who always advised not to use conditioners with hydrolyzed wheat protein if you have hair extensions. I got new human hair extensions installed in November, and didn’t look at the ingredients in the conditioner I was using (rookie mistake I guess?). I noticed that my extensions are full of split ends, despite using what I thought were good products. Checked my conditioners, most of them have hydrolyzed protein of some sort, and even my hair spray has hydrolyzed wheat protein 😫 \n\nJust wondering if anyone can explain why the hydrolyzed proteins would damage the extensions, and if it is only hydrolyzed wheat protein that could be damaging, or if any hydrolyzed protein would do the same damage (I’ve seen hydrolyzed soy protein, hydrolyzed oat protein, hydrolyzed silk, and hydrolyzed keratin on the product labels I checked). My understanding is that the extensions don’t require the extra protein that damaged or natural hair does, and the extra protein causes the extensions to break from being over-protenized.",

So I would assume that means any protein. So I would try to find a conditioner with only hydrating ingredients (which is difficult... they love to put protein in everything out there.)\nI have ultra bleached hair and have used high protein masks before and my stylist would tell me if my hair starts to feel really good, stop using it. It wont feel better if I use more. It will just make it brittle. \nMaybe you can try making your own conditioner? Something with oils perhaps. Food for thought!",

Ran out a week ago and noticed a packaging change when picking up my new tube. The feel of the cream is noticeably different and I've started breaking out badly.

    "body": "Hi everyone,\nI've had long time to experiment with my hair. I am very confused to what to do with it.\n\nI believe my hair is type 2a wavy hair. It's hard to say because when its short you would think i have straight hair, but there are slight waves, now that it is longer and layered.\n\nIn humid summer days, my hair frizzes and poofs up like a cottonball. I found that using a conditioner or product with protein helped.\n\nSo hair seems to be a few issues, with the protein my hair has more volume, but its still super volumized unless I put in mousse.\n\nThe strands seem to look more straight or curly depending on how much I sweat (the more sweat, the more wavy it looks). I tried using salt sprays with mixed results. It does make my hair more wavy+volume but I don't like the scrunchiness of it. \n\nSo here is the issue. My hair gets greasy real quick, I found that using oil containing conditioners make my hair limp. Recently, I tried the Pantene Ice Shine conditioner by mistake. This conditioner is oil-free but contains dimethicone. On the first night, I loved that it made my hair more voluminous and the curls in the waves were pronounced. However, on my second day of washing my hair with only the Ice Shine conditioner (no shampoo), the silicone in it straightened out my hair and weighed it down, making it flat.\n\nSO after this I used the Ice Shine shampoo, which contains sulfates and betaines and other substances that I'm sure stripped my hair of the silicone, and I'm back to just using protein stuff.\n\nSo now I'm unsure what to do. So far the only thing I do with my hair is use a refresher spray that replaces my conditioner (I don't condition because I find anythign with oil makes it limp due to grease). My refresher spray contains:\n\n * hydrolyzed rice protein\n * aloe\n * hydrolyzed corn protein\n * hydrolyzed wheat starch\n * hydrolyzed wheat protein\n * keratin amino acids (I mixed in)\n * silk amino acids (I mixed in)\n * a bunch of hydrating plant extracts (oil-free)\n * glycerin\n\nThis spray helps give me volume and makes my hair not frizzy in humid weather, but my waves are not defined. I am looking for a way to make my waves more pronounced without having to wash it everyday. \n\nI like the idea of salt spray, but so far I have mixed results, and I'm looking for alternatives. I am also avoiding heat methods, not because I'm against it, but rather I'm looking for types of ingredients and products that might enhance my waves first.\n\n\nwhat I know about my hair so far:\n\n * possibly type 2a , fine density hair, each strand itself is thin\n * can appear slightly wavy or straight\n * volume is flat if I don't use protein\n * greases very easily\n * oil containing conditioners are too heavy+oily, and makes my hair flat\n * oil-free and silicone contaning conditioners worked for the first night, but second night it weighed it down and made it limp.\n * frizzes without protein in humid summer\n * in general volume is difficult to get at the top/crown of my head. it is flat there most\n * I generally avoid sulfate shampoos unless i used silicone products like that Ice Shine Conditioner with dimethicone.\n * sometimes I don't bother shampooing and just use protein-free conditioner, because I find it makes no difference, but I rather not remove proteins from my hair, so I just wash in a conditioner that is free of protein. I spray with my refresher spray so im sure i get enough protein from there. \n \n\n\nany tips?",

My scalp doesn't redden anyway so that's probably irrelevant. I haven't experienced anything with my scalp until about April of 2015 where I just started getting white flakes (along with hormonal acne, etc.). It's almost been 2 years and I can't seem to get rid of it permanently. I live in a humid, polluted urban area in Southeast Asia. I've tried shampooing every other day, every two days, but nothing seems to help calm my scalp and remove the flakes. My hair gets oily when I do no-poo because of the environment that I live in.  I've used Head and Shoulders, CLEAR (Asian Brand), and many anti-dandruff shampoos, but it worsened if not did nothing for my itchy scalp. I don't consume meat (pescatarian), and eat a lot of carbs, veggies, fruits and moderate amounts of seafood, if diet has anything to do with my scalp balance. I've tried VCO, ACV, and none of them have helped as well. Nizoral, I did try, it kept my scalp in check for a couple of days, and then it went back to showing visible white flakes. I just used Nizoral to calm the itchiness as we speak. I don't know whether it's dandruff or a dry scalp. Here's a picture of my scalp if any of you could help\n\nThese are the ingredients of the shampoo that I've been using for the past 6 months. aqua (water), sodium cocoyl isethionate (coconut-derived), decyl glucoside (coconut-derived), sodium lactate (sugarcane-derived), sodium gluconate (sugarcane-derived), glycerin (vegetable-derived), Cocos nucifera (virgin coconut) oil, dicaprylyl ether (vegetable-derived), Persea gratissima (avocado) oil, olus (vegetable) oil, Aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf juice, guar gum, levulinic acid (rice or corn-derived), Mentha piperita (peppermint) essential oil, Mentha arvensis (corn mint) essential oil, coco glucoside (coconut-derived) , glyceryl oleate (coconut -derived), xanthan gum, charcoal (bamboo-derived), phytic acid (rice-derived), anisic acid (anise seed-derived), citric acid\n\nThis is my conditioner: aqua (water), cetearyl alcohol (vegetable-derived), cetrimonium chloride (vegetable-derived), Persea gratissima (avocado) oil, olus (vegetable) oil, Helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, Glycine soja (soybean) oil, capryloyl glycerin/sebacic acid copolymer (vegetable-derived), diheptyl succinate (vegetable-derived), Aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf juice, hydroxypropyltrimonium honey, hydrolyzed wheat protein, levulinic acid (rice or corn-derived), fragrance (all-natural), anisic acid (anise seed-derived) (I've tried co-washing once, but it didn't seem to help.

Coupled with the fact that you are probably of Asian descent, and thus probably have straight and/or fine hair, I would say that you probably don't need conditioner. If conditioner touches your scalp it can make it oily, which makes seb derm worse. If you want to keep using conditioner, apply only to the length of your hair, avoid the scalp.\n\nI hope that helps.",

    "body": "About a year ago, I cut a foot off my hair with promises to grow it back better. I shaved the underside and deep conditioned with every wash it because it was all broken off, started washing my hair less (once every 3 or 4 days now), stopped using heat products, get haircuts every 8-10 weeks, and  tried buying better shampoos/conditioners for my hair.\n\n\nAt that time, I bought an olive oil shampoo/conditioner pair from Regis Designline and it seemed to work well. I've used it for a year now and my hair seems tired of it, so I tried purchasing some new ones after asking my hair dresser for a suggestion. I've tried Healthy Sexy Hair Soy Moisturizing Shampoo ( which is supposedly sulfate free and has argon oil in it) and also Paul Mitchell's Super Skinny line. Healthy Sexy Hair made my hair feel strawlike and Paul Mitchell's made it oily within a day, and feels almost waxy when it's drying. \n\n\nI've never dyed or permed my hair and have med-course and straight-wavy hair. I'm half Cambodian, half white, so I'm wondering if my hair chemistry is different from what they make products for. When doing at home masks, my hair seems to like olive oil. Since trying these shampoos, my hair has gotten frizzier, I've noticed new split ends that weren't there before, and is more tangled. Any suggestions to try?\n\n\n\n**Healthy Sexy Hair Soy**\n\n\nWater (Aqua, Eau), Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycol Distearate, PEG-4 Rapeseedamide, Sodium Chloride, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Acrylates Copolymer, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Fragrance (Parfum), Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Glycerin, Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone, C11-15 Pareth-7, C12-16 Pareth-9, Trideceth-12, Disodium EDTA, Magnesium Chloride, Magnesium Nitrate, Potassium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Sodium Benzoate, Panthenol, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Ammonium Chloride, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, PEG/PPG-18/18 Dimethicone.\n\n\n\n**Paul Mitchell's Super Skinny**\n\n\nAqua (Water, Eau), Sodium Myreth Sulfate, Cocamide MIPA, Alcohol, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Isoceteth-20, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Algae Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Leaf Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Polyquaternium-10, Trideceth-12, PEG-150 Distearate, PEG-3 Dioleoylamidoethylmonium Methosulfate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone, Triethyl Citrate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, C11-15 Pareth-7, C12-16 Pareth-9, Magnesium Nitrate, Bisamino PEG/PPG-41/3 Aminoethyl PG-Propyl Dimethicone, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Parfum (Fragrance), Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool\n\n\n\n**Regis DesignLine Olive Oil**\n\n\nwater, olea europaea (olive) leaf extract, sodium laureth sulfate, disodium lauroamphodiacetate, PEG-10 olive glycerides, cocamide mea, cocamidopropyl betaine, polysorbate-80, polyqaurternium-4, hydrolyzed wheat protein, PEG-12 dimethicone, olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, fragrance, methylparaben, propylparaben, diazolidinyl urea, green 5, yellow5\n\n",

I emailed them and they assured me that there is no gluten left after the hydrolysis process. I was so excited!! I got the curl charisma leave in and don’t despair repair mask and omg they made my scalp ITCH. I have never had a problem with my scalp but these gave me such a bad allergic reaction that I have shampooed with sulfates to get rid of the product and it’s still itching days later. \n\nSo if you’re gluten free, just be wary if you haven’t tested other products with wheat proteins before or do a patch test first!!

For human products, I got glutened using a hair gel with wheat protein. When I washed it out in the shower, the water must have ran down my face and got in my mouth.

    "body": "So, I have thin, fine, slightly wavy (less wavy than 2A type, but not straight either, kind of wavy in patches), currently coloured (I started going grey at 21. I'm now 28 and going back and forth about whether I can deal with being noticeably grey at this age), between chin and shoulder length, crappy hair. Dry and greasy at the same time. Always coated with a fine layer of frizz. sometimes blow dry it, but usually air dry it.\n\nIt's always been crap. I have to wash it every day to stop it being greasy, but I have tried not to. On two occasions I've gone a couple of months washing it every other day, but it was still an oil-slick on day two by the end and I never had much luck with dry-shampoo.\n\nI'm now on day 4 of co-washing. I've also been keeping the shower water coolish. For the first couple of days I just used the conditioner I had as I didn't see any silicones in the ingredient list:\nhttp://www.boots.com/en/LOreal-Paris-Elvive-Nutri-Gloss-Shine-Conditioner-400ml_21752/\n\nBut for the past two days I've been using this one, as I didn't see any bad ingredients in it (I may have missed some): http://www.boots.com/en/Naked-Rescue-Conditioner-250ml_863348/\n\nI've also got the leave-in conditioner version of that product. \n\nI think my hair might be a bit shinier, and it's not in the slightest bit greasy on day one (I'm going to try leaving it a day on Sunday when I don't have to be at work looking professional) but it's also reeeeaaaaaalllly fluffy, fly away and static. This isn't necessarily something new, but it is a bit worse. Previously, I would have dumped in smoothing products, but everything I have contains silicones (and they never really helped that much anyway)\n\nI've found that even with just using the conditioner, it still leaves my hair 'squeaky clean' once it's rinsed, which suggests that it's still over cleaning my hair, right? Am I missing something in the ingredients? Should I go for the mildest product I can find? I'm certainly going to try washing (or rather conditioning as I won't be using shampoo) less frequently. Is this just an interim phase before my hair becomes amazing? Any ideas?\n\n*Edited to add the ingredients for the conditioner I'm using:\nAqua, Cetearyl alcohol, Brassicamidopropyl dimethylamine (derived from brassicacae oil), Olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, Butyrospermum parkii (shea) nut butter, Passion incarnata (passion) seed oil, Dicaprylyl ether, Glycerin, Lauryl Alcohol, Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed wheat protein, Aspartic acid, Hydrxypropyl oxidized Starch PG-Trimonium Chloride, Starch hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, Sodium lactate, Sodium chloride, Parfum, Chlorphenesin, Urea, Citric acid, Coumarin, Linalool, Lactic acid.\n\nAnd the leave-in conditioner:\nAqua, Cetearyl alcohol, Polyquaternium-37, Hydrolyzed vegetable protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Brassicamidopropyl dimethylamine, Aspartic acid, Ceteareth-20, Dicaprylyl ether, Lauryl alcohol, Argania spinosa (Argan) oil, Butyrospermum parkii (Shea butter), Parfum, Tocopheryl acetate, Chlorphenesin, Benzyl alcohol, Dehydroacetic acid, Coumarin, Linalool.",

I didn't use the conditioner since it had wheat protein in it (I'm celiac and I try to avoid putting gluten on my hands, even if it's microscopic), but my friend said she hated the conditioner. (She has curly/kinky hair.) I warned her to be careful if it got on her scalp since AHAs increase photosensitivity. (There was no warning about this on the bottle -- perhaps there's too little % in there?)\n\nAnyone know why L'oreal would bother putting lactic acid in a conditioner? What can AHAs do for hair? Or ceramides, for that matter? I assumed that this was an attempt to capture what's popular in skincare these days, but I knew I had to ask you guys!\n\n**The copy on the bottle reads:** The new Total Repair Extreme collection contains powerful ceramide to help repair broken hair fibers**. This luxurious formula instantly penetrates into the fiber to deeply renew extremely damaged and over-processed hair.\n\nI found this rather vague, even given the standards of beauty copywriting, but maybe I don't read enough shampoo bottles.\n\n**The full ingredients:** Aqua/Water/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Paraffinum Liquidum/Mineral Oil/Huile Minerale, Behentrimonium Chloride, Parfum/ Fragrance, Isopropyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Glycerin, Lactic Acid, Arginine, Glutamic Acid, Linalool, Hexyl Cinnamal, Chlorhexidine Digluconate, Serine, Benzyl Salicylate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Benzyl Alcohol, Limonene, Amyl Cinnamal, Citronellol, 2-oleamido- 1,3-octadecanediol, Alpha-isomethyl Ionone.\n\nAny insight?

I put a few strands in a water bowl and they never sank, but when I wash my hair it seems to get wet right away. Then read about how having low porosity I should avoid protein, went and checked the label on my conditioner, and the other conditioner... \"hydrolyzed wheat protein, hydrolyzed jojoba protein...\"! So I'm wondering if all that protein is the reason why some rebellious strands refuse to \"clump\" to a curl and just kinda zig-zag away? These frizzy strands do have a different structure from the other, more behaved ones: the \"nice\" ones are smooth with no (or very little) variation in width along the lenghth of the strand, whereas the angry frizzy ones vary in width, resulting in thicker and thinner parts... I'm trying to explain the best I can. \nSo is it safe to assume that just totally avoiding the protein should fix my problem?   \nSorry for the long post. I hope I explained it well. Be nice, it's my firts post!\n\n**TL;DR:** I'm pretty sure I have low porosity and found out products I've been using all have protein. Is that the reason why some strands are very frizzy and have a great variation in width along the lenghth of the same strand?\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the advice! I'll try switching to something without any protein and see if it gets better. Now I have to find it... I live in Brazil and here organic cosmetics are not as largely available as in the US and there's less variety. They're also A LOT more expensive... I had bought a few bottles of different stuff while in the US a couple of months ago but they all have protein! :(  Anyway, I'll be back to share the results with you guys, thanks again!\n",

For 2024, I plan to develop a formula inspired by my discontinued product, although not necessarily an exact replica. I've heard that some ingredients are merely for marketing purposes anyway.\n\nI acknowledge that this might not be the most beginner-friendly project. But I am actively engaging in thorough research and plan to conduct small-scale batch tests. I also already own several of the equipment needed, including a scale, ph meter, thermometer, hand mixer, & heat resistant containers.\n\n ———\n\n**Original product ingredients:**\n\nWater (Aqua)\n• Cetearyl Alcohol\n• Polysorbate 60\n• PVP\n• Glycerin\n• Propanediol \n• Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil\n• Euterpe Oleracea (Acai) Fruit Oil\n• Collagen Amino Acids\n• Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil\n• Schinziophyton Rautanenii (Mongongo) Kernel Oil\n• Argania Spinosa (Argan) Oil\n• Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil\n• Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein\n• Hydrolyzed Soy Protein\n• Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate \n• Carbomer\n• Fragrance (parfum)\n• Triethanolamine \n• Citric Acid\n• Tetrasodium EDTA \n• Lilal (fragrance)\n• Linalool (fragrance)\n\n**My intended ingredients:** \n\nWater:   70%\n• Cetearyl Alcohol:  2%\n• Polysorbate 60:  3%\n• PVP:    2%\n• Glycerin:   3%\n• Coconut Oil:    5%\n• Argan Oil:  5%\n• Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein: 1%\n• Hydrolyzed Soy Protein: 1%\n• Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate (Preservative): 0.5%\n• Tetrasodium EDTA (Chelating Agent):    0.1%\n• Carbomer (Thickening Agent):     0.2%\n•Triethanolamine (Use as needed for pH adjustment)\n• Citric Acid  (Use as needed for pH adjustment)\n\n————\n\n**Equipment**\n\n**Heat-Resistant Containers:** For mixing and heating ingredients.\n\n**Stirring Utensils:** Stainless steel or glass stirring rods are commonly used.\n\n**Scale:** For accurate measurement of ingredients.\npH Meter or pH Strips: To monitor and adjust the pH of the product.\n\n**Thermometer:** For measuring and controlling the temperature during the formulation process.\n\n**Double Boiler or Water Bath:** To melt and heat ingredients gently without direct heat.\n\n**Emulsion Blender or Mixer:** For thoroughly mixing the water and oil phases.\n\n———— \n\n**Directions:**\n\n\n**Weigh and Measure:**\nAccurately measure each ingredient using a digital scale. Record the measurements to ensure reproducibility.\n\n**Combine Water and Emulsifiers:**\nIn a heat-resistant container, combine water (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, PVP, and Polysorbate 60. Heat the mixture until to around 70-75°C (158-167°F) and to when the Cetearyl Alcohol is fully melted. This forms the water phase.\n\n**Combine Oils:**\nIn a separate container, combine Coconut Oil & Argan Oil, and any other oils desired. Heat the container until the oils are well-mixed. This forms the oil phase.\n\n**Emulsification:**\nSlowly add the oil phase to the water phase while stirring continuously. Use a hand mixer or an immersion blender to ensure thorough emulsification.\n\n**Cooling Phase**\nAllow the mixture to cool down to around 40°C (104-113°F).\n\n\n**Add Active Ingredients:**\nIncorporate Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein and Hydrolyzed Soy Protein into the emulsified mixture. Stir well.\n\n**Preservative and Chelating Agent:**\nAdd sodium hydroxymethylglycinate and tetrasodium EDTA to the mixture. Stir well.\n\n\n**Adjust Thickness with Carbomer:**\nSprinkle Carbomer into the mixture while stirring to achieve the desired thickness. Adjust the amount based on the consistency you want. Make sure to avoid clumps. Allow the mixture to hydrate and thicken.\n\n\n**Neutralize and Adjust pH:**\nIf necessary, use a pH meter to check the pH level. If it's too acidic, you can use a small amount of Triethanolamine to neutralize. Or citric acid (to lower pH) or sodium hydroxide (to raise pH). A pH between 5.0 and 6.0 needs to be achieved.\n\n\n**Final Mixing**\nMix the entire formulation thoroughly to ensure all ingredients are well-dispersed.\n\n\n**Quality Check:**\nCheck the consistency, texture, and stability of the cream-gel. Adjust ingredients if necessary.",

A few initial thoughts: \n\n- The cetearyl alcohol and Polysorbate 60 are likely part of an emulsifying wax here, and that would probably be easier to work with. This would go in your oil phase.\n- Depending on the hold the original product gave, you may want to play around with the PVP level until it's optimal.\n- What sort of carbomer are you using? If not pre-neutralised, you'll need a neutralising step specifically for that. You may also find you need to use a little more, depending on the texture you want.\n- The carbomer needs to be fully hydrated in the water phase, not added at the end.\n- Use the immersion blender. A hand mixer is not suitable for making cosmetic emulsions.\n\nBut overall you've done a good job researching and planning this formula.",

You could use DMDM hydantoin or Liquid Germall Plus instead. The tetrasodium EDTA should be added to the water at the beginning before heating.\n\nYou have to use the carbomer at the beginning. Basically you hydrate the carbomer, neutralize it with TEA, then heat the water (and oil phase), and then you can make the emulsion. You can't really thicken an emulsion with anything after it is made.\n\nI'd leave out the carbomer. The texture of the emulsion might be a little less elegant without it, and it might be very slightly less stable, but I suspect this is going to take a lot of practice and iterations to get right.\n\nI suggest you start off making a few simpler emulsifying wax lotions without PVP or carbomer to get a feel for lotionmaking before you start working on this.",

It was SO thick and sticky that I found it hard to apply to my hair. I was very interested to see if this would be the same, and also if it was curl enhancing. :)  Here's my review!\n\n**Basic Info** \n\nThis is what is listed on the product itself description-wise. \"Eco Styler Curl & Wave Styling Gel is a firm hold styling gel ideal for curly and wavy hair. It is weightless and provides gravity-defying hold for all styles. Eco Styler Curl & Wave Styling Gel is water-based and will provide moisture to help maintain healthy hair.\"   PS- this is the pink gel. :)\n \n**Ingredients** (as listed on product):\n\nWater, carbomer, hydrolyzed wheat protein, PVP, glycerin, triethanolamine, sodium hydroxymethylglycinate, polysorbate 20, tetrasodium EDTA, Fragrance, Love and pride.\n\n**Price**\n\nOn amazon, it is listed as $1.59 for 8 fl oz. Holy crap!\n\n**Where to Buy**\n\nThis is where I've been having difficulty.  I couldn't log onto to eco styler website because it has ecocoinc.com comes up as \"this site may harm your computer\".  When I searched for \"eco styler pink\" I came up with a lot more options than \"eco styler for curly and wavy hair\".  Just an FYI. :)\n\n**How to Use**\n\nPer the directions: \"Apply to dry or wet hair. Work desired amount through hair and style. \"\n\n**Pros**\n\nThe hold on this gel was marked as an 8 out of 10- and it was definitely true to that. A little goes a very long way! When I scrunched out the gel cast, it worked nicely.  It's CHEAP!  Also, this is alcohol and silicone free.  I also think it's a plus that it's a pretty pink. :)\n\n**Cons**\n\nThis gel, just like the other eco styler gel I had tried, was SUPER thick and sticky. I couldn't imagine trying to apply this to dry hair. I had to apply it to my soaking wet hair to even feel that it didn't pull at my curls when I scrunched and removed my hand.  I didn't like the methol-like smell of it either.  It definitely did NOT enhance my curls. In fact, I would say they made my normally 3b curls more into the type 2 category.  \n\n**Overall**\n\nI will revisit this in the summer when my hair doesn't need any curl enhancement. I think it's strong hold would work well at that time. For the winter months(right now), it's a bit too heavy for my fine curls.  ",

    "body": "# Protecting Your Hair from Heat Damage\n\nProducts that claim to reduce damage to your hair when used during styling with heat tools like blow dryers, curling irons and flat irons are considered heat protection. They can come in the form of sprays, creams, lotions and/or serums. In this post, I break down how to think about the temperature of your heat styling tools and the product ingredients that are best for heat protection.​ (This is the full blog beside a diagram of all the heats listed below, the post is a bit better organized on my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-protecting-your-hair-from-heat-damage.html))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Effects of Heat Damage**The diagram below shows how hair reacts to different blowdryer temperatures. A good blowdryer can be judged by (1) how strong the air flow, or blow force, is from the device and (2) how hot that air can get. The cost of a blowdryer can range anywhere from $20 to $250+, with the more expensive brands often offering better quality tooling that produces those effects to a greater degree. Those factors matter because they can contribute to cutting your blowdry time in half, which is a life saver when you have an 8am meeting to get to. However, more powerful tools are only useful if you know how to use them. Often people mistakenly abuse a higher quality blowdryer by overheating areas of their hair, or by not concentrating on certain spots for long enough.  \n\n\nAt work and at home, I use a [Dyson Supersonic](https://www.dyson.com/hair-care/hair-dryers/supersonic) blowdryer. I frequently use the \"fast drying and styling\" temperature (shown on the diagram below) on my own hair and with clients.  The \"cooler drying and diffusing\" setting is more commonly used on curly hair, while \"constant cold\" is for smoothing your blowdry with a blast of cool air right after it's done.  \n\n\nWhen considering the diagram below, imagine what a strand of hair looks like under a microscope (visual [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=hair+under+microscope&oq=hair+under+microscope&aqs=chrome.0.0i433i512j0i512l5j0i22i30l4.2387j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)). A healthy strand will appear smooth, while a damaged strand will appear rough and as though jagged shingles are coating the outside. Those jagged shingles are cracks in the hair's cuticle that are caused by overuse of heat and chemicals. I give an overview of the risks of different types of hair damage in my post [Hair Challenges: Part I](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---dry-hair.html) and [Part II](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-ii---build-up.html). In general, with heat damage your hair is more likely to break, tangle, have unexpected reactions to color, and adopt casts of green or orange by soaking up minerals from your tap water. These conditions make it harder to grow and maintain your hair over time. \n\n**​Heat Protection Ingredients**Now that we have a little insight on how heat affects hair, let's look at some ingredients that can help create a barrier from that heat. According to [L'Oréal](https://www.lorealparisusa.com/beauty-magazine/hair-care/damaged-hair/heat-protectant-for-hair.aspx), their products are \"often formulated to protect hair from temperatures as high as 450 degrees\", which means some products are designed to protect from heat all the way up to the \"danger zone\". There is more to maintaining healthy hair than heat protection alone, but when that is top of mind for you below is a list of ingredients that will help, plus a few to avoid.\n\n**Protein:** found to prevent cuticle cracking \n\n* P/DMAPA Acrylates Copolymer \n* Protein polysiloxane copolymer\n* 2% glycerin (that is a lot for any formulation) \n* Polyquaternium-55 \n* Hydrolyzed wheat protein \n* Hydrolyzed vegetable protein PG-propyl silanetriol \n* Hydrolyzed wheat protein PG-propyl silanetriol\n\n​  \n**Oils and Silicones:** products that disperse heat, found to prevent cuticle cracking \n\n* Sodium polystyrene sulfonate ([stable up to 576°F](https://salonkhouri.com/blog/2018/04/10/whats-inside-killer-curls/))\n* Sodium laureth-40 maleate/styrene sulfonate copolymer \n* Dimethicone\n* Amodimethicone\n\n**Conditioning Agents:** not found to prevent cuticle cracking \n\n* Polyquaternium-11\n* Cetrimonium chloride\n* Stearalkonium chloride\n* Quaternium 70 (Stearamidopropyl Dimethyl Ammonium Chloride)\n* Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine\n* Triglycerides, silicones, mineral oils and petrolatum\n\n*Sources:* [*How Hot is Too Hot for Healthy Hair?* ](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2012/02/how-hot-is-too-hot-for-healthy-hair.html)*by the Science-y Hair Blog*  \n[*The Cracking of Human Hair Cuticles by Cyclical Thermal Stresses*](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286849276_The_cracking_of_human_hair_cuticles_by_cyclical_thermal_stresses)*, Manuel Gamez-Garcia*",

Of course, I want to make sure I won't be damaging my hair in the process or ruining my curls, so I've been doing my research and looking around for my holy grail heat-protectant - one that can tolerate high-heat (around 425 F), has water-soluble silicones, no proteins, and no drying alcohols. I've already found a heat-protectant that I plan on trying soon (Discover Found Avocado Oil Heat Protectant Spray), however I'm still looking for a hydrating, heat-protectant leave-in conditioner to use prior to blow-drying. It's been a long search, and although I haven't found the perfect product I think I've come close enough with some of these. I'm open to some exceptions, such as using Amodimethicone because from my understanding it creates a thin film over the hair, doesn't build on top of itself, and mainly builds in damaged areas in the cuticle. Proteins are something I'd highly prefer to avoid as my hair seems to like getting as much moisture as it can get, but in really small quantities I may be fine. Also trying my best to avoid drying alcohols. So with all that in mind, I'd love to get some second-opinions on these products and which would be the best fit for what I'm looking for. I've left some notes on these, so I hope that won't confuse anyone lol. Any other product suggestions would be highly appreciated.

I’m currently on an elimination diet, but I’m realizing that maybe the acne and very stubborn folliculitis I’ve been experiencing for years is being caused by both ingested wheat and beauty/personal products. \n\nYesterday I was checking the ingredients in all of my bath products, and learned that my favorite shampoo contains hydrolyzed wheat protein. Clearly I should stop using it and see if my skin issues improve, but it got me thinking—what other wheat ingredients should I check for? \n\nI’ve read that vitamin E added to bath products and lotions is often derived from wheat in the US. Does anyone here with a wheat allergy have reactions to ingredients like this? \n\nMost of the literature I’ve found online is about celiac disease and these products. Some sources say that wheat-derived ingredients are ok for celiacs because there’s no gluten in these wheat derivatives and/or doesn’t matter because it isn’t an edible product. But what about those of us with IgE mediated wheat allergy?",

I used to use Aussie products and for years 3 Minute Miracle was my go-to conditioner and it always treated me well.  About 1.5 years ago I switched to Nexxus Keraphix because I was hoping to add some weight to my hair.  It has always dried really light and fluffy, if that makes sense.  I liked Keraphix and it did what I was hoping, making my hair feel thicker and heavier.  However in about the last 5 months or so my hair suddenly became REALLY tangly.\n\nWhile I'm washing  and conditioning it it hard to get my fingers through my hair. I know you aren't supposed to brush wet hair, but I used to be able to slide a brush right through with no issues and now when I get out of the shower it is a nightmare getting a comb through it. Even a wide-tooth comb is hard as it knots up right away.  I'm 40 years old and this is a completely brand new thing for me.  I have no idea what is going on.  I have used dry shampoo and leave-in argan oil occasionally as well.  I've tried using a couple other random shampoo/conditioner combos to see if maybe it is the Keraphix for some reason, but the results were the same.  I have also been getting knots in my hair while I sleep which is a new thing, too.  Any thoughts or advice are welcome.  I feel like my hair is ruined!  Below are the Keraphix ingredients in case that is helpful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I've been reading more on the sidebar.

        "body": "I think the problem could be too much protein. Keratin is a protein and there are other proteins as well in those products. When your hair gets too much protein it causes issues- like making it dry, brittle, and tangly. You may consider a moisturizing deep treatment and switch to a shampoo and conditioner that doesn't include keratin or other proteins. Our hair needs the right balance of protein and moisture or it tends to tangle easily. So of course too much moisture can also be an issue so once you get to a balance you may want to rotate your current shampoo and conditioner with a moisturizing one to maintain the balance. \nI wouldn't worry much about brushing it wet. Use a detangling brush and have conditioner or detangler in while brushing. I've got curly hair and when it's wet it literally the only time curly hair can be brushed so that's how we detangle our hair. But once you get your hair balanced you should have an easier time detangling it when dry, assuming your hair is relatively straight.",

Most contain humectants which just draw more moisture to your hair, lifting cuticles and causing damage/frizz. High porosity hair takes in and loses moisture faster. Protein will help with this. \n\nYou should be using oils after showering, to seal your hair in humid weather. Try using less and buy a sulfate body wash, or use your clarifying shampoo on your shoulders/back every time you shower. Else prepooing doesn’t do much except fill holes, it’s still damaged.

I found out after I've been using it for almost 2 months :(.  The YTC conditioner is ok though. There is also a Garnier Fructis that I made the mistake of buying but thankfully I verified the ingredients before using it.  \n\nThat \"search ingredients\" link is sadly another site that hasn't been maintained for a while :(\n\nIf you need product recommendations, try the pinned post at the top of this subreddit and scroll towards the bottom for the product recommendations.

I was an idiot and reduced my gluten intake before going to my doctor, because I was trying to figure out what was causing my problems (at the time mainly just bloating). So I decided to go properly gluten free, because the 5 more weeks of gluten didn't sound that appealing at the time if I wanted to be tested. \n\nNow if I have any (haven't intentionally, but cross contamination gets me) I get bloating, stomach pain, nausea,etc, and acne.

    "body": "# Recommended Product Ingredients\n\n​I always have clients review their hair care routine with me during appointments, which helps me recommend better products for their needs. The most common issue people share is experiencing a loss of effectiveness in their products over time. This results from a need to balance cleaning your hair with moisturizing it. Below I've provided a guide to help balance your hair care routine based on the recommendations I usually give my clients, complete with a list of the most effective ingredients for each category. I purposely left non-detergents (soaps) off of the list because they use oils to remove contaminants, which I've found does not clean hair as well.  (This is the full blog but if you want to screenshot the ingredient lists the post is a bit better organized on my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-recommended-product-ingredients.html))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Surfactant Cleanser **Definition:** Surfactant cleansers are detergents or cleaning agents. They work by surrounding and lifting residue off of the hair strand so water can rinse it away. On a product's ingredient list you generally see them listed towards the top. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Detoxes, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used by all hair types. Helpful for oily hair. See [How Often Should I Shampoo?](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html) ​for frequency.\\*\\*Ingredients:\\*\\*​\n\n* Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n* Sodium cocoyl isethionate \n* Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n* Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate \n* Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n* Sodium lauroyl glutamate \n* Sodium cocoyl glutamate \n* Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate \n* Ammonium lauryl sulfate ​\n* Ammonium laureth sulfate\n* Sodium polystyrene sulfonate\n* Cocamidopropyl betaine\n* Coco betaine\n* Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine\n* Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n* Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n* Sodium lauroamphoacetate\n* Sodium sulfosuccinate\n* Cocamidopropyl betaine\n* Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n* Sodium lauryl sulfate \\*\n\n*\\* Sodium lauryl sulfate is not recommended for daily use.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Non Surfactant Cleanser **Definition:** This cleaning agent does not completely lift oil and grease off of the hair strand, meaning it does not fully remove them. Doing so lightly cleanses your hair while also retaining moisture (i.e. conditioning it). It is not recommended for use with silicones, mineral oil or petroleum products because these ingredients deposit a [residue](https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/493588) under the hair's cuticle that require a surfactant cleanser to remove. I usually suggest using a clarifying shampoo once a month with this type of cleanser. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Detoxes, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used by all hair types. Helpful for dry hair. See [How Often Should I Shampoo?](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html) ​for frequency.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil\n* Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil\n* Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil\n* Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil\n* Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Detox **Definition:** While similar to the Cleanser category, the Detox category is stronger. These cleansing agents remove product build up and help with demineralization of the hair. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used once a month by all hair types. Helpful for oily hair.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Disodium EDTA (Ethylamine Diamine Tetraacetic Acid)\n* Pentasoidum Pentetate\n* Sodium phytate\n* Phytic acid\n* Citric acid (needs large enough quantity to be effective)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Humectants **Definition:** T​his ingredient helps retain moisture from water by attracting it to the hair strand in humid climate conditions. However, in dry weather humectants have the opposite effect and will transfer moisture from your hair into the atmosphere. This can leave your hair dehydrated, which may not be what you want depending on its current state.*Tip: Humectants are complementary to silicones and plant oils.* **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** Can be used daily by all hair types. Helpful for dry hair. Using a detox once a month is recommended with this category.\\*\\*Ingredients:\\*\\**Hydrolyzed Proteins*\n\n* Hydrolyzed Elastin, silk, keratin, collagen \n* Peptides (wheat, oat, soy...)\n* Amino acids (wheat, oat, soy) or glycine, alanine, proline, etc.\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (source of protein, i.e. keratin, silk, rice, soy)\n* Cocoyl hydrolyzed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (source of protein)\n* Potassium cocoyl hydrolyzed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (source of protein)\n* Hydrolyzed oat flour\n\n*For Use In Humid Weather​*\n\n* Vegetable glycerin\n* ​Sorbitol\n\n*Plant Gels*\n\n* Panthenol\n* Flax Seed Gel\n* Okra Gel\n* Aloe Vera\n* Hydroxyethylcellulose\n* Pectin\n* Xanthan Gum\n* Guar Gum\n* Marshmallow Root\n* Slippery Elm​\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Soluble Silicones **Definition:** This ingredient coats the hair shaft to lock in moisture, reduce frizz, add slip, and give hair the coveted soft and silky feel. Soluble silicones can be washed out with non surfactant cleansers. **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** Can be used daily by all hair types. Using a detox once a month is recommended with this category. \n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Any silicone with PEG as a prefix\n* Bis-peg/ppg-16/16 peg/ppg-16/16 (This is an emulsifier - not for shine or lubrication)\n* Cyclomethicone\n* Dimethicone copolyol\n* DEA PG-Propyl PEG/PPG-18/21 Dimethicone\n* Dimethicone PEG-8 Phosphate\n* Dimethicone-PG Diethylmonium Chloride\n* Hydrolyzed Silk PG-Propyl Methylsilanediol Crosspolymer\n* Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n* Hydrolyzed Wheat protein/hydroxypropyl polysiloxane and cystine/silicone co-polymers\n* Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Silanetriol\n* Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol\n* Lauryl methicone copolyol\n* PEG-40/PPG-8 Methylaminopropyl/Hydropropyl Dimethicone Copolymer\n* PEG/PPG-14/4 Dimethicone\n* PEG/PPG-20/15 Dimethicone\n* PEG-12 Dimethicone\n* PEG/PPG-20/15 Dimethicone\n* PPG-8 Methylaminopropyl, Hydroxypropyl Dimethicone Copolymer\n* PEG-7 Amodimethicone\n* PEG-8 Disteramonium Chloride PG-Dimethicone\n* PEG-33 (and) PEG-8 Dimethicone (and) PEG-14\n* Silanetriol\n* Silicone Quaternium-8\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Plant Oils **Definition:** This ingredient is used to retain moisture, condition hair, protect from damage and minimize dryness. **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** Can be used daily by all hair types. Helpful for dry hair.  **Ingredients:**\n\n* Coconut (Cocos Nucifera) Oil \n* Sunflower (Helianthus Annuus) Seed Oil\n* Olive (Olea Europaea) Oil\n* Argan (Argania Spinosa) Oil\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Preservatives **Definition:** Additives that prevent spoilage. Most consumer products contain preservatives because without them any water-based solution will eventually grow mold or bacteria. **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** A routine is not applicable for this category since it's included in most products, but pay attention to whether your products cause scalp irritation. That could be a sign to switch to, or alternate with, preservative free options.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Sodium Benzoate\n* Potassium Sorbate \n* Benzoic acid\n* Dehydroacetic acid\n\n*​Sources:* [*Cationic Compounds in Cosmetics*](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/search?q=surfactants)*, Science-y Hair Blog*[*Detergents Which Remove: Silicone*](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2016/05/detergents-which-remove-silicones.html)*, Science-y Hair Blog​*[*Essentials of Hair Care Often Neglected: Hair Cleansing*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3002407/)*, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)*[*Glycerin and Humidity*](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2015/02/glycerin-and-humidity.html)*, Science-y Hair Blog*[*Film Forming Humectants - What They Are And Why You Need Them*](http://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2014/07/film-forming-humectants-what-they-are.html)*, Science-y Hair Blog*",

We have some information we want to share with you.\n\nDMDM hydantoin is a formaldehyde-releasing preservative that's in some hair and skin products. Most people don't have issues with this, but it is possible to be allergic to formaldehyde, which means you'll [likely](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0536.1988.tb02802.x) also react to DMDM hydantoin. Your doctor or an allergist would be able to confirm this. We obviously don't know if that's what's happening here, but hair loss is a known side effect of allergic reactions that cause contact dermatitis.\n\nFormaldehyde is a known carcinogen, but in tiny amounts in a rinse off product, it's not likely to have a health impact in the grand scheme of things unless you are allergic.\n\nUnlike the DevaCurl allegations, the DMDM hydantoin controversy (and any related lawsuits) is tied to this specific ingredient. If you do happen to have issues with hair loss and DMDM hydantoin, you should consider checking for a formaldehyde allergy just in case, as there are [several other ingredient](https://www.contactdermatitisinstitute.com/formaldehyde.php) you might be sensitive to as well.\n\nIf I'm wrong, I probably just picked up on a keyword in your title (Please ignore me!).\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

    "body": "Hello guys. I have low prosoity hair but in some way the STRENGTHEN & RESTORE TREATMENT MASQUE from Shea Moisture was a miracle for me. My hair is not good in elasticity at all and I know that an increase of moisture should be the solution of this problem  (I've already tried with the Manuka Honey one and some deeply moisturizing mielle products) but for me it was the opposite. I've never used any protein for year but now if I don't use them my hair lacks of elasticity, they tangles a lot and seems very dry, thin and lifeless. So, since I used this deep conditioning mask for almost 2 months now (1x week), all this troubles disappeared.  \n\n\nTalking about the mask itself, I have used this one (from iHerb):  \n\\->  **SheaMoisture, Jamaican Black Castor Oil, Strengthen & Restore Treatment Masque, 12 oz (340 g)**   \n( Water, cetearyl alcohol, cocos nucifera (coconut) oil, glycerin (vegetable), butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter\\*♥, stearyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, behentrimonium methosulfate, fragrance, behentrimonium chloride, panthenol, hydrolyzed wheat protein, hydrolyzed wheat starch, cetrimonium chloride, persea gratissima (avocado) oil, mangifera indica (mango) seed butter, olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil, mentha piperita (peppermint) leaf extract, mauritia flexuosa (buriti) fruit oil, yeast extract, hydrolyzed keratin, macadamia ternifolia seed oil, tocopherol, niacin, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, acetic acid (apple cider), hydrogenated vegetable oil, glycine soja (soybean) oil, trifolium pratense (clover) flower extract, caramel, triethyl citrate, caprylyl glycol, benzoic acid.)  \n\n\nBut now I see two version of the formula in different stores, the \"second\" one is easier to find than the one that I used. Which should I buy? I think that if this first one worked for me, I should stick with it, but the other one is more common in stores. \n\nThis is the formula of the second one that I found (from LookFantastic but I think the same formula from Boots too):  \n\\->  (Aqua, Cetyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Glycerin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter\\* \\*\\*, Stearyl Alcohol, Parfum, Panthenol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Olea Europaea Husk Oil, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Mauritia Flexuosa (Buriti) Fruit Oil, Yeast Extract, Cocodimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Keratin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Niacinamide, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-3, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Trifolium Pratense Flower Extract, Caramel, Caprylyl Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Acetum, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Dextran.)  \n\n\nWhat do you think it is better? Which one should I buy? I heard that Shea Moisture changed formula and people are not happy about it. Maybe the first one is the old formula. What do you think?  \nThanks for reading and for the suggestions already. Have a good day.",

I've always been fond of Dead Sea stuff since my dad came back from Jordan with a bag of mud from there that was amazing on the face, so I decided to check it out.  \n\nBasically, the lady rubbed a bit of a facial peel on my wrist and little balls of dead skin came up which she then sealed with a lotion.  I did see a noticeable difference between my wrists afterwards, and the one she demonstrated on did feel a lot softer.  However, my skin is really sensitive, so I decided to hold off purchasing until I tried to find some more feedback.  I was told that the product line was originally created for people with eczema, but I still want to be cautious.  \n\nIf anyone has tried this stuff or knows more about what's in it than I do, I'd appreciate the feedback!  My skin has been peeling like crazy since starting Tretinoin, I thought this could help.\n\nBelow is the ingredient list for the facial peel:\nWater (Aqua), Polyvinyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Saponaria Officinalis Extract, Polysorbate-20, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Camellia Oleifera Seed Extract, Cellulose Gum, Fragrance (Parfum), Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Farnesol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vit.

You're seeing the roduct balling up, and with it, there's probably some superficial dead skin.  Just a little FYI.\n\nI love those little peeling gels. I feel that they are a good way to go for physical exfoliation that's gentle. \n\nI definitely would *not* use this while you're in the adjustment phase of tretinoin. And also, you really don't want to physically exfoliate flaking skin (or eczema or psoriasis), you'll end up irritating it more. So I'm going to call bullshit on anyone formulating a physical exfoliation product for something like eczema.  \n\nSlather with Vaseline or EltaMD Intense instead, it'll all slough off on it's own.\n\nAnyhow, if it's reasonably price, totally go for it after you adjust to the tretinoin.",

I have a mystery on my hands. \n\nI impulse bought a new conditioner recently and noticed something very odd about it: when I'm using it, it actually seems to make my hair rougher and more tangled. The effect is instantaneous: the tangling actually happens in the shower, before I've even rinsed it off. \n\nIt's the [L'Oréal Paris Total Repair 5 Restoring Conditioner with ceramide](http://www.lorealparisusa.com/en/Products/Hair/Hair-Care/Shampoo-Conditioner/Advanced-Haircare-Total-Repair-5-Restoring-Conditioner.aspx#ingredients). Here are the ingredients:\n\n>AQUA / WATER / EAU • AMODIMETHICONE • BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE • BEHENTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE • PARFUM / FRAGRANCE • DIPROPYLENE GLYCOL • PHENOXYETHANOL • BENZOIC ACID • TRIDECETH-6 • HYDROXYPROPYL GUAR • POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE • LINALOOL• HEXYL CINNAMAL • ARGININE • GLUTAMIC ACID • BENZYL SALICYLATE • SERINE • CETRIMONIUM CHLORIDE • BENZYL ALCOHOL • LIMONENE • HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN • AMYL CINNAMAL • CITRONELLOL • 2-OLEAMIDO-1,3-OCTADECANEDIOL • ALPHA-ISOMETHYL IONONE\n\nFor context, my hair is long, straight, and usually normal (neither dry nor oily). I don't heat style it or use styling products, and I always brush it before getting in the shower. \n\nI think the conditioner is primarily to blame, as the tangling doesn't happen until I apply it, but I did also get the shampoo from that line. [Product info and ingredients here.](http://www.lorealparisusa.com/en/Products/Hair/Hair-Care/Shampoo-Conditioner/Advanced-Haircare-Total-Repair-5-Restoring-Shampoo.aspx)\n\nObviously I'm not going to continue using this stuff, but since I'd like to avoid having to unclog my shower drain any more than I already do, it'd be nice to know what ingredient(s) could have caused this so that I can avoid them in future. \n\nThanks for reading this.

        "body": "I was right in the middle of an investigation to find out the culprit who broke me out and had just reached the conclusion that it could actually be butylene glycol. What a coincidence 😊\n\nI went through the ingredient list of every single product that caused me irritation and lo and behold, every single one of them contains butylene glycol among the top ingredients. Certain products would work great for a few months and then one fine day my skin will start getting itchy bumps. In other cases, the irritation will occur right after the first use. This was driving me crazy. Then I found that the products that caused irritation right away contained butylene glycol among the top three ingredients and for the rest, it came towards the bottom of the list. I researched the products that I used to use before I started serious skin care and none of them had butylene glycol. So this has to be the culprit.\n\n Sadly this means finding Asian Beauty products that works for me a hard task since almost all of them contain butylene glycol. Thankfully, my sister is not allergic to BG, so the products won't go to waste. \n\nI have combination skin by the way and I am not using any actives.",
