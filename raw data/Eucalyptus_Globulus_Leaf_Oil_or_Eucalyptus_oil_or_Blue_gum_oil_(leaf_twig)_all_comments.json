It doesn't take long for it to start, and it stops fairly quickly after turning off the humidifier. More weirdly, in my anecdotal experience, the ambient humidity can be higher in the summer (than what is achieved when using a humidifier in winter) and not have this effect.\n\nEdit: I'm inclined to agree with those who've mentioned mineral deposits in the water. Fortunately, these are few in my area. Maybe I should be more concerned than I am, but there is virtually no residue around the humidifier or on it after running 24/7 for five or six months of the year. White powder residue was a common complaint in reviews, but I suspect those people lived in areas with a much higher mineral content in their water.",

You need to water the oil down before using it and the most common form of doing this is a water bottle. I used a Sam's Club water bottle, because we buy bottled water in serious bulk. I used the sauna the night before with my wife and then placed the bottle up very high on the basement window sill. \n\nWell, today I for some reason took it down thinking it was trash. I realized it wasn't and put it on the book shelf. My daughter was getting into something and I forgot about it. I also didn't realize that eucalyptus oil is was so toxic. I knew it wasn't good to ingest, but they do use it as mouth wash. \n\nFast forward, 8 hours and my wife is using the workout room I set up. She comes out thirsty (not for me unfortunately)  and sees the water bottle. Takes a huge gulp and screams. She drank a mouth full of mainly highly toxic eucalyptus oil. \n\nI called poison control and they made me rush her to the hospital for observation. She is currently there right now, I had to come back home and watch our daughter. As, of right now she is fine and doesn't have any major symptoms, but they have to watch her for 4 hours. \n\nTL:DR my wife drank eucalyptus oil that I left in a water bottle.  \n\n\nUpdate- I can pick her up in 20 minutes and she is fine. PSA label your bottles no matter how long you use them and eucalyptus oil is extremely toxic. Like don't even get it on your skin. ",

But I knew I was in bad shape yesterday, and shortly after I boarded my train the nausea suddenly peaked. I ran out of the train at the next station and collapsed involuntarily on the platform heaving and crying, miraculously somehow not throwing up (the cold air really helped), and just so embarrassed.\n\nThe man who got off at the same door stuck by me and immediately was checking on me. Every single person who got off nearby all stayed close to keep an eye on things, while a small group asked me questions and offered support. Their kindness caught me so off guard that I ended up smiling despite the state I was in.\n\nI was obviously still a wreck but the immediately dangerous nausea cooled off within a few minutes, and I was so thankful to everyone who stayed with me. One man assured me he had nowhere to be, stayed with me until the next train arrived, and even gave me a small pot of eucalyptus oil gel he’d just bought to keep. I genuinely think the eucalyptus helped me make it the rest of the way home.\n\nI’ve never had something like that happen in public before. I felt so awful, panicked and embarrassed, but so many wonderful strangers handled the situation with such kindness. I don’t expect any of them to see this, but if you do – thank you. I made it home, and I’m feeling much better today.",

    "body": "TL;DR at the end.\n\n“How Yoga, Eucalyptus Oil, and Quaker Oats F*cked Up My Night” or “Taking Self Care Too Far, a Cautionary Tale”\n\nEither title works.\n\nAnyhow, I’ve been pretty proud of myself lately. Lots of healthy foods (even started to grow alfalfa sprouts since I can’t find them anywhere and eating it makes me feel like I’m a certified nutritionist) been doing workouts in the basement, drinking my 2 liters of water everyday - infused with cucumbers and mint fresh from the garden.\n\n(Yep, I know how pretentious this all sounds, but it’ll make the story soooo much more satisfying.  Bear with my holistic ass, folks.)\n\nAs I’m clearly rocking this self-care vibe, I decide to take it to another level.\n\nYoga.\n\nNever tried it before. But I know what namaste means, I get to use a cute pink mat, I finally get to wear my yoga pants for actual yoga, and it’s just stretching with a bunch of cute names attached. I’m going to ROCK this!! Easy, right??\n\nWRONG.\n\nSo the video had a beginning with tutorials or instructions or something. I don’t know. I didn’t watch it. But apparently I missed something important because within 5 minutes of doing the “downwards dog chasing a cat cow eating a lotus flower” pose, something snaps in my back.\n\nEverything is pain. I somehow make my way upstairs for a bunch of ibuprofen and decide a bath with epsom salt would help the muscles relax. So I draw a bath, pour my “Eucalyptus and Spearmint Muscle Relief” epsom salt in, and a brilliant idea hits me. If Eucalyptus helps sore muscles, I should pour in a bunch of eucalyptus essential oil straight from the bottle into the bath, right?\n\nWRONG.\n\nAbout 10 minutes into the bath my skin starts to feel like super prickly. All the sudden, my entire body is on fire. It’s burning and itchy and I’m freaking out. I jump out of the bath, I hop in the shower, rinse off. Still burning. Put lotion on. Still burning. Put a frozen bag of peas on it. Still burning.\n\nI literally know what the Wicked Witch of the West felt like when that hooker Dorothy poured water on her and this is how I’m going to die. I’m going to melt into a pile. I can’t go down like this!!\n\nI’M SUPPOSED TO BE GLINDA!! (I dressed up as her for Halloween last year)\n\nThen I remember that an oatmeal bath is supposed to be good for itchy, irritated skin. So I drain / rinse the bathtub, run cold water, run downstairs, grab a huge box of Quaker Oats, dump the entire thing in. This should help, right?\n\nWRONG.\n\nApparently when you do a oatmeal bath, you’re supposed to grind the oatmeal first to get the beneficial properties before you put it in the bathtub, and also because regular oatmeal is so hard on your drains (like cement) even a standard household drain cleaner can’t clear it.\n\nHow do I know all this?\n\nYep. You guessed it. My drains are now completely blocked.\n\nSo my back still hurts, my skin is on fire, I sat in a cold tub of slimy, disgusting oatmeal FOR NOTHING and I have to deal with this bathtub of culminating poor life choices because it won’t drain. \n\nMy bathroom smells like Wilford Brimley, Vick’s VaporRub, and shame. \n\nI’d use my husbands bathroom but I decorated it in eucalyptus leaves and I now officially hate eucalyptus. \n\nI don’t know a plant could be the arch enemy of your life’s narrative, yet here we are. \n\nMoral of the story? \n\nJust watch the damn tutorials.\n\nAlso as important... Don’t put shit in your bathtub that you know nothing about. It’s no biggie, you just sit in there naked and all your skin is vulnerable, but go right ahead! I’m sure that battery acid has anti-aging elements will compliment your lavender bubble bath nicely!! \n\nIf it doesn’t frigging say CALGON TAKE ME AWAY on the package, look it up first.\n\nBut wait for this...\n\nWanna know THE BEST part of this entire story? \n\nToday is International Day of Self Care. \n\nJuly 24. Literally today.\n\nI can’t make this shit up.\n\nAt least it gives me a clear cut answer for the title, “Taking Self Care Too Far, a Cautionary Tale” is clearly the winner.\n\nTL;DR Did yoga, pulled muscle, took a bath, added straight essential oil, burned my skin, poured a whole box of quaker oats in the bath to help and it clogged my drains.",

It elevates your core temperature, gets blood flowing to your muscles, and makes them \"wake up\".\n- warming up before a workout prevents injuries, increases gains, and makes you feel better during the workout itself.\n- never stretch cold muscles. Either stretch after your workout, or do 15 mins of movement first (actually raise your heart rate) and THEN stretch.\n- remember to work on strength, flexibility, and cardiovascular endurance.

Very severe insomnia. However, a few years ago or i have discovered that some lavender oil sprayed above my bed before i sleep helps calm me and i get a few extra hours a night (i usually sleep 1-3 hours, with lavender oil spray i can sometimes get a whole 5 hours) I’ve heard it’s helped others but im sure there are cases where it would not. Im not a fucking doctor.\n\nSo. This bitch i knew from highschool saw a facebook post about me being an insomniac and immediately commented tried to sell me lavendar Doterra claiming the kind i was using (a spray bottle bought at my local grocery store... In Australia, lavendar oil spray and eucalyptus oil spray is sold in the grocery store in the medicine isle as a natural wound disinfectant/sinus clearer) was the “processed” stuff and she could get me one that was “pure”. I stupidly believed her. \n\n$40 later the tiniest bottle arrives on my doorstep. No spray bottle. That would be extra. So wtf am i meant to do with this?\nSo I messaged her and she says “Don’t worry hun! I can get you a humidifier for your room half price, you can thank me later!” \nSo i buy more of her shit and finally set it up one night before bed. \n\nDidn’t do shit! Might as well have been spewing plain water vapor out of that thing because it did nothing and i lay awake for 3 nights.\n\nI go back to my old “processed” ways and slept much better. When i told her this publically on Facebook (calling her out infront of all her hunbot friends) she writes back:\n“So sorry it didn’t work for you, babes! That’s the first time in HISTORY it hasn’t worked! Are you sure you aren’t eating something before bed or drinking alcohol? Just like any medicine, doctors will tell you not to mix with booze!”\n\nI don’t know if she was trying to be insulting because i called her out or if she was just that insensitive. She also knows my long history of alcohol recovery. I am now 5 years sober and at the time was 3 years sober when she said this. \n\nI didn’t know what to say so i never replied but man there is so much i wish i could say to that bitch now. \n\nTL;DR: Hunbot sells me Doterra and claims it will help my insomnia. It doesn’t. I call her out and she publically implies that im an alcoholic on Facebook when she knows im 3 years sober.",

I knew what I wanted and I whipped out my business card showing that I am head of my lab for a prominent group. I have more degrees letters than name. Just give me some Halls. \nHe explained that is not how it works here. You present your symptoms and I prescribe the remedy. So I relented and described my congestion. He said that Americans get eucalyptus wrong. There’s no need to smell like a Koala bear.  Eucalyptus oil can be effective inside a capsule. It worked. \nI am impressed.",

    "body": "So far I've bought you such wonderful tales from my online store and a recent comment from my mother about what I used to sell bought up new memories of a much simpler time. \n\nBefore my store really expanded into what it is now, I used to sell a few smaller ranges of Pop Culture items. One of these was wall stickers or decals, usually depicting the latest princess or superhero. \n\nThey came in from my supplier in flimsy plastic packaging and I used to take them out and roll them up in hardy cardboard tubes for postage- the instructions were carefully cut out of the packet and inserted into the tube. I also had a disclaimer on the item page that if they need more information on how to use the item to let me know as I had a PDF version as well and could answer any questions as I used to practice with the items (ones that were damaged in transit) so I knew all about my product. \n\nIt was coming up to Christmas and business was booming, I guess because the stickers made great gifts. I'm just about to put up my holiday message explaining I will be away until *this date* so things will not be posted until *that date* when I get a frantic email from a woman wanting *random superhero* sent to her express as a last minute gift. \n\nAs I'm not a total scrooge, I work with her and we get the payment cleared and the item posted and I happily go on my holidays. \n\nTHREE MONTHS LATER this woman emails me in a fit, because her decal is broken and won't adhere to the walls. I ask for pictures to see if there is anything I can do. The first is the gratuitous shot of the thing all crumpled on the floor, then one of the blank wall. I look closer at the wall and see this sheen on it, but assume it's probably fresh paint. \n\nWe go through the standard questions about how she applied it. Somewhere down the line, this woman starts getting more and more aggravated. She is calling me all the names under the sun, accusations of not including instructions are thrown around etc etc. \n\nBy now I'm losing my patience. BUT THEN she lets out the first slip up. \n\nShe admits she kept it in the tube the whole time in her carport. In Australia. Over Christmas. In 40C heat. I explain that maybe the glue has been compromised, having been in direct sunlight for three months. She sends me a reply in all caps that it isn't her fault, but it is a fault with the product AND SHE KNOWS BECAUSE WHEN SHE PULLED IT OUT OF THE TUBE, THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE MELTED INTO IT. By now, I'm more interested in what else she has been telling fibs about, so I dig a little deeper.\n\nI ask if she read the instructions on preparing the wall. I usually advise people to lightly wash the wall with diluted detergent and water or a sugar soap solution. The woman replies that she did not have any on hand so she used- and I am not kidding- tea tree oil mixed with a little eucalyptus oil (because that makes the wall sterile, duh!). \n\nMy product had a removable glue on it, but the formula is a bit funky to explain, but let me tell you this. Anything like tea tree or eucalyptus oil (or rubbing alcohol, I've also had once) will strip the glue and make it kind of useless. \n\nBy this point, I am done. I email her back asking her to look at the \"tips\" section of the instruction list. I ask her to type it out for me. She types back that she can't be expected to read *all* the instructions.\n\nI emailed her back that as it was outside my 30 day refund and she voided her warranty with the item by blatantly ignoring instructions, there was nothing else I could help her with. \n",

    "body": "About two and a half weeks ago, I started getting fruit flies. I ignored the first few which was a bad idea. Then, they started to increase and I would see a few at a time. Now, I absolutely hate bugs and have trauma associated with bugs growing up. \n\nI started setting up apple cider vinegar traps with dish detergent and got fly stickies. My boyfriend and I deep cleaned out entire apartment. I poured Draino down the drains last week and have been pouring hot water down all the drains every single day for the past week. And I mean all the drains-- kitchen and bathroom. We had an exterminator come and he was confused on why we had fruit flies because our apartment was clean. \n\nI suspect the source was maybe an onion or a banana, but all those have been removed and/or are in our fridge for a week now. I'm feeling exhausted and my boyfriend is so sick of my paranoia. But, I just have no clue why we keep getting fruit flies. Each day, we will see about 10-15. Usually, they are dead in the traps and we only have to kill a few. I'll get excited when I go all morning without seeing a single one, but then when I get home, there's like 10 dead ones and a live one I have to hunt down like a madman. We don't usually get much during the night. I've also been wiping down surfaces with a combination of water, dish detergent, and rubbing alcohol. The kitchen drain is plugged too. \n\nWhere else could they be?? Could they be somewhere stupidly hard to reach the behind the fridge? Also, how would I know I've found the source if I haven't already gotten rid of it? Would there be a bunch larvae or flies if I find the source? It's taking a toll on me and I want to cook less and less. \n\nEdit: forgot some details such as no plants, no food outside of the fridge, and these little flies have red/orange eyes and striped bodies.\n\nEdit 2: thank you ALL for taking the time to read my post and posting advice. It means so much to me and makes me feel less isolated and less crazy! I am picking up the Zevo light tomorrow, have ice sitting in my garbage disposal, added eucalyptus essential oil to my rubbing alcohol/water/detergent mix, and still have my apple cider vinegar traps out.\n\nEdit 3: Again, thank you everyone for your help, advice, and empathy. I have read every single comment and upvoted each and every single comment as well. I appreciate this subreddit so much!\n\nEdit 4: For those reading in the future with this problem, reading this thread will be very helpful, but let me share what helped me the most. \n\n-I combined eucalyptus oil with my rubbing alcohol, water, and dish soap in a spray bottle and sprayed it. I noticed less very quickly.\n\n-I put ice cubes in my drain at night. This was the thing I think really helped me. I would filled my garbage disposal with ice cubes, sprinkle salt on top, and covered it with a sink drain cover thing. I did this twice a day— once at night and once in the morning.\n\n-I got the FruitFly Bar Pro strip from Amazon. This was the second thing I think helped a lot!! I hung it in my kitchen when I was away and they will go to it, eat it, and die AND take it back to their babies who will also die.\n\n-The Zevo light was good at catching stragglers as well!!\n\n-Every time I use my sink, I will spray some bleach spray down the drain for good measure. \n\nI will maybe see one live one every 2-3 weeks, but that is the extent of it. (Knock on wood).",

Sick of swatting, chasing, and reaching, I grabbed the hoover and proceeded to suck them all up and emptied the hoover outside after. From then on, if I saw another, I'd hoover it up. Worked like a charm and was way more effective than all the traps I used to set in the past for this problem. \n\nIt can take a few weeks to get them in check. If it takes longer, there's likely a breeding ground that you're missing (like my forgotten potato). Check for fruit fly sources in garbage cans, under and behind appliances, etc. It could literally be a small puddle somewhere. Replace your sponges too — that's another breeding ground. \n\nFruit flies also hate a lot of herbs — basil, peppermint, lavender, eucalyptus, lemongrass. You could put some plants in the kitchen to deter them.",

If so, sprinkle [Mosquito Bits](https://www.amazon.com/Summit-Chemical-Co-MOSQUITO-BITS/dp/B007RGAL6I/ref=asc_df_B007RGAL6I) onto the first layers of soil. It provides a type of bacteria that kill gnats' larvae when they eat them and then die.  It takes several weeks to kill the next generation, but the granules work well. Keep applying them (and don't overwater plants, because fungus gnats love waterlogged roots and wet soil!)\n\nCheck your sinks and drainpipes, and if you have a garbage disposal, you might have food particles & fruit peels in there that didn't get completely chopped. To clean it: Put a big amount of ice cubes down the disposal, and sprinkle Kosher salt over it,  then run water and turn on the disposal. The ice and salt will clean it well. Some people add lemon for the citrus aroma.\n\nUse [Enzyme cleaner](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XL3C6FR/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title) in your pipes -- it will slowly but surely dissolve the gunky soap scum and other nasty organic matter that collects in drains and pipes. It's not an instant fix, but it clears out slow draining sinks over time.\n\nCheck your potatoes and onions and any fruit or veggies you might keep in open bins; old potatoes and onions have attracted fruit flies to our house before.\n\nGood luck!

    "body": "I see a fair amount of posts on here recommending stocking up on prescription drugs and other medical items in the case of an extended crisis. I cannot agree more, but there are some items I don't see listed much that have been extremely helpful to me. For context, I spent years living as a busker/traveler/odd jobs. I was basically a hobo. I have since spent years living off grid in the woods. A lot of this stuff might fall under the category of herbal/\"alternative\" medicine, but I only share it because I have tested it and it works. I am not arguing you should replace conventional medicine with these things; if anything consider having them on hand should stocks of conventional medicine run out.\n\nNuSkin or Super Glue - used for sutures. Many people already know about this, but it's worth a mention.\n\nIodine - disinfectant, and sterilization of water for drinking.\n\nActivated Charcoal - this is the hobo remedy for giardia - the parasite that lives in most fresh water. It works - I had the misfortune of contracting that once. It is also used to absorb poison to keep it from going into the bloodstream. Safe for animals.\n\nWhole clove/clove oil - besides being a pest repellent, this is the preferred hobo treatment for toothaches. I have been told that holding a whole clove over the problem tooth for long enough will permanently kill the nerve. Fortunately my teeth aren't that bad but I know it dulls the pain considerably.\n\n* Edit - It's been pointed out in the comments that killing the nerve is a myth. Also it should go without saying to see a dentist if possible, as tooth abscesses are more than painful and a serious threat to your health! This is meant for those times where a dentist is unavailable for whatever reason.\n\nGoldenseal powder - Antibacterial. I suffered for months with staph that came back after each round of antibiotics. It was awful. I did not realize how close I was to dying. Finally someone told me this is what I needed. Depending on the infection you apply it to the skin, gargle, or take capsules - I took three a day and the staph that was systemic in my blood cleared up in four or five days. It's important that the powder is good. Lots of crappy supplements out there. It should be yellow green and staining, have a very strong smell and bitter taste. I am pretty sure it saved my life and know others with similar stories. Be mindful, because I'm told the plant itself is getting over-harvested.\n\nNu Stock - this is a wound dressing for animals you can find in feed stores. It is a mixture of sulfur and pine oil. It has a strong smell, but is like a miracle cure for rashes, burns, lesions, etc, while killing parasites like fleas. It was the only thing that helped my old dog's skin and I've used it on my own burns and poison oak rashes and it works better than anything.\n\nEye drops - just a good prep that's often overlooked. In the event of a disaster, being able to wash debris from your eyes could make a big difference.\n\nLemon Eucalyptus oil - this is the best pest repellent, though runner ups are things like tea tree oil and cedar oil. Another option is to mix water with ash and rub that on your skin, though that doesn't look pretty and will dry you out. It works though!\n\nSome other random things that people may not think of that can be really helpful are:\n\nHaving a dedicated spray/mister bottle for clean water - endless uses and conserves water really well.\n\nHave a steel guitar sting - the wire is just strong and flexible enough to come in handy for cleaning a miriad of things, whether mechanical parts or other hard to reach places. It's a weird item but takes up almost no space.\n\nIt might also be worth having some kind of product containing permethrin (like sargent's dog shampoo or such) in your preps, maybe even in your bug out bag. In the event of a disaster, if you end up at an evacuation center or something, parasites are a real risk, and I can tell you from experience that they reeeaally suck. Permethrin is not something to mess around with, but it will kill parasites, and dog shampoo is super cheap.",

    "body": "Why YSK: Cockroaches, ants, etc. can slowly become resistant to pesticides. Switching them up can prevent that. This also applies to weed killers, fungicides, etc.\n\nIdeally, you should use pesticides as little as possible around your home. They should be a last resort. Things like diatomaceous earth or natural repellents like lemon oil, eucalyptus oil, etc. are preferable. You can search for 'natural pest control' depending on what you're trying to keep away. \n\nPesticides can very easily enter the environment. You spray some ants or roaches, something like a lizard or a bird eats the dying or dead bug, gets sick itself and dies. Then maybe something like a hawk or a coyote eats the dead bird and also gets ill. This is a bigger problem with agriculture than home defense, but it's still an issue. In agriculture, many farms use pesticides on literally everything, all the time. Seeds are sprayed with pesticides and throughout the plants' lifespan. \n\nAgain, pesticides should be used as a last resort, but your mileage may vary. Having an exterminator come by once a month is probably excessive unless your problem is extremely serious. There's nothing wrong with using pesticides when necessary, but if you want them to be the most effective, it's important to limit their use and switch up chemical classes when applying them.\n\nSome sources:\nhttps://www.canr.msu.edu/grapes/integrated_pest_management/how-pesticide-resistance-develops\n\nhttps://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/natural-pesticide-tips\n\nhttps://www.chemistryworld.com/features/the-growing-problem-of-pesticide-resistance/4013465.article",

It's a stomach poison that slowly kills insects, while being almost entirely non-toxic to mammals (somewhat toxic to reptiles, though not terribly so... don't deploy anywhere they might roam).\n\nFun fact: roaches often eat their dead, and the long kill time of boric acid helps potentially wipe out multiple generations of roaches even when not continuously exposed.\n\nPut it anywhere and everywhere bugs might crawl, but people/pets won't (e.g. behind stove, fridge, edges of dishwasher, under sinks, bases of corners... literally anywhere you can get it on the ground).\n\nBy itself, it won't have an overwhelming impact (at least not at first), but in conjunction with a more comprehensive pest control strategy, it's basically more dead bugs for dirt cheap.\n\nFinal note: not particularly effective against bed bugs - they don't groom themselves, so they'll never ingest the poison (and won't absorb enough to die).",

    "body": "This was inspired by the popularity of my quick comment on the topic in the 30+ thread. Undereye circles have a variety of causes and will have different symptoms and treatments. It's possible to have a combination of several problems. I apologize for the lack of scientific references, I'm simply too lazy and making this post took longer than expected. Without further comment, this is the extent of my knowledge. Please comment to add any information or your experiences!\n\n\n#Brown circles\n\n**Caused by** hyperpigmentation from sun exposure, rubbing or hormonal problems. Sometimes genetic, more common if you have darker skin, but can happen with lighter skin too.   \n**Prevent by** using sunscreen, having good UV screening sunglasses, not rubbing the eyes.  \n**Treat with** ingredients that fight excessive pigmentation like vitamin C, mild retinoids, licorice root extract, arbutin, linoleic acid, niacinamide... [This thread on lightening ingredients by effect may be useful.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3r5ptc/psa_lightening_ingredients_split_up_by_mode_of/?st=j20qlpbm&sh=721abedd)   \n**Hide with** yellow based correctors.\n\n---\n\n#Purple circles\n\n**Caused by** circulation and drainage problems and congestion (sometimes caused by allergies or infections), capillary fragility.  \n**Prevent by** sleeping on your back to minimize the effect of gravity on blood pooling. Dehydration can cause capillary fragility so stay hydrated.  \n**Treat with** ingredients that promote circulation like caffeine, green tea and vitamin K. Horse chestnut extract and flavonoids (especially oligomeric proanthocyanidins) help strengthen capillary walls. Some medical conditions like undergoing dialysis or diabetes can cause lowered vitamin C levels in the body which has been linked to capillary fragility, supplementation may be effective in these cases. There isn't much research on skin oils but some of them are claimed to have capillary strengthening effects (rosehip seed oil, hazelnut oil, neroli oil, rose oil) and circulation improving effects (coriander oil, eucalyptus oil, cypress oil, evening primrose oil, geranium essential oil). There is anecdotal evidence in this thread that if you have persistent sinus problems a nasal spray (specifically Flonase) can be quite effective.   \n**Hide with** orangey correctors. Yellow correctors are the opposite on the color wheel but using the opposite color can create an ashy effect on skin.\n\n---\n\n#Grey/blue circles\n\n**Caused by** genetics (eye position in the socket and the amount of adipose tissue under the skin); thin skin (skin can be naturally thin, thin with age, prolonged use of some steroids can cause skin thinning); fatigue, stress and lack of sleep.  \n**Prevent by** using antioxidant ingredients, stopping smoking and using sunscreen. UV damage and smoking can cause premature skin aging, including thinning skin. Get enough rest.   \n**Treat with** ingredients that help thicken the skin by boosting collagen production like retinoids, vitamin C and zinc. Keeping the skin moisturized helps plump it up, too. If it's stress and fatigue related nourising and cooling eye masks may help.  \n**Hide with** salmon and peach correctors.\n\n---\n\n#Puffiness and bags\n\n**Caused by** circulation problems, allergies, congestion (can be a co-symptom of purple circles), fluid retention (fatigue, hormonal), or genetically having quite thick fat pads under the eyes (can start sagging with age).  \n**Prevent by** sleeping on your back to make it more difficult for blood to pool under the eyes; staying hydrated and not using too much salt. As skin loses elasticity with aging and becomes more \"loose\" it could allow more fluids and blood to pool in the undereye area, so helping elastin production with anti-aging ingredients could be preventative.    \n**Treat with** caffeine, green tea and vitamin K, cool compresses. Massages can help with fluid retention. You could make green tea ice cubes, wrap them in gauze so they aren't too cold, and use them as a compress, pressing gently from the corner of the eye outward to massage. Caffeine is great because it also helps if the cause is having naturally above average fat deposits under the eyes - it helps shift the cell metabolism from accumulating to burning fat, so the fat cells in the hypodermis shrink. Anti-inflammatory ingredients can help with swelling if it's caused by allergies or chronic infections. If you have allergy or chronic congestion problems do consult with your doctor.   \n**Hide with** a concealer slightly lighter than your skin, applied only in the shadow of the eye bag. Applying a lighter concealer on the bag itself will highlight it. Some facial primers and skincare products designed for undereye bags have a film former than can help tighten and compress the area. The facial primers tend to be ones designed for aging skin and have to sort of smoothed on, not patted on, for the film former to work the best.  \n\n\n---\n\n**Quick edit to add** - dark circle colour can be affected by skin pigmentation. \n\nBlue and purple circles can show up as more brownish or grayish with darker skin. \n\nBlue circles can sometimes appear somewhat purplish too, especially on very pale skin. Since it is blood vessels showing through the skin with very deep set eyes and/or thin low pigmentation skin the amount of vessels showing though can be nearing the look of lack of circulation or capillaries leaking blood.\n\nExtreme purple circles can look almost dark blue.",

Before I went I was trying to find a post like this but could not so this is for future searchers. \n\n*disclaimer, I am not a health professional, just someone with anxiety*\n\nNoticed I had a sore throat and slight nasal congestion after coming home from work Friday evening. Thought I’d rest up and see how I was on Saturday morning so went to bed smelling eucalyptus oil to unclog myself. Sat morning, okish but then the sore throat came back so I decided it was Time. \n\nI’m somewhat new to Sydney (1 year) so I don’t have a GP so I searched up a place where you didn’t need a referral. \n\nI used the map at [NSW Health](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Pages/clinics.aspx) and found a place where you could just text your name and time and fill in a form. \n\nTesting itself was very easy, they were ready for me as soon as I arrived and it all took less than a minute. They just shoved a swab in my throat and nose and voila. \n\nDrove home and hid out in my room, and got the text that I was negative before midnight (Was tested around midday).\n\nFor me I was planning on seeing a friend later and I was scared of passing something onto them. So now I’ll just see them next weekend instead when I’m better. \n\nTDLR, COVID testing is quick, easy and free, and good to do if you are showing any symptoms. \n\nShout out to my peeps with anxiety, who  might also be terrified of accidentally hurting other people or anxious about the process. Feel free to ask any questions. \n\nKeep safe everyone.",

The first time around, I presented at RPA in Camperdown. I know back then it was literally the first week of the COVID panic, so systems weren’t properly in place yet. It took around 3 hours in total; waiting in a socially-distanced waiting room, then going through various triage stages in smaller and smaller rooms. It was a such a man-power heavy operation, with staff needed at every step of the way to constantly sanitise, change PPE, etc. The test then was both the nasal and throat swabs. Back then, getting results was also a bit of a mess. I waited 4 days in isolation, with no phone call or message, and eventually had to scour the internet for a phone number to call; dealing with perpetually engaged phone lines, eventually manually getting my negative result.\n\nToday, 4 months later,  my experience at the Summer Hill drive through testing centre couldn’t have been better. No need to book, no GP referral needed, No need to get out of a car, with no line whatsoever to wait in (around 3pm this afternoon). Had a health care worker come up to my window to take down relevant details. Within a minute, another person comes over to actually administer the test. My partner was in the car with me, and also got tested. She had her own seperate 2 people come to the passenger window, making the process very fast. They were very clear and friendly with their instructions, recommending for eg to ‘tilt my head back, lean back on my head rest and close my eyes’ just before administering the nasal test. Like others have said, it is somewhat uncomfortable; but far from painful. My partner was particularly worried (she’s squeamish), but after the fact noted that the pre-test anxiety was probably far worse than the actual test. In total we were in and out in under 5minutes.\n\nThis time around, no results yet (it’s only been 5 hours) but was given an information sheet with clear instructions about what happens next. There’s a number to call if I don’t hear in 48hours, but all other reports indicate I’ll likely get it well before then.\n\nFor those thinking about getting tested, please do. It’s so quick and simple to do now. It’s not painful. More than likely too, if you’re negative, you’ll only be made to stay isolated at home roughly the 24 hours you’re waiting for results (so if say, you get tested first thing in the morning, you could in theory be back at work as early as the next day).\n\nStay safe out there, look after one another, and hopefully we’ll be over this pandemic nightmare soon.",

She played she ate and acted normal. I called the vet and she advised to give Benadryl and that the kids liquid I had on hand was fine (said sucrose not xylitol) within the hour she seemed back to normal. Question is: what could she be reacting too? My thought went to my down feathers duvet or the night before I was diffusing eucalyptus oil in my room so there might have been reminence on my bed? I didn't know about the dangers of oils until today (first time dog owner and we've had her 5 days) \n\nSecond: a few hours later she had blood around her anus and what looks like a hemeroid. She seemed fine but was scooting her bum on carpet. I took her to vet and they said they have never seen this before. They said it's not a prolapse. And didn't think it had anything to do with the morning incident. My thoughts are that maybe because we are crate/pen training and she's been very anxious while in there she may have been straining. They gave me a wash and a dewormer just in case and some probiotics. Anyone else experience anything like this? Thank you!",

    "body": " I’ve seen a number of posts on here showing examples of hunbots suggesting that various essential oils can be used to treat or cure all manner of ailments, often encouraging people to actually *ingest* the oils by adding them to drinks/food or putting drops on the tongue. I think this sort of thing is some of the worst MLM-related nonsense because it’s not only stupid, annoying, and deceptive, it can actually have serious consequences for any poor soul who follows such ‘advice.’ It’s not quite up there with the anti-vaccine movement, but it is monumentally stupid all the same. \n\nHere are some examples of the sort of thing I mean. Although I have re-uploaded them to imgur for ease of link gathering, the following all come from this sub. I’m not showing most of you anything new, just trying to illustrate my point. \n\n[Example one](https://imgur.com/a/XmSpPHd)\n\n[Example two](https://imgur.com/a/hr7OopW)\n\n[Example three](https://imgur.com/a/3aJ1UJI)\n\n[Example four](https://imgur.com/a/4QUZuLG)\n\n[Example five](https://imgur.com/a/ecyYXdr)\n\nAnyway, you get the picture!\n\nThe title says it all really, but for anyone who is curious then here’s the story. \n\nI live in an area that seems to have a bit of a problem with cockroaches, probably due to the number of takeaway restaurants here (they don’t call it ‘Curry Mile’ for nothing!) \nUntil I moved into this house I’d never even seen a cockroach in the UK. Now I’m dealing with having them in the house. Luckily, we’ve only seen a handful of them inside over the three years I’ve lived here. So it doesn’t seem to be completely out of control, but of course it’s still a horrible thing to have to deal with. \n\nWe had tried different traps and poisons, with limited success. Then I read that you can use an essential oil - eucalyptus oil - as a deterrent and/or ‘weapon’ against roaches. \n\nI bought a little bottle from the local pharmacy and mixed 10 drops together with water into a spray bottle. I sprayed around the areas that we’d seen the roaches in and all of the skirting boards for good measure. \n\nWell, a few days later I was sat on the sofa when a fat cockroach started sauntering past, bold as you like! It’s rare that we see them during daytime, so I thought maybe its ‘home’ had been hit with some of the spray I’d made and it had been forced to look for alternative digs. \n\nAll of a sudden I thought ‘I wonder what would happen if I sprayed it with *pure* eucalyptus oil?’ \n\nI had the oil nearby so I crept over and shook the little bottle over the cockroach. No more than three or four tiny drops came out, but I aimed well and they all landed on its back. \n\n*Immediately* it went into violent spasms before flipping over onto its back, dead as a doornail. The whole thing took no more than 30 seconds. \n\nI have repeated this ‘experiment’ with two more of the little bastards, same results each time. \n\nIf COCKROACHES - which are notorious for being tough as old boots and difficult to kill, even immune to radiation  - have such a violent and immediate reaction simply to having *contact* with an essential oil, what the hell is it doing to the insides of a human body?! \n\nI’m probably missing some really basic scientific reason for why they react this way, and maybe the oils don’t affect humans or other creatures at all. But I’m sure as hell not willing to take that chance. It makes me *furious* to think that some of these dickheads are not only ingesting what is essentially poison and encouraging other people to do the same, in some cases they’re also giving it to their innocent, helpless children. 😡\n\nOh, and one other thing... the bottle only cost £2.99. I haven’t seen anyone flogging that Doterra crap on Facebook (maybe it hasn’t reached the UK yet?) but I bet they’re not anywhere near that cheap if you buy from a hunbot. ",

However, it does illustrate how concentrated essential oils are and reinforce that safety measures should be taken when using them.\n\nEdit: it just occurred to me that what likely happened was part suffocation since roaches breathe through a system of tubes in their shells.

Imagine if all your whole body was the size of that small area and you got hit with the oil.\n\nAlso cockroaches arent hard to kill individually, theyre hard to get rid of as a group. A roach flew into the shower with me and immediately drowned, eating a little poison gets them, raid gets them, extreme heat and temps get them, but as a collective because they can outbreed being killed they survive and some are *a little* more hardy because evolution, but even then they're still tiny living things that get killed by normal everyday things.",

        "body": "PharmD here. Taking ivermectin nasally (not orally) for COVID induced changes in smell and taste is something that's currently under investigation in Phase 2 clinical trials, but that means that they still don't know if it would be effective or not. Considering that there are other options out there with stronger efficacy evidence and significantly lower risks, I personally would not recommend using ivermectin in this case, especially in oral form.\n\nPersonally, after looking at the options that have been investigated as of 2023, here's what I think may help your dad with persistent COVID induced smell loss without having to rely on illicitly acquired ivermectin.  \n\n1. Surprisingly, do keep the essential oils. Sniff four appropriate sniff bottles containing the odorants for 20 seconds each uninterrupted, once per day. \n\nAs long as he is not ingesting the essential oils, they might actually be somewhat helpful in terms of treatment. By smelling strong, recognizable aromas like the ones from essential oils, it's hypothesized that it may help olfactory neurons regrow by providing stimulation. Your dad really should not be shoving strong-smelling essential oils into anybody else's nose, though. It's not likely to have long term health effects, but suddenly experiencing an overwhelming aroma can be irritating and noxious. \n\nIt may take a long time to see improvements, but it seems as though about 71% of patients have their sense of smell improve after a year of treatment.\n\n2. Budesonide/Rhinocort nasal spray, use as labeled.\n\nIt is hypothesized that changes in the sense of smell that persist post-COVID infection may be the result of long-term inflammation within the neurons and supporting cells responsible for smell. \n\nNasally administered budesonide seems to be useful at helping to treat this neuro-inflammation, although the evidence is mixed, and mainly supports the use of a more intensive irrigation method than a standard nasal spray. Even still, the risk profile for OTC budesonide nasal spray is much smaller compared to oral ivermectin from an unknown source, so I would much rather try that. If your dad can get access to budesonide nasal irrigation with a prescription, that might work even better.\n\n3. PEA-LUT (Ultra-micronized), one dose sublingually once daily.\n\nPEA-LUT is a dietary supplement that's a combination of a fatty acid and an antioxidant flavinoid. It does seem woo-adjacent from a surface glance, but the current evidence seems to indicate it may be an effective treatment for loss of smell due to COVID with a minimal risk profile. The reason it is given sublingually is because stomach acid may degrade it, and absorption from elsewhere bypasses that. If you're feeling conspiratorial, you could spin this as the 'real treatment big pharma doesn't want you to know about\". \n\n4. Assess for non-infectious causes of smell loss.\n\nCOVID has likely become one of the most common causes of new-onset changes in smell, but usually, changes in smell only persist for a month or two. Longer-term changes are certainly not incredibly rare, but they may warrant an examination to rule out other causes. For example, Parkinson's causes smell loss, and so can physical changes within the nasal cavities like polyps. For Parkinson's especially, changes in smell, behavior, and cognitive functioning can often precede the motor symptoms which characterize the later stages of the disease. \n\n5. Conclusion\n\nA lot of the reason why people involved in QAnon are distrustful of evidence based medicine is because they feel like they are suffering in ways that nobody outside of the conspiracy community understands, and that people aren't willing to listen to them when they say that their experiences are different. They are trying to do an inquiry into why they are hurting, but they have an information diet consisting of thought-terminating cliches and the claims of unaccountable grifters who sell unregulated products.\n\n While large pharmaceutical companies are certainly profit-seeking, they are malevolent in pursuit of the goal of making money, not just acting to hurt others for no reason. And most medical professionals who do legitimately want to help their patients end up agreeing with many conclusions made by research that these companies help conduct. This is not because they are all being paid off to say these things, but because it is usually in a pharmaceutical company's best interest to at least try and make an effective product that people will want to purchase.\n\n When providers look at the information that's available, they are using their clinical judgement to come to their own conclusions in the best interests of the patient. That's their entire job. The mainstream medical opinion about things like COVID-19 is not a manufactured consensus. It is mostly the result of a bunch of people just trying to do the best they can to help as many people as possible. It fills me with dread to see people who have problems that could be helped who have been fully convinced that the people who can help them are an existential threat to them.",

    "body": "What would a good clinical trial on COVID-19 and nasal sprays look like? And how do the current studies stack up? Let’s rate over 30 nasal sprays by product name and ingredient!\n\n*Do a ctrl-F for nasal spray names/ingredients to see the issues with the study (or whether or not there even is a study on it). And please leave a comment if you know another brand name of a particular spray, I will edit the post to add it :).*\n\n**About me:** I have a PhD in biochemistry and one of my PhD projects was on COVID-19. I have extensive experience critically reviewing published studies, and my PhD supervisor was very impressed by my skills in this area. I have worked with scientific journals as a peer reviewer since 2018.\n\n**The main takeaway of this post is that there is no sound evidence that nasal sprays prevent nor treat COVID-19.**\n\n**Thus, nasal sprays should:**\n\n* **not be used for COVID-19 prevention in place of effective measures such as high-quality well-fitting respirators (that haven’t had too many hours of wear time, see** [**my post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroCovidCommunity/comments/1hnxlns/debunking_the_myth_that_n95s_are_super_protective/) **debunking the idea that N95s are super protective for 40 hours of wear time), ventilation and air purification**\n* **not be considered to lower the infectivity of someone with COVID-19 in any meaningful way**\n* **not be considered to help people with COVID-19 recover more quickly**\n\n**Comment note:** There is so much misinformation about nasal sprays out there. If you comment something that is misinformation or misleading, I will start off my comment with “This comment is misinformation” or “This comment is misleading”, to make it really clear to anyone reading it. If it appears like you didn’t read the post and consider the information from the post, I will also include something like “It seems like you didn’t read this post and consider its contents before disagreeing, therefore it’s hard to imagine that your opinion is valuable”. If you do not wish to have these things said to you, please try to fact-check the things you’re saying, and please read the post in its entirety and consider everything presented here before commenting. We all wish nasal sprays prevented and treated COVID-19. It is upsetting that the current evidence suggests that they don’t, especially when so many people spread the misinformation that they do. If this brings up feelings of sadness or anger, please try to realize that you are sad/mad at someone other than me, and please don’t take it out on me.\n\nWith that all out of the way, let’s get into a table of contents:\n\n1. Brief overview of issues with the studies\n2. What would good methods look like for these kinds of clinical trials?\n3. What would good results look like for these kinds of clinical trials?\n4. How do the current clinical trials stack up?\n5. How do nasal sprays without clinical trials stack up?\n6. FDA warnings\n7. Takeaways/TLDR\n\n# 1. Brief overview of issues with the studies\n\nGenerally, there is strong evidence that certain nasal spray ingredients prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture. The quality of this data depends on the methods used in the study (ex: checking if the ingredient(s) affect the viability of the cells you’re using, quantifying SARS-CoV-2 infection in ways that don’t rely on RT-PCR when you haven’t demonstrated that the ingredient(s) don’t interfere with PCRs, etc.).\n\nHowever, a nasal spray in a human nose is a very different scenario than a nasal spray in cell culture. Unlike in cell culture, mucus, etc. is flushed out of the nose and swallowed in a matter of hours. As well, it is easy to expose all cells in cell culture to a nasal spray, whereas nasal sprays sprayed in a human nose tend not to cover even 50 % of the nasal cavity (see the third to last bullet point below). Add to that the fact that SARS-CoV-2 infects cells outside of the nasal cavity, and you can see why, thus far, the evidence suggests that nasal sprays don’t prevent COVID-19.\n\nIn the case of having COVID-19, if nasal sprays were able to lower viral load in the nose (which remains to be seen, as the current studies have major methodological issues as described in the bullet points below and in section 4), it is unclear how meaningful that is in terms of lowering how infectious someone is. Again, this is because SARS-CoV-2 infects cells outside of the nasal cavity and nasal sprays don’t even tend to coat the nasal cavity well.\n\nList of general issues with these studies (modified from my post entitled “[There is no convincing evidence that nasal sprays prevent COVID-19](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroCovidCommunity/comments/1iv64oi/there_is_no_convincing_evidence_that_nasal_sprays/)”):\n\n* The fact that the test spray and not the placebo spray often contain ingredients that are known to interfere with PCR tests, and many of these studies rely on RT-PCR COVID-19 tests from nasal/nasopharyngeal swabs (aka swabs from where the nasal sprays are sprayed). This is almost always combined with no information on the timing between applying nasal sprays and taking swabs. This means that the test spray could cause false-negative COVID-19 tests and/or viral load values that are lower than the true values\n   * Ex: both a carrageenan ([study A](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39913533/)) and a heparin ([study B](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38649069/)) nasal spray can cause false-negative COVID-19 RT-PCR tests\n* Lack of placebo spray\n* Lack of sufficient information for reproducibility (especially regarding what is considered a positive and a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test result)\n* In prevention studies: lack of testing for asymptomatic/presymptomatic infections (how can we say something prevents COVID-19 if we aren’t testing for asymptomatic and presymptomatic COVID-19 infections?)\n* Inappropriate COVID-19 testing methods\n* Wide 95 % confidence intervals for relative risk reductions (see section 2 for a definition), reductions in viral load and symptom improvements\n* The group promised a follow-up study with more participants and the trial was completed but the results were never posted (suggesting that the results did not show the test spray preventing COVID-19)\n   * Ex: in [study C](https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-022-06685-z) a protocol was published for an upcoming carrageenan nasal spray clinical trial, and that trial finished in 2022 but the [results haven’t been posted](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04590365?term=NCT04590365&rank=1&fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaazwtXy-AS4JIQcaCCFdLUKzt9K2o3qNww5bkapp7Y8-TxUDmI-EBKjdAk_aem_UhX-7Nu_JhiXcWir4xMcZQ). Generally, if you do a search on [clinicaltrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov/) with [the condition “COVID” and the intervention/treatment “nasal spray”](https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?cond=COVID&intr=Nasal%20spray&limit=25&page=1&fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAabmmuQEJwHXGg_TlYJCmer9RsT4Fv9GzluPIrNli_IsCfBvmZeTwgCzPAE_aem__l8QUba6qzYbAkDseiH6Ww), you find 44 studies where only 4 have the status “completed with results”, 16 are “completed without results”, 9 have “unknown status” and 6 are “withdrawn” or “terminated”\n* Many nasal spray companies having to majorly walk back false claims of their sprays preventing COVID-19 after warning letters from the FDA (link [here](https://cen.acs.org/materials/biomaterials/biopolymers-behind-multimodal-nasal-spray/102/i30?fbclid=PAY2xjawHhEZJleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABplkfYWLZPD8ITdJAqsUTqxr67H1D2FkJFkPrLaocxpnJaDTELpo5_DeWpA_aem_J_1hkkM1nXJ9SpZptQHA8A), ignore the Profi nasal spray praise, see my other post entitled \"[There is no convincing evidence that nasal sprays prevent COVID-19](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroCovidCommunity/comments/1iv64oi/there_is_no_convincing_evidence_that_nasal_sprays/)” for issues with the Profi study). Also see section 6 for more info on FDA warnings\n* False claims that we mainly contract COVID-19 through nose cells (and not lung cells) with either no citation or citation of papers that don’t prove that (such as [study D](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30675-9))\n* Lack of acknowledgement that the location in the respiratory tract that aerosols end up is determined by their size (aka a nasal spray will not prevent the sizes of aerosols that end up in your lungs from going into your lungs), see Figure 3 and all the studies referenced in that figure in [study E](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-022-00506-7)\n* Not everyone breathes through their nose\n* Nasal sprays are flushed out of the nasal cavity in a matter of hours\n* Nasal sprays don’t appear to coat even 50 % of the nasal cavity (see [study F](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21499839/), [study G](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02786826.2014.931566), [study H](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12383290/))\n* Many of these sprays contain the preservative benzalkonium chloride, which have harmful effects at the concentrations used in nasal sprays in some studies (see [study I](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11575893/) and [study J](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31028024/) and references therein)\n* None of these sprays have long-term safety data on their regular (repeated) use\n* The sizes of aerosols that would end up deposited in your nose are very efficiently filtered by high-quality respirators such as N95s, provided that the N95 is sealed to your face and the seal doesn’t break. This is even true for a respirator with a lot of wear time (see my previous post on some studies looking at the effects of wear time on N95 fit and filtration efficiency [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroCovidCommunity/comments/1hnxlns/debunking_the_myth_that_n95s_are_super_protective/), again, provided that it stays sealed). This is because the filtration mechanisms that act on the sizes of aerosols that get deposited in your nose do not degrade with wear time (whereas the filtration mechanisms that act on smaller aerosols do degrade with wear time). Thus, while wearing a sealed N95, aerosols containing SARS-CoV-2 in the environment should not be deposited in your nose anyway\n\n# 2. What would good methods look like for these kinds of clinical trials?\n\nPlacebo\n\n* A test spray and a placebo spray, where the placebo spray lacks the one important test ingredient only\n* Participants being assigned the test spray or the placebo randomly and not knowing which one they got\n* Researchers analyzing the data not knowing who got the placebo and who got the test spray\n* Approximately equal numbers of people getting the test spray and the placebo spray\n\nTesting\n\n* Periodic testing for all participants, regardless of symptoms (to pick up asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections in prevention studies, and to get viral load data for many timepoints in treatment studies)\n* Testing whether or not the spray ingredients affect viral load measurements or the COVID-19 test results. And either showing that it doesn’t, or taking steps to minimize the effects and quantifying the effects (referred to as interference testing, *this has never been done in any of the current studies*)\n* High sensitivity testing method\n* Relevant testing method given the experimental circumstances\n\nAnalysis/reporting\n\n* Analyzing and reporting on data from all of the participants\n* Sticking to running analyses that they decided on before the trial\n* Only making statements about differences between the test group and the placebo group if the differences are statistically significant\n* Representing the results in a way that isn’t misleading\n* Appropriate analysis methods\n\n# 3. What would good results look like for these kinds of clinical trials?\n\nFor preventing COVID-19:\n\n* The relative risk reduction (a measure of how much being on the test spray compared to the placebo spray lowered the chance of testing positive for COVID-19) would be a high percentage and the 95 % confidence interval for the relative risk reduction would be a small range of percentages\n   * Example: a relative risk reduction of 80 % where the 95 % confidence interval for that value is 70-90 %\n\nFor treating people with COVID-19:\n\n* Over time, the viral load would be reduced in those on the test spray more than those on the placebo spray (with a 95 % confidence interval for that reduction not too wide)\n* People on the test spray would recover faster than people on the placebo (with a 95 % confidence interval for that difference not too wide)\n\nNote: having enough participants influences the stats associated with the results, so that important quality of a clinical trial is accounted for here.\n\n# 4. How do the current clinical trials stack up?\n\nWith the criteria from the previous two sections in mind, **all of the clinical trials on preventing and treating COVID-19 with nasal sprays score an F for failure**.\n\nThese sprays include:\n\n* iota-carrageenan aka carragelose (ex: Algovir, Salinex ProTect, Betadine Cold Defence, Nasitrol, Mundicare Cold Defence) \\[prevention\\] ([study

Takeaways/TLDR\n\n**Main takeaway (repeated from the beginning): there is no sound evidence that nasal sprays prevent nor treat COVID-19.**\n\n**Thus, nasal sprays should:**\n\n* **not be used for COVID-19 prevention in place of effective measures such as high-quality well-fitting respirators, ventilation and air purification**\n* **not be considered to lower the infectivity of someone with COVID-19 in any meaningful way**\n* **not be considered to help people with COVID-19 recover more quickly**\n\nTLDR and things to consider:\n\n* Sadly, there are no high-quality clinical trials showing that nasal sprays prevent nor treat COVID-19.\n* No study has done the obvious and necessary experiment: determining whether or not the spray interferes with the test used to obtain the results of the study. This is especially concerning because many of these sprays contain one or more ingredients known to interfere with the tests used in the studies. This is a major issue, because the sprays are sprayed in the nose and the swabs are taken from the nose or from the nose, mouth and throat. It is unusual for such basic and necessary experiments to be missing from a scientific article. This would even be unusual for studies from several decades ago.\n* There is no long-term safety data for regular (repeated) use of any of these nasal sprays, and not even short-term safety data for some. For some sprays, the evidence suggests they aren’t even safe for short-term use ([study 19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-72262-w)).\n* Nasal sprays should not be referred to as a layer of protection against COVID-19, as such statements are not based in science.\n* Any COVID-19 accounts promoting nasal sprays for preventing or treating COVID-19 are not being responsible, whether or not they have the experience/knowledge to critically review these studies. We can’t just repeat what others are saying, we need to fact-check things and be science-based.\n\nSigned, a PhD biochemist with extensive experience critically reviewing published studies and who cares about people and their safety <3\n\nP.S.

It would benefit us all to not believe and spread misinformation about nasal sprays and COVID-19!",

        "body": "So as someone with a science background as well: to the extent that your criticisms of these studies, I feel that you are taking an approach of similar magnitude in the opposite direction of the papers you are critiquing, and taking a more black and white approach (which can be valuable in science) but that isn't helpful for real life. I also find it interesting/problematic that while in academic science, people tend you use more conditional language when presenting evidence in either direction, you are here stating things with much more certainty than your own evidence warrants. \n\nSkepticism in science is a great thing, but your title is somewhat click-baity and some of what you say can also be misleading to a layman who doesn't have an understanding of academic science. Nasal sprays don't prevent or treat COVID, but they could potentially lower viral load and prevent a more severe outcome. To not look at this aspect and only criticize them for not 100% preventing covid in a post for the general public is anywhere between unintentionally misguided or outright disingenuous. I of course don't know your intentions, but Reddit isn't academia where you do a meta-analysis of papers on one specific issue and people understand that it is an exact point you're trying to disprove. I think the vast majority of us here are already not using nasal sprays as a sole preventative measure - it's a precaution I take when I need to get on an airplane and I've weighed potential known/unknown risks of sprays vs. risk of getting covid. At no point do yiu address this aspect of it. \n\nSecondly, absence of evidence =/= evidence of absence. Covid is incredibly new if we use a scientific timeline. Culture wars and general disinterest over the fact that the pandemic is \"over\" mean that people aren't studying covid as much now. There's still an incredible dearth of information around bigger issues of covid. There aren't even that many papers on novavax. So while there are issues with the papers thst do exist on nasal sprays, i think waiting for evidence to prove they are useful before actually using them in a circumstance as an additional precaution means you could be missing out on potential protection as well. How are we going to find people to do RCTs on nasal sprays when covid is \"over\"? Sure, on an academic level, let's not do something until we have evidence it works. In real life, well what are the risks of iota-carageenan potentially helping compared to potentially cstching covid? I think as irresponsible as it is, as you say, to recommend sprays when there could be issues with safety, it's also as irresponsible to advocate for not using them when they could be helping. I recognize the safety risks, and you analyze each study, and then at the end talk about there being safety issues with certain sprays, but then you blanket suggest not using nasal sprays, when the different sprays very likely have different safety profiles. You critique each individual study, but you don't present evidence where you actually look at each individual spray's issues vs. risks and do that kind of cost benefit analysis. In a academic setting, this is not necessary, but on Reddit, I think it's problematic to go so deep in one direction without looking at the other side. \n\nI think as much as there are criticisms around the studies that do exist around nasal sprays, it is also highly problematic to be stating the things you say them, with the amount of authority that you do. You are a single person with a PhD in biochem, and to a layman, that might seems like you are more of an expert, but as someone that also has a scientific background, and is a science educator, I find your analysis is problematic in the ways I've stated. I appreciate that you want to warn people that there really isn't solid evidence out there - however, you're in a way making recommendations that you don't necessarily have evidence for either. And you're communicating in a way that presents your own evidence as stronger than it is as well, and presenting it in a way that actively discourages the average person without a scientific background from using sprays because of a dearth of evidence, instead of presenting the evidence neutrally and saying \"look, there's no evidence of them preventing covid, but there could still be potential benefits the scientific community isn't aware of that could impact covid outcomes\" - you're not a doctor, so present the evidence neutrally and let people make the choice for themselves. \n\nOverall, I think, if you are coming from a good place, you are overapplying academic science to the realities of real world. As I have said, reddit isn't academia and so the perspective we take when assessing precautions shouldn't be the same perspective as one would take from an academic approach. But the other thing is that science is just as much about the content as it is about communication. If you are not able to effectively communicate the meaning behind your message, then your science is moot. Again, I'm not sure if you've worded things the way you have because you are set out to disprove nasal sprays or just because you're not aware of how to communicate science outside of an academic context, but your post is problematic to me as someone that is also able to evaluate scientific evidence critically.\n\nEta: I'll also add that as someone who went from really believing in the rigours of science and looked down on things without scientific evidence, to becoming disabled by multiple medical conditions, science isn't the be all end all. Anecdata from patients with my conditions about random supplements or treatments that have no formal evidence and are not used at all in clinical medicine (which I tried when medical interventions failed), have often ended up helping me much more than many of the scientifically tested medications that were associated with clinically and statistically significant improvements in their patient populations. Obviously this is a separate issue because pharmacokinetics/dynamics are much more person-dependent than the human-to-human variance that might come from a nasal spray, but my point is that even if there isn't scientific evidence for something, it doesn't mean that it can't be helpful. I'd love to see more studies on nasal sprays with larger sample sizes - but I'm not going to wait around for science to tell me something is helpful before I try it. In this case, I do a risk-benefit assessment and choose the spray that has lower risks and use it as an extra precaution with masking when I go to higher risk situations, because the potential risks of carrageenan are lower to me than the state I'll be in after another covid infection when I already have long covid.",

Its effectiveness is based on the following study: https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202008304\n\n2) Another flaw I identified fairly early on in many COVID related research studies is sample size and diversity in human trials (notably many on the effectiveness of masking, which suffer the opposite problem to above, where in fact masking is MORE effective than the study shows because many people in the study are masking improperly) I can't remember the sample sizes of the above nasal spray studies although I did read and criticise most of them, I do remember many of them had small sample sizes (less than 1000 and in some cases less than 100 participants) I also wonder about the location/occupation and other covid risk factors of the study participants and how that could introduce flaws in tbe studies. For example, many studies of mask efficiency were of healthcare workers who have a much higher risk of exposure to covid due to their jobs, but also may have access to other PPE, may only wear masks at work but not in their personal lives, etc. Any comments on this would be most welcome!",

    "body": "Edit: Wow, thank you everyone for the really nice awards and kind comments. I’m so glad I was able to help some of you! This took me a few days to start writing and ruminate on, so I’m really glad it seemed worth it for a lot of people. I’ll try to keep this going in for future major Ipsy skincare items! I’m about to get really busy in a month but I’ll do what I can! ❤️\n\nHey all,\n\nI've been seeing a lot of  posts about the Cryo ATP Sports Booster serum and how people don't know what it is exactly supposed to do... it doesn't help that the official 111Skin's description for it is just filled with nonsensical marketing bullsh\\*t. Considering the huge price tag, I think we're all feeling a lot more curious about it than most serums that wind up in our bags. As I'm reluctantly receiving this in my bag (Ipsy chose it for me), I'm putting in some time to figure it out.\n\n**Objective & Disclaimer:** Let's put aside the pseudoscience jargon used in 111Skin's description and try to figure out what the serum itself should do for your skin. I'm not an expert *in any way* but I'm a skincare enthusiast... I thought maybe it might be worth posting an interpretation of what this serum is formulated to do, since it appears the company itself fails to say anything useful at all on their website. At the very end of this, I'll explain how I think this product got its name. Again, I'm not an expert so if anyone knows better or has their own input feel free to chime in!\n\n**Product description per** [**official webpage**](https://111skin.com/products/cryo-atp-sports-booster): \"Mimicking the effect of extreme cold on the skin, this booster contains natural cellular energy, ATP, to encourage more oxygen for optimised cell function. Just a few drops of this highly-charged formula will reignite lacklustre skin, leaving it tightened, toned, and refined for a reinvigorated complexion. Perfect for use post-workout, this booster will prolong freshness for enlivened and refreshed skin.\"\n\n**Ingredients list**:  Aqua / Water / Eau, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Vp/Polycarbamyl Polyglycol Ester, Ribose, Acrylates Copolymer, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Carbomer, Hydrolysed Sesame Protein Pg-Propyl Methylsilanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Tromethamine, Adenosine, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Adenosine Triphosphate, Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow / Achillée) Extract, Xanthan Gum, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Fragrance / Parfum.\n\nOK, now let's break it down \\[key ingredients in **bold**\\].\n\n* **#1 Water**\n* **#2 Glycerin--** this is a humectant, meaning it attracts water into the skin and helps with hydration. The fact that this is #2 tells you that this should be a moisturizing serum.\n* **#3 Niacinamide--** I'm pleased to see that this is #3 in the ingredients list-- and I believe this should make the biggest difference in the serum for most people that aren't already using niacinamide. It's essentially a niacinamide serum with a lot of other bells and whistles. Niacinamide  (aka vitamin B3) is a really common ingredient that is non-irritating to most people but can cause some stinging sensation for some. It evens out skintone, reduces appearance of pores, evens out skin texture (ie, reduces congestion), and boosts ability for moisturizers to work (and thus is wonderfully paired with glycerin).  Most people that aren't already using a serum or some kind of special moisturizer might not have niacinamide in their routine, which is why I think this'd be the most \"groundbreaking\" ingredient for those that aren't already using it. It's the key ingredient that is the reason people rave about the Peach and Lily's Glass Serum which is essentially a niacinamide and hyaluronic acid serum. But here's the catch-- all these benefits won't happen overnight. It needs to be used consistently over a period of at least a week, but likely much longer than that, to start showing effects. Here's a great [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qd7J1UNGUo&t=909s) by Dr. Dray, a real dermatologist, that explains benefits of niacinamide.\n* \\#4 Butylene glycol-- a solvent so ingredients that don't dissolve well in water can be more evenly spread out in the serum\n* \\#5 1,2-Hexanediol-- a preservative\n* \\#6 Betaine-- a humectant\n* \\#7 Polyglycerol-10 Laurate-- skin softener\n* \\#8 Phenoxyethanol-- a preservative\n* \\#9 Caprylyl Glycol-- a humectant\n* \\#10 Vp/Polycarbamyl Polyglycol Ester-- I actually don't know what this is and can't find an immediate Google answer\n* **#11 Ribose-**\\- a component of ATP, which helps explain the product's name. It apparently [might play a role](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3047922/) in helping boost collagen production. \\[[Another source](https://www.oskiaskincare.com/skin-nutrition/patented-actives/ribose/#:~:text=Riboxyl%20or%20Ribose%20is%20a,naturally%20in%20all%20living%20cells.&text=It%20is%20the%20only%20known,new%20energy%20to%20tired%20skin) that explains the mechanism a little bit.\\]\n* \\#12 Acrylates Copolymer-- a microplastic for enhancing texture of product\n* \\#13 Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer-- thicken product, enhances texture of product\n* \\#14 Carbomer-- thicken product\n* \\#15 Hydrolysed Sesame Protein Pg-Propyl Methylsilanediol-- skin tightener\n* \\#16 Pentylene Glycol-- a humectant\n* \\#17 Tromethamine-- a pH adjuster\n* **#18 Adenosine**\\-- a component of ATP, which helps explain the product's name. It [might play a role](https://koreanskincaretips.com/adenosine-in-skincare/)in helping boost collagen production (and thus can may have anti-wrinkle properties).\n* **#19 Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil**\\-- offers a cooling sensation upon application, and I suspect is the reason 111Skin relates this product to cryotherapy... even though it has nothing to do with it. It might feel nice on the skin at first for people that aren't immediately irritated, but it can be an irritating ingredient to those with sensitive skin. This might be why some people are saying that they're seeing some redness after application. In the long term it's a sensitizing ingredient. Don't continue its use if you find your skin is irritated upon application. Edit: I should’ve researched this more, but it seems eucalyptus oil also has antiseptic, anti inflammatory, and antioxidant properties, which are all good things. However, it’s also not recommended by a lot of dermatologists due to how easily it can irritate skin for some people. (This is the case for many essential oils.)\n* \\#20 Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer\n* **#21 Adenosine triphosphate**\\-- ATP itself and gives the serum its name. This [L'oreal webpage](https://www.lorealparisusa.com/ingredient-library/atp.aspx) succinctly describes what its supposed to do in skincare.\n* \\#22 Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow / Achillée) Extract-- skin soothing properties\n* \\#23 Xanthan gum-- for product texture\n* \\#24 Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil-- an emollient\n* \\#25 Fragrance/parfum-- the yummy smells and potential irritant\n\n**Interpretation**: There's a fair amount of humectants in this serum, with glycerin being #2 right after water. That can be promising for people with dry skin. Right after glycerin is niacinamide, which if you don't know is a holy grail ingredient for a lot of products. Anyone that doesn't already have this in their routine but has textured skin, irritation, uneven skintone, or enlarged pores, may benefit the most from this serum. Note that the positive effects of niacinamide will take weeks to show, so don't expect this to work overnight! Unfortunately niacinamide can cause some stinging sensation for some people which can be off putting. The \"*cryo*\" part in the product name is thanks to the eucalyptus oil, which gives a cooling effect on the skin upon application. Really, it doesn't serve any substantial service. Maybe some people will find it temporarily soothing but those with sensitive skin, it is a major irritant and a sensitizer. Lastly, the \"*ATP*\" portion of the name-- there's ribose, adenosine, and adenosine triphosphate in the serum. These ingredients are supposed to interact together to promote rejuventation, whatever the hell that means. From the webpages I've linked, it seems these three ingredients should promote collagen production within the skin, which should help battle wrinkling and dullness of the skin.  I haven't delved too deep into the studies that show its efficacy but if someone else wants to do that, please share with us what you find! As for why this product has \"*sports*\" in the name? ...Uh, because the eucalyptus oil might feel good on hot skin post-workout, and something about adding ATP onto one's skin will supposedly help restore ATP that is supposedly used up during the workout?\n\nAnyway, overall I'm optimistic about this serum for people with non-sensitive skin. The eucalyptus oil and fragrance/parfum added might be too much for some of us to handle, but for those that can handle it and that don't have a robust skincare routine yet, I'm optimistic that the niacinamide can make a difference for a lot of people. Do I think it's worth the price tag because of that though? Nope. There's a lot of affordable niacinamide serums out there-- off the top of my head, The Ordinary's niacinamide + zinc serum \\[<$10\\] and Peach and Lily's glass skin serum \\[<$40\\] are the holy grails for so many people. (The glass skin serum is my own HG for fixing my textured skin.) As for the ATP components of this serum... without looking more into efficacy studies I'm not sure if it'll do anything on that front. If anything, the niacinamide should visibly address the things that the ATP ingredients should supposedly  be taking care of. As long as it isn't harmful, then, ah well why not, I guess.\n\nThat said, I just wanted to remind anyone new to skincare that it takes weeks to show major results... but if you are having a bad reaction to it, stop using it! Irritation on the skin can spur so many issues, it isn't worth it.\n\ntl;dr-- I think this is just a fancy niacinamide serum and 111Skin tried to set themselves apart from other products by adding words like \"cryo\" and \"ATP\"... and tried to make it niche by adding \"sports\". Aside from marketing BS, it might not be a horrible serum and would be worth trying for anyone that doesn't have a niacinamide product yet (assuming niacinamide, eucalyptus oil, and/or  fragrance doesn't irritate their skin too much).",

I agree that the heavy price tag is daunting for some, it must be magic in a bottle type of product but when you break it down, it is just a fancy hydrating serum. Anyway, since this post was a hit, please make more in the future, if you ever are so inclined of course!",

Wouldn’t recommend unless you know your skin tolerates alkaline cleansers. \n- **Tia’m Snail & Azulene Sleeping Mask**: I don’t dislike this and I fully plan on giving it another try when I return to the UK’s dryer climate, but for now it’s totally unsuitable for my combo-oily skin and hot/humid climate. I wish I’d done more research before buying/opening this, because for now it’s just collecting dust on my skincare shelf. Wouldn’t recommend for anyone whose skin doesn’t do well with oils, anyone with oily skin, or anyone in a humid climate. \n- **Skin1004 Centella Ampoule Sheet Mask**: the mint oil irritated and burned my skin. The mask also kept sliding down my face. Wouldn’t recommend for anyone whose skin can’t handle mint oil (or eucalyptus oil, which i suspect are similar as these two are the only essential oils my skin can’t handle).",

The toner I tried over a period of 6-8 months and in the end just felt more dehydrated. It seemed like it helped at first, but maybe too much of a good thing? The mask breaks me out in cystic acne, and I've also tried it twice. Which is a shame because the glow it gave me was unmatched.\n\nJudydoll & Shedella. I think these two come down to personal preference, but their products are really hit or miss. Shedella's highlighter was okay but I can't think of anything else I've tried where I really liked it. Same with Judydoll, their blue blush is fine but nothing else wowed me.

    "body": "Most of you seem to know this so maybe more of a vent, really.\n\nI belong to a cat specific group chat. \n\nAbout 2 months ago after losing my 18 yr old and his younger brother not doing well, I adopted a 1 yr old rescued feral named Ezra. Like many ferals he has herpes. If you hadn't heard about feline herpes it manifests as respiratory symptoms. About every 6-8 weeks he seems to get a flare where he feels like utter crud. He spikes a fever, sneezegags (it causes inflammation in the nose and trachea), gets stuffed up and sneezes out nastiness and is generally lethargic and hating life for a few days.\n\n*Overall antibiotics will not help this*. Unless he gets a severe secondary infection the antibiotics do nothing. Just like an antibiotic wouldn't be prescribed for cold sores or genital herpes, unless there was a secondary skin infection, this is like that.\n\nI sent a message to the group this morning asking if anyone had a cat with similar issues and what helped them. I mentioned I already have him on lysine which seems to cut down the duration of the flares but I'm open to try other things too. \n\nEnter the huns.\n\nOne tried to sell me a diffuser for eucalyptus oil. Eucalyptus is *highly, extremely toxic to cats*!!! Even not in direct contact with it, it. is. toxic. Another suggested I buy the \"respiratory blend\" and rub some on his chest because it always helps her daughter. \n\nI saw red. \n\nThere were other people in the chat who were like \"My cat gets allergies, I'll try this\" and I had to be like NO STAHP DO NOT DO THAT EVER JUST WAIT I'LL GET YOU SOME LINKS.\n\nThen of course the huns were angry and saying I obviously don't want REAL HELP for Ezra so why did I ask if I'm just going to rely on DRUGS??? Um..... lol. Lysine is a natural amino acid. It naturally occurs *in his own body* but some say supplementing extra really helps. Afaik his body doesn't produce eucalyptus oil. \n\nI'm angry and scared for the pets of other group members.",

I recently undertook a small project: I selected 50 episodes heavily focused on foundational health and actionable protocols.\n\nI then uploaded these 50 sources into Google's NotebookLM to see if I could extract a purely actionable summary. Essentially, a condensed list of the \"what to do\" without the (incredibly valuable, but lengthy) explanations of the underlying mechanisms. The goal was to create a high-level reference guide of tangible practices.\n\nYou can find that post here: [**Key Takeaways from 50 Core Huberman Health Episodes (Analyzed with NotebookLM)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/HubermanLab/comments/1k20t18/key_takeaways_from_50_core_huberman_health/)\n\nI wanted to do the same for ALL videos he has ever released, and this post, does that. This post is a culmination of **all \\~300 podcasts ever released by the Huberman Lab** analysed and compiled by NotebookLM Plus by Google.\n\nHere is a detailed list of specific, actionable tips, techniques, and protocols for optimizing physical and mental health, drawn directly from the provided sources and organized by health domain.\n\n# Wiki 1\n\nBased on the provided sources from the Huberman Lab, here is a detailed compilation of specific, actionable tips, techniques, and protocols for optimizing physical and mental health, organized into distinct categories. This compilation focuses strictly on the practical steps and strategies mentioned in the sources or noted as being available in associated resources like the neural network newsletter and the book \"Protocols: An Operating Manual for the Human Body.\"\n\n**1. Sleep Optimization Protocols**\n\nSleep is emphasized as the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance. Getting a great night's sleep is necessary to study and learn at your absolute best. Adequate sleep is needed for the positive effects of exercise on brain health.\n\n* **Regulate the temperature of your sleeping environment**.\n* You can use a tool like a **smart mattress cover** to easily regulate the temperature of your sleeping environment.\n* In order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep, your body temperature needs to **drop by about 1 to 3 degrees**.\n* In order to wake up in the morning and feel alert, your body temperature needs to **increase by about 1 to 3 degrees**.\n* **Get a great night's sleep the night before** if you want to be able to study and learn at your absolute best.\n* **Get adequate amounts of sleep**. It is not sufficient just to exercise; you need to get proper sleep, as sleep mediates many, though not all, of the positive effects of exercise on brain performance and long-term brain health.\n* **Structure your sleep** for optimal mental health, physical health, and performance.\n* Consider **monophasic sleep schedules**, which are the more typical sleep schedule where you go to sleep at night and then wake up in the morning, sleeping in one bout.\n* Consider **polyphasic sleep schedules**, which are when you sleep in two or more bouts, either at night or perhaps a shorter bout of sleep at night and another bout of sleep during the day.\n* Understand how your **needs for sleep and naps vary across the lifespan**.\n* **Pay attention to body position during sleep**, as it is critical for ensuring that the sleep you get is optimally restorative.\n* **Use light and absence of light** to regulate the timing and quality of your sleep.\n* **Use temperature** (both of your sleep environment, specifically the room you're in, and your body temperature) to regulate the timing and quality of your sleep.\n* **Get out of bed when you can't sleep**.\n* Be mindful of how things like **alcohol, caffeine, and cannabis impact sleep** and the various stages of sleep.\n* Explore **over-the-counter supplements** that seem to have some benefit in order to augment sleep.\n* Advanced protocols related to **thermal manipulation** can be explored for sleep enhancement.\n* Protocols for **optimizing your sleep** are included in the book \"Protocols: An Operating Manual for the Human Body\". The book is designed to be incredibly easy to use, such that if you are suffering from a particular pain point in life, such as difficulty sleeping, you can go to a specific chapter and protocol and begin to resolve that issue.\n* Protocols for **optimizing your sleep** are included in the neural network newsletter. These are brief 1-3 page PDFs.\n* A **sleep toolkit**, described as a distilled list of things to do in order to optimize your sleep, is available at [hubermanlab.com](http://hubermanlab.com) by going to the Neural Network Newsletter section.\n* Information and actionable protocols related to **sleep** are available on the Huberman Lab clips channel.\n* You can find episodes and newsletters that discuss how to optimize your sleep, improve your sleep, deal with insomnia, shift work, and jet lag by **putting \"sleep\" into the search function at hubermanlab.com**.\n* If you have a specific issue with sleep, such as shift work, jet lag, middle of the night waking, or trouble shifting your schedule because you want to become an early riser, you can **put those specific terms into the search function at** [**hubermanlab.com**](http://hubermanlab.com) to find specific timestamps in relevant episodes.\n* There is a newsletter on **sleep** that lists off the various things that you should and can be doing to improve your sleep, no matter how well you happen to be sleeping now.\n\n**2. Exercise & Movement Protocols**\n\nExercise is a critical foundational pillar practice for mental and physical health. Exercise improves brain health both in the long term and by improving sleep.\n\n* Follow the **basic structure of the foundational fitness protocol**: **three resistance training sessions per week and three cardiovascular training sessions per week**.\n* **Access the foundational fitness protocol** which is available as a PDF that spells out which workouts are done on which days, what the various workouts look like including sets and reps, and what options you have in terms of cardiovascular exercise. This can be found by following a link in the show note captions or simply going to [hubermanlab.com](http://hubermanlab.com), going to the menu tab, scrolling down to newsletter, and then scrolling down to the foundational fitness protocol. It is completely zero cost.\n* **Choose options for cardiovascular exercise** mentioned in the foundational fitness protocol, such as running, using a rower, or using a stationary bike.\n* Protocols for **exercise** are included in the book \"Protocols: An Operating Manual for the Human Body\". The book covers protocols for increasing your motivation and focus for exercise.\n* The neural network newsletter includes a **foundational Fitness protocol** that describes a template routine that includes cardiovascular training and resistance training with sets and reps, all backed by science. These protocols are in the form of brief 1 to 3 page PDFs.\n* A complete summary of our **fitness series** is available as a toolkit in the neural network newsletter.\n* **Assess your level of Fitness**.\n* Use **zero-cost ways to assess one's level of Fitness** such as a routine broad jump test and an in-home high jump jump and touch test.\n* Use ways that require a bare minimum of technology to assess fitness, such as **taking your pulse rate in very specific ways at specific times**, some **timing of Mile runs**, and some other things related to strength and hypertrophy.\n* From the options provided for recovery, **pick one or two things per category** that are most important to you, that are at your cost and availability, that are interesting and important/relevant to you, and do that. The point is not to measure all of them.\n* When applied properly, recovery tools and modes can actually **help you recover from the stress and create the literal result that you're trying to achieve**.\n* Discussed ways on **how best to warm up for any and all workouts**.\n* Discussed how to **improve our movement patterns** for cardiovascular exercise, for sport, for resistance training across the board.\n* Discussed how to **improve our range of motion** with the minimal amount of time investment.\n* Discussed how to improve our range of motion across our entire body in the best possible ways.\n* Discussed how to **offset or repair any imbalances** that stem from muscular skeletal problems or from neural issues.\n* Discussed how to **reduce soreness**.\n* Discussed how to **improve our posture** (seated standing and movement-based posture).\n* **Take time off from the gym if you had to take a week off** because you were sick; you'll be fine and will probably come back stronger in the end.\n* After taking time off, **take a couple of days and ramp back up**.\n* **Please don't come to the gym sick**.\n\n**3. Stress Management & Mental Well-being Protocols**\n\nMental health and physical health are critically important and discussed using science-based tools. Emotional health has everything to do with our physical health and vice versa.\n\n* Engage in **a particular form of journaling that is supported by over 200 peer-reviewed studies** in quality journals for improving our mental and physical health. This practice should easily be placed among some of the other critical so-called foundational pillar practices. (The specific form of journaling is not detailed in this source).\n* Consider doing **regular therapy with a licensed therapist**.\n* Using an online platform like BetterHelp can make it very easy to **find a therapist that's optimal for your needs**.\n* Understand the **structure of our own minds** and how to think about our own minds as a way to enhance our mental health. This includes understanding how our subconscious mind and our conscious mind interact.\n* Protocols are provided for you to **address questions about your own Mental Health**.\n* You will learn to **assess levels of anxiety**.\n* You will learn **protocols for addressing levels of anxiety**.\n* You will learn to **assess levels of your confidence**.\n* You will learn **protocols for addressing levels of your confidence**.\n* You will learn how to **think about your beliefs and internal narratives**.\n* You will learn protocols for **addressing your beliefs and internal narratives**.\n* You will learn how to **think about your self-talk**.\n* You will learn protocols to **restructure your self-talk**.\n* Discussed how to **address common challenges such as overthinking**.\n* Learn how to **build one's mental health through specific practices**, either done alone or with a therapist.\n* Aim to constantly **improve your mood and mental health**.\n* Protocols for **Stress Control** are included in the book \"Protocols: An Operating Manual for the Human Body\". The book is designed to be incredibly easy to use, such that if you are suffering from a particular pain point in life, such as excess stress, you can go to a specific chapter and protocol and begin to resolve that issue.\n* A **Mental Health toolkit** exists, listing off science-backed protocols to bolster your mood and mental health. (The specific protocols themselves are not detailed in the provided sources, but are referred to as the \"big six\" of self-care).\n* Information about the **\"big six\" pillars of self-care and mental health** can be found by putting topics of interest into the search function at hubermanlab.com. These pillars are necessary but not sufficient for the best possible mood and mental health every 24 hours.\n* **Use tools and techniques to readjust the autonomic nervous system in deliberate ways as an adult**. These tools and techniques are available at hubermanlab.com.\n* Practice the **physiological sigh**, described as **two inhales through the nose, as deeply as you can on the first one, sneaking in a little bit more air on the second one, and then a long exhale through the mouth**.\n* Practice **NSDR (non-sleep deep rest)** or **Yoga Nidra**.\n* When practicing NSDR/Yoga Nidra, **lie completely still**.\n* When practicing NSDR/Yoga Nidra, **keep the mind awake**.\n* When practicing NSDR/Yoga Nidra, use a **body scan directed relaxation, etc.**. This practice can help regulate impulses and deal with agitation, especially in the early days of trying to address addiction.\n* Consider **meditation** as a practice.\n* Consider using a **meditation app** that makes meditating easy and is backed by scientific studies, which can help you stick to a regular practice. Huberman uses one regularly, meditating anywhere from five to seven times a week.\n* Protocols related to emotional health are discussed, and Dr. Peter Attia's book \"Outlive\" contains an extensive section on emotional health and tools to improve it that are very actionable for anybody to use.\n* **Engage in social engagement** to support memory capacity and overall health.\n\n**4. Focus, Learning & Neuroplasticity Protocols**\n\nScience and science-based tools can be used for performance, including learning and focus. The nervous system has the capacity for neuroplasticity, meaning it can change.\n\n* Protocols related to **focus** are included in the book \"Protocols: An Operating Manual for the Human Body\". The book covers protocols for increasing your motivation and focus.\n* Protocols for **optimizing your dopamine** are included in the neural network newsletter. These are brief 1-3 page PDFs. The newsletter includes protocols for managing your dopamine, optimizing dopamine, and regulating your dopamine.\n* Protocols related to **neuroplasticity and learning** are included in the neural network newsletter. These are brief 1-3 page PDFs.\n* A **Focus toolkit**, described as a distilled list of things to do in order to improve your focus, is available in the neural network newsletter.\n* Information and actionable protocols related to **focus** are available on the Huberman Lab clips channel.\n* Protocols related to **focus and motivation** are covered in the book \"Protocols: An Operating Manual for the Human Body\".\n* **Get a great night's sleep the night before** when studying and learning, as it is the best nootropic and necessary to be able to study and learn at your absolute best.\n* **Limit your external stress** when studying and learning, although some stress is good because it cues up your alertness.\n* When you sit down to learn, **voluntarily ramp up your level of focus and alertness** by having a silent script within your head, telling yourself \"I need to learn this, I need to learn this\".\n* **Expect the information to be so interesting that it pulls your level of attention and focus**. This is the basis of active learning.\n* **Don't be a passive participant in learning**.\n* **Engage in cognitive activities** to maintain or enhance one's memory capacity as we get older.\n* **Engage in behavioral practices** to change your brain through neuroplasticity.\n* **Repetition can be important to change your brain, but the way to use repetition to change your brain is fundamentally different** from just passively experiencing things.\n* Learning involves all sorts of things; it's not just about being smart, it's about being able to attend and sometimes being creative and flexible with ideas and information.\n\n**5. Nutrition & Supplementation Strategies**\n\nNutrition is part of the ecosystem of factors that influence mental and physical health and performance. Sleep is mentioned as the foundation for recovery and performance, which includes nutrition.\n\n* Consider **supplementation as a potent tool** within a larger system aimed at customizing tools for our mental physical health and performance. Supplements are potent non-prescription molecules that really can move the needle in terms of your ability to think more clearly, sleep better, and support hormone function.\n* **Use resources like** [**examine.com**](http://examine.com) for information on supplements and any interactions to pay attention to if you are taking a combination of compounds.

        "body": "First off, thanks for taking the time to put this all together!\n\nFrom my perspective, Huberman's approach is grounded in neuroplasticity (not just in the cortex, but in the whole body) while offering practical tools to optimize focus, learning, and emotional well-being. He emphasizes that sleep is not just rest but a crucial element for cognitive function and mental health, which anyone who's had a rough night's sleep can attest to. Learning is not about passive repetition, but about engaging with material, managing stress, and focusing in ways that can change your brain structure or connectome.\n\nOn the nutrition front, he connects what we eat to how we feel and perform. Supplements like magnesium and Alpha GPC can improve sleep and cognitive function when used intentionally. He promotes a low-inflammatory diet and highlights the importance of the gut and oral microbiomes for overall brain health. It's clear that nutrition isn't just about fueling the body but supporting a larger system of mental and physical well-being.\n\nEnvironmental factors also play a significant role in health, and he regularly highlights how elements like light exposure, sleep temperature, and practices like cold or heat exposure affect brain function. It's not about comfort but about using these elements to optimize health. He ties mental health to social interaction and creativity, stressing how smoking or excessive drinking can negatively impact memory and cognition.",

    "body": "I'm lucky, I contracted Lyme disease from a tick near Montauk, Long Island, NY back in May 2025 but I seem to have avoided the worst symptoms... so far. The doxycycline treatment my doctor gave, after confirming my exposure from a blood test (lining up with my rash, which btw was *not* a bullseye), seems to have done the tick.  \n\nHowever, having grown up in Connecticut, USA, and spent a lot of time in the woods, it seems that 2025 is easily the worst year in terms of tick numbers I've ever seen. Some attribute that to climate change warming the environment. Regardless, I'm embarrassed to say that in 30+ years of life, I've never actually regularly used a single insect repellent product, so I need some advice. \n\n#Main question:\n**What is the best tick / insect repellent, if one lives with a cat and dog and occasionally car-camps with the dog?**\n  \nSo far I'm reading:    \n\n* **DEET** is the most effective overall skin repellent for mosquitos and decent for ticks, but it is highly toxic to dogs and cats and can damage/degrade plastics, including the materials that much athletic gear and camping gear like tents are made of. So that's probably a no-go for me. \n* **Picaridin** is an effective skin repellent for both mosquitos and ticks, and not as toxic to pets, and does not damage plastics.  \n* **Permethrin** is an effective treatment for clothing and gear (e.g., tents), but is highly toxic to cats when wet (but safe when dry, e.g. my cat could brush up against me wearing the treated clothes and should be fine).   \n* **Natural remedies like cedar oil or lemon eucalyptus oil** are not nearly as effective, and eucalyptus can irritate pets.\n\n    \n  \n#Additional questions:\nI'd love any advice y'all have, but have a few specific questions for the community:     \n\n1. Any specific product recommendations (in the USA) for human skin or gear? I'm seeing lotions, wipes, and sprays, so I'm assuming that's the order of most-effective to least in terms of obtaining coverage?  \n2. Any specific product recommendations for dogs? I am going camping with my dog in upstate NY in August and want to protect him (and me, preventing him from bringing ticks into the tent).   \n  \nPlus I'm curious if anyone can vouch for products such as:    \n\n3. [YAYA Oraganics TIck Ban Tick Repellent Spray](https://www.kitterytradingpost.com/yaya-organics-tick-ban-16-oz/) (I want to believe, but I'm guessing this isn't as effective, and may be toxic to cats).   \n4. [Sawyer Clothing Premium Insect Repellent Aerosol Spray](https://www.kitterytradingpost.com/sawyer-clothing-premium-insect-repellent-aerosol-spray/) (permethrin) (this looks legit, but I'm not sure if other brands might be better, like [Repel](https://www.kitterytradingpost.com/repel-repel-permanone-6-5oz-clothing-gear/), [Natrapel](https://www.kitterytradingpost.com/natrapel-natrapel-3-4-oz-pump-spray/), or [Bens](https://www.kitterytradingpost.com/bens-bens-clothing-gear-6oz/)?)",

    "body": "Original post:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/9sghzw/5_dried_grams_in_complete_darkness_tomorrow \n\nSome background: \n\nI'm a seasoned psychonaut, I've tripped solo numerous times but never with the intention of doing deep healing work as I did this time. I used to drink, smoke cigarettes, take kratom daily. I was inactive, ate a lot of processed foods with a lot of sugar. My body and my mind were not at all healthy. \n\nFor about 8 months I've been going through a very tumultuous back and forth break up, getting sober, meditating, going to therapy, got on medication, establishing better sleep, eating and gym habits, etc.. so I'm doing all of this very conscious work on practicing compassion towards myself and others and focusing on the present moment. Doing this work really gave me the ability to have such a positive and rewarding trip. I've done my research on psilocybin and possible interactions with my medication Wellbutrin XL (of which there are no reported interactions), set and setting, and took the proper precautions for harm reduction (a friend came over to do work upstairs, I had a CBD tincture to help with anxiety if things got to heavy, recorded meditations and playlists of soothing music prepared) Also for the past 2 months I was reciting a loving kindness meditation for 30 minutes every morning while at the gym on the bike, elliptical or swimming which consisted of the following phrases:  \n  \n\"May I be happy  \nMay I be peaceful and at ease  \nMay I be free from judgement and suffering  \nMay I be filled with joy  \nMay I experience love\"  \n  \nI started this meditation with myself for 5 minutes then my ex for 5 minutes then my family for 5 minutes then all beings in the world for 5 minutes then my family for 5 minutes and then back to myself for the last 5. I only include this because I really think it was crucial to the pleasantness of the trip. \n\n\nThe Trip: \n\nI started around noon and took the mushrooms with 300mg niacin and Host Defense Brain blend which includes Lions Mane, Bacopa, Reishi, Gotu Kola, Ginkgo, and Cordyceps. I took a walk around the park while listening to Brian Regan's stand up album \"Standing Up\" I always loved his light hearted comedy. Halfway through the walk I began to feel the niacin flush which I have to say was not pleasant feeling but remembered reading it was a normal sensation. This psilocybin, niacin and lions mane stack was something I heard on the Paul Stamets episode of the Joe Rogan Experience podcast which coincidentally was streamed a year ago next Wednesday. Apparently niacin and lions mane aids in neurogenesis and rebuilding neural pathways. Honestly, I'm not a scientist so I won't pretend to be. \n\nAfter my walk in the park I came back to my hammock and laid down for a little while, still feeling the prickling sensation of the niacin and waited for the visuals to hit before going into my room. Once I could feel the trees start breathing and my visual acuity increased, I smoked two massive bowls, put some peppermint/eucalyptus oil in my diffuser, threw on my eye shade and laid in my bed. I started with simply focusing on my breathing and before I knew it I was catapulted into the Lighthouse of Love. \n\nI can only describe this experience of floating in the middle of hexagonal lighthouse with geometric patterns moving across the walls and I'm just in the middle of it being embraced by and unlimited source of compassion and love. It made me want to tell everyone in my life how much they mean to me, tell the people who I've hurt in the past how sorry I am and rectify those situations. It was pretty much this for the entire duration of the trip. I wish I could say there was more to it than that. I kept thinking and searching for deep intellectual insights but only got this eternal feeling of love. It felt like I was cheating. Like I did something wrong almost. You always hear stories of challenging trips where you have to accept some hard truth and keep going through the darkness until you get to the other side. I kept anticipating the dark parts of my subconscious to show up but I think that since for the past 8 months I've been doing very conscious work on improving my mindset that it was almost like the mushrooms were like \"Actually, dude, we're good. We're going to throw you a little party now because you deserve it\" \n\nAfter my peak around 4:30 I went upstairs and talked with my friend who came over to do some computer work at my place and we basically just talked about life, I expressed how much I appreciated his friendship and our experiences together and how excited I was for him to be moving to another country in a week. \n\nIt was overall a very peaceful and loving trip and I will carry it with me forever. I will say that I'm not sure if my mushrooms had lost some potency (I had had them for about a year and didn't freeze them) because I remember during the trip I thought I could have gone deeper. But then again it's probably better to think you could have gone deeper than thinking you've gone too deep. Whatever the case it was a very therapeutic trip that made me very appreciative of the relationships I have in this world. It made me want to become that Lighthouse of Love and be willing to take in any ship that comes to my shore in need of compassion. It helped me accept realities that I have been in denial about for a number of months regarding fundamental differences in my relationship with my ex. I thought about her a lot in that trip and not in a negative or a sad way but just coming from a place that I love her so much but I know deep in my soul that our needs for a relationship don't match up. So giving us both freedom is the best way for me to express my love to her and myself. A number of days later and everything is very crisp, and clear. I didn't even need a recovery day the day after. Just thought I would share my experience for anybody interested! \n\nI want to thank everyone for their encouragement and suggestions yesterday. It was very helpful indeed. \n\nTL; DR: Do the work. Show the people you love how much. Be that damned Lighthouse y'all.",

I read your earlier post on Top 10-20 Cleansing Oils & Gels also. \n\nI'm looking to introduce a new cleanser to my daily routine and was playing with the idea of an oil cleanser.  So much choice, but this should make it easier.  Ideally, I'm looking for something without propylene glycol. butylene glycol, essential oils or added fragrance.  And no parabens - was shocked to see Phytomer still incorporating these!  The ATrue Black Tea Cleanser in your previous post looked interesting; simple list of ingredients, although ironically green tea is the first ingredient in the list, rather than black tea!  Aromatica Orange Cleansing Sherbet looks interesting, as does Clinique - so simple but effective.  Have you any idea what Kakadu (reference Sidmool) means??\n\nWhich do you use incidentally?  You are probably more geared up than most to recommend?  Thanks again.  Bev",

I wanted to write up what we did, what's worked and what hasn't so it can be a sort of case-study for other people looking to do the same as us.\n\n>*I will update this post with more information as I learn it. I'll get my partner to update with her stuff too. There's a YT called wehatethecold for anyone interested in travel*\n\n# How we were and currently are travelling - what bags, what weight, what class, where we're travelling\n\n**So to start off our travel, we wanted to do it as budget as possible and with as little stuff as possible. Here are the guides we set for ourselves:**\n\n* **1 Backpack each (40L)**\n   * Carry on dimensions (50 x 40 x 20)\n   * 7-10kg weight\n   * Multiple compartments\n   * Portable vacuum bags\n* **Budget airline travel for every destination** (besides longhaul bc economy isn't really economy)\n   * Vietjetair\n   * Ryanair\n   * Air Aisa\n   * EasyJet\n   * (all the shit ones bc we're not well off)\n* **Public transport to and from destinations**\n   * Rail (cheapest possible class 3 whenever)\n   * Buses (cheapest possible, local buses etc)\n   * Occasional Grab or Uber to get to a hotel from airport\n* **Destinations - all hot weather (mostly)**\n   * Thailand\n   * Vietnam\n   * Cambodia\n   * Laos\n   * Malaysia\n   * Indonesia\n   * India\n   * Pakistan\n\n# Our First Time Packing List (4 months on what's worth and whats not)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[credit: wehatethecold YT](https://preview.redd.it/2fi789t4g5fa1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=460d4680887bc95c0f369efb895abedf5852232c)\n\n**Quick note:** *I did not realise because I'm stupid. Northern Vietnam is freezing in the mountains, when it is raining and you're on a motorbike. Take a damn jacket or a waterproof. I was stupid enough to listen to the whole \"just buy a poncho while you're there\" a nice, light waterproof jacket would have been amazing for my trip. Oh and gloves! I left my Sealskinz behind sadly and my fingers froze. Oh well... life goes on*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Clothing|Type|**Worth it? (Y/N)**|Why is it worth/not?|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1 polo shirt|Fabletics gym polo|Y|cheap, easily dries, breathable, light weight|\n|2 cotton shirt|H&M white|Y|cheap, throwaway tops, not much space, 1 long sleeve was godsend for cooler days|\n|1 synthetic gym shirt|Fabletics|Y|Great, light t-shirt, dries easily, doesn't smell|\n|2 hawaiian shirts|Random Cambodian Brand|Y|Picked these up in Cambodia. Nice light material for ultra hot days, don't take up barely any space, really lightweight, but easily shrink in drier. I would buy 2-3 sizes up to combat this.|\n|2 shorts|Fabletics one short|Y|cheap, dries easy, doesn't smell, stretchy, all round great|\n|1 pair joggers|H&M brand|Y|cheap, not light at all, warm, only really useful for Vietnam where it was freezing|\n|1 pair of jeans|River Island|N|only used for 1 flight here. was useful for layers in vietnam, but heavy and not worth it imo|\n|7 pairs of socks|Primark sport socks|Y|great socks, no need for these crazy expensive material ones, they work well in heat and in cold. ended up chucking 3 pairs for more bag space|\n|7 pairs boxers|Pierre Calvini (some off brand calvins lol)|Y|cheap, comfortable, durable. ended up chucking 3 pairs for bag space|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Electronics|Type|Worth it?|Why or not?|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Macbook Pro|Apple|Y|Need for working on the move. Small, compact 13 inch. Takes up most of my bag weight though. At least a kg.|\n|Camera|Go Pro|Y|Great for videos and photos, got a little action cam so not heavy, but camera box hogs space.|\n|3 x Camera Batteries|Go Pro|Y|Go Pro has shit battery capacity. If you're out a lot and want to take photos and videos you'll need these|\n|Triple camera battery charger|Cheap Amazon|Y|There are rarely many plugs in hotel rooms, and it saves you having to wait triple the time to charge batteries. I would recommend some kind of multi plug for all electronic devices|\n|Electronics pack|Cheap Amazon|Y|Just a little bag to keep all wires and shit. Great for convenience, you know where everything is and great on the plane.|\n|Battery pack 13800mAH|Cheap Amazon|Y|Great little pack this, really cheap like £30 and charges multiple phones and a laptop at the same time. Hasn't broken yet. Only downside is it takes ages to charge up.|\n|Wires, chargers, headphones etc|Multiple|Y|Needed for charging devices. I would personally try to get multi-plugs. Recently bought a multiple USB plug with 40W+ and it's great for saving space plus charging multiple things at once|\n\n**Other miscellaneous useful stuff we packed:**\n\n* Soap bar (better than shower gel bc of ml limits)\n* Portable vacuum bags with vacuum pump (best purchase we made, saves so much space)\n* Books for reading 1-2\n* 20KG resistance band for working out\n* Travel towel (microfibre and doubles up as a camera lens cleaner)\n* First aid kit (homemade)\n   * Paracetamol\n   * Cocodamol\n   * Throat sweets\n   * Bandages\n   * Disinfectant wipes\n   * Detol wipes\n   * Sniffy stuff for colds (vicks but off brand)\n   * Deap heat cream\n   * Mossie bite cream\n   * Bungy cords\n* Tweezers\n* Anti-histamine (insect bites, trust me if you react you're going to want these)\n* Toothbrush, toothpaste, floss etc\n* Headbands\n* Makeup\n* Nail clippers\n* Batter electric shaver\n* Plastic cutlery **(god send this is an absolute must of mine)**\n* Deodorant\n\n# Tips on Picking A Bag - What Bag Did We Pick?\n\nRight, so I'm going to say this right off the bat. For me it was a lot easier to chuck my stuff away than it was my partner. Within the first week I'd realised I'd packed way too much. So had my partner, but she is more sentimental with things and was reluctant to throw stuff away until month 2. So bare in mind if you're an over-packer, you'll most likely end up dropping weight along the way, because the heat and the weight while travelling budget is a nightmare.\n\n**Quote from her:** \"you'll be surprised how heavy your cr\\*p gets after a while\"\n\n**The bags we chose after checking out multiple stores were the Osprey Farpoint and Fairpoint 40L.**\n\nI really would have loved to opt for a Trek 55L, because the back support is raised and mesh and it would have been beautiful in the hot weather to have that, plus would have been more comfortable\n\n**If you're picking up a bag first time do not order it online, do this instead:**\n\n* **Take a day out and go to town**\n   * We took this as like a date day/planning day and it turned out to be really fun\n   * You'll also head into shops and realise there's a lot of useful products you'll have forgotten about\n* **Find different camping and outdoor shops**\n   * Millets\n   * GoOutdoors\n   * Blacks\n   * Trespass\n   * Whatever your country has\n* **Try on the bags**\n   * Cannot stress this one enough - you want to be comfortable while travelling and you want logical things\n   * Think about pockets and where they're located, do you have an easy access one for all your documents etc? god send in airports when you need to take your f\\*cking laptop out every damn time\n   * Look at the structuring of the bag. Is it sturdy? Will it keep it's shape?\n   * Many shops will price match anyways\n* **Don't buy some cheap stuff on Amazon**\n   * If you're going for a long time, this bag is essentially your home\n   * I was going to opt for a cheap brand until my partner said this\n   * Go for a reputable brand with good returns and a nice warranty\n* **Once you have a bag pack it and go out for a hike with it**\n   * I wish I did this because I would have dropped a lot of things if I'd had known how annoying the weight was after time\n\n# Top Tip on Shoes\n\nThe countries we went to are bloody hot, and you're going to want breathable shoes for that, but there are also amazing mountains and lots of terrible pathways, so you're also going to want grippy shoes too.\n\n*A great tip I learned completely by accident (only works in the UK), is if you buy running shoes from runnersneed or snow and rock, they give you a warranty whereby you can pretty much return in 2 years if the shoes have broken through use.*\n\nIf you use your shoes a lot, this is almost always the case and you get a free store credit for new shoes if they break through use. I've done this 3 times so far.\n\n**Take 1 pair of trail runners:**\n\n* they're nice and sturdy\n* great grip for days where you wanna go adventure\n* some are waterproof\n* usually breathable (not waterproof ones)\n* they're pretty bearable in the heat\n* easy to slip on and off\n\n**Bite the bullet, look like a d\\*ckhead and buy some crocs:**\n\n* Easy to pack as pretty much flat\n* Ok grip on the bottom\n* Slip on and off\n* God send in the torrential rain of Asia\n* Your feet might rub and hurt though\n\nI would personally wait until you arrive at said location unless you have unusually large feet, because you can get really cheap knock off crocs that are pretty much the exact same. I have UK Size 11 feet so it's pretty much impossible for me to find shoes in my own country let alone Asia.\n\nIf you don't mind walking around multiple shops and have the lady or market guy tell you he has your size when they don't and you have to say no a lot and keep doing that until you find your pair, then you can also buy your crocs there. If you cba just buy the damn crocs in your home country\n\n**I personally took a pair of GoreTex Nike Pegasus Trail shoes. My partner took some Nike Air Max and some sandal type things.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lg31xfo6g5fa1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0fc05d8431ebe55a5f6d3d00c196f91b564f2c21\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f3fkpoq6g5fa1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e755c970b24152b33b7b8a48c4c9d496c65fc94b\n\n**She reviewed:** \"the sandals are good in the heat, and better than trainers in the sun. sandals are better than flip flops because they stay on. but physical activities and treks are really not suitable, and you're way more likely to slip. also tan lines are to be laughed at\"\n\n# Have we been charged for overweight bags?\n\nNever had a problem with any budget airline with this as of yet, apart from one time. However, the flight ended up getting cancelled and we hopped on another flight and they didn't check our bags. Haven't bought extra baggage weight once, and I'm sure it's only a matter of time until someone does weigh them, but buying baggage every time adds up for 2 people.\n\n*We also had a good idea to combat this if the weight does go over, and will update this when we find out if it works or not.*\n\n**Few things to note from what we've seen:**\n\n* **If you fly international** you're more likely to have your bags checked\n* **If you fly domestic** you're much less likely to have your bags checked\n* **All long haul flights** come with enough baggage weight to get you in the continent\n* **Once you're in the continent**, there are rarely bag checks for international and domestic flights (we experienced it once)\n\n# Getting through airport security easily\n\n**Separate your bag into electronics and clothes:**\n\nOn airport days we have these foldable bags I bought from a bus station in Thailand. It's a bag with no structure that you can fold up (think string bag, but with padded shoulder straps). I wish I knew the brand because it's fucking great, but I'll put some pictures below so you can pick it up if you're in BKK bus station.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lebyogv7g5fa1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5434decbd13407ca57dedfab3b7831e0f99bfbd3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9c750hv7g5fa1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=37fbd618fde726d1e78f233e8580e82d53d360cf\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lmflshv7g5fa1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=07d058c514c35ee88b20da3a17b6614b9d4ad65a\n\nChuck all the electronics and liquids stuff in there, wear your big bag on your back and put the electronics bag on your front.\n\nThis way you don't have to screw around searching for all your electronics stuff to put in the box to go through security. Just empty the bag you have in the tray and done! Keep your liquids there too.\n\nIt's also nice to wear the bag on the front, because it sort of balances the huge weight on your back and makes the whole walk to the airport or journey wherever a lot more comfortable.\n\n**Liquids:**\n\nThe airlines always say no more than 100ml and you have to put them in the clear bag, but there have been many occasions where I've forgotten to remove some bottle of shampoo or my partner has shoved some skin care shit in my bag way over 100ml and we've never been stopped. Only to go through and find out later that we just went through with more than we're supposed to.\n\n# Staying Healthy While Travelling (Tips I've Picked Up)\n\nI thought I could shed a little light on this since I love the gym and working out. I was much bigger in terms of muscle mass before I started travelling and I lost a lot of weight during travels. However I'm still 80kg at 10-12% bf at 180cm while travelling which I think is pretty good considering I'm constantly hopping around. Usual stay is 2-3 nights in a hotel then off again. Also my body type is easy to put on fat.\n\n**Here's what I do to stay healthy while on the road:**\n\n* **Intermittent fasting**\n   * **breakfast 6am/7am**\n      * black coffee for breakfast (pinch of salt will change the game for you)\n      * maybe pea protein shake at 10am-12pm to curve hunger, but no milk, just water, want to starve carbs for ketosis, don't use tap water!\n      * maybe some fruit instead of the pea protein, but light fruit, no banana or starchy fruit. something like watermelon or apple or citrus style stuff.\n   * **lunch 1-2pm**\n      * some kind of lean meat with rice and veggies, then some fruit after pretty easy to find street food like this\n      * usually go for BBQ meats sizzled on coal you can find this pretty much everywhere in Asia, it's decent compared to other street food and tastes banging\n      * run into a convenience shop and grab some salad\n      * if there's no convenience shop and I'm on a motorbike in the middle of nowhere you can usually find a fruit stand or some kind of fruit shop\n      * noodle soups are good for on the road\n   * **snack inbetween 4-6pm**\n      * nuts\n      * fruit\n      * sticky rice\n      * depends on how i'm feeling. if i feel low energy I'll have something starchy to pick me up a bit\n   * **dinner 6-8pm**\n      * beef, chicken, eggs... some kind of meat for proteins, with some kind of carb, can usually find some decent noodles or mini BBQ meat sticks about, omlettes are good to find\n      * pretty much the same as lunch but i'll have some different flavouring or a different dish\n* **Working out**\n   * **3 times a week 30 mins to 1hr30 (depends how much time I have) all bodyweight exercises**\n      * (if anyone wants it i have a gym program entirely built from bodyweight exercise I use as a google sheet and I can hand it out for free, it's got youtube videos with instructions etc. I made it for my brother to get fit for his wedding but he didn't use it so might as well share the love)\n      * Push ups, squats, lunges, sit ups, chair dips, pike pushup, l-sits, handstands, pullups... whatever you can do get it in\n      * Sometimes I'll get my packed bag and use it as weight. I'll do curls with it or I'll squat with it on\n      * **Point is to push yourself to your limit**, you don't need all the fancy weights and machines and shit. Just push yourself to the point of failure on exercises. Add some HIIT stuff in there to kill yourself. Eat and drink afterwards. Simple as.\n      * Also try to make your exercises dynamic exercises. This way you get stretching, mobility work and muscle building all in one. It's hard to keep up while travelling so don't make it hard for yourself, build a workout plan that hits all 3 in one, short session. You really don't need to workout as much as people think.\n\n# Eating healthy foods on the road tips\n\n**Go for nuts, fruit or some kind of salad from shops** if you're on the move. Most places will sell BBQ meat at the stands and you can also pick up BBQ fish. Eat noodle broths, or some kind of steamed rice meal and try to really avoid all the fried stuff.\n\n**Dried bananas are a god send.** Filling, generally not that unhealthy, great with nuts for a protein, healthy, energy filled snack on the move.\n\n**Noodle broth is almost available everywhere in most Asian countries (SEA anyway).** Very decent meal with veggies, protein and carbs to keep you going.\n\nAt times I will eat fried chicken because it's the only decent protein available in some places. If you have to do that, so be it. As long as your active and keeping up working out etc you'll be fine.\n\n# Tips on Sun Cream, Toiletries, Medicine etc.\n\n**I've seen a lot of people say get sun cream before you go. Don't listen to this**, it's extremely cheap from any supermarket in all Asian countries I've been to so far - Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia.\n\n**Paracetamol and other pharmaceuticals are extremely cheap too.**\n\n**Shampoo is a little more expensive and so is deodorant.** Additionally conditioner is pretty expensive too. So if you have some kind of special hair routine (my partner has really curly hair), then you'll pay a little more here. I'd make use of the included cabin space here before coming.\n\n**Lip care is more expensive here.** Branded lip balms etc. The other stuff is just fine, but if you are particular about a brand then i'd bring a few with you.\n\n**A lot of pads (for ladies) my partner tells** me have cooling stuff in them. So if you're not used to that down there, then it's a little harder to find the non-cool ones apparently. But they're very cheap.\n\n**If you're travelling for a long time, use roll on.** Roll on deodorant lasts months compared to spray.\n\n**Don't buy DEET or any of the chemical mosquito sprays.** DEET worked a little, but it didn't worked nearly as well as Eucalyptus oil. Most of the local people use this stuff and it's a lot, lot better. I've literally seen mosquitos try to bite me and after I put it on, they come back, but fly away when they get close. My partner got eaten alive until we found this out.\n\nThis is about all I can think of for now. I will update this post with more information as I continue to travel further and make my one bag experience more refined.\n\n# Edit for workout plan:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR7uMUCCF8hy2ha3QjYc42qEtci-yg8dXZQqDc7y\\_S8DHbwuDiQ2F-VLHIjkoOkzcJI2WGC0rIZSvU9/pubhtml](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR7uMUCCF8hy2ha3QjYc42qEtci-yg8dXZQqDc7y_S8DHbwuDiQ2F-VLHIjkoOkzcJI2WGC0rIZSvU9/pubhtml)\n\n**(please watch the video at the top of the sheet to understand how to use it)**\n\nThey were all made for my brother, so I'll use a different name. Also the copy I made was for my Thai friend, so there will be a name dissonance lol. Enjoy!",

The other machines have been dissected, tested and the component parts stored to hopefully restore future bad machines.\n\nAll of the above issues have been fixed. The only issue difficult to halt or fix is the hinge issue - so far there is no ‘fix’ to the plastics or the stuff hinges, so you have to be very delicate with the one example I found that hasn’t completely broken and snapped.\n\nThe case was carefully covered in eucalyptus oil and scraped with a plastic razor to remove only the very upper level of rubber.\n\nEverything is original, even the 120Mb hard drive.\n\nThis machine does not have a built in BIOS setup program so you have to use a combination of 2 IBM floppy disks (reference and diagnostics) to restore the configuration.\n\nA 4Mb and 8Mb DRAM credit card gets the RAM up to 16Mb.\n\nTopped off with a clean floppy install of Windows 3.11 and a 640x480  IBM wallpaper.",

I’m always learning, but I hope these reviews help.      \nI’ll be keeping the reviews short and straight to the point, but if you ever want more detail on a product, just let me know!      \n\n\n**Almost Porefect - 8/10**              \nPaula’s Choice : SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant              *Pros:* Clears out congestion, light fluid texture, noticeably effective.              \n*Cons:* Very strong — easy to overdo it. Smells like straight-up alcohol. Not for sensitive skin.              \n*Bottom line:* Use with caution — twice a month is plenty!                            \n**Soothe Operator - 7/10**              \nBiafine Emulsion              \n*Pros:* Actually relieves pain and Soothes sunburns. Very affordable.              \n*Cons:* Contains a Sodium Alginate and fragrance. Not for everyday use.              \n*Bottom line*: Use with purpose - (Like if you over-exfoliated and then spent too much time in the sun… been there.              \n               \n**French Stripper - 3/10**              Typology: Purifying Cleansing Gel with 2% Zinc PCA + Bamboo Extract.              *Pros:* Smells nice, “clean” formula, love the brand’s ethos.              \n*Cons:* Little stripping and drying, contains eucalyptus oil and limonene.              \n*Bottom line:* Gentle on paper, little harsh on skin. Not for the easily dried out.              \n               \n**Mousse-take - 5/10**              \nVacation: Classic Whip SPF 30 Sunscreen Mousse (whipped cream)              \n*Pros:* Absorbs easily, fun packaging, leaves skin glowy.              \n*Cons:* Messy to use, not face-friendly, only SPF 30, stings the eyes.              \n*Bottom line:* Cute for content but stick to their regular cream sunscreen.              \n               \n**Lactose Tolerant - 9/10**              \nRhode: Glazing Milk ceramide facial essence              \n*Pros:* Hydrating, leaves a beautiful glow, cute packaging.              \n*Cons:* Pricey, slight chemical smell, may have caused a few bumps over time.              \n*For who:* For those who can appreciate a top tier ingredients list and miss the old Laneige toner formula.               \n               \n**Supreme Sting - 8/10**              \nUltra Violette: Supreme Screen SPF 50 Facial Sunscreen Moisturizer and Primer (American version).              \n*Pros:* Love the pump, silky finish, no white cast.              \n*Cons:* Eye sting alert, not good for sweat or water.              *Bottom line:* If you can import the Aussie version, definitely do!              \n               \n**Grainy Funk-3/10**              \nRhode: Peptide Lip Tint (color toast)              *Pros:* Beautiful shade, clever packaging that makes application a breeze, long-lasting hydration.              \n*Cons:* Texture turns grainy over time, and after a couple of months, it develops an unbearable smell.              \n*Bottom line:* So close to being worth the hype but wouldn’t buy again because of how quickly it went bad.              \n               \n**Soulless Suds - 1/10**              \nWalgreens: Hydrating Facial Cleanser              *Pros:* Cheaper than CeraVe.              *Cons:* Drying, over-cleansing, forgettable.               *Bottom line:* Just add a few bucks to your cart and spare your face!              \n              \n**Gloss Angeles - 8/10**                    \nTower 28 : ShineOn Lip Jelly              \n*Pros:* Cute color range, super comfortable (not sticky or tacky), good price.              \n*Cons:* Needs frequent reapplication, scent/taste could use work.              \n*Bottom line:* Doesn’t moisturize much, but for the price? Worth every swipe.              \n",

Cleaning products that do not submit their ingredients to our database, various \"workout\" products or other supplements that are *loaded* with caffeine and who-the-fuck-knows, etc. However, the most obnoxious is without a doubt the oils.\n\nI received a call from a mother who was in the parking lot of an emergency room. Her toddler had ingested possibly a tablespoon (15 mL) amount or more of a 100% eucalyptus oil. Mom was not a hun; occurred at the house of a relative. Mom was scared and not sure what to do so she instinctively drove to an emergency room within 10 minutes, but decided to check in with us before actually entering.\n\nWhile eucalyptus oil can be profoundly toxic (CNS depression > coma > death) in doses greater than 3-5 mL in children, actual toxicity is uncommon for a variety of reasons. \n1) It causes a lot of oral irritation that makes continued ingestion unlikely\n2) Usually they are formulated in bottles that have a built-in 'dropper' mechanism that limits how much can come out\n3) The maximum size is often 5 mL.\nUnfortunately, this product was a 1 oz. bottle with no safe-guard mechanism. Who knows? Maybe the child had simply poured the bottle out somewhere on the carpet in the home. But if the history was correct this had the potential to be quite serious. I recommended that she go ahead and go in for evaluation as a precaution. *If the child truly did ingest that much* then CNS depression was imminent, and I wanted them to be in a health care facility.\n\nI called back about an hour later to check in with the hospital. The charge nurse says the patient is not there. Weird. She transfers me to triage. The triage nurse states *oh, I actually sell that stuff, it's not toxic, I sent them home* - a decision she made unilaterally without doing an actual triage.\n\nNeedless to say, that's a paddlin'. The nurse supervisor was livid when I explained the situation. The fury in her voice was marvelous, and to this day I would have loved to be in the room to see the scolding. Turning away a patient prior to evaluation in an emergency room is a serious legal liability. \n\nI followed-up with mom a few more times over 4 hours to check on the child. Fortunately, they were okay, but it's infuriating to think that an already nervous mother had the potential to have a comatose child in her car after being told \"everything would be okay\" by someone that had no clue what they were talking about.",

Don't get me wrong; I'm not saying that I'm entirely healed, but believe me when I say this, giving it time does help. Your healing is going to be the most difficult yet most beautiful process you'll ever come across, so do not diminish it. \n\nTo give you some context, my ex and I lived together for a year, and one fine day, he woke up and decided that he didn't feel like he was in love anymore, and that was it. There was no trying, no justifying, no explanations given, no nothing. \n\nI had to pack my stuff and leave. (this is perhaps the most difficult thing I've done in my entire life. The process was gruesome, exhausting, and for most of it, a blur in my mind because that's how shocked I was. I have no memory except how numb and painful it was)\n\nPeople often say that there's light at the end of this tunnel, and while I can't see it, for now, I do feel slightly hopeful, and during the course of the last 60 days, I put down everything I know about what you might go through when you're getting over a heartbreak. \n\nI hope this helps you prepare yourself and little, and if you're going through any of these feelings, you have to ride it out, my friend. You're not alone, and this too shall pass, one day at a time. \n\n1. You're going to live like a robot for a while, you won't be human, and that's okay. \n2. You might have breakouts on your face and body. \n3. That morning anxiety is going to last for a while. But in time, that ball in your stomach becomes much smaller. \n4. You will struggle with sleeping, and sadly nothing might help for a while. But you will survive through every one of those nights. \n5. Keep hydrating, even if you don't feel like it, drink that glass of water\n6. No, you can't be friends with your ex. However comforting the thought of it is, he/she who broke your heart cannot fix it. Not contacting your ex is the only way it gets better. \n7. People are going to talk for a bit, power through! \n8. Your work will take a backseat in life, and you have to be okay with it. \n9. You might not feel like socialising. \n10. Counting days won't help. I wish it did. \n11. Your bed and blanket will become your best friends \n12. Patience is key. With yourself and everyone around you who is trying to help\n13.  Your priorities in life are going to change \n14. Throw away everything that triggers you \n15. Delete all the photos, chats, numbers. Literally, everything that you can. \n16. Stay away from music for a while. There will come a time when you will be able to go back to it. I promise you. \n17. Strength will come from the most unexpected of places. Let it. \n18. Tell your story as many times as you feel the need to, and eventually, you'll notice how the narrative shifts. \n19. Reddit and Quora might become your safe space. \n20. You might not be able to see your progress, but be kind to yourself cause it does exist. \n21. Talk to a therapist. Don't wait on this for too long. Sometimes, all we need is someone who can listen to us with zero judgements passed. \n22. Spend time alone. It won't kill you. \n23. You are not a burden. Not to your friends, not to your family and not to the planet for sure. \n24. It's fine if you can't focus. It's fine if you can't watch movies or shows. In time, you will go back to doing so. \n25. You don't have to find a new hobby or throw yourself into work. \n26. Don't quit your job. Take a leave/sabbatical instead. \n27. Expect some hair fall. \n28. Everything that once interested you will not for a while. \n29. Try and cycle or walk. It does help. \n30. You're going to lose a few friends. Please don't beat yourself up about it.  \n31. Keep fighting the urge to call him. The more you do so, the more liberated you're going to feel.\n32. Journaling helps. But when it does not anymore, it's okay to stop. \n33. There's no timeline for your grief. Let no one ever tell you it's enough. It's enough when you decide that it's enough. \n34. The memories will keep coming back. Be ready to go to war with them. \n35. Stay away from happy people for a while. You don't need toxic positivity in your life right now. \n36. Your common friends might trigger you, so don't be afraid to block them too. \n37. Cry as much as you need to. Who cares? Let it all out! \n38. It's okay to zone out between conversations.\n39. They'll move on sooner than you. Learn to accept this. \n40. Eating won't be your concern for a while, so make sure there's someone around you to take care of you for the initial few weeks. \n41. Keep away from alcohol for a bit. \n42. Stay away from dating apps for as long as you need to. No one's going anywhere, and you're not behind in the race. Focus on you for now. \n43. You might push your friends and family away, but if that's what you need to feel better, then don't be afraid to do you!\n44. It's never as bad as day 1, even if it feels like it is. \n45. If you can, go on a social media detox \n46. Smell some flowers whenever you can. \n47. Give yourself a foot massage and take long hot water baths. \n48. Spend time with your pet or street dogs. It helps release some of the negative energy. \n49. Go on drives by yourself. Long or short, it does not matter \n50. Watch Mike Posner's video 'Move On'. You'll feel slightly hopeful again. \n51. Every time you feel anxious, smell some eucalyptus oil. You'll see how it helps! \n52. It's okay to draw boundaries with your friends, colleagues and family. You're on your own journey for a while, and all you have to do is do everything that makes only, and only you feel better. \n53. Buy a good lip balm; your lips are going to get dried. \n54. A pandemic break-up is the worst shit you'll ever have to get through. But if you pull through this, everything else will be a cakewalk. \n\nWhile I'm sure there's going to be a lot more to discover in the next few months, I'd like to tell you that it gets better. \n\nI'm not saying that you're going to go back to being that happy, chirpy version of yourself. But you're going to become a far more aware, empathetic, woke and willing version of yourself, and honestly, is not that much better than simply being happy? :)    \n\nGood luck with your healing!",

Almost the same scenario happened to me - she up and decided we were done after about a year (it seems she had been emotionally checked out for a bit, and had lined up the next guy - it was all very sudden and shocking to me regardless). To be fair, I brought a LOT of baggage into the relationship, and certainly wasn’t the best boyfriend at times, but the reality is that she didn’t fight for us and instead went for the grass is greener. I hope she’s happy.\n\nThe toughest part, other than the pathetic loneliness, is the self doubt and blow to the self esteem that comes with being dumped like this - you start to wonder if you were ever good enough, if it would ever have been possible to “go the distance” with this person, or if you’re just not quite good enough to ever be able to KEEP a partner that really makes you happy.\n\nIt especially hurts since my last major relationship before this breakup was with a wonderful girl who should have been the love of my life, and in that case I was the one who messed it up for foolish reasons. I suppose I’m looking for something too good to be true, and I don’t want to be waiting forever. How the HELL do you know when you’ve found it? Am I the type of person who’s only ever going to get close, but no cigar? These thoughts eat at me every day.\n\nI only have hope now, the hope of the broken; that despite my flaws and failings, and despite this pain, there may still be “the dream” in store for me. I really hope so.",

When she left things did not go very well for awhile. It was hard not to just close myself off from everyone but I tried to make sure I didn't. I talked and talked about it with everyone. Sometimes it can be the same thing but if your family and friends love you they'll listen. Also, a therapist helps a lot. \n\n\nFast forward to present time and I recently saw her and this mythical creature I've been building up in my head fell so short that I felt nothing. I thought I would be a blubbering mess but I held my head up high and puffed out my chest and exuded confidence.  I'm in no way 100% healed but seeing her again really helped me see my progress.

Since it’s done wonderful things for me I want to share the magic lol . Not-sponsored and not trying to sell-you my specific one lol. \n\n-Oils names + brand -  \n(all got from Amazon) \n\n* Black seed oil -  HBNO 4oz\n\n* Pumpkin seed oil - cliganic 4oz\n\n* Amla oil - Velona 4oz\n\n* Grape seed oil - now solutions 16oz\n\n* Avocado oil - Hand craft blends 16oz \n\n* Eucalyptus essential oil - cliganic 0.34oz \n10ml \n\n(Doesnt need to be the same brand but this is what I use)❤️\n\n*Remember to shake blend before use!\n* try to use a amber or dark tinted dropper bottle or make sure it’s not in direct sunlight.\n\n—DETAILED Benefits of each of those oils-\n( always do a patch text before using a new product or oil! Regardless) \n\nBlack seed oil : \n1. Antimicrobial, Anti-fungal, Can help combat scalp infections or dandruff. It can help reduce information which may be helpful for people who have psoriasis or eczema. Rich in fatty acids which is especially good for curly hair & or porous hair . There is some information suggesting it can help strengthen the roots and follicles, so it may aid in helping prevent or reducing hair loss and promote/stimulate hair growth.\n2. Black Seed oil can be used directly, but if you’re using it for the first time or have very sensitive skin make sure you properly dilute and use less drops.\n\nPumpkin seed oil :\n1. Rich in Nutrients: Pumpkin seed oil is packed with vitamins (A, E, K), minerals (zinc, magnesium), essential fatty acids (omega-3 & omega-6). These nourish the scalp + hair follicles, promoting overall scalp health.\n2. May Promote  Growth: Pumpkin seed oil contains phytosterols, which may help block the action of DHT (dihydrotestosterone), a hormone linked to hair loss. By reducing DHT levels, pumpkin seed oil can help promote hair growth and reduce hair thinning.\n3. Pumpkin seed oil has anti-inflammatory properties that can soothe an irritated or inflamed scalp, which is beneficial for conditions like dandruff, eczema, or psoriasis.\n4. antioxidants in pumpkin seed oil, such as vitamin E, help aid in protecting the scalp and hair from damage caused by free radicals.\n5. The zinc in pumpkin seed oil helps maintain a healthy scalp by regulating oil production and reducing the risk of scalp infections.\n6. The nutrients in pumpkin seed oil may help strengthen strands.thus, reducing breakage,split ends, and making the hair more resilient.\n7. Consistent use of pumpkin seed oil can add a nice natural shine to your hair, making it look healthier and more vibrant.\n8. Pumpkin seed oil is generally considered a light and non-greasy oil making it suitable for multiple hair types, including those with oily scalps.\n\nGrape seed  oil :\n1. Grapeseed oil is considered to be lightweight and easily absorbed, makes an excellent moisturizer for the scalp.helps to lock in moisture and prevent dryness\n2. Grapeseed oil is packed with  vitamin E, omega-6 fatty acids, +  antioxidants. These help nourish the scalp and hair follicles, promoting scalp health.\n3. anti-inflammatory properties. grapeseed oil can help soothe an irritated or inflamed scalp, which can be beneficial for conditions like dandruff, eczema, or psoriasis.\n4. Grapeseed oil has antimicrobial properties aswell . This can help prevent and aid in treating scalp infections.\n5. The nutrients in grapeseed oil, particularly vitamin E and linoleic acid, can help strengthen hair follicles thus aid in stimulating/promoting hair growth \n6. The fatty acids in grapeseed oil helps to strengthen & smooth the hair shaft, reducing breakage\n7. Non-Comedogenic. meaning it won't clog pores .This makes it a great option for those with sensitive or acne-prone skin on the scalp.\n\nAvocado oil \n1. It contains vitamins A, D, and E, as well as proteins and minerals that nourish the scalp and hair follicles, promoting overall scalp health.\n2. Anti-inflammatory properties \n3. Can Promote Hair Growth \n4. Antioxidant Properties: \n\nAmla oil \n1. Amla oil comes from Indian gooseberry its packed with wonderful nutrients like vitamin C, antioxidants, flavonoids, and polyphenols. These are excellent in nourishing the scalp and hair follicles.\n2. Amla oil can also help stimulate hair growth by enhancing blood circulation to the scalp. The vit C in Amla helps aid in collagen production, which in return may helps strengthen the roots.\n3. The antioxidants and nutrients in Amla also help in reducing hair fall and breakage. It’s also thought to help prevent/delay premature graying.\n4. Amla oil provides excellent Moisture. helps to maintain scalp hydration especially after wash day. It’s also known to help fight against dryness and flakiness. Amla tends to be pretty beneficial for people with dry/itchy scalps.\n5. Amla oil is anti-inflammatory so that can soothe an irritated or inflamed scalp.\n6. Scalp health.Regular use of Amla oil helps maintain a healthy scalp by reducing dandruff and other scalp infections.its antimicrobial properties help the scalp feel clean.\n\nEucalyptus oil (must be diluted) \n1. Antimicrobial\n2. Anti-inflammatory Effects: It can help soothe inflammation,itchiness and irritation on the scalp, making it beneficial for conditions like seborrheic dermatitis or psoriasis.\n3. Stimulates blood Circulation.Eucalyptus oil can stimulate blood flow to the scalp, which may promote healthier hair growth.\n4. Cooling Sensation.menthol in eucalyptus oil provides a cooling sensation that can relieve itching and discomfort. (Don’t use if you’re sensitive to cooling products or make sure you use a very tiny amount )\n5. Cleansing.It helps to cleanse the scalp by removing buildup,excess oil, helps to keep the scalp fresh \n6. To use eucalyptus oil safely, dilute it with a carrier oil!!! I don’t recommend sleeping with it with a double layered bonnet it can spread on the pillow case and make your eyes water kind of like peppermint oil .\n\n\nAdvice — feel free to select the ones you think are most beneficial I recommend starting with 2 or three if you want to start trying a hair oil blend. So that way you can tell the difference and better perceive how the individual oils are working for you. And if you want to add one,change the amount depending on your goals it’ll be easier to alter if you incorporate them slower etc. ) \n\n**Very very optional - sometimes I add anywhere from 1-4 sprays of sugar milk co’s birthday cake oil perfume to make it smell good . If I change my mind on how fragranced I want it  I’ll add more oil with my main desired benefits to dilute it. If im using it just on the scalp I’ll only do 0-1 sprays inside the bottle.if im using the batch on my mids to ends I like adding a a few sprays of oil perfume in the bottle but I also do it without sometimes\n\nI use all of these in my oil blend . Has done wonders for my high porosity hair and doesn’t aggravate my sebborheic dermatitis. i rlly feel it also helped my density in the front of my head also smells great if you add a oil perfume to it. I oil my scalp 2x a week and I oil my mids to ends esp on wash day after products are applied while hair is still wet. I also use it to add some smoothness and shine to my hair through out the week and also can work as a hair perfume if you add oil perfume . It creates a nice protective layer.\n\n—Also just a reminder that what works for me may not work for you but I think it’s a really good blends and it’s very customizable—- \nI hope someone took the time to read all this lol 🥲❤️💕 \nAny questions lmk !",

Thanks for making such a high effort post. I don't believe in hair growth oils but this seems like it could help with scalp health and just protecting strands without irritating my skin.

        "body": "r/veahveah!! When you post, my hair rejoices <3\n\nI have a huge document with hair tips, and I add your science-backed information to it whenever I see you post!! Thank you for being you, and for taking time out of your busy college life to be here.\n\n**I have a few questions.** I oil my scalp, but I usually feel like it's not doing anything (or worse, causing me to have increased hair fall). I'm hoping that clarifying the following with you will help me to improve my practice.\n\n**My hair profile:** high porosity, navel-length hair, coily / curly (3C/4A), dries out easily, shiny, thick strands, low density (I am recovering from a health issue, but have been experiencing a lot of shed hair as a result...edges are *very* sparse), currently in long-term mini twists (rarely left unravelled). \n\n**My routine**: heat up jojoba oil and JB castor oil, mix together, add rosemary or peppermint essential oil, massage into scalp (on entire head) with pads of fingers.\n\n**My questions** (please take your time...no rush to answer them <3)\n\n* What is your exact process for massaging the oil into your scalp (e.g, the parts of your fingers you use \\[I use the pads of mine\\], how long you spend on each part of your hair, what kind of massaging technique you use \\[skin over scalp? Or something else?\\]). I've started using a scalp massaging tool with thin bristles, but it hurts...not sure if it's working, sadly.\n* Do you warm the oil before using it?\n* How long do you spend massaging oil into each part of your scalp (back, mid, front, edges)? How many minutes?\n* What kind of amla oil do you use? I mix the gooseberry powder into warm jojoba oil and strain out the powder. Unfortunately, it leaves my scalp feeling itchy, but I'm not aware of any other amla oils that do not contain mineral oil (which I understand isn't the best for hair / scalp health)\n* Do you spray your scalp with water before oiling?\n* Is my understanding of oils correct?\n   * Avocado, coconut = penetrating oils = better for strands?\n   * jojoba, castor, grapeseed = sealing oils = better for scalp?\n* I wear my waist-length mini twists for 4+ weeks or more, so I'm not frequently washing. How would you recommend developing an oiling practice while minimizing build up?\n* I've stopped using pumpkin seed oil because it tends to cause acne when it leaks from my bonnet on to my pillow. How do you balance the butters and oils our hair loves and skincare?\n* And finally, how does your treatment of roots vs mid-strands vs tips differ?\n\nThank you so much, Veah <3 Bless you.",

    "body": "Cleansing balms\n\nUPDATE 8/20/20: I’m adding a new balm I’ve recently tried (at the bottom of the list). If anyone has tried balms that you’d like to review in the format used, please post them below!!!\n\nOk, I’ve been (still am) on a mission to try and review all of the best/most popular cleansing balms in an effort to find the very very best one. I’ve tried nearly all of the most popular ones now. I searched everywhere for a comprehensive review of all of these and couldn’t find much so I’m hoping this will be a helpful resource to others who might be looking too. I welcome any input!!\n\nBackstory:\nI had been using The Body Shop’s Camomile balm since way before cleansing balms went mainstream, for probably a decade at least. I never knew there were other options until I was given a sample of Farmacy Green Clean and that’s what started me down this path - I wanted to see what the best option truly is! I liked my Camomile but could there be a better balm out there waiting for me??!\n\nAs always, YMMV but below are my results! All prices are in Canadian dollars and I have not researched pricing or availability in other countries.\n\nAs for what I actually use it for - I don’t wear a full face of makeup every single day but I do always wear a tinted sunscreen and mascara at a minimum, usually with a light powder foundation, blush and brow gel as well. I’ve tried every balm below on little to no makeup up to a full face of special occasion makeup.\n\nA note about ingredients - I’ve copied ingredient lists below from the brands websites. It was important to me to evaluate which ones have polyethylene (plastic) as well as essential oils.\n\nI would LOVE to hear your thoughts on those below or any other options I haven’t tried yet!\n\n**TL;DR FINAL VERDICT**: for a really good clean and soft face, Drunk Elephant’s Slaii is probably the best value in terms of value, packaging, ingredients, etc. I think this will continue to be my go to in the super dry winter months (especially since I tend to wear a bit thicker makeup in the winter), but to be honest, I think I will probably continue use my trusty Body Shop Camomile Cleansing Butter in the summers.\n\n**The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter**\n\nSize: 90mL (3oz).   \nPrice: $17 CAD @ The Body Shop reg price (but it’s often on sale).   \nPrice per oz: $5.67/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a wide and flat metal tin that is perfect for storing bobby pins or things in after (no plastic packaging, yay!). I have had a few times over the years where the threads get misaligned and stuck if it was tightened wrong and have needed to use a knife or screwdriver to pry it open again.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.   \nTexture & Emulsion: When scooping the balm out, it stays a little solid as you rub it into your skin. I wouldn’t say it emulsifies 100% to an oil but it feels great on the face and it’s super spreadable once warmed up. Doesn’t feel greasy/oily, more creamy.    \nScent: Very neutral scent, I don’t believe there are any added scents, essential oils or fragrances.    \nOn the Eyes: It doesn’t sting the eyes at all, but sometimes there’s a light film, if so I just blink a few times and it goes away.    \nAmount Required: A very small amount is required for my whole face (probably about 1/2 tsp max) and one tin easily lasts me a few months.    \nIngredients: No plastic to be found here! I also love that the ingredient list is short and sweet.    \nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, Parfum, Aqua, Linalool, Limonene, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Citric Acid.    \n\nVERDICT: I’ve loved this forever and to be honest, now that I’ve tried some others I’m not totally sure if the grass is actually greener on the other side. Still a top contender for me and the price is amazing! I do wonder though if my skin feels a just a tiny bit less moisturized after using this (compared to some of the others below)...\n\n**Farmacy Green Clean** \n\nSize: 90mL (3oz).   \nPrice: $45 CAD @ Sephora Canada.   \nPrice per oz: $15/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes, but the plastic tray it is stored in is very flimsy (sits in top of the tub).    \nTexture & Emulsion: When scooping the balm out, it melts easily and emulsifies quickly to rub around your face. Not greasy/oily.    \nScent: Light citrusy scent (almost like a lime sherbert or something) that smells so good I just want it all over my face all the time.    \nOn the Eyes: I do find it causes quite a bit of a film if I use it on the eyes (something I’d never really experienced before with the Camomile balm), no stinging unless it gets directly in the eyes. Makeup dissolves easily with minimal rubbing or tugging.    \nAmount Required: A small amount is required.    \nIngredients: While they say it’s not “microbeads” and that it melts in water, this product does contain polyethylene aka plastic. Take that for what you will. This product does have quite a bit of essential oils and extracts.    \n\nCetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Peg-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Peg-10 Isostearate, Polyethylene, Phenoxyethanol, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Amino Esters-1, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Amber Powder, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Water/ Aqua/ Eau, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Echinacea Purpurea Root Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Moringa Pterygosperma Seed Extract, Disodium Phosphate, Citric Acid.   \n\n\nVERDICT: I like it, I love it, I want some more of it. It smells amazing and feels luxurious on the face. Even though a little goes a long way, I do have a hard time justifying spending that much money on a first cleanser (and I don’t love that it contains polyethylene and a lot of essential oils).\n\n**Physicians Formula The Perfect Matcha 3-in-1 Melting Cleansing Balm**\n\nSize: 41mL (1.4oz).  \nPrice: $15 CAD @ Shoppers Drug Mart (also find at Walmart, Superstore etc).   \nPrice per oz: $10.71/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a screw top and an internal insert underneath. The insert holds the very tiny spatula.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes but it’s tiny, about the size of a safety pin.   \nTexture & Emulsion: It melts but it’s not overly emollient and isn’t as spreadable as others I’ve tried.    \nScent: Sort of a light essential oily/green tea/citrus scent. Some say it smells like Green Clean but I completely disagree and it’s nowhere near as nice of a smell.    \nOn the Eyes: A bit of eye stinging and a definite film was to be had.    \nAmount Required: Larger amount required to effectively remove makeup/sunscreen of any I’ve tried to date.    \nIngredients: Looks like we have that ever present plastic again (polyethylene) as well as fragrance, food colouring and citrus essential oils. Sad face.    \nCETYL ETHYLHEXANOATE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SORBETH-30 TETRAOLEATE, PEG-5 GLYCERYL TRIISOSTEARATE, PEG-10 ISOSTEARATE, POLYETHYLENE, FRAGRANCE/PARFUM, CAMELLIA SINENSIS LEAF POWDER*, PHYLLOSTACHYS EDULIS SHOOT WATER**, NELUMBO NUCIFERA FLOWER EXTRACT***, CITRUS NOBILIS (MANDARIN ORANGE) PEEL OIL, WATER/EAU, PHENOXYETHANOL, SORBITAN SESQUIOLEATE, POLYGLYCERYL-10 OLEATE, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, LACTIC ACID, SODIUM BENZOATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, MALTODEXTRIN, YELLOW 5 (CI 19140), BLUE 1 (CI 42090). *MATCHA, **BAMBOO, ***LOTUS\n\nVERDICT: It’s a no from me, dawg. I couldn’t wait to finish this (relatively small) tub so I could try the next product. Having heard so many claims that it’s a perfect dupe for Green Clean, I was VERY disappointed. IMO they are nothing alike other than the colour (both balms are a light green colour). Smell, texture, effectiveness, price, ingredients - nothing wowed me.\n\n**Heimish All Clean Balm**\n\nSize: 120mL (4oz).   \nPrice: $23.95 CAD @ Amazon.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $5.99/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a flip top. Under the lid is a second lid which holds the included spatula. I like that the spatula is separated from the product but the extra lid makes it extra bulky in my cabinet.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes.   \nTexture & Emulsion: This balm I’d say emulsified almost immediately to a complete oil. It has a light oil feel (similar to say a sunflower oil, not as thick as an olive oil for example). It melts right away once it touches your face and feels like an oil face massage as you rub it in. It feels quite luxurious!    \nScent: Light floral scent (smells like essential oils). I like it and it’s not too overpowering IMO but I have heard some people find it too strong of a scent.    \nOn the Eyes: No stinging and the eye film is minimal.    \nAmount Required: I’d say a medium amount. Definitely more than the Camomile and Green Clean but it doesn’t seem excessive.    \nIngredients: There is polyethylene (plastic) in this as well as a number of essential oils which those with sensitive skin may wish to avoid.    \nEthylhexyl palmitate, cetyl ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, polyethylene, PEG-8 isostearate, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, cocos nucifera (coconut) fruit extract, citrus aurantifolia (lime) fruit extract, freesia refracta extract, iris versicolor extract, jasminum officinale (jasmine) extract, lilium tigrinum extract, leontopodium alpinum extract, nelumbium speciosum flower extract, narcissus pseudo-narcissus (daffodil) flower extract, rose extract, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) peel oil, lavandula angustifolia (lavender) oil, pelargonium graveolens flower oil, amyris balsamifera bark oil, citrus paradisi (grapefruit) peel oil, eucalyptus globulus leaf oil, melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) leaf oil, juniperus mexicana oil, boswellia carterii oil, citrus aurantium bergamia (bergamot) fruit oil, tocopheryl acetate, 1,2-hexanediol.\n\nVERDICT: There’s a lot to love about this - the scent and the texture are awesome, the price is definitely right, and I enjoy using it. My skin does always feel great after and it doesn’t dry me out. Cons for me are the bulky packaging, the amount of essential oils and the microbeads. I do like it but I’m not ready to stop my search quite yet.\n\n**Drunk Elephant Slaai**\n\nSize: 115mL (3.83oz).   \nPrice: $45 @ Sephora Canada.   \n(Note that this price includes a small vial of Bamboo Booster (physical exfoliating grains) as well).   \nPrice per oz: $11.75/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top. The spatula is magnetic and sits on top of the tub via a magnet (super handy for the makeup cupboard but also exposed/can pop off in a makeup bag while travelling).    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes.    \nTexture & Emulsion: Feels like softened butter and emulsifies to a thick oil feeling (similar to olive oil).     \nScent: Neutral, but a light olive oil type scent. I wish it had a nicer smell but it’s not offensive.     \nOn the Eyes: No stinging, easily removed eye makeup.    \nAmount Required: just a little, I’d say the smallest amount of any I’ve tried which is great news for it lasting a good while.\n\nIngredients: There don’t appear to be any polyethylene in this product and it’s lighter on the essential oils as well (good news if you have sensitive skin).\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Lauryl Laurate, Polyglyceryl-3 Laurate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Wax, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Oil, Actinidia Chinensis (Kiwi) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Ananassa (Strawberry) Seed Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Polyglyceryl-2 Caprate, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Seed Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Schinziophyton Rautanenii Kernel Oil, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Ximenia Americana Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Glycerin\n\nVERDICT: Love love love! Definitely don’t use too much but when using a small amount the oiliness isn’t too much and it makes my face feel soft and clean. However, a second cleanse is a must.\n\n**Clinique Take the Day Off Balm**\n\nSize: 125mL (4.17oz).    \nPrice: $40 @ Sephora Canada.    \nPrice per oz: $9.59/oz.    \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.    \nTexture & Emulsion: Texture is comparable to a solid form coconut oil (similar to the Heimish balm in texture and colour also). Emulsified quickly to a soft oil.    \nScent: Unscented.    \nOn the Eyes: A light film, but no stinging. Takes extra rubbing to loosen stubborn eye makeup.    \nAmount Required: Medium amount (not as much as Heimish but not as little as Drunk Elephant).    \n\nIngredients: Very short ingredients list but unfortunately, those classic plastics are in this balm as well (polyethylene).\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate , Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil , Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride , Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate , Polyethylene , Peg-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate , Water\\Aqua\\Eau , Tocopherol , Phenoxyethanol\n\nVERDICT: Honestly, I have no real bad things to say. It’s utilitarian. It doesn’t feel luxurious but it works.\n\n\n**Acure Seriously Soothing 3 in 1 Serum**\n\nSize: 50mL (1.7 oz).   \nPrice: $23.49 @ well.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $13.82/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a glass jar with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.   \nTexture & Emulsion: A very soft solid serum that gets a little melty when room temperature is quite warm. It melts immediately in your hand/on your face and becomes a liquidy oil. It feels luxurious but does leave an oily film so a second cleanse is definitely required.\nScent: Strong scent due to the blue tansy oil (some might not like it but I do!)\nOn the Eyes: It’s very gentle and doesn’t sting or leave a film.\nAmount Required: Very little required. I’d say about half a teaspoon for my whole face including eye makeup.\nIngredients: No plastic here! Just very basic natural ingredients.\n\nCaprylic/capric Triglyceride, Euphorbia Cerifera(Candelilla) Wax, Copernicia Cerifera(Carnauba) Wax, Butyrospermum Parkii(Shea) Butter, Rosa Canina(Rosehip) Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa(Argan) Oil, Tocopherol(Vitamin E), Tanacetum Annum (Blue Tansy)flower Oil, Ribes Nigrum (Black Currant)seed Oil.\n\nVERDICT: I didn’t originally buy this for a cleanser, (just as a balm) but used it in a pinch as my first cleanse when I accidentally lost my jar of Slaai on a camping trip. I love how my skin feels soft and soothed after using it as a cleanser and it feels so silky on my skin. It is a little on the expensive side but I think it’s a keeper for sure seeing as it’s so versatile!!\n\n**Banila Co. Clean It Zero Original Balm Cleanser**\n\nSize: 100mL (3.3 oz).   \nPrice: $27.96 @ Amazon.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $8.40/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: TBD.   \nTexture &amp;amp; Emulsion: TBD.   \nScent: TBD.   \nOn the Eyes: TBD.    \nAmount Required: TBD.   \nIngredients: Doesn’t look like there’s any microbeads in this bad boy, thankfully!\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, PEG-10 Isostearate, Synthetic Wax, Onsen-Sui, Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Lithospermum Erythrorhizon Root Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance, Ethylhexylglycerin, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Bambusa Vulgaris Leaf/Stem Extract Aspalathus Linearis Extract, Angelica Archangelica Root Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Polydiethyleneglycol Adipate/IPDI Copolymer, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Acrylates/Methoxy PEG-15 Methacrylate Copolymer\n\nVERDICT: TBD - haven’t tried it yet but I plan to so I’ve included the info I was able to find so far.\n\n\nYour turn!

So I changed it up and my go-to is now Farmacy Green Clean, which I love. Both are great, but I feel GC does a better job at overall removal for me and agrees with my oily skin type. Also the scent is just lovely. I am intrigued though by the Body Shop Chamomile though, I didn't even know they had that. So I might give it a try after using up my current supply.",

It's so gentle and doesn't foam. No signs of irritation. It leaves my skin hydrated and smooth. it's also affordable. got it for 300 pesos for 150ml. pH is 5.5\n\n# MOISTURIZERS\n\n**Face Republic Cica Moisturizer -** 🚩\n\nit broke me out. how? the eucalyptus oil ☹️ it also didn't feel very moisturizing and a bit thick for a gel.  fragrance was too strong.\n\n**Luxe Organix Cica Soothing Gel -** 🎂\n\ni think it's great for healing new red acne marks but it isn't hydrating on its own. have to apply a thin layer and follow it up with a moisturizer with humectants. it does help control the oiliness on my face for the first few hours. i also apply it to areas on my body that feel itchy i.e. a mosquito bite. it kind of smells like grass but it's very subtle. i don't use it with my retinol though.\n\n**Luxe Organix Hyaluron Soothing Gel -** 🥂\n\nit has hydrating ingredients like pantothenic acid, ceramides, glycerin, and hyaluronic acid. it also has niacinamide. more effective after using an exfoliant and leaves my skin hydrated! my face would feel smooth and dewy the morning after. i also use it to moisturize my UA. a small amount spreads very easily and dries down quickly. i have both the packet and tub but packet >> tub for hygiene purposes\n\n**Celeteque Hydration Moisturizer - \\_\\_**\n\nsimple formulation and it works fine on other parts of my face but it stings my mouth area a bit especially under my nostrils so i just avoid applying there. hindi naman ako nagbr-breakout sa area na iyon so i treat it as a minor inconvenience. i do think it's a good day moisturizer but i've been meaning to find a replacement for it.\n\n**Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion - \\_\\_**\n\nbagong bili ito and maybe i should use it at night. based on the formulation lang, mas suitable ito while repairing the skin barrier. used it on my face this morning and i feel that i should use the product less cause it's taking a while to sink into my skin. it's 4pm at may konting malagkit feels parin. if it doesn't work out i'll just use it as a moisturizer for other parts of my body.\n\n**Vaseline Petroleum Jelly & Lip Therapy (Shea Butter) -** 🥂\n\nthe original petroleum is okay but the shea butter does enough to moisturize my very dry lips! i also use the petrolatum to heal some papules.\n\n# SUNSCREENS\n\n**Belo Dewy Essence Sunscreen -** 🥂\n\nNo whitecast, stinging feeling, or breaking out. spreads easily and smells like milk. HG. Affordable pa at naka B1T1 ako sa isang supermarket. currently on my 4th tube :>\n\n**Biore** **UV** **Aqua Rich Watery Gel** \\- 🚩\n\nmy friend had this while on a field trip and i gave it a try. felt some stinging. gave me a breakout too. felt greasy and left a whitecast kahit light skin ako. doesn't absorb quickly. i personally can't tolerate alcohol as its pretty high on the list. not for me.\n\n**QuickFX SPF 50 PA++++ Sunscreen -** 🚩\n\nthis was my first sunscreen kasi ang mura nya but it kept breaking me out. left whitecast and pills. the fragrance is also very strong. after using it for several months i noticed it made my skin darker ??\n\n# ACTIVES\n\n**Pond’s Age Miracle Youthful Glow Night Cream -** 🎂\n\nit has the retinol derivatives retinyl propionate and retinyl palmitate. niacinamide is 6th on the ingredient list. it has a light cream consistency that spreads easily. it also smells like baby powder. i used this so i could introduce actives slowly before getting the actual retinol. didn't give me breakouts. medyo konti nlng mga contents nya so i only use it on areas sensitive to retinol (temples and area below ears). it also helps fade PIH, but not so much PIE. im surprised this product isn't mentioned often!\n\n**Klued 0.1% Retinol + 0.3% Bakuchiol** \\- 🥂\n\nvery first and current retinol. it definitely has helped improve my skin tone and very helpful in preventing acne. i also noticed it minimizes the appearance of pores. this with glycolic acid in my routine is slowly eliminating the appearance of ice pick scars on my cheek. i do like that it comes in a tube so i can control what comes out of it. a pea-sized amount is enough to spread around the face.\n\n**+ful 7% Glycolic Acid Toner -** 🥂\n\nimproved skin texture along my cheekbones. saw results after the first week. helps fade PIH and new PIE scars. this combined with the hyaluron gel are a good match and make my skin glowy and soft the morning after. i also love the packaging! i pat some on my UA too. i'm scared to use it on my temples na may PIE scarring lasting from months ago since medyo sensitive ang area doon but i'll try to use it there again.\n\n# Misc\n\n**Luxe Organix Hydrocolloid Patches (Both night 🥂 & day 🚩 variants)**\n\nGreat pimple patches but i find the night variant to be more effective! i only use it if the whitehead is fully out. the day variant doesnt stick that much to my skin\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhere are some products i'm willing to buy and make a review:\n\n* LUXE Baby Gentle Soothing & Moisturizing Gel Lotion - nakita kong nirecommend nito ni Jan Angelo sa isang video nya so nacurious ako ano ingredients . looks very hydrating and gentle. might work as a daily moisturizer?\n* HHN Ceramide Skin-Renewing Night Cream - found out one of their physical stores are based in my city and i'll try finding it there!\n* QuickFX Ceraboost Enriched Shield Cream - saw it in a local watsons but wasn't able to buy. has lotss of ceramides and active compounds of cica. it might pair well with my retinol\n* Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Soothing Gel - THE DREAM! malaki na siya and might last me a long time. could be a good pair with retinol as well. downside is palagi ako nasa labas and wala siguro magtanggap ng package ko if i buy online\n* Ellana 10% Azelaic Acid - if ever the PIE scars are too stubborn to go away then i might try this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nanyway, iyon lang. still trying to find an HG moisturizer for daily use. factor rin ang accessibility since i'm still in uni kaya i'm grateful if products are in physical stores. may nakita na rin akong stores malapit sa uni ko bumebenta ng TO, Cerave, Good Molecules, COSRx, etc.\n\nif curious din kayo tungkol sa progress ng skin and routine ko then just comment below hehe\n\nhope this review is helpful!",

Nagbalik loob ako kasi biglang di na okay sa akin yung cleansers na ginagamit ko (heimish, hada labo, panoxyl and aveeno). Sabi ko nga try ko lang uli yung basic at readily available anywhere. And ayun, rekindle na ulit kami this year. Nakadalawang malaki na ako this year.\n2.  Bioderma micellar water\nHay, bat ba nagbabago bigla skin natin no? Dati okay naman ako oil cleansers like Shu, Biore, Heimish balm, Hada labo) ..nag kka comedones na ako pag oil based gamit ko na mga to (and yes I emulsify this balms or oils followed ny cleanser) So I tried this one, pink variant, it works and wala comedone after using it at nakaka alis naman ng makeup.\n3. Klenzit adapalene with clyndamyacin\nVery effective sa acne, i just do spot treatment. Pero pag sa nose, i apply it all over sa mga black and whiteheads ko.\nI love it lalo na sa mga acne na hindi nahihinog na pabalik balik. Haha eto ang tumapos don.\n4. SOUL APOTHECARY (very underrated local brand, as in)\n   A. Hydragel moisturizer - di malagkit, absorbed quickly ng skin. I use this before I apply my adapalene. \n    B. Azelaic Acid - first thing I bought sa kanila. This one decreases hyper pigmentation and helps decrease inflammation ng acne! \n5. Vaseline petroleum jelly (the one in a small cute mini tub - I always buy the rose variant)\nGet this one! (Not the lipstick form), HG ko dati lucas pawpaw but bigla di na gumana. Pati din yung Laneige sleeping mask. Naka ilang reco na ako sa friends ko nito, as in nakaka galing chapped as in sugat lips huhu\n6.

    "body": "My daughter started having Eczema when she was 6 months of age. Since then we have been experimenting on many things to help her and heal her. Long story short, below are the list of things we did\n\n1. We reduced the usage of steroids as much as possible (only during big flare-ups)\n2. We stopped using the cetamacragol (Vaseline + .. i dont know what else in it)  and instead used Shea Butter + Black seed oil cream on her\n3. Slowly we even stopped using sheabutter and only used raw and organic black seed oil on her skin multiple times in a day\n4. We made sure she gets enough Vitamin D3 & K2 & Omega-3 in the form of supplements\n5. We discovered the main trigger was milk and milk related products. So we stopped them and used milk alternatives.\n\nAll the above steps helped us in managing her eczema and not really cure it. When it comes to curing\n\n1. We wanted to find out the actual reason for the triggers.\n2. We found that Milk, Corn & Sugar were aggravating her condition but were not really the cause\n3. We wanted to go to the root cause so we started seeing if the eczema is caused because of gut leak. No. Was it because of Liver issues. No. Was it because any other organ problems. No.\n4. We saw the eczema is increasing during the colder the months but greatly reduced during summer times\n5. Then we suspected if it could be related to lung issues or breathing issues. And there we narrowed it down.\n\nReal Cause: During winters as we close down all the doors and windows and turn up the heating, the humidity in the house reduces greatly. This causes the dust particles in the house to loose weight become lighter ( i have this theory that in a humid place the tiny water particles binds with the dust to keep them down, i am no scientist) and start circulating within the house. This is the real trigger. This and seasons when there are more hay particles in the air.\n\nSolutions:\n\n1. Remove all carpets from home\n2. Installed good air circulation system in the house\n3. Installed air-purifier in every room atleast in the sleeping room\n4. Reduce the number of corners where dust can collect\n5. Humidifiers everywhere set to auto-mode\n6. Aroma diffuser with mix of eucalyptus oil in the bedroom while sleeping everyday.\n\nPS: I am not a scientist nor a doctor. But I don't have to be neither to look at all the possibilities and to find workable solutions. I believe in the natural ability of the body to heal when presented with the right conditions.",

        "body": "Post like this can be very frustrating and lead to misinformation. Thank you for sharing your experience and what has helped your daughter. Some of things you have mentioned might help other people, but to say that you have cured her eczema is ridiculous. \n\nIt has cleared up. She is a baby, she might have outgrown a reaction to some of her triggers or you unknowingly eliminated it. It could flare up again later in her life. I hope not, but to act as if you have cured it is quite frankly silly.\n\nIt sounds like you should get her tested for allergies. If reducing her exposure to dust has helped reduce or eliminate her symptoms, she might have a dust allergy. I also have a dust allergy. I hope that a doctor verified she can’t tolerate milk or is allergic to milk. It would be beneficial to have a doctor test her for any intolerances or allergies. \n\nEczema is not a one size fits all kinda thing. For example eliminating dairy would not help me at all. It would actually trigger a flare up because I am allergic to almost all dairy alternatives. I am allergic to soy, tree nuts, and peanuts. Just because you have eczema does not mean you should blindly eliminate things because it helped some random person online. They might actually be allergic or have some kind of intolerance to something that you don’t. Same thing with other items people love to suggest people with eczema eliminate like gluten, sugar, and eggs. Actually get tested. Correlation is not causation. \n\nFurther, essential oils can trigger eczema in many people. I understand that there is a desire for more natural remedies, but for many people with eczema “nature” is a trigger. If you have allergies to pollen, plants, tree nuts, animals, etc. many “natural remedies” like essential oils, lanolin, shea butter, or coconut oil can trigger a flare up. \n\nhttps://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/eczema/eczema-essential-oils\n\nMany people on this thread love to suggest lanolin, coconut oil, shea butter etc. If you have not been tested for allergies these contain very common allergens that may worsen your symptoms. Lanolin comes from wool bearing animals, shea nut and coconut are tree nuts - these are all common allergens. Do you know what does not contain common allergens? Lotions like vanicream and cera ve - despite being seen as horrible because they are “unnatural.”\n\nAdditionally, you should speak with a professional to evaluate any vitamin or nutrient deficiencies. The supplement industry is very poorly regulated. Blindly taking supplements can cause serious health problems or might just be a complete waste of your money. \n\nPlease see a doctor and do not allow yourself to become mis-informed by random suggestions from strangers on the internet. There is no known cure for eczema. Its symptoms are simply managed and what works for one person may not work for you.",

The probiotic fixed temporarily a 20 year long IBS issue but ramped up all of my childhood allergies ten fold. \n\nI later found many other probiotics had the same effect. Bacillus subtilis, lactobacillus reuteri and many other histamine producing bacteria. \n\nFoods that contain histamine also cause these issues. Milk was also an issue for me and sugar. You may want to look at an anti histamine diet. No fermented products as they contain a mix of histamine producing bacteria. I do not have a suggestion on how to flush out the bacteria causing this but it's a start if this may be part of the issue you're having. \n\nVery high dose omega seal oil helps to stave off the symptoms and resolved them at one point for four months until I tried some yogurt that set me back to square one (lesson officially learned re: fermented foods). I suspect the bacteria isnt as transient as people claim probiotics to be and in some individuals take up residence. \n\nI have two autoimmune diseases and my niece also has this issue with eczema and has juvenile arthritis so there may be a link to histamine and histamine releasing bacteria.\n\nEdit: not sure why my experience is being downvoted as this is my personal experience and the experience of my family member.

    "body": "I made this post last year, and since we're seeing a lot of complaints about the amount of gnats on campus again, I thought a repeat might be helpful. This is some advice from what I learned in Scouts.\n\nFirst off: an important thing to note is that basic insect repellants like OFF! do not work against gnats. If you're looking for a spray solution because you're afraid of bugs/can't stand the thought of them, scroll to the bottom for my recommendations. You'll have to buy a gnat specific repellent.\n\nYou might have noticed the gnats try to get to your head/your face. This is because gnats always search for moisture and salt, and so attempt to land on your eyeballs. Gnats are also attracted to the carbon dioxide we breathe out, which is why they'll attempt to follow for some time.\n\nIf you put both your arms up and clasp your hands together, the gnats will *always* surround your hands instead of your head. They're too stupid to know the difference. In fact, you should really be trying to use this method instead of simply waving them away as **gnats can easily cause pink eye.**\n\nNow, once you've got your hands up and the gnats surround them, you should simply leave the area or head indoors. Thanks to how the gnats operate in Rutgers, they congregate around certain areas where moisture is higher, and stick to that area in swarms. Once you leave said area, only some will follow for a couple seconds before returning to the swarm.\n\n# Repellent advice:\n\nIn wooded areas/literally anywhere that is not a city like New Brunswick, the above method would not help and I'd recommend repellents like Peppermint/Eucalyptus Oil or a vanilla based repellent as gnats can't stand the scent of vanilla. I know Walmart usually carries gnat specific repellents, and they're easy to find on Amazon. However, since there's only about 2 weeks left in the semester, it might not be worth it to go find one of the above products.",

I didn't know how to process it because she and I have been through so much but it ultimately ended over her being a rep for Doterra. Let's call her Addy.\n\nEvery evening, we will catch up mostly on Facebook and during those times with Addy, she will promote her product on her work page. One instance, I had some issues with crohn's disease and I was telling her what was going on in my life.  She said she had something she wanted me to try and she just send me a free sample so I said why not cuz it was a free sample.  She just said mix with your tea or something. That shit pissed off my crohn's for that week. My doctor was pissed. We're in a makeup and skincare group on Facebook. Rule number one was no pyramid schemes or Mlms. Guess who got into it with a mod and was kicked out?\n \nOne of the reasons why I liked her because she wasn't pushy with her product; you could ask her about something she then would give you some info and then that was it. Then she tell you about her dog or the baby and back to normal non mlm stuff. She wasn't as hun like but then again I did see her with rose tinted glasses.\n\nBack in March she posted asking if anybody had a specific medical ailment (stomach infection). Some people ask why and she said she had a product for them. I commented and said to check with your medical profession to see if any \"holistic\" help was good for your health and to always consult with your doctor. The comment was liked by other people. They also said the same. My comment was removed.\n\nI didn't think anything of it, so I just moved on. I called her up on the phone to talk to her about our show and was telling her about a local woman trying to push oils on to cats and how deadly they are. It was pretty big in my area and she took offense to it. I told her I don't understand why do reps tell people to try oils over medical expertise. Addy told me that they should try their products first instead of going to spend all that money and insurance at the hospitals and doctors. She told me some people are brainwashed into thinking medicine is the only key. She told me to back in January to try eucalyptus oil for my asthma. Now eucalyptus is known to be somewhat of a trigger for those with asthma and allergies. I will react to eucalyptus oil and have an asthma attack. She told me I needed to get used to it for it to work. \n\nAnyway, we went back and forth. And I told her that it was an abuse of power for her or any rep to give medical advice when they are not a medical professional. She told me I did not understand and that oils are proven. Now one of the reasons why I love this board is that we have useful information regarding mlms. I showed her some factual information regarding it and she said the reason why the FDA does not approve of their oils is because, it would make the \"pharmaceutical companies go bankrupt.\"\n\nI was called many ugly names and she had her oily army call to tell me the real truth. I blocked her on Facebook . It became an ugly night with her friend Huns going after me for believing logic over their research.  My 9 year friendship is gone because of some oil MLM. I can't see the baby or family anymore. 😔 It would've been my 9th friend anniversary with her today.\n",

She's more like a paid advertisement that's setup for the person above her to make money.

It is essentially a small manufactured pyramid within the pyramid, where the steps aren't actually active. Lady A makes more money if lady B signs lady C, and then  lady C sign people up on a 4th level ... and none of these people do anything at all really. They don't sell, they just have doTerra stuff sitting around the house. Like a diffuser, or some skin oil, or whatever they can use quietly but noticably .... if someone asks, refer them to Lady A. Lady A has a rich husband, and she does literally ALL the work, but none of the sales are attributed to her. She just inputs one of the lady D's as the sales person ....\n\nAnyways, in exchange for free oil garbage around the house, and chump change. But mostly oil shit... the only thing the false steps in the pyramid have to do actively is react positively on facebook and IG. This lady's scheme is all about quiet, noticeable, passive aggressive shit. So if you say \"have a doctor check it out...\" Her oily army \\(i love that phrase\\) shills will rain praises on your wisdom while mentioning oil...\n\n**Like an earache** *.. normal person says, \"see a doctor\" ... oily shill goes, \"Yes, great advice normal person.... ear ache guy, if you can't to Doc today try melaluca oil while you wait! helped me out alot.\" Shill 2 \\- \"Yeah malaluca saved me while waiting for my doc appointment.\" Shill 3 \"I was in Iowa for a week, and couldn't see my doc, I used lavender and melaluca for 4 days, ear ache went away, and i cancelled my appointment. \" Shill 4  \\- \"Hey Shill 2, did you try lavender too or just melaluca, what did doctor say you had?\" Shill 2 \\- \"Luckily it went away after a few hours with just melaluca, lavender works too??? i'll try next time ...\"*\n\nThey're just waiting to tee off on people. Because that's their only role. that's their minimal effort job for a free diffuser and $20 a month. So you did the right thing, BLOCK and don't get involved... they're waiting to turn what you say  into an advertisement, sadly in your case, much more negative.",

I got complacent, and in fall 2024 I did not apply nematodes or feed the mice contraceptive bait all winter (this is a very expensive way to go, and I thought I had mostly beat the ticks and could save some $. LOL). I also use tick tubes, although I got them out late this spring.\n\nThis spring is insane. I have put down nematodes twice, but I think they are really most effective in fall since they live in soil and parasitize the pregnant female ticks who go back to the soil to lay eggs. I am collecting so many deer ticks off myself and my dog that I decided to experiment with a lot of essential oils and natural products to see what might actually work. Here are my findings:\n\nCedarcide chips do not seem to bother ticks at all, they crawl all over them and seem to have no ill effects.\n\nEucalyptus oil slows them down and seems to disorient them some, but after 45 minutes exposure they aren't dead. Same for Cedarcide Tickshield, Peppermint Oil, Sawyer Permitherin, Ecosmart Insect Repellent, Cedarcide Lawn Spray. They freely crawl over these products on a paper towel and don't seem repelled. \n\nSo far, the only thing I've tested that seems to kill them pretty fast is Clove oil, but it's poisonous to dogs so I can use it on myself but not my dog. \n\nThe only product they flee from in haste is Vet's Best Flea and Tick Yard and Kennel Spray. Still not full dead after 20 min, though. \n\nIf anyone else has done these experiments and found success, please share!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mcuat3y28dze1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f160d537d9a75d3b7d4c39bdc3ba30f1406fbc82\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5vwvs4y28dze1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=414a31aa9aa366af602e1920ed346afc27878f3d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/etvcj9y28dze1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c2ba650858a6a2899ac3bd7ff91a06b66e7221bc\n\n",

I grew up around lots of ticks on a goat farm in NC. Never remembered getting bit but apparently I did because at age 32 Lyme autoimmunity kicked in full force and I lost the ability to walk almost overnight. \n250k in infectious disease specialty clinics later I was worsening and had to move my wife and I off of our Homestead into my parents house across the country so they could help take care of me. Finally, I got fed up and fired all my doctors and started bee venom therapy. 10 Stings along the spine every other day. I’m now mobile on crutches and can take small steps and we are back home on our land.  I’m farming this year again for the first time since 2020. The bees work and I finally feel like I’ll get better someday but it’s a 3 year protocol. Ticks are no joke be very careful. It’s part of why we moved to NM I don’t ever want to leave the desert it’s just not worth it. \nI get so many messages from random homesteaders and ex hunting guides that friends have put in touch with me at least around twice a week. Chronic Lyme is rampant among homestead and rural communities and it’s very suppressed in the medical world. It’s just as serious as MS or ALS and it’s wild how many farmers and rural type people are getting sick with Lyme these days. \nThere’s a good documentary called  ‘the quiet epidemic’ that goes into why chronic Lyme is suppressed in most medical communities especially on the East coast. It’s all very political and pretty messed up that’s why you don’t ever hear about it.  Pfizer is working on a new vaccine for Lyme called VLA15 that is projected to hit markets in 2026 I believe when that happens cdc will make chronic Lyme a big deal again like they did back in 92’ when the lymrix vaccine was on the market before it was recalled and weirdly chronic Lyme turned right back into a medical conspiracy theory. \nIt’s pretty weird that it’s become a political issue but whatever you believe just be careful around ticks and I would encourage anyone to follow ILADS guidelines for a proper doxy cycle over cdc guidelines just to be safe if you are ever bit regardless of what a western blot test shows.",

My oldest child has chronic Lyme (contracted in San Diego county of all places) and so I am really, REALLY paranoid about ticks. The first few years, I had the cleared yard area sprayed for ticks, and it would knock down the population by about 90%. I was so hesitant to use pesticides but the risk of Lyme and other tick borne illness is so beyond serious, i felt it was worth the risk. Note I have a huge vegetable garden and orchard and had no issue with bees- honeybees and native pollinators were still in abundance. The spray was basically a barrier aimed at the wood line. Last summer, we decided to try a flock of guinea fowl for tick management. We have 12. They were growing up last summer and we still sprayed, this spring we did not start our usual spraying program. \n\nThe guinea fowl are at least as effective as pesticide spraying through a professional company. Maybe more effective. They are loud, obnoxious, hilarious, literal bird brained goof balls. If we had neighbors it would be out of the question. But for us, it’s worked amazingly well! I think that might be a good solution for you depending on the neighbor situation. Chickens and ducks (which we also have) are not as effective as guineas and they are a little easier on your garden and landscaping, unlike chickens.",

Even if a cyclone doesn't hit us directly, flooding that has occured previously has been caused by storms, tropical lows staying offshore, or ex cyclones tracking down the coast. I've been here all my life, and while the big floods were bad, the odd small ones did have pretty major impacts on the day to day functioning of my life.\n\nSo, aside from the standard things everyone should be doing (a link to which can be found here: [https://www.qld.gov.au/emergency/dealing-disasters/prepare-for-disasters](https://www.qld.gov.au/emergency/dealing-disasters/prepare-for-disasters) ), what are your weirdest tips for handling flooding disasters?\n\nI'll go first:\n\n\\- Have a battery speaker for podcasts and songs, not just emergency broadcasts. Shit gets boring\n\n\\- Buy the cheapest hard laundry soaps you can for post flooding clean up and washing. Sunlight, for example, is $5 for half a kilo of soap, and it goes FAR\n\n\\- Get some electrolyte powder, and make sure you like the taste of them. Poweraid is the most obvious one, and can be found at colesworth, but theres way more these days at Chemis Warehouse\n\n\\- Clove or Eucalyptus oil as a preventative for mold invasion is good shit, but if you need to kill mold due to it getting in anyway, use the damn proper stuff, THEN the oils\n\n\\- Buy hand sanitiser\n\n\\- Try as hard as you can to get a fan that works on batteries or some other means.

Goodal, DHC, Blythe tundra chaga pressed serum full size and crystal serum one travel size for 16.99 USD and Skin&Lab giant 3.3 oz barrierderm cream for 12.99 USD. And Pureheals centella serum and green tea mask on sale for 19 USD. The serum is awesome. Sorry I got too off topic... And still didn't mention half of the AB stuff.",

This means there is doTerra on the reception desk for sale, and if he hears someone is sick he tries to push the essential oils on you as part of ‘natural healing’ (eucalyptus oil on hands and neck to absorb into skin and open airways over any medications). He is so far into natural healing no one in his family is vaccinated or goes to the doctors for any illnesses. That’s fine for him, but when a large portion of the company’s client base is elderly and babies, you shouldn’t be pushing those beliefs on the vulnerable and immune deficient.\n\nI think the thing that gets me the most is he does seminars for new patients explaining how to get the best out of chiropractic care. In this he talks about eating as healthy as possible and if you can’t buy from farmers markets, to wash all your fruits and vegetables in lemon essential oil. Needless to say this shocked me. I’m smart enough to only like essential oils for the smells, but I really worry for some of the clients. As I said, the majority are elderly who could be pressured or tricked into buying this stuff.\n\nI’ve just been asked to do a google review for them and I want to mention this, without it getting back to it being me if possible, and with evidence based science to back me up. Can anyone point me in the right direction?",

    "body": "But, wait!  I’m not done yet!  Indeed, the best is yet to come with a few other Tosowoong products I think are worthy of note!\n\n\nPropolis Sparkle Ampoule - Contains 80% propolis that adds elasticity, vitamins and nutrition to dry and dull skin (neither of which I have, so its effects are even more pronounced on my skin!).  It’s also got Honey Extract, Artemisia Vulgaris Extract, Sophora Angustifolia Root Extract, Coptis Chinensis Root Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Pinus Sylvestris Leaf Oil, and Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil.\n\nI use this now after the FTE and before the serum, and this stuff REALLY turns the glow on.  It’s a little stickier than the LJH I was using before but the stickiness goes away with the ensuing layers.  I’d say it almost makes my face “glow in the dark” glowy, were it not for (drum roll please)…\n\n\nPure Propolis Mask Pack\n\nThis sheet mask is insane – just absolutely, totally, and completely insane!\n\nI put it on after the FTE (and instead of the Sparkle Ampoule) and, after 20 minutes or so, my face is well hydrated and glowing like it never has before.  And the glow lasts!  It really, really lasts!  \n\nI was totally blown away the first time I tried this in the PM and quickly made plans to “make time” to try it in the AM.  \n\nOMG!  My face had a wonderful (and quite noticeable) AB glow the entire day and into the night!  While I do use the serum, emulsion and cream (PM only) after this mask, I haven’t quite gotten up the courage (yet) to try the Sparkle Ampoule right after and in addition.  \n\nI’m afraid I might actually blind myself with the glow shining back at me in the mirror (and, besides, it would be a dead giveaway that I actually “did something” to my face which, as we know, is “streng verboten” for members of the weaker – and way less fair – gender).  \n\n\nCocoon Monster Pack - contains syn-ake peptide & EGF to firm, silkworm cocoon protein & galactomyces to hydrate & nourish, volcanic ash gently exfoliates, while Bifida enhances skin barrier.\n \nClaims to get rid of blackheads & whiteheads, tighten enlarged pores, as well as firm and lift sagging skin.  It is “normal” to feel very tight, and the texture of the pack to be rough, uneven and crack as the pack dries. \n\nWhoa Nellie!  This mask definitely means business!  They say you should leave it on for 15-20 minutes but I’ve never gotten that far.  This mask tightens onto your face like no one’s business, far more than any clay mask I’ve ever used.  But, interestingly, once you wash it off, your face feels really smooth and supple, and NOT dried out at all.\n\nI’m not sure about the claims with regard to blackheads and whiteheads, but I can definitely say that my face looks (and feels) smooth, nicely hydrated, and virtually pore-free after I use this.\n\nI’ve even tried it as step 2 of the now (in)famous 3-step pore minimizing routine and it absolutely works well for this, even better than the clay masks I used to use.  \n\nJust be aware that this innocuous little gel will tighten onto your face like a vise about 5 minutes after you put it on.  And then, it really tightens up and begins to crack, which is rather “unusual” to say the least.  Strange – but effective!\n\n\n",

    "body": "—INTRODUCTION—\n\nPeople start looking into no-, low-, and natural-poo for a variety of reasons.  For whatever reason, we do have a tendency to let our beliefs and emotional reactions (feels) get in the way of facts (reals).\n\nThere’s a link in the sidebar to a page about “Essential Oils in Haircare”.  This set off crazy warning bells: essential oils are not something with which to be tinkering around.  This is about 7000 times more true if they are being used topically, rather than for aromatherapy, which is how the linked website (and many of this subreddit’s users) recommend using them.\n\nJust because something is “natural” or derived from a plant does not mean it’s a-okay for your skin.  There’s no market out there for poison ivy tea rinses, after all.  I want to work through (for now) the oils specifically mentioned on the linked page, since that is what the subreddit “advocates” or is, at least, what most users will find when looking into essential oil use.\n\n—THE LINE-UP—\n\nBASIL: first up, this essential oil has some compounds that are going to be old friends by the time we get through this: linalool and eugenol.  This are BOTH documented irritants that you should avoid in any skin care product. (http://www.aromaweb.com/essential-oils/basil-oil.asp), (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/eugenol), (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/linalool)\n\nCHAMOMILE: this one checks out; it doesn’t appear to be widely irritating in general, though some people with allergies to the daisy family may have issues. (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/chamomile)\n\nCEDARWOOD: this is a fragrance, and like many fragrances, can be irritating and allergenic.  There is also, apparently, some research which found it to cause tumors on mouse skin.  The evidence is far, far from conclusive, and even if there were more studies with similar results, “correlation is not causation” would still apply.  However, if you’re going to freak out about parabens or whatever, it doesn’t make sense to use cedarwood oil. (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/cedarwood)\n\nCLARY SAGE: this is tagged with the Risk Number* R38, marking it as irritating to the skin.  Don’t put it on your scalp, fer Pete’s sake. (http://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB9340183.htm)\n\nEUCALYPTUS: this is a fragrant oil which, as the sidbar-linked website says, may well have some anti-fungal and anti-microbial effects.  HOWEVER, some of its components are known irritants.  \"Truly a mixed bag, because this oil, like rosemary oil, is one that has benefits and risks. Because the risks are primarily with topical application to skin, eucalyptus oil is an ingredient to avoid” (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/eucalyptus-oil)\n\nLAVENDER:  STOOOOOOOOOOOOP putting lavender essential oil anywhere near your skin. The “tingling” feeling that many people describe isn’t lavender oil stimulating your bloodflow or anything, it’s the oil irritating and damaging your skin.  You do NOT want to experience tingling with any product you apply topically: it is your body sending you distress signals.  Lavender is so, so misunderstood, so I’m going to quote the whole article:  \n\n\"Of particular concern is the lavender oil, which smells great but causes havoc on skin. Research indicates that components of lavender, specifically linalool, can be cytotoxic, which means that topical application causes skin-cell death (Source: Cell Proliferation, June 2004, pages 221–229). Lavender leaves contain camphor, which is a known skin irritant. Because the fragrance constituents in lavender oil oxidize when exposed to air, lavender oil is a pro-oxidant, and this enhanced oxidation increases its irritancy on skin (Source: Contact Dermatitis, September 2008, pages 143–150). Lavender oil is the most potent form, and even small amounts of it (0.25% or less) are problematic. Although it’s fine as an aromatherapy agent for inhalation or relaxation, it is a must to avoid in skin-care products. (Sources: Psychiatry Research, February 2007, pages 89–96; and www.naturaldatabase.com).\"\n\n(http://www.paulaschoice.com/beautypedia-skin-care-reviews/by-brand/bio-oil/_/Bio-Oil)\n\nLEMON: this provides no demonstrated skin care benefits, but can be both irritating and photo toxic, i.e. reactions may result following exposure to sunlight.  (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/lemon-oil)\n\nLEMONGRASS: this is another fragrant, volatile oil which contains the same compounds that make lemon oil (above) irritating to the skin. ( http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/lemongrass-oil)\n\nMYRRH: another one that contains limonene, an irritant also found in the two oils above, as well as pinene (see “volatile oil\" description below) and eugenol, which you also don’t want on your body. (http://www.baseformula.com/product.php/6670/myrrh-essential-oil), (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/eugenol)\n\nPATCHOULI: this is derived from mint, can sensitize skin, and contains eugenol (see myrrh, above) which is an irritant.  Patchouli is considered a “counter irritant”, for which see below for a full explanation. (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/patchouli)\n\nPEPPERMINT: it’s another counter-irritant; move along. (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/peppermint)\n\nROSEMARY: this one kind of almost barely checks out.  In very, very small quantities rosemary EXTRACT can be okay, but if you look at the main constituents of rosemary OIL, it’s a whole lot of known irritants: pinene, borneol, linalol, camphor, etc. (http://www.aromaweb.com/essential-oils/rosemary-oil.asp), (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/antioxidants/rosemary-extract)\n\nSAGE: I feel like this is starting to get repetitive: it’s a fragrant oil, and all the usual, skin-annoying compounds are there, including camphor.  Nope.  (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/sage-extract)\n\nTEA TREE: Fiiiiiiiiiinally!  This one kind of checks out too!  It can have anti-inflammatory effects and seems effective at treating certain skin conditions.  However, that doesn’t mean you should go whapping it all over your head: it still contains components that can cause issues, so it should STILL be treated with extreme caution.  (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/tea-tree-oil1)\n\nTHYME: once again, fragrance compounds found in thyme oil are undesirable on your skin.  Billionth verse, same as the first, no?  (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/thyme-oil)\n\nYLANG YLANG: allllllllllll together now!  It’s a fragrant oil made up of compounds known to cause skin issues!  Skip it!  (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/ylang-ylang)\n\n—IN CONCLUSION—\n\nMany people who avoid shampoo do so because they feel it contains too many “harsh” or “irritating” chemicals.  Swapping out a rigorously-tested, carefully-formulated shampoo only to start smearing essential oils (chemicals) over your head is, however, nonsensical.  Not that you can’t do it, of course; it’s your body.  If, however, you’re going to invoke science in defense of any part of your regime (often done in no-poo-land), why not apply that standard consistently?  “Diluting” these oils with carriers may help, but these compounds can be problematic for skin even in tiny quantities in professionally-made products.  If you’re avoiding shampoo to limit your exposure to chemicals and irritants, why risk the above-listed essential oils\n\n—ADDITIONAL NOTES AND DEFINITIONS—\n\nVOLATILE OIL: \"Group of volatile fluids derived primarily from plants and used in cosmetics primarily as fragrant additives. These components most often include a mix of alcohols, ketones, phenols, linalool, borneol, terpenes, camphor, pinene, acids, ethers, aldehydes, and sulfur, all of which have extremely irritating and sensitizing effects on skin.” (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/volatile-oil)\n\nCOUNTER-IRRITANT: \"Ingredients such as menthol, peppermint, camphor, and mint are counter-irritants (Sources: Archives of Dermatologic Research, May 1996, pages 245–248; and Code of Federal Regulations Title 21—Food and Drugs, revised April 1, 2001, CITE: 21CFR310.545, www.fda.gov). Counter-irritants are used to induce local inflammation for the purpose of relieving inflammation in deeper or adjacent tissues. In other words, they substitute one kind of inflammation for another, which is never good for skin. Irritation or inflammation, no matter what causes it or how it happens, impairs the skin’s immune and healing response (Source: Skin Pharmacology and Applied Skin Physiology, November–December 2000, pages 358–371). And although your skin may not show it or doesn’t react in an irritated fashion, if you apply irritants to your skin the damage is still taking place and is ongoing, so it adds up over time (Source: Skin Research and Technology, November 2001, pages 227–237).”  \n(http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/counter-irritant)\n\nRISK NUMBERS: an explanation can be found here (https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/newsletter/essential_oils_handle_with_care.php)\n",

This is a true statement, and I'm glad someone is pointing this out.\n\nThat said, I wanted to point out a couple of things to anyone who may still read this thread.  What makes something toxic or damaging is amount, and that can be said for everything ranging from resiniferatoxin to normal water.  While there are definitely going to be stupid or ignorant people that use essential oils in an unsafe manner, most of them have safe levels associated with use.  In other words, diluted down sufficiently, there's nothing on the list you've provided that *can't* be safely used for lotions, shampoos, and bath oils, and some, like lavender, are *so* safe that they're regularly used in baby lotions.  \n\nEveryone isn't going to be rolling to EO use with a solid chemistry background, so mentioning that certain things cause sensitization (like the wood oils) more rapidly than others is definitely worth noting.  But even with that in mind, almost everything you listed makes regular appearances in commercial perfumes, so they've been tried and tested in the population.  \n\nLastly, I wanted to point out that your concept of skin irritant is a little off.  Inducing local inflammation isn't the horrible thing you seem to think it is, in fact, products containing a number of the ingredients above are recommended for multiple-times-daily use by doctors for treatment of pain (like from sore muscles and arthritis).  The proportion of eugenol and linalool and other potentially irritating compounds is so low in most of the ones you've listed that dilution is sufficient to all but eliminate risk.  The remaining risk is the same for any new scented product you'd buy, including tested deodorant soaps and shampoos.  \n\nJust don't use EO's undiluted, ever, and follow established protocols for reduction, and people will be fine including them in whatever homemade hair or skin tonic they wish.",

    "body": " The last part of my mini-review series and this one is dedicated to body care!  \n\n\n• Body Washes/Shower Gels  \n\n\n**Nivea Creme Care Body Wash**: It's a really creamy and gentle body wash. It lathers up pretty well, smells amazing and especially love it for winters because it leaves the body so soft! WRP.  \n\n\n**Skinbeing Blueberry Daily Refreshing Shower Gel**: I love anything with berries which is the reason I picked this one up. This one is super cleansing and refreshing and smells divine. Makes me feel really fruity and fresh. WRP.  \n\n\n**Skinbeing Lime Quat Shower Gel**: Talk about freshness and summer! This shower gel smells like a jug full of lemonade and cools down the skin. It lathers great is super refreshing after a hard day. WNRP since the blueberry variant is better.  \n\n\n**St. D'vence Tea Tree Body Wash**: This one has featured on my page before and for a reason. I've suffered from body acne since my childhood and this product has helped me a lot. It contains peppermint and eucalyptus oil which not only soothe the skin, but also visibly help in clearing up acne on the body while not stripping it to much. If you suffer from these issues, you must try this! WRP.  \n\n\n**Nivea Waterlily & Oil Shower Gel**: I got this because of the super cute and aesthetic packaging and its performance hasn't disappointed me. I absolutely adore how this one smells and how the fragrance lingers on for a few hours. It definitely feels like a super expensive product and isn't stripping or harsh. Love it! WRP.  \n\n\n**Pears Pure & Gentle Body Wash**: Pears is well known for their gentle and simple product and this body wash aligns with this. It's 100% soap-free so it's great for dry or irritated skin. It smells just like their soap, cleanses well and definitely hydrates the skin a lot! A really basic and effective body wash, since I like to experiment, WNRP this one.  \n\n\n• Body Butters/Lotions  \n\n\n**Nivea Aloe Hydration Body Lotion**: It's a very lightweight and liquidy lotion that is extremely easy to spread. It does have a strong fragrance but I personally find it very pleasant and refreshing. Leave the skin hydrated without feeling greasy or oily, which makes it a great choice for summers and humid climate. WRP.  \n\n\n**The Body Shop Fuji Green Tea Body Lotion**: Smells so refreshing, has a light texture, and spreads very easily. It's perfect for summers and provides adequate moisture. WRP.   \n\n\n**Khadi Natural Almond & Kokum Body Butter**: It's a decent body butter and does help with dry skin especially during winters. But honestly, it wasn't anything that great, WNRP.  \n\n\n**Pilgrim Shea & Cocoa Body Butter**: This body butter smells like luxury. It is so thick and creamy and deeply moisturizes the skin. The only down side is that it's a little hard to spread, but putting it right after bathing solves that. WRP.  \n\n\n• Body Scrub  \n\n\n**Nykaa Wanderlust Body Scrub (Japanese Cherry Blossom)**: It's a very gentle and mild scrub with a heavenly fragrance of cherry blossoms! It lasted me a long time and really made a difference to my skin. WRP and would love to try the other variants from Nykaa's range!  \n\n\n• Body Oils  \n\n\n**Khadi Natural Ayurvedic Sandalwood Massage Oil**: It's a nice basic oil for hydration and leaves the skin with a nice glow, love to use it during winters. WRP.  \n\n\n**mCaffeine Naked & Raw Coffee Body Polishing Oil**: Definitely a little expensive, but as a coffee addict, it's worth every penny for me! The ingredient list is quite good and it really makes the skin supple and hydrated (and smelling like coffee yumm). The downside is that a lot of quantity of this oil is used if you're massaging your full body, it doesn't spread to a large area. But considering the plus points and how well it's working for me, WRP for occasional self-pampering sessions!  \n\n\n• Hand and Foot creams  \n\n\n**M&S Magnolia Hand & Nail Cream**: The texture of the cream is very lightweight and non-sticky. It keeps the hands soft and supple for 3-4 hours and smells divine. The other fragrances of M&S hand creams are amazing too. WRP.  \n\n\n**Moha The Herbal Nail Care Cream**: The cream definitely helped in smoothening out the cracks in my cuticles and also gave a very nice shine to my nails. It works really well as a hand cream too. It has really made a difference in the smoothness of my hands. It does have a strong fragrance and hence I'm trying to find a better alternative, WNRP.  \n\n\n**Khadi Natural Milk & Saffron Hand Cream**: This one surprised me. It's so creamy and hydrating it almost feels like putting fresh cream on your hands. Smells amazing too and is affordable! WRP.  \n\n\n**Khadi Natural Jasmine and Green Tea Herbal Foot Crack Cream**: Similar to the hand cream, this foot cream works really well and keeps the feet really soft. It did help in healing my mother's foot cracks too! So creamy and nourishing, WRP.  \n\n\n**Nivea Hand Cream, Refreshing Glycerin & Aloe Vera**: One of the most affordable hand creams in the market. Works really well and keeps the hands soft, but sometimes do need reapplication. WRP since it works well for its cost.  \n\n\n• Deos and Perfumes   \n\n\n**Nivea Deodorant (Fresh Natural)**: It does its job really well, leaves me smelling fresh for a quite long time and isn't overpowering or extremely heavy on the skin. It's extremely affordable and hasn't caused me any irritation or problems. However, I want to move towards using non-alcohol deodorants, hence WNRP.  \n\n\n**Fab India Warm Amber Body Spray**: I've been using these body sprays for quite some years now and I really enjoy them. They do have alcohol but I mostly spray these over my clothes. They last for a couple of hours and come in some great fragrances. WRP, but in a different scent, didn't enjoy this one too much.  \n\n\n**Nivea Whitening Smooth Skin Deodorant Roll-on**: I've been using this on a daily basis and am quite enjoying this. It doesn't have a strong scent, yet leaves me smelling pleasant and fresh and keeps odor at bay. I haven't seen any whitening effects but not too bothered about that. It's a nice basic everyday deo, WRP.  \n\n\n**Miniso Perfume: Dear**: I love the fruity and sweet scent of this. It surprisingly stays for quite a long time and is super affordable. WRP and try out the other variants available!  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had a lot of fun reviewing these products and contributing to this amazing community. Happy New Year to everyone :)",

    "body": "I recently asked Marbas for help with healing for my girlfriend, who's suffering a lot right now from what appears to be some kind of neurological pain disorder and having a lot of trouble getting effective treatment. Since my girlfriend is long-distance, it's really difficult for me to do much of anything to help her from where I am, which is why I reached out to Marbas for help. Marbas (who I refer to with feminine pronouns; to me, she appears very visually masculine, but has a feminine voice, and said that \"she/her\" works for her) instructed me in the process of creating a sigil that I could send to my girlfriend to help her. Since Marbas said that the best way to honor her is to \"spread healing,\" I decided to share the technique she taught me so others can try it out. \n\nThe sigil should be Marbas' sigil, drawn on paper or parchment in gold ink, with details in silver ink. (I used the Lemegeton version, but if you have a sigil for Marbas you prefer, I think that would work fine.) The sigil should have a circle around it \"to focus and localize the energy.\" \n\n[Here's the one that I ended up making.](https://imgur.com/a/09U1fT8) It's not necessary to reproduce the curlicues in the way I did them, but more just to add some form of decoration/ ornamentation in silver to give yourself a chance to concentrate on the sigil for longer and focus your intent on it.\n\nThe sigil should then be \"adorned/anointed\" with lavender and camphor. You can also use eucalyptus and mint to supplement those, to enhance their effects and synergy. I didn't have camphor oil on hand, so I used lavender oil, eucalyptus oil, and fresh mint from my apartment's mint garden, and ordered my girlfriend a bottle of camphor oil so she could add it when she got the sigil and also use the rest of the camphor oil for her joint paint. I added the oils one by one to a scrap piece of parchment, dabbing each oil gently onto the back of the sigil, so as not to smear the ink. I then crushed the mint leaf in my fingers to release the natural oils and smeared it on the back.\n\nMarbas instructed me to have my girlfriend sleep with the sigil tucked under her pillow/in her pillowcase. It can be kept in a plastic bag if you're concerned about allergies interacting with the oils, because the oils are just there to enhance its energy. \n\nI sealed up the sigil in a plastic bag and put it inside a greeting card to send to her. I asked my patron, Belial, to recommend a demon to me to help get it delivered speedily, because the post office has had a lot of delays after all that it's been through. He suggested I contact Forneus; I was confused at first, but he said that Forneus' powers over communication also cover communication by mail. \n\nI don't really remember much of what happened when I got in contact with Forneus because I was in a really bad state of fatigue at the time, but I have a general impression of the interaction going well and being successful. My request was definitely granted, and the card made its way to my girlfriend speedily. \n\nSo, hail Forneus for coming through so well, even when I was making what I'm sure was a very tired and fumbling request! Hail Marbas for the gift of knowledge of healing techniques!\n\nI hope this is useful! If you do try to make a sigil like this, please let me know how it goes. I would suggest wearing gloves if you think you might get the essential oils on your skin while you make it, because they can be irritating to the skin when they're not diluted and can even cause you to become sensitized to the ingredients.\n\n**EDIT:** I forgot to mention this when writing up the guide, but realized later that I should have added it in case people have trouble accessing the materials. Marbas implied to me that I didn't need to use pure essential oils, but could use products that contain the necessary ingredients-- even synthetic ones, such as Vicks Vaporub or related products with synthetic camphor. This might be useful if you can't get your hands on camphor oil, which can be hard to find, and means that you can hopefully find all the ingredients you need at a drug store-- I was able to get gold and silver Sharpies and a set of essential oils containing lavender, mint, and eucalyptus oil at Rite Aid, and they also sell Vicks products. You can use regular paper or cardstock instead of parchment.\n\nIf you can't afford any ingredient or can't get out of the house to acquire them, you can always visualize using the needed ingredients and manifest their effects with your Will. This takes a lot more energy and concentration than using physical ingredients, but it allows for more flexibility if you have limitations on material goods!",

    "body": "After lurking on this forum for quite a while and constantly seeing everyone rave about how much better DE razors were than cartridge razors I was a little confused as I could always manage to get a great shave with a cartridge razor. I was struggling to justify the cost of initially buying a DE shaving kit, but in a haze of drunkeness decided to bite the bullet! (one of my rather excellent drunken decisions may I add!) \n\nA few days later I received my kit from amazon. As I was a newbie I tried to go on recommendations from this forum and also on some reviews from amazon. \n\nI settled on an Edwin Jagger DE89BL as this always seemed to pop up as one of the best beginner razors. For razor blades I got a sampler pack with a few different brands. As my area has hard water I opted to get a shaving cream rather than soap and went for Proraso's tubed creme (I think it is menthol and eucalyptus oil), as well as the pre shaving creme in the same range. For a brush I opted for a Best Badger Edwin Jagger brush again based on some reviews in various places.\n\nFor my first shave I used Astra Stainless blades which came in the sampler pack (rather than the derby's which come with the razor). Again all I can say was WOW! Whilst I feel the shave maybe wasnt quite as close (I missed out my usual ATG pass as I think I need to practice my technique a little more before I go for that!) my skin felt far better during and after it! When using a cartridge razor I often got alot of tugging around my chin area, this was non existent with the DE. My skin was usually a little sensitive to touch for maybe an hour or two after shaving but with the DE it was only a matter on minutes! ( Although with a few additional nicks which I am sure go down to poor technique and not a great lather!)\n\nI think within a few weeks once I am a little more comfortable with my technique and once I have improved my lather I will attempted and against the grain pass however for now I am certainly happy I decided to make the switch! Whist I already really enjoyed the cartridge shaving ( I find shaving really therapeutic) I feel this has already added another dimension!\n\nSo on that I would like to thank everyone on wicked_edge for there advice on equipment and technique! Its all great so keep it up guys! Another Cartridge user has well and truly been converted!",

By keeping the brand of blade constant, variation from shave to shave is (probably) due to prep and technique, so you can focus more on perfecting those by not changing the razor or brand of blade. Also, after two months, you'll *really* know what that brand of blade feels like so when you try a new brand the differences are highlighted. \n\nI strongly recommend that you try a [distilled water shave](http://sharpologist.com/2011/10/the-distilled-water-shave.html). You may feel that it's not worth doing, but of course that's exactly why you try it: to see what difference it makes. (Exactly the reason you tried DE shaving, for that matter: you felt skeptical but you were willing to try it anyway, and it turned out that your prediction of the experience was not at all what the experience was like---a very good lesson in itself: most people are horrible at predicting accurately whether or not they'll like something they've not tried.)\n\nWith a little distilled water then on hand, try a shaving soap. Again, you may be surprised. Here's how I [make lather](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/vuzqy/so_wicked_edge_do_you_prefer_to_lather_in_a_bowl/c57wqt2), and I recommend that you make a series of practice lathers using the technique to gain experience quickly. Play with brush speed, brush pressure, and how much you load once you see microscopic bubbles. But do try the exact procedure before trying modifications. \n\nVery wise to hold off on ATG until you are good at WTG and XTG. Once you really understand angle and pressure and what you're going for when you hold the razor and shave, then introduce ATG gradually, beginning on cheeks and sideburn area, where it's easy. Gradually extend the amount shaved ATG (but skip any areas in which you tend to get ingrowns).\n\nAvoid [the four most common mistakes cartridge shavers make](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/15eqbh/my_so_got_me_a_starter_kit/c7lz76u) when switching to a DE razor.",

    "body": "The whole diacetyl issue shouldn't be too much of a concern anymore. It was a couple of years ago when most (if not all) of the flavoring companies were using it. You see, it provides an excellent buttery flavor. If you have ever had microwave popcorn, you know the flavor. Interestingly, employees at microwave popcorn factories were showing symptoms of a condition later called \"Popcorn Lung\", caused by direct inhalation of large amounts of diacetyl over a long period of time. Since you are asking about it, you probably know that already.\n\nObviously, a chemical that can do that has no place in e-juice, even if the quantities are so minute that they would probably never present a problem. Back in 2009 before this became a concern, we used flavorings that contained diacetyl (just like everyone else), but most of the flavoring companies (all of the ones we use) removed diacetyl in favor of acetoin. Acetoin was an acceptable replacement for diacetyl in regard to flavor, and does not cause Popcorn Lung. I know some non-American flavoring companies took longer to convert, and I'm not even sure all of them did. We only use American made flavorings, so I'm sorry but I do not have much knowledge about the foreign ones. If there are actually any vendors that still have diacetyl in their juices, there would be a couple of things to remember: First, if they do have it they probably don't know, or haven't even heard of it, so you may not actually find out. Second, if they tell you that they DO contain diacetyl, they clearly have no idea what is safe for e-juice and what isn't or they just don't care. That leads me to the third thing. If you suspect that a vendor is using flavorings with diacetyl, don't use them. The fact that you are asking is good, although like I say, you would probably actually have a hard time finding anyone that has it these days. \n\nSo, to answer your question simply, no, our flavorings do not contain diacetyl. You can even vape our straight Butter flavor to your hearts content without the worry of diacetyl! Thanks for doing your homework though. The next thing you land on might be regarding oil based flavorings. That is a more recent topic, maybe about a year old or so now. I never heard any resolution on this one though. It is theorized that the oils can be difficult for the lungs to metabolize, causing a build up of it inside the lungs. I have absolutely no idea if this is true or not. However, it became a bit of a hot topic for awhile, so we took a look at our flavorings. We found maybe a half a dozen flavors that used oil based flavorings instead of water based, and we decided to immediately remove those flavors from our menu just in case. Unfortunate because the Lemonade flavor we had was the bomb! We do still have some eucalyptus flavors which contain eucalyptus oil. It is a very tiny amount (super strong flavoring), and we have a clear warning in the product description for those who are concerned about oils. Plus, eucalyptus oil is a bit different from some of the other oils used in flavorings, and it has been used as an inhalant, possibly for thousands of years. \n\nSo how's that for a long answer? We have been at this for awhile now, and it is clear that sometimes discoveries are made about ingredients. Since we are all sort of the pioneers of vaping, this is an inevitable consequence. I like to think of it as we are sacrificing for future vapers! Nevertheless, when these things come up we evaluate our products to eliminate anything that could potentially cause harm. I would say I hope this answers your question, but I'm pretty sure you found the answer buried up there somewhere! Thanks for contacting us.",

Merril and I are both musicians, and we celebrated Valentine's Day on the road, playing a run of shows up through Chicago and back home. The kids have had back to back snow days, and the washer and dryer are full of sledding clothes. These are the good days, y'all. Hope everyone is well!\n\nNow, for the weekly beard education post!\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnless you're some kind of Adonis, or a full blown beard model, chances are your beard isn't completely perfect. Almost every single beard has at least one weak spot, an issue, or something that could be better. Maybe you’ve got a patchy area that won’t fill in, your beard is wiry and uncooperative, or you're shedding a ton of hair. In any of these cases, you’re not alone. Every beard has something. The trick is figuring out what’s causing the issue and addressing it with proper knowledge.\n\nLet’s break down some of the most common issues dudes come to these subs looking to address.\n\n**Patchy Areas That Won’t Fill In**\n\nThis is one of the most common early beard struggles, and it’s also one of the main reasons guys give up early and shave it off. You get stoked about growing a beard, and as it starts coming in, you notice holes, hairless spots, and parts that don't connect.  This makes you feel a bit insecure, and makes the beard look messy. You might lose hope that it will ever fill in.\n\nThe cause:  Sometimes this is just a timing issue. In the early stages of growth, patchiness is fairly common. Some parts of your face have fewer follicles than others, and some follicles take longer to activate, or grow at different speeds. Later in the journey, you might deal with issues like inflammation or lack of proper hydration that can slow growth and diminish follicle function.\n\nNote: A big mistake guys make is shaving to \"make it grow thicker.\" This doesn't work. It's a myth. Your beard will keep growing in the same way no matter how many times you shave it off.\n\nHow to fix it:\n\nGive it time. Some beards just take longer to fill in than others.\n\nDevelop and practice a good skincare routine. Wash your face daily with a gentle cleanser. Avoid harsh soaps.\n\nIncrease blood flow to the skin to activate follicles and keep them working at their best. This is done through exfoliation and vasodilation. An exfoliator brush and a gentle scrub is invaluable. A firm boar bristle brush performs \"scritching\", which clears pores and brings blood to the surface of the skin. Common vasodilators are peppermint oil, rosemary oil, cinnamon bark oil, ginger oil, eucalyptus oil, clove bud oil, black pepper oil, castor oil, avocado oil, grapeseed oil, MSM, and vitamin B12.\n\nMany beard oils, combined with a good skincare routine, can eliminate inflammation AND increase blood flow to the follicle, while also supporting their function.\n\nReducing inflammation removes the roadblock. Increasing blood flow steps on the gas. This dual approach ensures that the whole beard, including the patchy areas, grows at its best. You'll see this start to fill in as quickly as genetically possible.\n\n**Wild, Wavy, and Uncooperative Beard Hair**\n\nWe see this every single day. One side grows up, the other side grows down, and the middle grows sideways. There's a whole ocean worth of waves in the center, and a split down the middle. This is where a lot of guys start thinking they just have a bad beard when really, they just have an untamed one.\n\nSome beards naturally grow in straight and lay easily and uniformly, but for most of us, the beard has a mind of its own.\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes you can make in this case is trying to fight against these types of issues with force. Using heat or waxes to force your beard to lay a certain way is unlikely to work, and is likely only going to create more problems.\n\nHair that grows in wild has all sorts of names, depending on the pattern. Vertical growth, reverse growth, upward grain, against the grain, whorls, cowlicks, swirls, vortex growth, helical growth. So many terms for hair that just doesn't do what it should.\n\nHow to fix it:\n\nThe best thing you can do to address this is start by relaxing the hair. We talked in the last section about the keratinized scales on the cuticle of the hair. When they're standing, the hair is TOUGH to maintain. It goes every which way, it's wiry, it's brittle, and it can bend wherever it wants to go.\n\nA beard oil rich in penetrating fatty acids will smooth down the cuticle layers, absorb into the cortex, soften and relax the hair to increase ease of maintenance quickly. Then, you begin mechanical training. Just like you brush your hair to train a part into it, or to \"teach\" it to lay a certain way, you comb and brush your beard daily to establish new normal patterns. When your hair starts to adapt to these new patterns, THEN you can incorporate balm or butter to reinforce your training. Balms that contain lanolin or pine tar are extra helpful in training.\n\nAvoid the urge to trim to cut out problem spots. Let it grow longer. More length = more weight = more control.\n\nit takes patience and consistency, but you can establish a healthy, relaxed uniform beard with regular care!\n\n**Stalled Growth Or Constant Shedding**\n\nA lot of guys hit a wall where their beard just stops getting longer. Sometimes that’s terminal length, meaning that’s just how long your beard is genetically programmed to grow. But most of the time, the hair is just breaking as fast as it’s growing.\n\nPoor circulation, lack of nutrients, and even rancid beard oils can slow down follicle activity. If your beard has stayed the same length for months, it’s likely not because it won’t grow, but because something is interfering.\n\nA bit of shedding is normal, but an over excess of shedding is caused by the same things that stall growth. A healthy follicle anchors the hair properly and will hold onto it for a full cycle. But if the follicle is weak or inflamed, it will often push the hair bulb out and shut down.\n\nHow to fix it:\n\nMake sure your beard oil is fresh. Rancid oils increase breakage and shut down follicles.\n\nUse oils and supplement sprays with castor oil and sulfur donors (like MSM) to strengthen follicles and reinforce their function.\n\nBe gentle when brushing. Ripping through tangles can cause unnecessary hair loss.\n\nUse good beard oil to impart nutrients that increase the strength of the hair to reduce breakage.\n\nTrim split ends, avoid over-washing, and don't use too much beard product. Stick to non-comedogenic oils and pay attention to your skin for signs of clogged pores and inflammation.\n\nEXFOLIATE. VASODILATE. HYDRATE.\n\nEliminate all the things that stall growth and reduce follicular function and you can easily overcome the stall, reduce shedding, and get back to growth. Also make sure to believe in yourself REAL hard. It helps.\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nEvery beard has some kind of issue. You are far from alone with yours. Stop stressing about it and trying to force your beard to behave a certain way. Instead, take a deep breath and figure out what it actually needs.\n\nPatchy cheeks? *Activate dormant follicles.*\n\nUnruly growth? *Work with your beard, not against it.*\n\nStalled growth? *It’s breaking as fast as it’s growing.*\n\nShedding? *Your follicles are not getting what they need.*\n\nMost beard problems aren’t genetic curses at all. They’re just signs that your beard needs better care. Now go fix it!\n\nBeard strong, y'all!\n\n\\-Brad",

    "body": "Hey ScA! I recently lapsed on my skincare routine, so I decided that I should do a review of my main products as I add them back into my routine. This review will be mainly overall experience, with some recent insights. I have more products that I have used in the past, but I decided to only review ones I have a lot of experience with so far. The only product I don't have reviewed from my routine is the Advanced Retinoid - as I just reintroduced that back into my routine in the last week.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**My current routine:**\n\n*AM*\n\n1.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n2.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n3.\tTO Niacinamide over whole face\n4.\tApply TO Caffeine to under eye\n5.\tFormula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free moisturizer over whole face\n6.\tIf using sunscreen, use Etude House Sunprise\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*PM*\n\n1.\tIf wearing makeup, I use baby oil to remove\n2.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n3.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n4.\tPaula’s Choice 2% BHA Gel to whole face – wait ~20 mins to sink in\n5.\tTO Retinoid Advanced Retinoid 2% over whole face\n6.\tMoisturize with Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Info about my skin/general experience trying out products:**\n\n* VERY oily t-zone, normal cheeks, normal-to-dry jaw line and around mouth; light-to-medium skin tone\n* VERY VERY CC-prone, mainly on my forehead (some on chin). This is mainly due to not being consistent with my routine (especially simply washing my face with a cleanser, which is the minimum I need). This can also occur from moisturizer.\n* No issues with acne, except a few whiteheads around my menstrual cycle\n* Most cleansers I have tried are either a) not strong enough or b) too strong\n* Main skin concerns: Oil control, reducing appearance of giant nose pores, preventing CCs, even skin tone, healthy aging\n* Slowly trying to reduce the number of products I use for all the things (not just skin care) that contain fragrances\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser](https://imgur.com/a/uAvebDj)\n\n***Product Type:*** Cleanser; specifically purchased because it is **sulfate free** (my body hates sulfates)\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Juice, Coco-Betaine, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Peg-50 Shea Butter, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Lycium Barbarum Fruit Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Morinda Citrifolia Fruit Extract, Punica Granatum Juice Extract, Garcinia Mangostana Fruit Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Fragrance, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Benzoic Acid, Sorbic Acid, Red 33\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance free**; **Sulfate free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; AM: use with konjac sponge; Fragrance is actually pleasant, doesn’t linger; consistency starts off creamy, but foams very easily\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is amazing, and has been a major game-changer for me when it comes to cleansers. I’ve never found a cleanser that worked long-term before this one. A little goes a long way with this stuff – it is a very efficient clean. My face feels so soft afterwards. While it is strong enough to get rid of all my oil, it’s not so harsh that it makes my skin tight.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** In terms of function, none that I can think of. Only downfall (IMO) is it is not fragrance-free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4.5/5 stars, I’ve gone through over 4-5 bottles of this stuff and I will keep it in rotation until I can find a functionally similar product that is fragrance-free\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Thayer’s Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner](https://imgur.com/a/OwCREGs)\n\n***Product Type:*** Toner; purchased because of how many people liked it on ScA\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~0.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Purified Water, Certified Organic Witch Hazel Ext Blend (Hamamelis Virginiana Extract (Witch Hazel*), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (Filet of Aloe Vera*)), Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Water, Fragrance (Natural Rose), Citric Acid, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Seed Extract\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** ***Not fragrance-free***; Liquid consistency; potentially irritating, depending on your skins relationship with witch hazel\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Despite the smell (see below), this stuff works pretty well. I always feel like this enhances my *clean* feel following my cleanse, but it also leaves my skin feeling refreshed and moisturized. I always follow-up with moisturizer, but I can definitely tell when I don’t use it, especially in my dry areas.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** **I HATE THE SMELL OF THIS STUFF!** Come to find out, I hate the smell of roses (I’m weird, I know…) but seriously. This stuff smells like a rose pooped in some water and then sold it on the side of the road on a hot sunny day. It’s terrible. If you are remotely disinterested in the smell of rose, do not buy this.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5 due to smell. Will repurchase the fragrance-free version in the future\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%](https://imgur.com/a/Tuo5otO)\n\n***Product Type:*** Purchased to reduce redness/even skin tone and to control oil; side-benefits: helps prevent CCs\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mild medicinal smell**, doesn’t linger; Somewhat-sticky consistency; Absorbs quickly\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** I keep this in rotation mainly because it helps control my oil. Even if I use this stuff without my mattifying moisturizer, it helps prevent the massive amounts of oil that my skin normally produces. It helps keep my skin an even texture and tone, as well. I’m not 100% sure if this is solely responsible for preventing my CC (doubt it, since I use BHA), but I’m almost certain it’s contributing at the least. This product has been one that I have been most consistent with besides my cleanser and what little redness I sometimes develop (mainly due to allergies or weather) has been under control.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Functionally, none. This stuff does what it’s supposed to. I just hate the dropper packaging, personally, of most TO products. It’s hard to get the little bits out of the bottom!!\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, have repurchased 2+ times; will be replacing with skinlex’s version to avoid buying more products from Deciem.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG](https://imgur.com/a/roT93Vy)\n\n***Product Type:*** Active for reducing appearance of eye contour pigmentation\n\n***Cost:*** **$* - ~$7.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Caffeine, Maltodextrin, Glycerin, Propanediol, Epigallocatechin Gallatyl Glucoside, Gallyl Glucoside, Hyaluronic Acid, Oxidized Glutathione, Melanin, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Seed Extract, Urea, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Xanthan gum, Lactic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Propyl Gallate, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Benzyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; Watery-to-thick consistency (from the glycerin, probably); no noticeable smell; yellow-ish in color\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I’ve been using this stuff for a little over a year, and honestly it does absolutely nothing for my eye contour. I don’t have much puffiness, but I do have decent enough under eye darkness where I wanted something to help. This does not. It does help reduce the appearance with some small, visible blood vessels around my nose, but it’s only a temporary effect thereby reducing redness. \n\n***Bad stuff:*** It doesn’t really work for what I wanted it to work for.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 1/5, WNRP.\n\n*Does anyone have any suggestions of what I can do with what I have leftover? I’d love to use it for something else if it’s functional!*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free Mattifying Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/rQeCSUV)\n\n***Product Type:*** Daytime moisturizer; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Propylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethicone, Ceteareth-20, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Silica Silylate, Behenyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Salicylic Acid, Panthenol, Fragrance, Boron Nitride, Bambusa Arundinacea (Bamboo) Stem Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Maltodextrin, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance-free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; very thick consistency; absorbs quickly; powdery/soft finish\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** Another game-changer with my oily skin. Using this moisturizer during the day saves my face from producing oil. Even if I sweat a little bit, it controls oil. Normally, without it, I’ll start producing oil within a few hours of cleansing. If I use this moisturizer, I’m relatively oil-free all day, except around my nostrils. This is also a strong enough moisturizer to keep my dryness at bay, even during the wintertime (and where I live gets very cold during the winter).\n\n***Bad stuff:*** The smell is pretty bad (probably the bamboo), but honestly I get used to it and the smell goes away quickly. My friend said it smells like wet dog... haha but I don't notice it anymore since I've been using it for so long.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, only because it’s not fragrance-free. Will continue to repurchase until I can find a fragrance-free alternative.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish Sun Milk SPF50+/PA+++](https://imgur.com/a/kXZLXCa)\n\n***Product Type:*** Sunscreen; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.40 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dipropylene Glycol, Titanium Dioxide, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Viscum Album (Mistletoe) Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Carex Humillis Root Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Pinus Sylvestris Leaf Oil, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Malpighia Emarginata (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract, Echium Plantagineum Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Peg-10 Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Magnesium Sulfate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Methicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Aluminum Hydroxide, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Octyldodecanol, Dimethicone, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate, Polyglyceryl-6 Polyricinoleate, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Butylene Glycol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Cellulose Gum\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mineral sunscreen**; **Not fragrance-free**; **Mild whitecast**, but absorbs well; **Drying**; mattifying/oil-control like a boss; pleasant scent; not waterproof\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Due to drying my skin out, I only use this product when I have to. I don’t wear SPF most days (work inside, very little exposure to sun during the day), but I do wear this when I’m running errands and/or trying to control my oil more than I can with the moisturizer mentioned previously. This stuff works really well to control oil – the best of any product I’ve tried so far. Wears well under makeup, as long as my dry skin is kept controlled. Some minor white cast, but with my skin it absorbs and isn’t visible (even when I’m tanner) – but may not be the same on someone with a darker than medium skin tone.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** This product is very drying. It works SO WELL on controlling oil, but it zaps any amount of moisture out of my dry spots. To the point where I have to counteract the dryness in my PM routine. Do not recommend for people with sensitive skin, or dry skin.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 3/5, due to drying and not being fragrance-free; Will continue to repurchase until I find an alternative that controls my oil as well as this does, if ever.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Paula’s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Gel Exfoliant](https://imgur.com/a/X9YEexN)\n\n***Product Type:*** Chemical exfoliant; meant to prevent/reduce CCs and help with overall skin texture\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$8.80 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, (hydration), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Phytosphingosine (skin-renewing), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Vitis Vinifera Seed Extract (grape extract/antioxidant), Camellia Sinensis Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (green tea/antioxidant) Epilobium Angustifolium Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (willow herb/skin-soothing), Bisabolol (skin-soothing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH-adjusting), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; **BHA**; thick consistency, absorbs slowly\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is AMAZING! It attacks any signs of CCs overnight, and can easily clear my CC-prone forehead within a day or two. I use it almost every day as a preventative. My face has been noticeably clearer and smoother thanks to this product. Also, it visibly reduces the appearances of pores - this combined with the retinol I use has been an amazing in reducing their appearance.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Smells chemical, so may be off-putting to some people. Absorbs slowly, so you should leave room in your routine for that.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, WRP. I am going to be trying to the liquid version (I got it on sale), but if this works better for me over the liquid I will come back to it\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/BDGVfpd)\n\n***Product Type:*** PM moisturizer; light-weight\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$9.50 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Dimethicone/vinyl Dimenticone Crosspolymer, Phenoxyethaqnol, Polyacrylamide, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Dimethiconol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Laureth-7, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, C12-14 Pareth -12, Sodium Hydroxide, Blue 1\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **NOT Fragrance-free**; **Contains silicones**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; **Contains hyaluronic acid**; Very light-weight moisturizer.\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I love this product. It was the first moisturizer I tried when I embarked on my skincare journey, and I am so thankful I found it. This is the first moisturizer I used every in my life that didn’t break me out or lead to a forehead full of CCs. I’m in love with this stuff! It is light enough for my super oily spots (which is not due to being dry, it’s just oily…) and is strong enough for my dry spots. In the winter I use a little extra HA serum over my whole face and it works like a charm. I’ve been dabbling with some oils as well, but so far I haven’t found it necessary in the summer because this moisturizer works so well!\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Nothing, just that it’s not fragrance free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, because of fragrance. Will continue to RP until I can find an alternative that I can afford and is fragrance free.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading, everyone! I hope this is helpful, as I use some products that you don't see a lot around here (as well as some you do...). This is definitely a more simplified version of my routine, but that may be a good thing, as I'm noticing the same effects as to what I was seeing before despite reducing the number of products I use!",

    "body": "A bit of a long read, but hopefully worth it to others...we all know how this can cripple every aspect of our lives.\n\nI joined the community a week or so back.  A little back story...I always could \"taste\" my breath, or always had that thick, dry feeling in my mouth, and my tongue would develop a white coating.  Nothing worked...like probably all of us, I was obsessed with the hygiene, brushing 2-3 times a day, using a baking soda and peroxide paste, cleaning the tongue, water-piks every time I brushed...the messed up part is, the stigma is, if someone has bad breath, it's from poor hygiene,  yet most of us are fanatical about trying just about everything.  Nothing worked.\n\nI initially came across a post from Thinkbig202 (if I got that wrong, I apologize), and his/her story.  They mentioned another post from Napolean7.  All credit goes to them, and others that might have passed it on.\n\nThey mentioned Dr. Bronners unscented castile soap, liquid chlorophyll, and different oils.  I don't know the science behind it (carrier oils, essential oils, etc), but had nothing to lose at this point, it was worth a try.  You can buy this stuff online, but if you have a health food store or Whole Foods around you, you can probably get this there.  I went to the local health store place and tbey had it all there.\n\nI bought Dr. Bronners castile soap (I'm an idiot, I saw a bar of it saying just that, and bought it, thinking you just rub the bristles of the toothbrush on it), went back the next day to get the same stuff but in the liquid form in a bottle (it's pretty cheap too).  Thinkbig202 used Jojoba oil (said this is the carrier), and frankincense, peppermint, and eucalyptus oils (essential oils).  They didn't have frankincense in stocks so I bought tea tree, so all the ingredients are ~ \n\n• Dr. Bronners unscented castile soap in liquid form\n\n• jojoba oil (carrier)\n• eucalyptus oil (essential)\n• peppermint oil (essential)\n• tea tree oil (essential)\n\nThe liquid chlorophyll Napolean suggested, I don't know...I've been mixing a tablespoon of it with a glass of water and drinking it, because it cleanses the body.  It's the same stuff that comes from plants, which makes sense, because my cats and dog chew on grass to clean their systems, but the real difference was below...\n\nSTEP 1.\n\nI mix the castile soap with baking soda until it's a paste, than brush my mouth and tongue with it.  One lesson I learned on day 2, dilute the soap a little with water.  I made the mistake of thinking more is better, so after brushing with the paste, added more soap to liquefy it and swish it in my mouth.  Bad move.  Too much, or not diluted can leave a burning or stinging feeling on your tongue.\n\nSTEP 2.\n\nScrap the tongue and brush with regular toothpaste.  When you scrap the tongue, you can actually see mucous/phlegm on the brush and when you spit it out.  I don't know if the soap \"kills\" what's in there, or just \"catches\" it and you spit it out. \n\nSTEP 3.\n\nIn a small cup, mix a little mouthwash (you can use anything you like, I don't think the ones with alcohol are good, they'll dry your mouth out more).  I use Biotene because it seems to moisturize my mouth.  Mix a cap of the mouth wash with about a tablespoon of jojoba oil, 6-8 drops of eucalyptus oil, 3-4 drops of peppermint oil, 5-6 drops of frankincense oil (I use tea tree), I'm not sure it matters that much.\n\nA HUGE difference in a matter of days.  My mouth feels so much better, natural saliva, not dry mouth...my tongue is bright pink again and doesn't get coated as much, or at all during the day.  When I did the lick test on the wrist before, or the spoon test, it smell like vinegar or sulfer...now when I do it, it hardly has any smell, or no smell at all.  I drive semi's, so the other day I did this before hitting the road.  I had a piece of gum in the truck.  3-4 hours later, I did the lick wrist test in my truck it smelled like the peppermint gum...this was HOURS after doing it.\n\nI'm skeptical too...I always think \"it's probablya scam\", than I realized, nobody is selling anything...these are all natural ingredients you can find online or at any health food store...IT WORKS!!!!....for the first time in 15 years, I feel like I have control over it.   The cool thing also was, (sorry about this, lol), I cleared my nose by blowing it in the shower, and smelled/tasted the scents from the oils in my naval cavity.  I don't know anything about biofilms, or any of that stuff, but did enough reading over the years to know some kind of unbalanced \"good bacteria/bad bacteria\" in the mouth can lead to a lot of problems for us...maybe it's as simple as breaking down the biofilm and letting the oils keep balance in our mouths?  I don't care if I ever understand it, all I know is, for me, it works.  I'd suggest giving it a try if you haven't already...I know what it's like and how others feel...the depression, the isolation...it's a sh*tty way to go through life...it can be crippling.\n\n2 other minor things I did...started eating lots of yogurt.  I read yogurt helps promote healthy bacteria in the mouth.\n\nSwitched from coffee to green tea (this one wasn't easy, being a truck driver).  The coffee always left a coating on my tongue.  I read the green tea also helps promote good bacteria.\n\nAny other questions, please ask.\n\nThank you Thinkbig202, Napolean7, and others for posting their success stories and sharing them...much love ❤️\n\nEdit: I'll answer any questions, but I want to make clear, because some people seem to be attacking me, I DON'T WANT ANYTHING, I AM NOT PROMOTING ANYYHING, I HAVE NOTHING TO GAIN HERE.  You can pick up the stuff you need from a health store or online...I have no benefit here other than I know what it's like living with this, so if it helps others, that's all I want.  Keep the BS to yourself if you're gonna attack me.",

What I’m doing right now is using my essential oil mix in the morning and then the iodine at night. Since I changed up my routine, I had some bb come back, but it does seem like it’s slowly eliminating all of the bad bacteria better than my treatment. I’m hoping this will fully cure me so I don’t have to do these lengthy routines anymore. I’m going to try this out for 2-3 weeks and see how it goes. If it doesn’t work, then I’ll be going back to my original routine.",

    "body": "Hello r/mangacollectors community and welcome to my guide on how to take care of and restore your own manga collection. This is a multi part series of posts that I will be posting in this community. I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MangaCollectors/comments/d47jc4/kintsugi_and_manga_repairing_and_restoring_used/) a few weeks ago where I shared my hobby of buying used manga, restoring them, and giving them a second life. This is based on the Japanese idea of Kintsugi. In this guide, I'm going to talk to you today about how to clean the front, spine, and back cover of your Manga volumes. Keep in mind, this technique is something that I personally use on manga that I own or have been paid to restore. If you wish to clean your own collection, you are willing to do it **at your own risk.** \n\nWith that said however, I have not damaged a single book in the process. This method has only been used on glossy and matte covered books in the english language (North America). If you are concerned about your books, be sure to spot test before using any products on them.\n \n#**The Process**\n\nTo have a little look at how cleaning works check out this imgur album -> [CLICK HERE](https://imgur.com/a/zhZ3kOy)\n\n**For removing stickers and labels:**\n\n1. Remove all labels using your fingers, a peeler, or whatever is your preferred method.  \n2. Often the sticker itself will break and will become harder to remove. Even after removing the sticker there's may still be glue residue. For this reason, I suggest using peppermint oil to remove the residue while also cleaning the surface of the book. Peppermint oil is quite harsh, but is a welcome choice over other oil products and especially products like Goo-gone which, imo, will damage your books and are not the best chemical products to use. A drop or two of peppermint oil is more than enough. If you do not have peppermint oil you can use eucalyptus oil or tea tree oil, both of which are effective, but you will need to use more of it.\n3. After applying the peppermint oil onto the surface of the book using a Q-tip you can do the following: Remove residue in a circular motion and break down any bits of glue. Or, you can leave the peppermint on labels or stickers for an hour or two. This will breakdown the glue layer underneath, making it easier to peel the sticker label.\n4. Repeat with this method as necessary to remove the labels. It's a meditative process, so be patient.\n5. Wait about 24 hours before placing your cleaned books back with your other books. This is to prevent any potential damage to your other books from direct contact. \n\n**For cleaning:**\n\n1. Follow the same principles as before. \n2. Apply oil to the surface of your books. \n3. Using a cloth, Q-tip, or paper towel rub the oil over the surface. Get into areas that are especially dirty. \n4. A little goes a long way. Use a drop or two at a time to clean your books.\n5. Sometimes oils just don't work (especially on glossy covers). You may have some caked on chocolate or god knows what some people eat around their manga. You can use a solution of Windex on these types of books to clean them. Not recommended for matte covers.\n\nAnyways, that about cover's how I \"clean\" the surfaces of my manga. Again, I have not had any problems with this method, and all of my customers have been happy with the manga they purchase from me that have been restored. Hope it helps, and I will edit this post in the future with a full video on the cleaning process (Hopefully to restore an absolutely gross book).",

Barrister and Mann, Chiseled Face Groomatorium, Declaration Grooming, Noble Otter, Oleo, Siliski, Southern Witchcrafts, Summer Break, Wholly Kaw.  All that.\n\nIn fact, one could make the argument that the biggest differentiator between this specific community and [other online wetshaving communities](https://www.badgerandblade.com/forum/threads/your-3-favorite-soaps-2019.579118/page-3#post-10492168) is the brand loyalty that r/wetshaving has for its artisans. This brand loyalty phenomenon has been discussed and analyzed much over the years here and [other forums](https://old.reddit.com/r/curatedshaveforum/comments/ex8jii/users_of_forum_discuss_pricing_on_forum_which_has/fgc4e1v/?context=3) with a range of opinions on the cause and effect: [consumerism run amok, plain and simple](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/f9yqbj/titans_of_wetshaving_history_charles_roberts/fj3b6wk/) OR [a natural consequence of gravitating toward communities where your experiences more closely mirror the other users there](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/e20yu6/do_fanboys_impact_your_purchasing_decisions/f8t14q7/) OR [a blessing, but mostly a curse for the artisans themselves](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/e20yu6/do_fanboys_impact_your_purchasing_decisions/f8uc2aq/) OR [toxic fanboyism and fundamentally unfair to those artisans that aren't considered reddit house brands](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/7p6jn2/dealsnew_products_tuesday_jan_09_2018/dsj9ill/).\n\nWhatever the reasons and consquences for the brand loyalty/fanboyism, one thing's for certain: if you come to r/wetshaving to read product reviews, [you're reading at least 90 percent artisan product reviews.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3AReview)\n\nMy opinion is that is a good thing on balance. Fanboyism aside, I think, objectively speaking, soap artisans are doing the most interesting and novel things in wetshaving, and that's notable and *should* be noted by reviews and discussions. In the year 2020, how much more can be said or discovered about TOBS (it's shitty so [stop using it FFS](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/f2hr9y/help_with_creams_soaps_after_shaved/fhcm5sx/)), Proraso (much better than it gets credit for here, much worse than the floor-tarp-and-bukkake parties  r/wicked_edge, Marshalls, and TJMaxx throw for it), Tabac (ghastly and gross, but works great as a soap base so long as you've lost your sense of smell/have a TBI/like to bang octogenarians exclusively), Arko (the urinal puck smell is overstated, and if you must -- but why must you? -- just air it out for a few months and it's perfectly usable), Mitchell's Wool Fat (boring on smell, finicky on lathering, and not worth the trouble even for [people who *claim* to be experts on lathering it](https://youtu.be/mVKu1oZWfww)),  or Williams Mug Soap (no, Gary, your [spreadsheet](https://www.badgerandblade.com/forum/threads/eleventh-annual-one-blade-in-february-challenge-2020-edition.581120/page-13#post-10591149) is NOT helpful)?\n\nSo [Santa Maria Novella](https://buy.smnovella.com/index.php/men-s/shaving-cream-tabacco-toscano-7030915.html?___SID=U) sorta falls into that r/wetshaving dead zone of products that gets mostly ignored by reviews and SOTDs (minus a few notable users who have drunk this particular brand of tobacco Toscano-flavored Kool Aid).  It's not artisan, it's not hip, it's old school, it's European, it's pricey, it's more B&B/TSN/TSD/CSF than it is r/wetshaving.\n\nAnd indeed the prevailing thinking in regards to SMN on this sub and its predecessor sub have been largely negative. IMO. IMHO. IME. YMMV.\n\n[Exhibit A: RaggedClaws](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wet_Shavers/comments/2tmzcv/xpec_and_santa_maria_novella_discussion/co0gv7x/)\n\n[Exhibit B: $have$core](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/cvdj6l/review_santa_maria_novella_crema_da_barba/)\n\n[I've been meaning to get around to this review for quite some time.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/cvdj6l/review_santa_maria_novella_crema_da_barba/ey3r401/)  Because this nonsense is a crime.  But, alas, my fabulous and glamorous life just got in the way.\n\nWe'll get more into the Ruds review specifically below, but SMN appears to have a lot going against it on first blush. For one, it's 71 GD American dollars. Over $80 after shipping -- though to be fair, it's 7.4 ounces of product in the tub rather than the typical 4 ounces of American artisan product ($10.81 per ounce shipped compared to, say, Wholly Kaw Siero's tag of $8.75 per ounce, shipped...but still quite a bite out your chips).  Two, the [ingredient list doesn't look all that impressive.](https://www.mensbiz.com.au/santa-maria-novella-shaving-cream.html)\n\n> Aqua, Stearic Acid, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Parfum, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butlyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Camphor, Menthol, Allantoin.\n\nNo tallow? No butters? No milks? Is...is this vegan? Eww, gross.  And coconut oil based? Double eww.  And camphor and eucalyptus. Like Proraso? Naw, dawg. I'm out, right?\n\nRight?\n\nRight?\n\nIt doesn't make sense on paper.  Why would this be good?\n\n\nEven the backstory on the company is weird.  \n\n[According to the website](https://buy.smnovella.eu/ENG/about-us): \"Santa Maria Novella was established by Dominican monks shortly after their arrival in Florence in 1221. The friars began cultivating medicinal herbs in their gardens to prepare medications, balms and ointments for\ntheir convent’s small infirmary.\"\n\nThey continue: \"Following the Italian government’s confiscation of the church’s assets, in 1866 the pharmacy became a state owned enterprise; nevertheless it was transferred to Cesare Augusto Stefani, nephew of Officina’s last monastic director.\"\n\nSo setting aside the little bit of minutiae that, no Italianxirs, monks and friars [are NOT the same thing](http://priestvocation.com/difference-between-monks-friars-priests-and-brothers/) and the words aren't interchangeable, the whole thing sounds absurd.  [William of Ockham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Ockham), inventor of Occam's Razor, father of modern epistemology -- not [episiotomy, mind you, common mistake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episiotomy) -- was a friar, lived out with the people, tended the flock.  [Martin Luther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther), famous for fucking up the entirety of Christianity, lived in the monastery with his bros when he was a monk. For fuck's sake, Santa Maria Novella, were they friars or were they monks? Hmmm?\n\nBut at any rate, the monk vs. friar thing notwithstanding, how did a line of shaving products get started? \n\nSo we got Middle Age monks, living a life of poverty and celibacy, scribing ancient manuscripts with quills, cooking up tinctures and herbal remedies for gout and unbalanced blood humors from the bounties of their herb garden and shit, and then one day one monk looked at another monk and said \"I got it, Giuseppe. We'll make shave cream\"? And that's what they did right up to the point that proto-fascists ganked all the their shit and put them out on the streets? And then later the fascists sold their shit back to a monk's nephew?\n\nSo many questions.\n\nWas the Tetra-Di-T-Butlyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate in the original monk recipe? \n\nCan you grow Tetra-Di-T-Butlyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate in a monastic herb garden? \n\nDo Italian monks study chemistry?\n\nAnd if they did, don't you think it'd be fair if the University of Notre Dame would give them a full academic scholarship? \n\nBecause how would that not be fair?\n\nBut then they'd have to uproot their lives and move from the monasteries of Italy all the way to South Bend, Indiana. Talk about culture shock, my god. But on the other hand, you just KNOW Friar Tuck would straight own your ass at beer pong in a fraternity house full of Notre Dame undergrads.  But that still wouldn't work, logistical nightmares and what not. Unless, of course, Notre Dame could offer on-line classes. \n\n*Hey Alexa, do monks use computers?*\n\n[Whoa, they do.](https://www.trappist.net/) Maybe this could work.\n\n\nYeah, so it's weird.  And it doesn't look like it should be worth a damn. One would be forgiven for thinking it was something like overpriced Italian Martin de Candre by monks. \n\nAnd back to the Ruds review. Our faithful r/wetshaving correspondent had this to say about SMN:\n\n> I rate this as mid firm and the soap base is an easy loader. It is not a very thirsty soap and when dialed in, the consistency of the lather will resemble whipped cream. Slickness in terms of both primary and residual slickness are very good. There are many soaps that are noticeably slicker than this offering. Post shave is good, but a proper post shave routine will be a must when using this soap. Overall this soap doesn’t knock my socks off but provides enough for a serviceable shave. As such the Crema da Barba receives a ShaveScore of 84. For similar lather performance I suggest Kepkinh or Wild West Shaving Co.\n\n\nKephkinh or Wild West Shaving Company? Ouch. I don't know what either one of those two things are, but it can't be good.  I'm assuming this is akin to saying to someone \"for a face similar to yours, I suggest taking a look at either Bruce Vilanch or unmasked Kylo Ren or James Brown's domestic violence mugshot.\"\n\nBut ackshully I see the problem.  Emphasis all mine. To wit:\n\n\n> I rate this as mid firm and the soap base is ***an easy loader.*** \n\n\nNo, sir.  \n\n\n> It is ***not*** a very thirsty soap\n\nNo, sir.\n\n\n> when dialed in, the consistency of the lather will resemble ***whipped cream***.\n\nNo, sir.\n\n> There ***are*** many soaps that are noticeably slicker than this offering.\n\nNo, sir.\n\nIn fact, I own very few soaps slicker than SMN. \n\n\nWere I to fix Ruds' review, it would go like this:\n\n> I rate this as mid firm and the soap base ~~is an easy loader~~ requires a fairly heavy load and a little more effort than you're probably expecting.  Load it like you'd load Wholly Kaw Donkey Milk. Don't hate-bang it, but definitely get in there, work those hips, and throw some lather around. Don't be lazy. It is ~~not~~ most definitely a very thirsty soap that you should either Marco Method, [SkidMarko Method](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/87rjn5/welcome_wednesday_and_simple_questions_newbie/dwfopr2/) or [Pajeet Method](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/dwcjs9/why_your_lather_is_terrible_even_though_you_think/), and when dialed in, the consistency of the lather will resemble ~~whipped cream~~ a wet, damn near drippin' mess . Slickness in terms of both primary and residual slickness are ~~very~~ elite-level good but decidedly on this side of Milksteak and Excelsior and Siero, but still slick as Rick. There are ~~many~~ precious few soaps that are noticeably slicker than this offering. Post shave ~~is good~~ doesn't matter one single bit, you waterheads, ~~but~~ and a proper post shave routine ~~will be~~ is a must when using ~~this~~ any soap because soap is soap and not some magic moisturizing substance. It'll dry you out, just like every other soap. Use lotions and shit to combat this. Stop being weird. This isn't hard.   Overall this soap ~~doesn’t~~ knocks ~~my socks off~~ the pussy out like fight night, ~~but~~ and provides enough for a ~~serviceable~~ superb shave. As such the Crema da Barba receives a ~~ShaveScore~~ PooterScore of ~~84~~ of [\"gyeah\".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTN30-YOCQ&feature=youtu.be&t=21) For similar lather performance I suggest ~~Kepkinh or Wild West Shaving Co.~~ you just stop trying to compare every single soap against every other soap with weird metrics in an increasingly unwieldy database of numerical scores, and just live your life, you know. Twist cabbage off instinct. Blunts and broads, tits and bras, menage-a-tois, sex in expensive cars. In other words, enjoy your morning shave for yourself. For your own, personal face. For you own personal neck-meat. For your own, personal man-cans. \n\nAs to the scent, it's not at all like Proraso. Interested in the soap, but don't want to spend $80 and discover you don't like the scent?  It smells exactly like [this.](https://groomatorium.com/products/razorock-santa-maria-del-fiore-lozione-dopo-barba?_pos=1&_sid=b386af327&_ss=r)   This is one of the few times it's okay to lean on RazoRock (though *do* buy it from The Groomatorium, if you're able).  It's spot on. But definitely skip the RazoRock Santa Maria Del Fiore soap. It smells great, but the soap base itself is straight flaming garbage, homie, and despite the claims, it's nowhere close to SMN, the genuine article's, performance.\n\n**Disclosure**: [I paid for SMN with my own money via a 4-way tub split...which is a great way to buy this if you have 3 other close-knit bros or friars or monks you can get with.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wet_shave/comments/84w3ns/santa_maria_novella_split/) You don't need 7.4 ounces of soap at $80, do you? But 1.85 ounces at $20? Now you're talking sense, my friar.",

Some of the typical things seen on property walkthroughs include:\n\nStanding water in an unused birdbaths, clogged gutters, yard debris, and planter trays with live mosquito larvae\n\nThick boxwood and ivy shrubs under trees that create the ideal daytime mosquito habitat.\n\nDecks without proper drainage and airflow that attract mosquitoes during the day to hide from the sun in the shade and humidity.\n\nThere are several strategies you can take to significantly reduce the mosquito population around your home:\n\nStanding water removal – learn to spot and drain micro breeding zones, like plant saucers and gutter dips, and yard debris.  Areas with high moisture can also be treated with mosquito larvicide (mosquito bits or dunks)\n\nCO₂ traps – These mimic human breath (carbon dioxide and human odor) to lure adult mosquitoes and trap them.  If placed in the proper areas, these machines can create a large reduction in the mosquito population over time.  You have to find where the mosquitoes live during the day to effectively trap them.\n\nWater-based traps – These traps utilize larvicide to kill mosquito larvae, and infect the adult mosquito when they land in the water to lay eggs.  The traps are placed strategically to attract females looking to lay eggs, breaking the breeding cycle.   Mosquito bits and dunks are two effective products. \n\nLemon eucalyptus mosquito repellent balls  – Placed near the patio, grill, kids’ play area, and any seating areas to actively repel mosquitoes.  These work great in combination with the trapping methods above.  Lemon eucalyptus oil is also used as a spray applied to skin as an alternative to deet based mosquito repellent sprays. \n\nMosquito-repelling plants – These plants are used to repel mosquitoes in problem areas for long-term passive defense.  The plants include: lemongrass, citronella, lavender, basil, marigolds, peppermint, catnip (nepeta cataria), rosemary, sage, bee balm (monarda) \n\nAll Austin yards are dealing with this right now, and the solution isn’t spraying.\n",

While they are not the exact products of Beauty of Joseon, some of the ingredients are similar but of course not exactly the same.  Some of the products are particularly popular in Korea at the moment because Hanbang and plant based?\n\n[KIcho Sheep Oil](http://beautyfaceskin123.blogspot.com/2016/07/review-on-kicho-sheep-oil-cream.html)\n-this product is free from T.E.A, artificial scents, mineral oil, isopropyl alcohol, paraben, urea, heavy metals and formaldehyde.   Since it is anti aging product and is for dry skin, it contains a lot of plants extract(8 types of berries), essential oil, beeswax, silicone, shea butter hyaluronic acid and oils(grapefruit,lemon, orange) Dimethicone is the second ingredients after water.   So, it can be clogging if you do not like those ingredients.  The moisture lasted whole day.  There are ceramide, lanolin, collagen and sea water. No butylene glycol. (press sample, no affiliate link)\n \n[Hansaeng Cosmetics RIN Bi-gyeol Soo Essence](http://beautyfaceskin123.blogspot.com/2016/07/review-on-hansaeng-cosmetics-rin-bi.html)\nThis is a hanbang skincare from Korea. Niacinamide is high on the list along with a lot of hanbang which include the famous ginseng ingredients(6 fermented years). It has floral scent to it. Texture is light and absorb well.  It has Triethanol amine  which some said it is dangerous but it is not a problem for me.  No paraben.( press sample ,no affiliate link)\n\n[Hansaeng Cosmetics RIN Bi-gyeol Soo Cream](http://beautyfaceskin123.blogspot.com/2016/07/review-on-hansaeng-cosmetics-rin-bi_28.html)\nIt has the same hanbang ingredients(fermented 6 years ginseng) in the cream with the same smell but with different kind of texture. It is pretty light and calming. The jar is of course luxurious and looks like a blue pearl. Niacinamide is lower than the essence but it is still high. No paraben but contains Triethanol amine  to adjust the ph.

    "body": "It is occasionally said on this subreddit that shelf life of estradiol gels is probably many months, if not years.  We had a professional chemist who visited recently who said the same in this thread:  [We have a new mod, and the same old principles: everyone is welcome here! : ](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/1bh7ald/we_have_a_new_mod_and_the_same_old_principles/)\n\nBut as far as I know, no one here has done any objective testing, and I haven't heard any arguments that settle the question in my mind.  I found two studies that make me think that oxidation might be a real problem.  Both studies came out of the same university, and both created experimental transdermal formulations for both estradiol and progesterone.  Both studies measured how much estradiol and progesterone was left after 6 weeks of \"storing in tubes at room temperature\".\n\nThis study found that the estradiol in the experimental formula degraded 9%-27% and the progesterone degraded 17%-32% after 6 weeks (in Table 4): [Evaluation of an eucalyptus oil containing topical drug delivery system for selected steroid hormones - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16950579/)  The study used microemulsions using an oil (eucalyptus oil), an alcohol (ethanol), and a surfactant (Brij 30).  I don't think anyone here uses this particular recipe, but there are similar recipes on this board that are microemulsions using an oil, an alcohol, and a surfactant.\n\nThis study used a different formulation and found that both the estradiol and the progesterone degraded 61% in just two weeks! (Table 4):  [Skin permeation of different steroid hormones from polymeric coated liposomal formulations - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16202573/)  The experiment was ended after 2 weeks due to microbial spoilage (no alcohol in the formula).\n\nNeither of these studies use \"our\" recipes, although the first one used a recipe similar.  I'm not enough of a chemist to make even an educated guess as to whether there is anything about our recipes that better protect against degradation over time compared to ones in these studies.  Any thoughts from real chemists would be greatly appreciated here.\n\nBoth studies found that gelling the formula with a carbomer or even more so with a polymeric emulsifier (brand name Pemulen TR 1, aka Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer) slowed down the degradation a lot, as well as increasing skin absorption.  The part about increasing skin absorption surprised me, but both studies found it.  Still the degradation was significant:  9% for estradiol and 19% for progesterone after 6 weeks in the first study.\n\nWhat I'm thinking now is that it might be worth the trouble to:\n\n1. Add a tocopherol based antioxidant like this one at 0.5% [Vitamin E, Mixed Tocopherols T50](https://lotioncrafter.com/collections/antioxidants/products/vitamin-e-mixed-tocopherols-t50)\n2. Add a broad spectrum preservative to any formula with less than 60% alcohol, such as adding this one at 0.5% [Liquid Germall Plus](https://lotioncrafter.com/collections/preservatives-stabilizers/products/liquid-germall-plus)\n3. Use opaque, airless bottles\n4. Try thickening with with Pemulen TR 1.  The studies added it last at 2% with gentle stirring.  It's available at [Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZRNP54H/?coliid=I3W0QVDVGCR3ZT&colid=QWWT5FT0LE2T&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it&th=1).",

        "body": "Wow, that's an excellent post and a lot of research!\n\nThis may bring a very interesting discussion about our primitive methods (basically, most of them are just a dissolution in ethanol, with some penetration enhancer, with or without a thickener): as you noted, both of these studies use more \"advanced\" formulations: microemulsions and liposomes, essentially the same thing as the cells that make our bodies, that is \"small balls\" containing interesting things (the interesting thing here being the lipophilic hormones)\n\nMicroemulsions are generally spontaneous and stable, but not perfectly so, and liposome likewise and even less so: think about all these tiny balls wanting to coalesce to form bigger balls.\n\nI haven't read both these studies yet (I will, I promise!) but I assume what was lowered was not the actual E2 or P4 content, but the skin flux, because tiny balls go very well through the skin, while bigger balls don't go so well - that's my educated guess. The actual E2 or P4 content should remain the same, unless some microbial contamination found them yummy\n\nNow about why a carbomer or an crosspolymer helps: think about all these tiny balls being either separated from eachother by more viscosity: they wouldn't coalesce so rapidly\n\nYour proposed solutions are well thought, but for slightly different problems: oxygenation is unlikely to be a problem, spoiling won't happen if there's at least 30% ethanol (vodka doesn't spoil)  and thickening should be sufficient if using a carbomer\n\nThe simpler solution if people start using more advanced formulas (like microemulsions) is to shake them off: that's how you can mix oil and water (for a while), and that's how you can rehomogenize an emulsion that has separated\n\nYou have extremely good intuitions and research skills. If you want to dig more into microemulsions, I will be very happy to help you, but unless you don't have a lot of E2, the skin flux of the usual methods discussed here should be enough for most of the uses",

        "body": "Wow, thanks for the heads up. Publically I say my personal recipe uses orange oil. But in actual fact, I use eucalyptus oil as a penetration enhancer (1:1 substitute for orange oil). I don't publically share this, since eucalyptus oil isn't tried and tested like orange oil is. This is... very concerning... For me specifically. This probably doesn't matter for everyone else, but it's very concerning for me. Perhaps that's why my estradiol dosage is so high. What I think is 8mg per day, is actually substantially less... Hmm.\n\nOne thing I don't understand is why their ethanol-eucalyptus oil solution is a microemulsion. Correct me if I'm wrong, but eucalyptus oil is soluble in ethanol. Emulssifying shouldn't be necessary?\n\nReading through the paper, it is good it notes estrone is the main degredation product here. For a while I had actually doubted that, ever since talking to the chemist in that old post you linked. But since this paper notes estrone was the most common degredation product of the estradiol in the solution, I'm inclined to think the chemist was wrong.\n\nJust beneath that, the paper proposes the mechanism behind this degredation is hydrolysis. I.e. The steroids may be reacting with the water droplets in the microemulsion, and degrading. My spray is annhydrous ethanol. I never bothered to dillute it to 70% ethanol out of laziness, it appears that may have saved my whole batch. In any case, I doubt this issue applies to conventional estrogels, even ones with a significant water content. This is because we don't make microemulsion gels here. We make miscible, homogenous gels/sprays. We don't do emulsions.\n\nThe paper confirms my assumption that eucalyptus oil and ethanol synergise with one another to have a brilliant antimicrobial effect together.\n\n\"... On the other hand, this fact \\[The presence of cineol, a component of eucalyptus oil\\] may cause skin irritation.\" Not in my experience. My spray is 5% eucalyptus oil (v/v) and it's very easy on my skin. Nowhere near as harmful as orange oil. And the paper concurs eucalyptus oil is an effective penetration enhancer\n\nThanks for that u/Ljb66882 that was a good read! Thanks for bringing this to my attention.\n\nAlso here's a download link to the paper for anyone interested: [https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2006.08.003](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2006.08.003)\n\nEdit: My batch of spray is maybe... 8 months old now? Maybe 9? Fyi",

To note, do not use anything on your pet that does not say that it is pet friendly on it. If you do, you are running an extreme risk of making your pet ill or even worse, result in their death. \n\nThis first one happened my first year at the store. A lady was having an issue with keeping her dog calm during trips to the vet or grooming appointments. She said her dog would get so nervous that it would get sick in it's carrier. I ended up suggesting a product that we sell that has a pet friendly use of lavender in it; it was a spray that you put on a toy/blanket to put with the dog during those trips. We sold other things such as chewables, or drops, but I had received a lot of feedback from the spray from customers so that was what I usually suggested if we had it in stock. \n\nShe looks like she's processing what I showed her for a second and then mentioned that a friend sold *cough* pyramid scheme *cough* essential oils and had been trying to get her to buy some. Her friend had already mentioned using the lavender one on the dog and apparently me suggesting a pet safe lavender product signed the deal for her. I tried my best to talk out how of buying the (overpriced) oil due to the amount of risks, but she waved me off and left the store thanking me for my help. \n\nA little over a month later, she comes back in. Again, she's looking for a calming product and again, I try to help her. She looked distraught while talking to me and she began to explain that she had just got her dog back from the vet after it having to be monitored for a few days. \n\nI, being concerned and remembering our former conversation, asked what had happened. She told me that she had been putting the lavender oil behind her dog's ears for a few weeks and she had noticed that the dog was scratching at them all the time, which later resulted in fur loss and serious irritation. Before she stopped putting the oil on (which I don't understand why you wouldn't since your dog is losing fur/has raw spots behind her ears) her dog started refusing food and began vomiting to the point where there was a dark reddish tint to it. \n\nShe mentioned to the vet about the oil and essentially (haha, get it, sorry) the dog had been licking the oil off its back paw after scratching its ears and upset her digestive system/started poisoning her. She spent a very high amount on that vet bill and now trusts when people tell her to only use pet friendly products. \n\nStory two happened a couple days ago. \n\nA lady came in and bought three betta fish. I rang her up and a woman behind her was patiently standing at the register, waiting for this lady to move out of the way so she could ask me a question. When the lady moved to put her cart back/gather her belongings, she heard the woman asking me the question that began this conversation. To make this easier, I'm doing dialogue. I shall be Me, Lady Need Assistance will me LA, and Fish Lady will be OL. \n\nLA: Hi, I'm looking for something for fleas and ticks. My son recently moved back in with me and he has a Chihuahua puppy that has them. \n\nNow, I'll have to mention here that I live in the boonies. Fleas and ticks in our area are awful to the point where when I was a kid, I got anywhere from 2 to 20 ticks off of me just by walking in the woods. My store sells an array of products along with supposedly \"natural\" options that don't sell well because they're overpriced and sometimes don't work as they should; this lady was not looking for anything natural. \n\nMe: I can show you some things-- \n\nCL: Essential oils help. They're bad around here and I (gesturing to the toddler she had with her) found that a mixture of eucalyptus and (some other one I no longer remember) in a bottle of water and spray on her and my dog whenever we go on a walk outside. It works well. You just spray it on the dog's paws and it has it covered. \n\nLA gives me a funny look since this woman ran right over me mid sentence and I felt like my eyes had grown very wide listening to her talk. \n\nLA: Ah, well thank you for the advice. \n\nCL: I have a friend that sells them if you want her information. I think I have it in my purse somewhere. \n\nCL digs around her purse and all I'm thinking is here we go again with the pyramid scheme crap as CL shoves a business looking card into LA's hand and LA thanks her. \n\nI'm slowly walking away from my register, hoping CL leaves so I can show LA what I actually recommend and thankully CL actually walks out the door this time. \n\nLA follows me over to the flea and tick stuff, I tell her about our products before I say the one thing that I had been mentally screaming about since CL mentioned it. \n\nMe: I'm not trying to sound mean or nasty, but please don't listen to what that lady said about the essential oil spray. Eucalyptus oil is toxic for dogs (seriously, look it up) and the last thing I want to happen is for your son's puppy to get sick. \n\nLA: Don't worry, I don't plan on it. \n\nNeedless to say, she ended up buying a topical (the drops you put on the back of their neck) instead and she was super nice about the whole thing. She said that if the topical worked (she bought a one month supply) she'd definitely come back for more. \n\nAll I could think about though was what if she'd took that lady's advice instead of listening to what I had mentioned. While I don't know if a diluted version of eucalyptus oil would be any safer (I doubt it would) it is still one of the ones that is listed as toxic if a dog happens to ingest it. Especially if it's sprayed on their paws. \n\nPeople make me want to scream.",

I based it off Viva Doria's tooth powder ingredients. \n\nIt's mint and eucalyptus oil mixed with finely ground Himalayan sea salt and then mixed with calcium carbonate. I didn't measure but the oil ratio was probably 4 drops mint for every 1 drop eucalyptus. I probably put about 40 drops of mint in a couple ounces of the total tooth powder. \n\nI've been a lifelong Listerine user which I'm now thinking probably is part of my gum problems. I was really hooked on that sterilized clean mouth feel so was worried my natural mouthwash would be disappointing but I'm actually happy with it. For the mouthwash I basically made a super strong tea with fresh mint and thyme leaves. About 2 tablespoons mint and 1 thyme. I steeped it covered for about 20 minutes. While that was steeping I mixed two tablespoons of Himalayan sea salt with about 6 ounces of boiling water and stirred until it dissolved. I then mixed that with the \"tea\" and stored it in a glass water bottle in my bathroom. \n\nI've been brushing with the powder and gargling (swishing for about 1 minute) with the mouthwash a few times a day for a couple weeks now and my tooth sensitivity is gone. It's too early to really tell if there's new gum growth but it seems like there is.",

I also have a young flamethrower, small spears made from porcupine quills that can be shot with a kettie. It's fun skewering them or braai-ing them to be feed to my velvet ants.

        "body": ">Conventional shampoo technology using anionic surfactants and cationic conditioners results in charge interaction and complexing of he ingredients. Neither shampoo nor conditioner achieves the desired result. The successful solution was to incorporate charge neutral dimethicone conditioning ingredients, suspended as microfine droplets within complex crystal lattices, into anionic surfactant shampoo technology. The same solultion has also been applied to amphoteric surfactant systems. This provides complete cleaning, and hair conditioning fully equal to separate conditioners without the problems of build-up. This was achieved by keeping the dimethicone in suspension throughout the shampoo process. During rinsing, excess water breaks the crystalline lattice and allows deposition of the dimethicone droplets onto the hair. Full cleaning and conditioning are, therefore, achieved in one application. Dimethicone build-up is not encountered as subsequent washes first remove soil and previously deposited dimethicone. Neither do neutral dimethicones show any interactions with sebum. \n\n[(Rushton, Gummer & Flasch, 1994)](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/211278)\n\nOne of the authors is affiliated with Proctor and Gamble.\n\nAs to why it doesn't appear to leave build up, the same article states that \"no significant shift compared to untreated hair was found showing that dimethicone does not build-up on the hair surface with continued washing\" and that \"the level of dimethicone deposited onto virgin hair was found to plateau after 5 washes...and remained constant for in excess of 50 washes.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> since shampoo is primarily focused on the scalp does the silicone deposit on it? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure, but I would guess that it might. Silicones are used in skincare though, so I am not sure why that would be a concern:\n\n>The major drawback to pure petrolatum as a moisturizer is its greasiness, which most patients find unaesthetic. This can be minimized by lowering the petrolatum concentration and adding dimethicone, known as an astringent moisturizer,to improve product aesthetics. **Dimethicone is the second most common active agent in moisturizers today** because it too is hypoallergenic, noncomedogenic, and nonacnegenic.4 Dimethicone is one of a family of silicones that form the basis of all oil-free moisturizers and facial foundations......Dimethicone can provide many other skin benefits as an active agent besides moisturization. It can function as an emollient, making the skin smooth and soft to the touch by filling in spaces between the desquamating corneocytes.\n\n(emphasis mine)\n\n[(Draelos, 2010)](https://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/Abstract/2010/02000/Active_Agents_in_Common_Skin_Care_Products.38.aspx)",

    "body": "I made this post last year, and since it's about that time again, I thought a repeat might be helpful. \n\nFirst off: an important thing to note is that basic insect repellants like OFF! do not work against gnats. If you're looking for a spray solution because you're afraid of bugs/can't stand the thought of them, scroll to the bottom for my recommendations. You'll have to buy a gnat specific repellent.\n\nYou might have noticed the gnats try to get to your head/your face. This is because gnats always search for moisture and salt, and so attempt to land on your eyeballs. Gnats are also attracted to the carbon dioxide we breathe out, which is why they'll attempt to follow for some time.\n\nIf you put both your arms up and clasp your hands together, the gnats will *always* surround your hands instead of your head. They're too stupid to know the difference. In fact, you should really be trying to use this method instead of simply waving them away as **gnats can easily cause pink eye.** \n\nNow, once you've got your hands up and the gnats surround them, you should simply leave the area or head indoors. Thanks to how the gnats operate in Rutgers, they congregate around certain areas where moisture is higher, and stick to that area in swarms. You'll often find them in areas of lower elevation or around puddles. Once you leave said area, only some will follow for a couple seconds before returning to the swarm.\n\n# Repellent advice:\n\nIn wooded areas/literally anywhere that is not a city like New Brunswick, the above method would not help and I'd recommend repellents like Peppermint/Eucalyptus Oil or a vanilla based repellent as gnats can't stand the scent of vanilla. I know Walmart usually carries gnat specific repellents, and they're easy to find on Amazon. However, since there's only about 1 week left in the semester, it might not be worth it to go find one of the above products.  \n    \n   ",

I've seen a lot of crazy stuff in that time, but the one thing that drives me up the wall is the amount of people who mention to me that they've used essential oils on their pets/people who suggest to *other* customers that they use essential oils on their pets. \n\nI've got a couple of stories to share. We should all know at this point from working at pet stores that we should only use pet friendly things on our animals. \n\nThis first one happened my first year at the store. A lady was having an issue with keeping her dog calm during trips to the vet or grooming appointments. She said her dog would get so nervous that it would get sick in it's carrier. I ended up suggesting a product that we sell that has a pet friendly use of lavender in it; it was a spray that you put on a toy/blanket to put with the dog during those trips. We sold other things such as chewables, or drops, but I had received a lot of feedback from the spray from customers so that was what I usually suggested if we had it in stock. \n\nShe looks like she's processing what I showed her for a second and then mentioned that a friend sold *cough* pyramid scheme *cough* essential oils and had been trying to get her to buy some. Her friend had already mentioned using the lavender one on the dog and apparently me suggesting a pet safe lavender product signed the deal for her. I tried my best to talk out how of buying the (overpriced) oil due to the amount of risks, but she waved me off and left the store thanking me for my help. \n\nA little over a month later, she comes back in. Again, she's looking for a calming product and again, I try to help her. She looked distraught while talking to me and she began to explain that she had just got her dog back from the vet after it having to be monitored for a few days. \n\nI, being concerned and remembering our former conversation, asked what had happened. She told me that she had been putting the lavender oil behind her dog's ears for a few weeks and she had noticed that the dog was scratching at them all the time, which later resulted in fur loss and serious irritation. Before she stopped putting the oil on (which I don't understand why you wouldn't since your dog is losing fur/has raw spots behind her ears) her dog started refusing food and began vomiting to the point where there was a dark reddish tint to it. \n\nShe mentioned to the vet about the oil and essentially (haha, get it, sorry) the dog had been licking the oil off its back paw after scratching its ears and upset her digestive system/started poisoning her. She spent a very high amount on that vet bill and now trusts when people tell her to only use pet friendly products. \n\nStory two happened a couple days ago. \n\nA lady came in and bought three betta fish. I rang her up and a woman behind her was patiently standing at the register, waiting for this lady to move out of the way so she could ask me a question. When the lady moved to put her cart back/gather her belongings, she heard the woman asking me the question that began this conversation. To make this easier, I'm doing dialogue. I shall be Me, Lady Need Assistance will me LA, and Fish Lady will be CL. \n\nLA: Hi, I'm looking for something for fleas and ticks. My son recently moved back in with me and he has a Chihuahua puppy that has them. \n\nNow, I'll have to mention here that I live in the boonies. Fleas and ticks in our area are awful to the point where when I was a kid, I got anywhere from 2 to 20 ticks off of me just by walking in the woods. My store sells an array of products along with supposedly \"natural\" options that don't sell well because they're overpriced and sometimes don't work as they should; this lady was not looking for anything natural. \n\nMe: I can show you some things-- \n\nCL: Essential oils help. They're bad around here and I (gesturing to the toddler she had with her) found that a mixture of eucalyptus and (some other one I no longer remember) in a bottle of water and spray on her and my dog whenever we go on a walk outside. It works well. You just spray it on the dog's paws and it has it covered. \n\nLA gives me a funny look since this woman ran right over me mid sentence and I felt like my eyes had grown very wide listening to her talk. \n\nLA: Ah, well thank you for the advice. \n\nCL: I have a friend that sells them if you want her information. I think I have it in my purse somewhere. \n\nCL digs around her purse and all I'm thinking is here we go again with the pyramid scheme crap as CL shoves a business looking card into LA's hand and LA thanks her. \n\nI'm slowly walking away from my register, hoping CL leaves so I can show LA what I actually recommend and thankully CL actually walks out the door this time. \n\nLA follows me over to the flea and tick stuff, I tell her about our products before I say the one thing that I had been mentally screaming about since CL mentioned it. \n\nMe: I'm not trying to sound mean or nasty, but please don't listen to what that lady said about the essential oil spray. Eucalyptus oil is toxic for dogs (seriously, look it up) and the last thing I want to happen is for your son's puppy to get sick. \n\nLA: Don't worry, I don't plan on it. \n\nNeedless to say, she ended up buying a topical (the drops you put on the back of their neck) instead and she was super nice about the whole thing. She said that if the topical worked (she bought a one month supply) she'd definitely come back for more. \n\nAll I could think about though was what if she'd took that lady's advice instead of listening to what I had mentioned. While I don't know if a diluted version of eucalyptus oil would be any safer (I doubt it would) it is still one of the ones that is listed as toxic if a dog happens to ingest it. Especially if it's sprayed on their paws. \n\nPeople make me want to scream.",

I like to find products that are inexpensive and can be used in numerous ways to clean my house.\n\nLast night I realized I can iron stains out of the carpet.  All you are doing is steam cleaning it.  Spray the stain down with diluted Dr. Bronners (I use peppermint since it is clear.) place a wash cloth over the stain, and iron it on the cotton setting so it steams up well.  Blot dry with another dry wash cloth and the stain is gone.  It even lifted stains that were set and I wasn't able to clean using other carpet cleaners.\n\nBest part? The dog has no interest in Dr. Bronners. Using Resolve or any other cleaner I have to crate him until the spot is dry and keep a close eye on him for a few days following.  Yeah, my pup isn't too bright.  I know.  He once licked wet paint off a wall...\n\nYou can probably use diluted vinegar, but I was sadly out of vinegar last night.\n\n\n\nSpider Away Spray:\n\nMix two squirts of Dr. Bronners peppermint soap into a large squirt bottle, add half a bottle of eucalyptus oil, and fill with water.  Spray corners, in closets, around door ways and windows, or where you normally have spider issues.  Caution: it is oil based so it may stain curtains or walls. Test first!  We have solid wood on our walls so the oil absorbs. \n\n",

To give you a short answer, yes – such a compound as below is certainly possible but the formulation below Is a terrible formulation and 90% of actives will go to waste. The pharmacists preparing such combination has no pharmaceutical knowledge and just add a bunch of actives together and hope for the best.\n\n \n\nFor topical actives to have a pharmacological effect they need to be in solution – there are published studies on just Minoxidil detailing what the exact ratio of solvents and excipients should be in order to be absorbed – too little solvent and the active does not penetrate – too much alcohol and the solution evaporates too quickly leaving a residue of active. The below formulation starts off being a suspension, meaning those actives in suspension might not even get as far as out of the spray nozzle, never mind having pharmacological effect.\n\n \n\nMinoxidil/Dutasteride and Tretinoin in combination are compatible and yield a solution with good pharmacological effect.\n\n \n\nWe utilise all the other actives, but in different solvent systems as they can be challenging to formulate with and when added together will precipitate out. I can go into great pharmaceutical detail on each of the actives and what sort of pH, solvent systems etc they require but do not want to bore you with the detail.\n\n \n\nI would suggest a combination of Minoxidil 8%/Dutasteride 0.2%/Tretinoin 0.01% applied daily for men – we compound this often for patients. A new trend is also low dose oral Minoxidil for men and women.",

The latter could be interpreted as \"pour one 2.5mL bottle of Xalatan into your 100mL bottle of hair serum\". That's 40x less latanoprost then the former.\n\nAlso, how often is regrowth permanent after discontinuation of the serum? Did permanency increase when started using latanoprost in the past?\n\nEDIT: I've contacted AgelessRX, and according to the detailed recipe sheet they sent me, their v5.1 contains even less latanoprost: a 60 mL bottle of final product contains 1.5 mL of a 0.0005% latanoprost solution (yes, 0.0005%, not 0.005%). That's one hundred times lower concentration than if there were 0.00125% of latanoprost in the final product. Looks like the situation is complicated! It's hard to believe that if 0.00125% is needed to enhance eyelash growth that a mere 0.0000125% would have an effect on hair regrowth.",

She was 9lbs, 1oz and 22\" long. \n\nBack story which some of you may recall: there is a Florida law that if a moms iron level is below 10.0, they midwifes cannot help you due to increased risk of bleeding. Mine was okay most of my pregnancy but around 35 weeks dipped down below 10. I did ALL the things to try to increase my iron. Supplements, steaks, spinach, etc. but I couldn't get it above 9.6 (ugh. So close!)\n\nBy my 40 week appointment I pretty well knew if I went into labor I would have to go to the hospital. It was frustrating, but we wanted to be safe of course and if that was the best option- so be it. We did a hospital tour in advance to make sure we knew what was what. It was reassuring that they had lots of different options for labor (birth tub, birthing balls, suggested dim lighting, bringing music, etc) and they even mentioned that several of their nurses had experienced out of hospital births and they try to \"match you up\" to help make sure you get the support you need. Cool. \n\nI had been having contractions on and off for days (weeks? Months? It felt like forever!). I was woken up around 5am on the 24th with contractions again. So frustrating. They were about 10 minutes apart and continued that way all morning. Around 11am I texted my husband to please have his appointments for the afternoon reassigned so he could come home. I continued to labor quietly in my room watching Law and Order on Netflix, timing contractions. They continued getting closer and closer and I eventually concluded it was real labor. \n\nHusband was finishing up his work and I asked him to pick up our daughter and take her to my dads house (where she would stay over so they could take her to school the next day). He got her, took her to their house, proceeded to dick around for too long (HELLO? What part of \"time to go to the hospital!\" is unclear to you?). It was getting to the evening now, I ate some dinner and called my midwives on call line to advise them I was in labor and would be heading to the hospital. She was so sweet but I think skeptical because I sounded totally normal. I had a contraction on the phone with her and just put her on hold until it passed. \n\nHusband finally got home around 7 and was, again, dicking around the house... He was like \"well I need to eat dinner\", then take a shower... Etc. He got our bags in the car and we finally left around 7:30. I was definitely not loving life during contractions but was still managing very well. We got to the hospital and to the OB ECC around 8. This is a separate emergency room just for pregnant women so you don't go to the regular ER or straight to L&D. \n\nIn the ECC I filled out some paperwork with breaks for contractions. I got back to a room and the nurse that came in was super cool. She said \"I can check you but only if you want. The doctor will probably want to know where you are but if you aren't feeling it that's fine.\" I appreciated having the option and she was super sweet so I agreed to have her check me quickly. She then says \"I can't feel your cervix\". Cue me looking at my husband and going \"God dammit- they are going to send me home!\"  She said \"NO! You're like more than 8cm! I almost broke your water by accident!\"\n\nThey got me to L&D right away after that. I was on the stretcher riding up and the ECC staff was waving at me going \"Good luck! You look amazing!\" Since I was handling being 8cm very well. I felt like a super unglamorous, pregnant beauty queen on a parade float. \n\nOnce we got to L&D, things went south for me. I wanted to be in a tub so badly. My first was a water birth and it helped me cope so much. Of course I was told \"sorry the tub rooms aren't available\". They took my blood- I immediately told them \"if by some chance my iron level is over 10, don't you DARE tell me\" haha. Spoiler alert: it was 10.4. I asked later on. Yes I'm bitter as fuck over that. \nThen I was pushed to be strapped to a monitor to get a \"baseline\" on the baby. My nurse Audrey (who was a pain in the ass) told me ten minutes. I looked at her and said \"I can see that clock. 10 minutes.\" And she was like... Well... Maybe 20. This was where our relationship went downhill. \n\nI tried to give her the monitoring she wanted but eventually bailed for the shower. It was awful. Small, shitty water pressure. It didn't help me feel better at all. My husband was trying like hell to be helpful but I wanted nothing to do with him. At one point he was plugging in my oil diffuser and setting up my Bose for music. All I could think was \"eucalyptus oil and Pandora?! That's what he's worrying about?!\"\n\nMy contractions were pretty gnarly at this point and I was definitely starting to push a little in the shower. I decided I didn't like standing there so I went back to the bed and sat there for a while. Audrey kept asking me to lay back so she could monitor the baby. Nope. Fuck off Audrey. I'm not laying back. She also kept asking me a million questions. Are you diabetic? Do you smoke? Do you like the color chartreuse? You name it and she was asking me. Just. Go. Away! (Hindsight: I know she was just doing her job and she was very nice with me.) \n\nWe started talking about how the only thing that hasn't happened was my water breaking and that if they did that , baby would be out soon. It was about 9:55 pm and I remember Audrey saying baby would be here by 11. Awesome. Husband and I agreed, so they asked the doctor to come in. He came in and threatened an internal monitor to get a trace on the baby. I remember saying \"I don't want that\" and he grabbed his giant hook thing. Before he could get near me with it, my water broke all over the bed. Meconium. Meconium EVERYWHERE. \n\nThen the NICU team came in. They told me they would check the baby out to make sure she didn't aspirate any gunk. I was too busy screaming \"FUCK BALLS!\" At the OB and \"get her out!\" While they yelled back at me to push because the baby was \"swimming in pea soup\" (uh, gross). From my water breaking to baby girl coming out was probably less than 5 minutes. I would say 4 minutes. Baby Georgia came out at 10:18pm and I immediately apologized to the doc and Audrey. Lol \n\nI heard someone tell the doc I wanted delayed cord clamping, I figured it was out of the question with the meconium but the NICU lady was right next to my side suctioning her. She did take her to the warmer once her cord was cut but it was for less than 30 seconds and she was right back to me. Then, like a switch... Everyone was gone. They dimmed the lights and just left us be for almost 2 glorious hours. Nobody came in, asked me any questions, poked me, took my blood pressure. It was amazing. We just relaxed and listened to music and stared at her. \n\nAs a bonus for reading this far: after about 90 minutes, I decided Daddy should have a cuddle. The second I handed her to him, \"Georgia on my mind\" came on my Pandora. It was like a scene in a movie- it couldn't have been timed any more perfectly. Watching my husband sway and stare at his newborn baby girl was so beautiful. I will never forget that moment. \n\nTL;DR: pics are at the top ☝🏼️ \n",

    "body": "I see a lot of complaints about the amount of gnats on campus, so I thought I'd give some advice from what I learned in Boy Scouts.\n\nIf you put both your arms up and clasp your hands together , the gnats will *always* surround your hands instead of your head (unless you've got your mouth wide open, then they'll probably go for that). This is because gnats always search for moisture and salt, and so attempt to land on your eyeballs. In fact, you should take care to use this method instead of simply trying to wave them away as gnats are a prime cause of pink eye.\n\nAnother fun fact: gnats are attracted to carbon dioxide we exhale, which is why they follow people around - and only dissipate from following you when you run into more people. They're also attracted to bad breath, so brush your teeth.\n\nEdit: Good question from someone who asked what to do once the gnats surround your hands. You should simply leave the area. Thanks to how the gnats operate in Rutgers, they congregate around certain areas where moisture is higher, and stick to that area in swarms. Once you leave said area, only some will follow for a couple seconds before returning to the swarm. In wooded areas/literally anywhere that is not a city like New Brunswick, this would not help and I'd recommend repellents like Peppermint/Eucalyptus Oil or a vanilla based repellent as gnats can't stand the scent of vanilla. This is important to note because basic insect repellents like OFF! actually do not repel gnats. You can obviously still use the aforementioned repellents, but it's not worth it to purchase them if you're moving back home soon.",

I can't use most oils creams or balms due to seborrheic dermatitis. I finally found my HG product close to 30 bucks a pop for a measley 2oz by Avene and they went and CHANGED IT. Jerks.\n\nOkay, no problem, I will just, you know, continue to look for even longer, seeking a product for me. I buy a lotion (body) from FAB that gave me an allergic reaction to eucalyptus oil which was a new ingredient not listed on the website upon purchase. Okay, fine, it's just another super expensive product to gift to my boyfriend. He feels bad for my plight but likes benefiting from my failed product attempts. Alas I continue onward. Today  I opened up a Purito face wash and checked the ingredients in the label to avoid any more surprises, and guess what...THEY ADDED TEA TREE OIL.\n\nI just started straight up crying in the shower, ya'll.\n\nI've spent hours upon hours learning about all the minutiae of these different skin conditions, seeking diagnosis and treatment, and scouring ingredient checkers. And these companies keep doing me dirty.\n\nTo top it all off I've recently developed dyshidrotic eczema on the soles of my feet and my palms and it's super duper itchy and is one of a whole host of medical problems keeping me awake at night. I have added petroleum, wool socks, and cotton gloves to my daily dress and it's helping a little. It's looking like I will have to invest in wool sheets too, which is just another exorbitant expense. Sigh.\n\nJust skin me alive, I might be more comfortable. I kid!! But seriously folks, I wish my skin would stop being so rude.\n\nI hope you are having a better day than me! Gotta go give myself a hug and make peace w my skin and discomfort. Solidarity fam!",

It was a Pointclan cat who first founded the connection to starclan. \n\nCapeclan:\nKnown for their inventive nature Capeclan cats who live on the Cape shoreline underneath Pointclan's territory use washed up items, nets and tools to help them create hunting traps for fish. They're considered lazy by the other clans but incredibly innovative. \n\nRecluseclan:\nRecluseclan cats earn markings throughout their lives from apprentice to elder. These fur staining ceremonies are very culturally significant to Recluseclan cats and help them connect to their core values and beliefs.\n\nRecluseclan cat's use a mixture of ochre and eucalyptus oil + various other herbs to create a fur staining poultice that also doubles as a natural insect repellent to ward off all the bugs in their forest.\n\nDriftclan:\nThere's a lot of cats to keep in line so routine is absolutely crucial for Driftclan cats. They're trained in squads as apprentices and stay in the same group as they grow up to be warriors. These cats often form strong bonds and comradeships, training, hunting, sleeping, and patrolling together, making them very skilled  fighters and hunters in a team.  \n\nIf you wanted to read it from the start you can google ' Framed But Not Broken' and click the webtoons link!

And because they have a dog she often diffuses nice scents for the SCENT ALONE. This has never bothered me, she’s not pouring citrus oil in the dogs ear or anything. \n\nBut something about thieves in particular has my mom absolutely enamored. And I’m going crazy.\n\nIt started as a normal scent. My mom has trouble saying NO to people, and an MLM friend was peddling oils around. As the people pleaser my mom is, she bought some to make her friend happy. Over time the friend kept offloading stuff to my mom and eventually my mom got thieves oil. There were a few oils she had that bothered me, like the “relaxation” one, I can’t remember the real name but my mom rubs it on her temples when she is stressed, and puts it on my dad when he gets headaches. Oils + skin is never a good idea without a doctors supervision. \n\nAnyways, long story short now thieves is the solve for everything. She made “homemade hand sanitizers” for everyone, which if I’m not mistaken is literally just hand sanitizer mixed with enough thieves my nose burns when she puts it on fifteen feet away from me. She made one for everyone. I didn’t take mine because I’m an adult and am allowed to say no. But my 14 year old sister had to take one and have it on her at all times. My 19 year old brother took it and “lost it” basically immediately, and my mom is a little intimidated by his independence so doesn’t hound him over it. I think she’s scared he’ll move out like I did when I wanted more control over my life. \n\nYesterday my bathroom mirror fell off the wall revealing a few patches of mildew. I sent pics to the family group chat and immediately my mom said “spray cleaner or thieves on it!!” too late I used bleach :P\n\nWhen people have sore throats (I get strep very often) she insists on putting thieves on the back of their throat. The thieves trend has been going on for AWHILE so I had to do it a few times when I was 16-17ish (I’m 23 now...) and not only did it literally never help, it often burned my inflamed throat and made me feel worse. Then I’d get antibiotics and she’d say “see, it’s working. You don’t need to finish those antibiotics” which is a whole can of worms I don’t even look at anymore because the antibiotic argument means exactly nothing to her. My dad is equally frustrated. He keeps my siblings on track with antibiotics but can’t control my mom, and thus she doesn’t ever take her antibiotics all the way. She likes to “save some for later”. Yes. I feel just as stressed as you do reading that. \n\nMy brother often gets migraines and my mom rubs a few drops of thieves on the back of his neck. Interestingly he usually feels WORSE and then goes to take a nap. My mom seems to think this is just how the migraines work......but I wonder how they’d be if we didn’t overstimulate the dude’s sinuses with the nasty thieves scent. \n\nThis damn thieves oil is so annoying. My sister has to use the hand sanitizer or my mom will get after her, so I told her to just keep normal hand sanitizer handy too and use THAT after the thieves one so she’s *actually* safe. \n\nI know one of the main ingredients of thieves is eucalyptus oil.......which is toxic if ingested. Either way, anecdotally thieves makes my skin burn and my stomach hurt. In no way does it make me feel better. \n\nMy moms a Christian and I’ve had this argument that doesn’t go anywhere either. “Why don’t you just trust the health system” = well the health system is good for some things but they don’t know everything. “Okay, then instead of self medicating how about you just trust in god?” = I trust god won’t allow me to make a mistake by using essential oils. \n\nShe has even given me thieves oil to MAKE SURE I have it in the house for whenever I need it. I threw them away at first but she just kept buying more, so now I have an old crusty container at the top of my pantry with probably expired thieves oil. Idk if they expire or what. Not like they’d follow FDA guidelines with those either lol. \n\nAlright, rant over. Her comment about thieves on the mildew just tipped me over today. I feel better now.",

I've filled in 3 tiny gaps of the \\~60 PLUS the floor surrounds that is required.\n\nSooo yes, gloves would have been handy (they'd have stuck to the wall and saved me being glued to the mouse), anyone got any better tips for using this stuff?",

    "body": "**Tea tree oil applied topically**: Tea tree oil has frequently been mentioned as a cure for scabies \\[8\\], with multiple angles of benefit: first, it can kill the mites. Second, it may help with secondary complications such as with the proliferation of Staphylococcus Aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes \\[11\\]\\[21\\]. Additionally, in one study, it was shown that tea tree oil had not exhibited any cytotoxicity to fibroblast cells \\[21\\]. In another study, it was shown that tea tree oil, even at very low concentrations, can inhibit the growth of various types of cancer \\[23\\]\\[24\\]\\[25\\].\n\nBut it isn’t without its limitations. Tea tree’s antibacterial properties may also kill good bacteria such as lactobacillus. By re-introducing good flora to the skin after tea tree oil is washed off, this negative impact may be countered. See [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/user/good_burger1/comments/s4oa9r/how_scabies_attacks_our_skins_microflora_and_what/) for details. An additional limitation of tea tree oil is in the potential (albeit low) for skin irritation in some individuals. (Definitely do a spot test before adding this to your regimen). The final limitation to tea tree oil is due to poor absorbency in the skin.\n\nThe main issue with tea tree oil is that there is very limited penetration into the epidermis layer of skin in its pure form, and it’s also very quick to evaporate \\[9\\]. To know how effectively the tea tree oil should penetrate the skin to provide a cure, it’s important to understand how deep scabies burrow. I’ve read that scabies burrow no deeper than beyond the stratum granulosum layer of the skin, which is part of the epidermis ([diagram of skin here](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0753332218353393-ga1_lrg.jpg)) \\[14, 18\\]. There are many sources that indicate that the mites primarily burrow in the stratum corneum (several layers above the stratum granulosum), but many which state stratum granulosum, and, if we want to find the most effective solution, it’s best not to assume the best. Therefore, a perfect cure would need to at least be absorbed into the stratum granulosum layer of the skin and remain within that part of the skin (or at least reasonably reapplied to this part of the skin) until all remaining mite eggs have hatched. \\[Edit\\] From my understanding, however, once the stratum corneum layer is penetrated, the drug can freely pass through to the dermis. Darn you, stratum corneum!\n\nOverall, to fully eliminate mites, the mite killer must be consistently applied as long as there are viable eggs unless the solution is fully effective against killing mite eggs. Therefore, in theory, if tea tree oil were to get absorbed into the skin to a reasonable depth / concentration, it would need to come into physical contact with freshly hatched mites to be fully effective \\[15\\].\n\nWhen considering these various factors, it makes sense that many home remedies will fail – most of them consist of a tea tree oil mixed with a carrier oil, with inadequate transdermal activity. According to one article, epidermal thickness was measured to anywhere between 31 and 637 micrometers \\[16\\]. However, vegetable oils, the most frequent carriers used for topical application of tea tree oil, cannot penetrate the skin beyond 11 micrometers \\[17, 18\\]. And, for reference, the stratum corneum is 10-20 micrometers thick, and mites are said to live well below that. For an application of 100% tea tree oil, it was shown that only 2-4% applied to the skin would penetrate the human epidermis \\[9\\] (and nobody would be able to reasonably tolerate or afford this level of dosage several times a day at any rate). These oils and their carriers wouldn’t even come close to touching the well-hidden scabies or their eggs, unless the scabies surfaced while the oil was still applied.\n\nPerhaps with the use of a transdermal delivery method, the tea tree oil can be absorbed fully into the epidermis. Ideally, full absorption into the epidermis will result in: (1) the active ingredients being effective for a longer period, and (2) the active ingredient making contact where mites and their eggs are living, killing the mites and even reducing the hatch rate.\n\nAfter digging deeply into the topic of transdermal delivery of tea tree oil however, I’ve fallen short - it's a very dense topic, and requires me to investigate whether it's even safe, which doses are effective, how to actually accomplish this, etc. And that's enough information for yet another post... Still, in all my digging, I have found yet another clue on how we might be able to treat the scabies and their eggs that exist far into the epidermis – and I’m going to follow that clue in my next post. Spoiler alert: Eucalyptus oil has wonderful transdermal properties and has been proven to kill scabies \\[26\\]\\[27\\]. However, I still believe that there is much more to uncover regarding tea tree oil and its potential positive impacts if this shortcoming is addressed. So, maybe more to come there. But I feel as though exploring lower-hanging fruits at this point is a better way for me to spend my time.\n\nLet’s end with a summary - Tea tree oil will:\n\n* Eliminate pathogens on the surface of the skin, which flourish when scabies are present\n* Kill mites on the surface of the skin, and perhaps mites in the stratum corneum layer of the skin\n* Help prevent skin cancer\n\nBut also may:\n\n* Cause skin irritation in some individuals\n* Kill good lactobacillus\n* Not be readily absorbed into the skin\n\nOverall, tea tree oil is certainly a great addition to the arsenal against scabies but may not prove to be a complete solution unless a method is used to improve skin absorbency. The benefits greatly outweigh the negatives here, so my recommendation would be to keep this solution in the back pocket, and to apply it alongside other treatments that can readily penetrate the epidermis.\n\n\\[1\\] [Host immune responses to the itch mite, Sarcoptes scabiei, in humans](https://parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13071-017-2320-4#ref-CR29)\n\n\\[2\\]

Blukote to disinfect wounds, as well as camouflage them.\n\n2.) Neosporin gel *without* the pain reliever in it\n\n3.) Bandaging, wraps, spray on bandage, etc\n\n4.) Sulmet or Corid for Poultry..both are sulfa-based medications, so people with allergies beware. Sulmet seems to treat a broader range of diseases and pathogens vs Corid.\n\n5.) You know I am going to say it....Nutridrench. It is an instant vitamin and energy nutrient that is quickly absorbed into the stomach lining of your poultry, immediately giving them energy to battle the illness, and later nutrients to bolster the immunity. It has helped save many adult chickens and many chicks. You can get it on Amazon.\n\n6.) You can also look into buying Sav-a-chik powder/probiotics, which you can add to water to help sick birds. \n\n7.) VetRx, it is pretty much eucalyptus oil, and helps with respiratory inflammation.\n\n8.) Ivermectin----it is normally a blue liquid, you apply 1 drop per 1-2lbs of bird. You can suction the solution into a clean eyedropper, and administer it when the chickens are roosting. Simply place the drops against their bare skin; under their feathers, or right next to their vent. Ivermectin kills blood feeding parasites like mites, fleas, ticks, myiasis, and most internal worms/parasites.\n\n9.) Poultry dust...this helps address feather lice, mites, fleas, ticks, etc. Blood feeding parasites will respond better to Ivermectin.\n\n10.) A simple book about basic chicken behaviors, biology, the most common illnesses and injuries, and guides on How to. \n\n____\n\nI also have Oxine, and I sometimes add a teeny tiny amount of UNactivated Oxine to the water dispensers to kill pathogens, algae, fungus, as well as treat internal issues in the hens too.

    "body": "So I see people recommending nutramedix, Zhangs, other products every day here. And I have no comments about the effectiveness of those products (except that NutraMedix TOA free cats claw is a scam, TOA is a necessary part of the cats claw and they are using false information to promote it), but I have something to say about the prices. \n\nLets start with cistus. Many people pay 50 cents or more per moderate dose of cistus, more if its a tincture. People might pay 25 euros for 100g of the tea. Well, some places sell 250g for 3 euros, so thats about 97% discount. 97 percent. Lymeherbs.eu is one such place. \n\nOr Zhangs products. They sell houttuynia, artemisia annua, garlic, or other herbs for something like 1 euro per dose. You can get dried houttuynia for 5 cents per dose at some places, but fresh houttuynia is much more effective. Teaselshop sells fresh tincture for quite a good price, but even then, you can save 95-99.9% if you just find/plant houttuynia yourself at any place that is moist enough for it to grow. It grows fast. After 3 months, you have free medicine forever. \n\nOr the garlic capsules. Garlic costs almost nothing in supermarkets, so you can just take a clove, crush it into coconut/olive oil and eat it. Again, you save at least 90% of your money.\nSame for cinnamon and clove. Dont buy the oil, just get good quality spice from any supermarket.\nEucalyptus oil is 2 euros for a bottle at lymeherbs. Thats 50-100 doses for 2 euros. \n\nSo, before you pay another 50 euros or 90 euros or 130 dollars for product x and y, check lymeherbs.eu and your grocery store and maybe etsy and if possible, plant your own houttuynia and see if your area has other natural medicines growing there. \nDont pay 20x more than you need to pay. Get your cistus and other herbs at 90-99% discount by looking up a few websites first",

If that's what they want to do because of convenience and the money isn't really a problem for them, more power to them, but I want folks who are on a budget to be aware of this.\n\nI have often not been in a position to grow my own plants, but many herbs are equally as effective as homemade alcohol tinctures, starting from the dried herb. For folks in the US, 1stchineseherbs.com is a good seller that was recommended by Buhner when he was alive. I often use the Plum Flower brand. $50-$80 can buy you a pound of an herb that can last for two years or more, depending on the dose you use. The dried herbs don't really go bad as long as you can avoid moisture around them. Some herbs are available as powders, and I also make capsules using a machine that cost me maybe $40. \n\nThe thing is I am not well enough to make capsules or tinctures now. I'm still using tinctures I made a few years ago but I'm out of pre-made capsules. I have family helping me with things but I try to minimize the burden on them. When people post here, we don't necessarily know what their physical limitations are. Nor whether they have outdoor space that they have permission to grow things in. So I just try to inform people of the options that are out there.",

I feel like real tumeric would work better for helping joint pain than tumeric capsules anyway. I always prefer to get my vitamins from diet as much as possible cause they are absorbed better when we consume foods with vitamins and nutrients that we need than if we take the supplement version. I also have a friend who is really into gardening and hydroponics and stuff and got lots of adaptogenic mushrooms from him (he also sells them at farmers market). I got the mushroom powder and added that to my smoothies every day. \n\nI’ve read about the cowden protocol and it’s all “special herbs” that only one brand makes. I call bullshit. I did Buhner and just used cats claw, Chinese skullcap, and Japanese knotweed tinctures + tons of other herbs but ya I’m poor too so I searched around to find the best prices for good quality brands for everything I used. \n\nAlso, my LLMD prescribed 3 months worth of 50mg capsules of methylene blue. My brother had to lend me $500 for that prescription, and I could only take it for 18 days before the side effects became too extreme (constant heart pain was the scariest symptom) .. I also had to borrow money from my brother to pay for her $100/15 min bills (saw her in total for 1 1/2 hours and she basically told me everything I already knew about herbs and diet thru my own research - but she did have me start eating meat, fish, and eggs and I do think that helped me to heal by adding those foods and she also ran tons of blood tests and helped me find out what previous infections I’ve had and what vitamins and nutrients I’m deficient in and referred me to an allergist from whom I found out I actually have minor allergies to soooo many foods. \n\nI think LLMDs are a good option for anyone who can’t find an in-network doctor to prescribe them enough antibiotics (I was lucky that my urgent care doctor kept giving me another week of refills of doxy at a time until my symptoms were better but I know a lot of people can’t find a doctor who will prescribe enough doxy outside of LLMDs) so I think an LLMD is a good choice for anyone who needs antibiotics prescriptions and can’t get them from normal doctors but other than that they mostly just overcharge patients for advice that is all available online. Anyone who needs an LLMD will prob benefit from seeing them but I think just one or two appointments is all that is necessary. I recommend people go to get the prescription antibiotics and the blood tests then take treatment into their own hands. Buhner protocol helped me so much more than methylene blue and I really regret having filled that prescription that I’m still paying off.",

I live in a very dry area so I have to keep my lips moisturized, and I've found some favorites and some duds out of the balms I've tried recently. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xpjyp2b38p921.png?width=1017&format=png&auto=webp&s=48a4238564cc113d6dc89828f997ee62e119d888\n\n**Lypsyl**: this one reminds me of regular Burt's Bees, in that it's a beeswax lip balm with a minty flavor. It's definitely more expensive though, about $5 per tube or 2 for $8. I like one more than Burt's Bees because it doesn't feel as sticky, but it is still moisturizing and protective. The main ingredients are mineral oil, petroleum, paraffin, coconut oil, ceresin, beeswax, and shea butter. The tube is so cute, the yellow on the side is a little bee that you push up and down to get the balm to come out. ***I rate it 4/5, because I personally don't lie the stickiness of beeswax.*** \n\n**Simple Truth Organic Moisturizing Lip Balm in Strawberry Lavender**: I like the scent of lavender, but I didn't realize how strong it would be in this lip balm and I didn't like that I would get a taste of it every now and then. This is a big tube that  I bought for around $3, but it essentially only puts a thin layer of balm on your lips that stays at the surface and does nothing for moisture unless you re-apply. Its main ingredients are sunflower oil, beeswax, cocoa butter, and coconut oil. ***I rate it 1/5, because it does nothing to help my lips.*** \n\n**Yes to Coconut Coconut Lip Oil:** this one is interesting, because as an oil its very thin and lightweight on the lips as opposed to normal lip balms. As you can imagine, it leaves lips glossy and shiny after application but it has never felt sticky! However, I didn't feel like it moisturized my lips the way I expected an oil to and I had to re-apply it a lot. There is some eucalyptus oil to give a minty tingly and scent, but there is also a hint of coconut scent so I would stay away if you don't like either. It was about $5. ***I rate it 3/5 because it's like a healthy lip gloss and offers temporary relief, but not moisturizing enough for me.*** \n\n**Jack Black Intense Therapy Lip Balm in Cucumber Lime:** this is one of the few lip balms that I have that has SPF (25) in it, and since I've started using sunscreen on my face I definitely want to extend it to my lips as well. I bought a 3-pack of these for around $13 with different flavors, my boyfriend took the Natural Mint and my mom took the Lemon Basil. All of the scents are pretty strong, but you don't taste them as much on your lips. The texture of it from the tube feels something like Carmex or Vaseline, but it's more smooth and not as oily. My boyfriend likes that it doesn't leave a glossy sheen on his lips, and it's nice to have a lip balm that goes on matte without drying. This balm lasts really well on lips, moisturizing and protecting them. Besides the sunscreen, the main ingredient is petroleum and there's some oils and beeswax as well. ***I rate it 4.5/5, because it's still just a tad sticky for me haha.***\n\n**Fresh Sugar Rose**: I am very disappointed in this lip balm. For the price of $24, I was expecting a lot. The balm has some benefits, like SPF 15 and the different colors you could choose from for a light tint. The rose color is probably their most popular, and it gives me a nice subtle color on my lips. However, I found that I can only use this on my lips when they are already smooth and moisturized. If I tried to use it on dry lips, it would make the dry skin pill up and collect in the middle. This is a lovely balm to put on after your lips have been scrubbed and when you want some color but don't want lipstick, but otherwise it feels sticky and not moisturizing at all. ***I rate it 2/5 because of the nice tint, but the horrible moisturizing abilities.*** \n\n**Vaseline Lip Therapy in Cocoa Butter:** this was about $2 and has a subtle scent of cocoa. I wanted to try the creme brulee, but couldn't find. Every night before I go to bed, I apply normal Vaseline to my lips and wake up with smooth lips. I had problems with very dry lips during the day and heard good things about this tiny version, so I decided to get it for on-the-go application. I  don't like that it comes in a little jar, because I feel disgusting sticking my finger in there and smearing it on my lips. This also feels more thin than the normal Vaseline. It moisturizes well throughout the day, but I have to re-apply it often with the gross finger method. Ultimately, I'm going to keep this at my boyfriend's place to use at night when I don't have my normal Vaseline with me. ***I rate it 3/5 because it moisturizes, but doesn't last long on the lips and I don't like the application method.*** ",

    "body": "I bought the FAB Ultra Repair Intense Hydration Cream because it said it was safe for sensitive skin. I have a couple of moisturizers I use so I hadn’t been consistently using only this. I had been having an allergic reaction on my face from time to time and I couldn’t figure out what it was. Mind you, I take many meds and have autoimmune disorders so finding out what’s making me feel weird is pretty hard for me. \n\nIt took me a long time by using a process of elimination to figure out it was the FAB moisturizer. My medications have been stable. My disorders are currently in check. I started using one product at a time to see if I could find the culprit. 2 nights ago, I applied only this product on my face and a little bit down my neck. As soon as I woke up, it felt like my face was on fire. My whole face was red and covered in tiny bumps and small whiteheads. I had this reaction on every part of my skin where I had applied it. \n\nIt’s been 2 days and I’ve been too afraid to use anything else. All I’ve been doing is washing my face and letting my skin calm down. It’s VERY dry and flaky. I looked up reviews from beauty websites that carry the product and found MANY one star reviews stating they changed the formula for this product at some point in 2021 and added eucalyptus oil. Many people seem to have had the same allergic reaction. I’ll attach a picture from the morning when I woke up and one from the day after so you can see the havoc it wreaked on my poor skin.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/OffzT52\n\nUPDATE: I went to see a derm and he prescribed Elidel. I’ve been putting it on twice a day for a week and now my skin looks so much better, I can’t believe how quickly that helped. Here’s an UNFILTERED pic: https://imgur.com/a/49Qn0d9",

It may not be a big deal for a lot of people, but I can catch a faint whiff of it. Now I love me some minty scents, but not on my face if I can help it. \n\nIn my case, luckily, it did help my skin quite a bit, but I didn't want to push my luck. I'm sorry it gave you that reaction. FAB does have a handful of nicely formulated products, albeit overpriced, but goddamn if it doesn't have flat out perfume it's got fucking eucalyptus 😑\n\nIt's an overrated brand with almost half it's products potentially problematic for sensitive skin for the reasons stated above. There's way better moisturizers out there.\n\nEdit: Note: BTW, as far as I know it's always had eucalyptus oil, I'm very familiar with this cream as I remember being pissed 9 years ago about them adding it to a moisturizer they are marketing toward sensitive skin. They must have changed some other things in their formula, but FAB has always sucked in putting in fragrance.",

Companies that greenwash tend to throw in essential oils willy-nilly for marketing hype without any actual care for what it does to their formula - like adding citrus oils to SPF (citrus causes photosensitivity, thereby negating some of thr SPF's effectiveness), or adding menthol to eye products for that cooling sensation (it's an eye irritant that stimulates tears because your body is literally trying to flush it out and away from the eye - but the tears are lower quality and your tear film is in worse shape once the irritant is gone).",

Especially if they are worse just before or after sleep.\n\nI work in allergy industry and based on feedback and talking with clients these are the simplest ways! \n\n1. **Encasements:** Use anti-dust mite covers on pillows, mattresses, and blankets to create a barrier against mites. Wash bedding weekly at 60°C to kill mites on the surface.\n2. **Remove Carpets:** Replace carpets with hard floors like wood or tiles, as carpets trap dust mites. If removal isn't possible, vacuum frequently and use a dust mite spray.\n3. **Reduce Humidity:** Maintain indoor humidity below 50% using dehumidifiers. This environment dehydrates and kills dust mites. Avoid indoor air drying, especially in humid conditions.\n4. **Air Purification:** Use a HEPA air purifier to capture dust mites and allergens. It should run continuously and include a carbon filter to remove harmful pollutants.\n5. **Remove Fabrics**: Reduce fabric items in the home which harbor mites, such as rugs and fabric sofas. Opt for leather or hard materials and wash items like toys regularly.\n6. **Cleaning Protocol:** Wash items and use eucalyptus oil sprays to kill mites. Clean from top to bottom to capture all dust, and keep a regular cleaning schedule for all areas, especially bedrooms and bathrooms.\n\nEdit - for the people asking for recommendation on a good encasement- The one i recommend is here -   DustMiteTreatment.Com",

    "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nTo start off, this is a anti-acne cleanser by an India co, Yuderma - I have been using this for 2 months+. My dermatologist who I saw for my first acne appointment in years, recommended AHA glow face wash but I asked her for an alternative. I had already used it for a month and frankly it left my skin too dry, had no effect on blackheads and minor acne. She then recommended Acnelex. I went to the pharmacy and checked out the Ingredient list:\n\nhttps://ibb.co/m976JxN\n\n*Aqua, Decyl Glucoside,* ***Potassium Azeloyl diglycinate, Mandelic Acid, Salicylic Acid, Oatmeal powder, Green Tea Extract, Aquaxyl, Kaolin, Witch Hazel, Tea Tree Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Bisabolol, Eucalyptus oil, Spearmint oil Sodium Gluconate.***\n\nI thought this was too good to be true, they claim that the  ***Potassium Azeloyl diglycinate (Azelaic cid)*** and ***Oatmeal*** in the formula are procured from UK  & Swiss labs (The ingredient list on their website seems older & in need of update)  I still went in with zero expectations.\n\nIts a creamy cleanser like Cerave or Krave Matcha Hemp; you need to activate it with water and it lathers slowly. It cleans VERY WELL, Unlike AHA Glow which leaves skin dry with a soapy tackiness. During this time, I was using Azelaic Acid 10% on active inflammatory acne so I can't vouch for its anti-acne action but they claim on their website that it combats mild acne. I started Tret for cystic acne a month after I started using this. It is very gentle, very soothing and very very hydrating, I use this day and night.  Skin looks really refreshed and clean, inflammation is diminished and before I started Tret this really removed and helped bring oiliness down. My face feels plump and plush after using it, quite the opposite of what cleansers like Neutrogena and Clinique have done in the past. For the first month I was only using a rose toner, plain aloe vera gel, sunscreen and Exazel N for scars because the cystic & inflammatory acne was soooo active and terrifying. It was puzzling, I was super hydrated and not dry after cleansing.\n\n I looked up Aquaxyl\n\n>Aquaxyl™ offers the 3D hydration hydraconcept for circulation of moisture throughout all skin layers and boosting of hyaluronic acid. The skin barrier is reinforced in 24 hours by limiting water loss. Results are softer smoother skin in 28 days with normal desquamation and smoothing of fine lines. Aquaxyl™ strengthens the skin barrier, promotes healthy differentiation of the epidermis and refills the internal water reservoirs (hyaluronic acid, ceramides and aquaporin boosters)\n\nThe only other face wash that has been on par is the Krave Match Hemp one, its is super hydrating and soothing for oily skin with a tendency for pores and persistent mild acne. Quite often oily skin also tends to be inflamed, which leads to excess sebum and acne; ironically most anti acne cleansers aggravate it. I used the Krave cleanser but didn't repurchase because its too pricey and customs add to it. Acnelex is the closest dupe I have found to it.\n\n**Moreover**\n\nI underwent a laser and 2 peels during the past 2 months and after each I was told not to wash my face for 3-5 days in case my skin would get red, peeling, inflamed etc , no actives or moisturisers to allow for desquamation. BUT I was also asked to wear a sunscreen everyday. I just couldn't follow this instruction. I was not to use oils because the dead skin need to dry and come off, so I couldn't use an oil cleanser or Cetaphil which which would also soften cells. I used Acnelex after a day, smaller quantity and very gently.\n\nIt did NOT cause any discomfort on raw, post. treatment skin! Perhaps the *Oatmeal,* *Green Tea etc*. are in higher dose or of good quality but it was a breeze. It actually felt very soothing and conditioning and I now think my post service bounce back might have been due to washing my face twice a day - this cleanser actually feels really soothing & calming the more inflamed your skin is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRetail Price: 699.",

To get around the paywall, cut, edited and pasted.\n\nEdit:  from LA Times\n\n**Los Angeles apartment owners race to add luxury amenities**\n\nTenants enjoy custom-designed cabanas and one of two pools at the Circa complex on Figueroa Street in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nCompetition for tenants who can pay top rents has grown so fierce that landlords are loading up their new buildings with goodies unheard of in years past when a swimming pool and laundry room were considered ample enticements for renters.\n\nIn a new downtown Los Angeles apartment complex, residents could be found on a recent hot Friday afternoon washing their pooches in a dog park that offers separate runs for large and small breeds. It’s just one of the tenant amenities on a sprawling 2-acre deck that unfolds like a garden courtyard eight stories above Figueroa Street at the towering Circa complex.\n\nMusic from hidden Bose speakers changes with locations and intended moods, from classical to pop to dance music as tenants move on flagstone walkways among heated gazebos, gas Viking-brand barbecue stations with tables for group get-togethers, a lap pool for working out and a round pool flanked by well-appointed blue cabanas where casually clad tenants watch television while poking at their digital devices.\n\n“It’s pretty sweet,” acknowledged tenant Kevin Frampton, who was standing in the pool with a can of beer, reminiscing about watching the British Open golf tournament while lounging in one of the haute huts.\n\nThe custom-designed wood-and-canvas cabanas, which will soon have refrigerators, “are each worth the price of a car,” landlord Scott Dobbins said, “but they are a marquee for the project.”\n\nDobbins oversaw construction of [the $500-million Circa complex](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-circa-dtla-apartments-20181005-story.html), where twin 35-story towers provide residents with views of the downtown skyline and sometimes as far as Catalina Island. Circa’s massive block-long video display across from Staples Center can turn night into day on Figueroa Street with its bright, pulsing Nike commercials.\n\n“You almost can’t build a project without a dog park now.”  Scott Dobbins, landlord\n\nTo help fill its 648 apartments, Dobbins’ Hankey Investment Co. and its partners splurged on communal spaces such as a wine-tasting bar and a quiet library where shelves are filled with books arranged by the color of their covers. There are yoga and spin cycling classes for residents.\n\nAs is growing more common in high-end residential buildings, the gym is lavishly appointed with the latest equipment and occupies its own glassed-in building on the plaza instead of being tucked in a windowless corner. Every day an attendant puts fresh washcloths scented with eucalyptus oil in a cold refrigerator for people who want to mop their brows while exercising.\n\nAbout a third of the tenants have dogs, Dobbins said, so it’s important to design new buildings with space for them to play, do their business or get shampooed by their owners.\n\n“You almost can’t build a project without a dog park now,” he said.\n\nNone of this comes cheap for tenants. Rent for a one-bedroom unit starts at about $3,000 a month at new fancy buildings like Circa, where popular, bigger units of 1,900 square feet cost about $7,500 a month and penthouses hit $25,000.\n\nThe over-the-top perks stand in sharp contrast to a tight rental market that has become increasingly unaffordable for the average person.\n\nBecause few can or want to pay such rents, owners of deluxe buildings turn to ever more swanky amenities to attract well-heeled tenants and keep them renewing their leases, said economist Richard Green, director of the [USC Lusk Center for Real Estate](https://lusk.usc.edu/about/usc-lusk-center-real-estate).\n\n“New luxury stuff is having some trouble leasing up, so they have to compete with one another,” Green said. “Their calculus is that it’s more profitable to compete on amenities than by cutting rents.”\n\nSo far, builders are finding a receptive audience, he said.\n\n“I don’t know how many people are out there who can afford $3,000-a-month rent,” Green said, “but for the time being it’s sustainable.”\n\nAt the Pearl on Wilshire apartments near the Wiltern Theatre, communal-style Korean barbecues are a popular draw for tenants who want to cook dinner together or with their guests.\n\nThe new Talaria in Burbank’s Media District is on top of a Whole Foods market that has its own restaurant and pub. Tenants can request to have a prepared dinner or other Whole Foods groceries dropped off in their refrigerators.\n\nWith a call to the concierge, residents can have their clothes picked up, dry cleaned and hung in their closets. Each unit has a full-sized washer and dryer.\n\nThere is a top-of-the-line theater with 34 plump reclining seats where tenants can make reservations and choose from hundreds of movies to watch with a few computer clicks. Sometimes residents come together there to watch popular television shows, such as “Game of Thrones” or “The Bachelor.”\n\nThe gym has saunas, locker rooms, a hair salon and dry bar for hair straightening and blowouts . There is also a pet salon to go with the dog park and a plush rooftop lounge wired with televisions, music, heaters, fire pits and an open-air kitchen.\n\n“What we tried to do was create a community that would allow you to address your daily issues without leaving the property,” developer Michael Cusumano said. Also, there’s that competitive edge.\n\n“We wanted to set ourselves apart,” Cusumano said, “and there is no other product in this particular market that comes close in project amenities.”\n\nTenants such as professionals from Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center, people from Warner Bros. studio and empty-nesters pay top-market monthly rents ranging from $3,300 for a one-bedroom to about $6,000 for a three-bedroom unit, he said. A penthouse unit could cost as much as $18,000An artist's rendering of a planned $400-million apartment and retail complex at 5411 Wilshire Blvd. in the Miracle Mile district of Los Angeles.\n\nLos Angeles developer Walter N. Marks III has seen the trend and plans to up the ante at a $400-million [luxury apartment skyscraper with Art Deco styling ](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-miracle-mile-luxury-residential-skyscraper-20190529-story.html)that he plans to build in the Miracle Mile district of Los Angeles.\n\n“It’s very expensive to build, especially high-rises,” Marks said, which prompts landlords to set their rents high — and justify rents that in many cases exceed the cost of a monthly home mortgage payment.\n\n“When tenants pay these higher rents, they wonder what else they are getting besides the view,” Marks said.\n\nIf tenants like the gym, they don’t have to pay for a membership elsewhere, but proper fitness centers are just a given now. At Marks’ proposed 371-unit complex on Wilshire Boulevard near the coming La Brea Avenue subway stop, he plans to experiment with a range of millennial-friendly comforts including what he called a “robust” co-working space that tenants may want to use in lieu of renting an office.\n\nTenants who drive will step out of their cars and leave them to a robotic system that will park them underground and charge them if they are electric vehicles. There will also be a room for parking bicycles.\n\nThe 42-story tower will have an outdoor deck on the fifth floor big enough for a park with trees, flowers and a perimeter walking trail overlooking the city. There will be two swimming pools, barbecues and a dog exercise area with enough room for professional dog groomers to ply their trade.\n\n“Some people groom their pets as much as every week because they sleep in their beds,” Marks said, and he expects about half the residents will have animals. “Pets are huge.”\n\nIn addition to a gym, the building will have a two-lane bowling alley, a virtual reality gaming room, a golf simulator, dog-grooming space, demonstration kitchen, wine-tasting counter, billiard room and yoga studio. On the 42nd story will be a private rooftop garden and lounge.\n\nThe mix of features may take some fine tuning, Marks acknowledged.\n\n“If the gaming room doesn’t work out, we’ll find another use,” he said. “Maybe it becomes a podcasting studio, or a sound room where people can do recordings.”\n\nLike other owners of upscale apartments, Marks plans to host events intended to entice tenants away from their electronic devices into communal activities such as bowling leagues, movie nights and backgammon tournaments. There will also be more high-minded events such as forums on astronomy or social inequities such as homelessness that may be open to visitors.\n\nAnother feature growing more common in the fancy new buildings are lockers to collect Amazon-style deliveries, or messengers who will place them inside your unit if you allow them access through your electronic door key.\n\nRent at the deluxe [Argyle House ](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-argyle-house-2018021-story.html)completed in Hollywood last year includes package shipping service and weekly hotel-style tidying up by a housekeeper. Other services such as hanging flat-screen televisions, assembling furniture and walking the dog can be ordered at additional costs through a phone app.\n\nSuch attentive services including concierges are pushing Los Angeles into a realm previously associated with high-rise living in dense urban centers like New York and Chicago, Marks said. “We are now at a place where people want doorman buildings.”\n\nSo the competition to come up with new features will continue.\n\n“There is a ratcheting up because there is this race to get your place occupied,” Marks said. “Maybe if you get it right and your amenities are really thoughtful and well planned, tenants will stay longer and not jump ship for the next shiny building.”",

Making them is trivial**\n\nThe number one obstacle preventing me from switching to homemade products was actually making them.\n\n“Who has time for that anyway?”\n\nIn reality, making the products has proven to be embarrassingly simple.\n\nNone of them take me more than 10 minutes.\n\nAnd most of them last me for weeks.\n\n(I wish I had known this sooner.)\n\n**2. Making them is rewarding**\n\nThe search for greater health is in itself therapeutic.\n\nDeciding to detoxify my hygiene products has given me control over a part of my day I left to so-called ‘experts’ in the past.\n\n(And they might as well be—just with different incentives.)\n\nIt is something I take some pleasure in now; a kind of self-experimentation.\n\nThis obviously isn’t a substitute for achieving sovereignty in other (bigger) areas of my life, but it’s also not nothing.\n\nThese things pile up quicker than we think.\n\n**3. Making them is cheap**\n\nMost of the products I make contain items I already used on a regular basis:\n\n* Filtered water\n* Coconut oil\n* Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)\n* Baking soda\n* Apple cider vinegar\n\nI already had these things in my pantry anyway.\n\nThe total cost for each, compared to store-bought products, is pennies on the dollar.\n\nI haven’t done the math, but I know for a fact I’m saving money by making them.\n\nYou’re just going to have to trust me on this.\n\nAt least until I do the math.\n\n(Maybe one day.)\n\n# Some Recipes\n\nHere are my three favorite recipes for three homemade products:\n\n**1. Toothpaste**\n\nThis simple formula is antibacterial, antimicrobial, antifungal, and antiviral.\n\nYou just need:\n\n* 1 cup of melted coconut oil (you can melt it by doing a simple bain-marie)\n* 1 cup of either sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) or, even better, arrowroot powder (it’s less abrasive)\n* A few drops of peppermint oil and/or eucalyptus oil\n\nMix all the ingredients and pour them into a glass jar. The coconut oil will harden, and you can simply use a dab of the mix onto your toothbrush.\n\n**2. Moisturizer**\n\nWhen it comes to moisturizing your face, as bizarre as it may sound, beef tallow (i.e., beef fat) is a fantastic option, especially when it comes from grass-fed cattle.\n\nBesides having ‘pro-metabolic’ vitamins (A, D, E, and K), the fatty acid composition of beef tallow is very similar to that of human sebum.\n\nBeef tallow is:\n\n* 40% saturated fatty acids (SFAs)\n* 50% monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs)\n* 4% polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)\n\nHuman sebum is \\[R\\]:\n\n* 38-45% SFAs\n* 45-47% MUFAs\n* 10-12% PUFAs\n\nThis makes tallow very compatible with the fats your skin naturally produces.\n\nIf you can buy refined beef tallow, you can follow this recipe to make a tallow balm:\n\n* 1 cup of melted tallow, preferably from organically raised, 100% grass-fed beef\n* 1/4 cup of the most decadent and luxurious EVOO you can find\n\nSimply melt the tallow with a bain-marie, wait for it to cool a bit (but not harden), mix in the EVOO and add it all to a glass jar.\n\n**3. Hair Mask**\n\nThis is baby-work; simply:\n\n* Crack a pasture-raised egg into a bowl\n* Add 5 g of EVOO (optional)\n* Whisk it good\n* Massaging it onto your scalp and hair\n* Let it rest for 5 minutes\n* Rinse it well with very cold water (unless you want to become an omelette)\n\nYou can do this hair mask every 2 weeks or once a month.\n\nIt is better and cheaper than 90% of toxic options out there.\n\n*Voilà*.\n\n# What’s Next?\n\nMy detox journey began as a side-product of a bigger quest: learning how to maximize my physiological potential.\n\nThis is partly what I write about, as I attempt to uncover what makes up a modern Renaissance Man (not in the scholarly sense, but in the original one: a *uomo universale*).\n\nIf that sounds right up your alley, you can [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ProjectImpero) as I document my journey.\n\nTalk to you there.\n\nUpwards,  \nYago",

        "body": "A few years ago a friend recommended me his dentist and his girlfriend was pretty stoked since she recently went there as well. *Who's stoked about a dentist?*\n\nHe started of with an intake conversation about dental habits and how much I cared about my teeth and all that. He then went on to explain how bacterial growth in your mouth works and why brushing 3 times a day for 2 minutes is worse than brushing just once, but good.\n\nThe idea is that you're only brushing the easy to get to parts and your mouth is quite capable of cleaning those by itself. By cleaning better and longer you get rid of everything. Getting rid of everything once a day is just fine. He's got 3 steps:\n\n1. Take a normal toothbrush and on the outside of your teeth go from red to white. Top teeth you go down and bottom teeth you go up. Doing this on all teeth removes larger pieces and stops you from rubbing them in the grooves.\n\n2. Preferably use an electric toothbrush and brush everywhere. Close your eyes and go woth the sensation. Extra attention for spots where your gum meets your teeth as well as behind your back teeth. Don't forget the back of your front teeth (much easier electric). This should take about 4-5 minutes.\n\n3. Use an interdental brush (interprox is good, start with the smallest pink ones. Move on to orange and stick with it or adapt if necessary). Going between your teeth is weird at first, but there's always stuff there. Getting rid of food is one thing, but it's mostly to rustle up the bacteria. This kills the anaerobic bacteria that cause damage.\n\nNeither my friend, his gf or my gf have stuck eith this routine, but exceptions aside, I hate it when I don't clean well and I feel the difference. Maybe it's ocd, maybe it's all bull, but I'm loving it and spreading the word!",

If you don't want the  lettering on the keycaps, it will come off with methylated spirits or eucalyptus oil I think, it's already rubbing off from a moderate amount  of use.I will throw in a magnetic USB cable - you can see the adaptor for the cable in the pro micro in the pictures.\n\nI'd prefer to give the keyboard to someone suffering from / trying to cure RSI issues if possible, as I've had issues for 20ish years and would like to be able to help out someone in a similar situation.\n\nAlso, if you ever find you're not using it or don't like it, please pay it forward and find someone else to give it to (and ask that they do the same if they stop using it) so it's not just sitting around somewhere.\n\nThanks!\n\n\\-------------------------\n\nUsed a random name picker as didn't know how choose otherwise, this is the result:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/57tx8m4azi6c1.jpg?width=968&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb3b674e68d23f454d83f93cd7b543ff83c254b0",

    "body": "I've been using this bad boy as part of my sunscreen arsenal for the past few months and I'm almost empty. For reference, my skin is combo/super dehydrated in winter, and annoyingly sensitive. I've come to realize that eliminating the majority of fragranced products from my routine has helped my skin tremendously. I can tolerate essential oils in moderation, but I prefer to avoid them if possible. I overwhelmingly prefer physical sunscreens (Drunk Elephant Umbra is an HG for me) as my skin adores zinc for its healing bounty. But sometimes in a rush (or when reapplying throughout the day) physical screens are a pain in the ass, so it's nice to have something cosmetically elegant to slap on and go. Some chemical sunscreen exceptions that I keep around are Cosrx Aloe and Shiseido Senka Anti Aging. I hated Biore Aqua Rich and the Missha All Around Safe Block Essence. They apply like a dream but leave my skin kind of filmy but dry from all the alcohol and the chemical filters burn my eyes, which is obviously an issue when driving. \n\nI decided to try the Neogen because at the time it was $17 on amazon and because around December my skin started to feel dehydrated from physical blockers. Neogen is one of those midrange Glow Recipe/Soko Glam-hawked K Beauty brands I'm normally hesitant to try and those wine and lemon peeling pad things that Youtubers rave about makes my skin angry just thinking about. But based on reviews, this sunscreen seemed to be on the more moisturizing side of the sunscreen spectrum, and the price was right. It also contains more than your run of the mill sunscreen in terms of potential antioxidant benefits from extracts and soothing ingredients like beta glucan. Then again, it also contains a bunch of essential oils with potential for serious irritation. Because of the inclusion of citrus EO's, I would also not use this on a super sunny day that requires me to be outside for long periods, but more of an easy running around sunscreen that's simple to press into my skin and wear dashing in and out of buildings in dreary weather.\n\nIngredients:\nWater, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Hexanediol, Isoamyl P-Methoxycinnamate, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glyceryl Stearate, Peg-100 Stearate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Phyllanthus Emblica Fruit Extract, Rubus Idaeus(Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Carbomer, Lippia Citriodora Leaf Extract, Rosa Damascena Flower Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Angelica Archangelica Root Extract, Beta-Glucan, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Artemisia Absinthium Extract, Arnica Montana Flower Extract, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Alumina, Gentiana Lutea Root Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Litsea Cubeba Fruit Oil, Citrus Limon (Lomon) Fruit Oil, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Wood Oil, Disodium Edta, Potassium Hydroxide, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis(Orange) Oil, Aluminum Stearate\n\nThis sunscreen is like a lightweight lotion that glides over a slew of other layered products quite well and sinks in almost immediately. It kind of reminds me of a hydrating emulsion, similar to the Muji Sensitive Skin High Moisture Milk. The essential oil-induced smell is distinctly Tang, so I was sure it was artificial (looking at the ingredients doesn't seem like it though). Thankfully the smell fades quickly. I'm willing to be more forgiving with fragrance in sunscreen because it's so difficult to avoid and also because I've already layered healing unfragranced products that feel like they've cocooned my face. \n\nI may be alone here, but I love a thick, protective film of sunscreen on my face and personally a good, not chalky whitecast festival zinc-rich cream makes my face feel protected and sealed and gives me a healing glow (I often finish my night routine with LaRoche Posay Cicaplast or Avene Cicalfate). The DE Umbra does this for me, and if it were SPF 50 and the slightest bit easier to apply, I'd wear that motherfucker every day. Alas, a girl can dream. This does not provide that same protective-feeling film and obviously doesn't calm redness the way zinc does for me, but it was surprisingly non irritating and not dehydrating in the least. \n\nThe Neogen has a dewy finish which fades over time, but if you hate dewy, you may hate this. I've experienced zero irritation or burning as can sometimes happen for me with chemical UV filters. No eye burn either. I can layer it twice with no issue or gunky sheen, I've tried it over a serious mega routine or alone for when I'm really in a rush to take the dog out or grab coffee down the street. It works both ways. I have yet to find foundation that doesn't make me look like a coked up lizard in winter so I cannot attest to its ability to sit well under makeup, unfortunately. It's not enough moisture on its own in winter but for combo skin could be an option as a standalone moisturizer for summer. Then again, I spend more time outside in summer and I don't want a bunch of photosensitizing ingredients in my sunscreen.\n\nVerdict: This is pretty lovely as far as application and texture, but nowhere near an HG. It was under $20 on amazon when I purchased in December. It's now $26. I would definitely not purchase at this price, and would probably not repurchase in general. I much prefer the Cosrx Aloe and Shiseido Senka, which are far cheaper and get the job done. If I need antioxidants, I can snag them elsewhere in my routine. \n\n\n",

    "body": "I never attended a summer camp when I was little. I missed out on swimming in a lake, learning to canoe, and ghost stories around a campfire. My childhood was very solitary and was filled with books and hiding when my parents fought about money. The chance to meet other children and escape from my family issues would have been a welcome opportunity but I had to wait until college to attend a camp. If I had known what was in store for me I would have happily avoided it. \n\n\nI went to college in the Pacific Northwest but I was born and raised in Hawaii. Camping in Hawaii was a little less common but Boy and Girl Scouts had traditional camps littered around the island. I spent the day at the Boy Scout Camp once, as my dad knew the man who maintained the property. It was right on the beach, the high surf splashing up feet from the mess hall. Falling asleep to the sounds of the ocean waves must have been soothing for the boys, away from home. The Girl Scout Camp was close to the house I grew up in, in the middle of a huge eucalyptus forest, up in the cloudy mountains. The difference between the two camps was jarring but I thought the Girl Scout Camp a little more authentic to the experience that I'd seen in movies and read about in high school coming of age stories. \n\n\nI said earlier that I attended camp, but I guess that would be a bit of an exaggeration. During a harrowing game of King's Cup one night near the end of my junior year of college I won the round of I Never by saying I had never attended camp. My drunk friends erupted into cries of how I'd missed out on childhood and how we had to rectify the situation. Over the next few weeks we had paid for a week's stay at the camp in the forest and my friends were gleeful about not only fixing this problem for me but the chance to go to Hawaii. The first few days we spent sunning on the beach and drinking Mai Tais at hotel bars were everything my friends had dreamed Hawaii would be. But as we drove to a higher elevation we entered the Hawaii I knew for so many years. \n\n\nThe camp was at the end of a long road, the pavement cracked and bumpy from years of neglect. A faded sign at the gate proclaimed it as Camp Piiholo and though I had been here before my stomach twisted with the excitement. We drove our rental cars through the gate and went past the long cabins, each with the name of native Hawaiian plants. We parked next to the mess hall and my friends burst out of the car, shouting excitedly. Arianna, a former gymnast, did a quick succession of cartwheels in the tall grass and Maddy, who had been a camp counselor in high school, sprinted to the mess hall, keys in hand. \n\n\n\"We should get the food inside so we can get everything started!\" She said, unlocking the door. \n\n\nI nodded dutifully and unlocked the trunk of the car I'd driven up. I lugged the cooler out and passed it to Lee, the one who had been adamant about this whole trip, who was looking thoughtfully at the sky. \n\n\n\"I think it's going to rain,\" She said, the dark clouds above us swirling in the sky. The four of us began unpacking the cars and hefting our food supplies into the mess hall. As I was lifting a case of beer up the steps the sky opened up and it began pouring rain. Arianna slammed the trunks shut and ran up the stairs, shaking herself off as she got up to the porch. \n\n\n\"We made it just in time,\" Arianna said, looking out at the rain thumping on our cars. \n\n\n\"The boys are going to have a hell of a time getting up here in the rain,\" I said, biting my lip nervously. \n\n\nThe guys we were all dating were flying in this afternoon and were driving up in the evening. The girls and I had wanted a few days on our own to lay on the beach and oggle surfer guys. \n\n\n\"Come on Heather, they'll be fine,\" Arianna said, gently pushing me into the mess hall. \"I still have cell service and they'll call if they have any trouble.\" \n\n\nI had always been a little bit of a worrywart and gently chided myself as we lit the gas stoves and set about making macaroni and cheese and grilling hot dogs. When my friends had conceived the idea for this trip my mind had run wild with all the possible things that could go wrong. The whole camp set on fire, trees crushing us all while we slept, a multiple car crash on the drive up; the scenarios went on and on. Rain wasn't one I had planned for and as we ate lunch I put back a few more beers than I normally would have during the day, desperate to calm myself. The guys still hadn't turned up and the other girls were starting to get a little worried too.\n\n\nI walked to the back of the kitchen, my empty beer cans in hand. I dropped them in the bin we'd set aside for recycling and I glanced at the door the lead from the kitchen to the back of the camp. The rain was still falling and I shivered a bit; it was colder in the kitchen than I thought it would be. As I turned something on the floor caught my eye. At the bottom of the door, tracking in through the kitchen were wet footprints. They were very large, as if someone dripping wet had walked through recently. None of us had been through here recently and the door to the outside was still locked. \n\n\nI followed the footprints, bolstered by liquid courage, and they lead into the room with the dish pit and the stacks of huge pots and pans. They stopped by the mop sink, the footprints larger than any of the others, as if the soaking wet person had stood there for some time, the water pooling around them. I looked around, puzzled. There was no one in the room with me and the footprints didn't leave the room; they just ended strangely here. I backed away from them, the hair on the back of my neck standing on end. This was way too weird. \n\n\nI backed up into someone, and the person wrapped their arms around me. I screamed, and tried to break free. The person started laughing. \n\n\n\"Hey there! Heather calm down. Did I scare you that much?\" I turned around and was met with the mischievous grin of Robin, the guy I was dating. \n\n\nI punched him lightly in the chest. \"Asshole,\" I said, kissing him quickly. His firm arms wrapped around me and travelled south a bit. I pulled away, laying my head on his chest. \"I thought I saw something weird before you scared me and nearly gave me a heart attack,\" I said teasingly. \n\n\nI looked back at the foot prints and frowned. I really wasn't sure what was going on with them and they creeped me out but honestly, in Robin's arms all my fear and worry seemed silly. He always managed to comfort me when I was scared. \n\n\n\"The only weird thing I can see is the fact that you still have clothes on,\" He said, giving me a smouldering look that made me blush.\n\n\nWe hadn't been dating that long but the way he could distract my worrying mind was always comforting. With his piercing blue eyes and muscled body it was honestly hard to focus on anything else when he was around. Somehow he always managed to take the things that worried me off my mind. He kissed my neck and I giggled, pulling him to the door in the kitchen. I yelled to my friends not to look for us and ran outside. \n\n\nThe rain had stopped and the sun was setting behind the remaining clouds. Fog was rolling in and the rain was pooling on the dirt paths leading to the different cabins. The air had a distinct smell of eucalyptus oil and rain as I ran to the showers. There was a large open field next to the mess hall and on the edge of it, behind all the cabins, were the shower stalls. I kicked off my sandals as I entered them, pulling on the hanging light. The water sputtered a bit as I turned it on and ran freezing cold for a solid minute, which we used to undress each other. He pushed me into the stream of water and as we frantically moved together I thought I heard someone crying. The sound was quickly covered by my own cries of pleasure and all I could focus on was the guy I felt so lucky to have. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nWhen we returned to the mess hall we found that my friends had cleaned up and were sitting on the porch, snuggled up in their respective couples. I felt a rush of embarrassment for having run off so obviously to fuck but no one said anything. Arianna handed us some beers and we sat together on the porch talking about who had breakfast duty. Maddy suddenly panicked about the possibility that we wouldn't have enough coffee to last us the trip but I reassured her that we brought more than we could possibly use. Sitting with my friends and laughing about how Robin had scared me in the kitchen, I couldn't believe I had been so scared of those footprints. I couldn't even be sure that they were footprints. Maybe the roof was leaking. Maybe one of the girls had spilled something while I'd been pounding beers. Whatever it was I shrugged it off. \n\n\nAs we retired to bed I was glad we'd decided to sleep in different cabins. After all the beers we were all being a little too touchy feely with our respective boyfriends and I didn't want to relive freshman year, trying to pretend to be asleep as Maddy and her boyfriend loudly had sex on the other side of the room. Robin and I opened the door to the Ohia cabin and hurriedly pushed the twin beds together. We spread out the blankets and a wave of sleepiness hit me very suddenly. I've always struggled to sleep in strange places so this was very encouraging. As Robin pulled me into his arms I felt sleep take over me. \n\n\nI awoke later to a rhythmic pounding. I rubbed my eyes and cursed my friends. It seemed impossible that they were having sex loudly enough, cabins away, to wake me up. I shifted and faced Robin, who was looking at me, a look of terror on his face. A chill swept through me; I'd never seen him afraid before. He gripped me tightly and I could feel his hands trembling. \n\n\n\"Those are drums,\" He said.\n\n\nI strained to hear and realized he was right. Were the girls playing music this loudly? It seemed impossible and the drums were all we could hear, no other music. I wanted to go investigate but I'd also never felt so afraid before. I tried to move but my fear kept me in place. The drums pounded continually but the sound didn't get closer. Gradually they tapered out, as if whoever was playing them was moving away from us. We lay in bed, clutching each other even after we could no longer hear the drums. Somehow we were able to fall back asleep but I had troubling dreams of crying women and rain.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn the morning I lay quietly in bed while Robin slept. I turned the events of last night over in my mind, trying to figure out what had happened. Had we been dreaming? The idea that we'd heard drums pounding in the night just seemed too strange to me. If I had been the only one awake last night it would have been easy to dismiss the whole thing as an incredibly vivid dream. I had a history of these vivid dreams and had once experienced sleepwalking during a stay at Arianna's house once. But I couldn't get the fear I'd seen in Robin's face out of my head. We'd both been awake, experiencing the same thing. \n\n\nWhen he woke up he kissed me and held me tight, as if he was afraid I would disappear. We hadn't been dating that long but I knew we both felt a deep comfort in each other, something that helped in this moment. He didn't mention the events of last night, as if he was trying to will them from existence, as we got dressed. He just seemed quieter and more somber as we left our cabin. Lee and her boyfriend had been the ones to take on breakfast duty and I could smell coffee as we walked to the mess hall. Inside I drank the black coffee down and ate the blueberry pancakes they had made with relish. \n\n\nThe normal motions of the morning, drinking coffee and eating breakfast, made what we had experienced last night seem all the stranger. No one mentioned the drums as I helped myself to seconds of pancakes and bacon. I felt silly and strange as everyone talked about how well they had slept. Robin and I exchanged a puzzled look when Arianna, who notoriously suffered from insomnia, talked about how she'd slept the night through without taking sleeping pills. This was unheard of. \n\n\n\"You all really had no trouble sleeping last night,\" I finally asked, incredulous. \n\n\nThey all looked at me like I had sprouted an extra head. My friends explained, at length, that it had perhaps been the most restful night of sleep they had ever gotten. And their boyfriends agreed with them. Robin sat silently and I stared at them in disbelief. \n\n\n\"I'm sure you two didn't sleep very well last night,\" Lee said wryly, looking at us both. \"You guys just need to stop pawing each other and maybe you'll sleep tonight!\" \n\n\nI frowned but didn't want to argue with them. I helped the girls clean up the breakfast dishes and puzzled over everything in silence. They were all eager to explore and go swimming in the man made pond up the trail in the forest and I couldn't help but agree. It had rained the day before but the sun beat down mercilessly. Jumping in some cold water sounded perfect. \n\n\nWe gathered our things and trekked up to the pond, Robin and I bringing up the rear, me drinking a mimosa, him silent and thoughtful, which was uncharacteristic of him. I stopped as our friends turned a sharp corner in the trail, looking at his back. \n\n\n\"Hey,\" I said, making him stop. He looked back at me curiously. \"I know you heard those weird drums last night and you're fucking freaking me out with how quiet you've been. You haven't been rude to Lee at all today so something must be wrong.\" The two of them had never gotten along. \n\n\n\"Everyone else didn't hear them,\" He said, glancing over his shoulder, as if to make sure they couldn't hear him. \"But I know what I heard and I've never been so afraid.\"\n\n\n\"Why didn't anyone else hear them?\" I asked, continuing down the path. \"They were pounding so loud it felt like the whole cabin was trembling.\" \n\n\n\"I have no idea. But they way your friends are acting, Arianna not needing her sleeping pills...\" He trailed off, and I shuddered involuntarily. \"I think something bad is going to happen tonight.\" \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI don't really know why we stayed at the camp after that conversation. Our w0rry about our friends? Not wanting to seem crazy? Whatever it was, I still don't understand how we managed it. Robin stayed stone cold sober as I drank what must have been an entire bottle of champagne worth of mimosas. When alcohol was involved I was pretty adept at avoiding things. I lay in the sun, desperate to try and regain the tan the Pacific Northwest had stolen from me, and Robin kept close to me. Nothing seemed wrong with my friends. They didn't seemed drugged or like different people. They just hadn't heard the drums, the drums which woke me up from dead sleep.  \n\n\nThe six of them played in the pond and I envied them their playfulness and their lack of fear. I felt a niggling in the back of my mind, like something trying to tell me something. I felt like I knew what was happening, like it was a distant memory, but the more I tried to reach for it the further away it got. I groaned in frustration, cursing my alcohol consumption which probably wasn't helping. My friends and their boyfriends were now at the far end of the pond, leaving Robin and I alone on the grass. He lay next to me and I cuddled next to him, the gentle rise and fall of his chest calming me. \n\n\nThe wind blew through the trees and rustled the grass. It was peaceful, but a feeling of dread overcame me. I could hear women crying suddenly, making me jump up. We were alone at the camp and there weren't any houses or anything close to us. I had chosen the camp because it was so isolated, wanting to have an escape from the city life that we were used to. Robin must have heard it too because he snapped up, looking around. At least if I was going crazy it wasn't happening to me alone. \n\n\nThe crying became frenzied, the women wailing and shrieking, like a mourner's procession. I spun around, looking at the trees, expecting to see hysterical women tearing at their hair and clothing. I couldn't see anything and the crying only got louder and louder. I yelled across the pond at my friends that something was wrong but I couldn't even hear myself over the crying and screaming. It was so loud that it felt as though the women were right behind me, their cries making my ears hurt. \nAnd suddenly it was quiet. All I could hear was the wind through the trees and the sound of my friends frantically swimming over to me. I looked at Robin and he was pale, trembling, and wearing an expression of fear that I'm sure was on my face as well. My friends reached us and looked at us, confused. \n\n\n\"What the fuck were you screaming about?\" Maddy asked, looking confused. \"Nothing's wrong except the two of you are acting weird.\" \n\n\n\"You seriously didn't hear anything?\" I demanded, holding my hands together to stop them from shaking. \"You didn't hear women crying?\"\n\n\nThey all looked at me with confusion, Lee rolling her eyes dramatically. \"I think you need to lay off the booze and sleep off whatever is going on.\" \n\n\n\"Seriously Heather,\" Arianna said, with obvious concern in her voice. \"Nothing is wrong and nothing has been wrong all day. Just...Look, we'll head down in an hour or two to make lunch and we'll do everything. Go take care of yourself.\" \n\n\nI gaped at them and mouthed wordlessly. I couldn't believe what was happening. I turned around and stumbled as I picked up my things. My friends were muttering behind me, and I stomped away from them Robin following close behind me. He tried several times to stop me and talk to me but I was fuming. When we were down the trail and came in sight of the camp I burst into angry tears. \n\n\n\"Hey hey hey,\" Robin said, pulling me tightly into his arms. \"Whatever is going on you're not alone. You're not going crazy. Something is happening and you're not just imagining it.\" He kissed me forehead which only made me cry harder. \"Your friends don't see it but I know something crazy is happening here. I know it Heather.\" \n\n\nI couldn't stop crying and he lead me to our cabin where I sat down on the bed and cried in his arms. Again, as I wept, the nagging sense that I knew what was going on crept into my mind. It was a memory, like something from elementary school. Was it a game or a story? Trying to remember it just made it seem further and further away and I sighed, wiping away my tears. \n\n\n\"I want to leave, Robin. Every reasonable part of me is screaming for us to run to the car and get out of here,\" I paused and sighed. \"But I can't let something happen to the girls. I'm not stupid. I'm drunk and have no idea what's happening. But I just couldn't live with myself if something happened to them. \n\n\nRobin nodded grimly. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe ate lunch and did silly kid things like make friendship bracelets and crafts that I'd miss out on by not attending camp as a child. It was almost comical, the innocence of what we were doing and the absolute dread that followed me around as I wove a flower bead into my bracelet. Maddy was giddy as I finished mine and presented it to her, tying the one she had made around my wrist. Trying to explain to my friends what was going on wasn't working, and was backfiring on me. Somehow, pretending that everything was fine was working. I mean, of course the sense of doom wasn't going away but my friends were important to me and spending time with them had always made me happy. \n\n\nThe sun set in a stunning show of reds, yellows, and pinks as we made tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches. We made a fire and roasted marshmallows and made s'mores. It was almost easy to forget what had gone on last night and earlier at the pond but as we turned in for bed I clutched Robin's hand, my knuckles white. We lay down on the bed, over the blankets, waiting. The mix of all the alcohol I'd consumed and the constant state of fear I'd been experiencing all day finally must have knocked me out. I curled against Robin and fell asleep. \n\n\nThe drums woke me up, the cabin lights blazing and the sounds shaking the walls. I bolted up in bed and screamed. The pounding of the drums made it hard to think and my mind tried to wrap its way around what I was seeing. Men and women, their skin deeply tanned and covered in loin cloths and feathered capes were walking through the walls of our cabin. There were so many of them, carrying spears and torches and drums. I finally remembered what my mind had been trying so hard to grasp. These were Night Marchers. \n\n\nWhen the ancient Hawaiians built their temples, they often built them far from the sea, up in the mountains. They would travel from the ocean to the heights of these mountains for their religious ceremonies. Night Marchers were the imprint of these people, their spirits, continuing their march in the afterlife. The camp must have been built in the path of these Night Marchers and I wondered how many Girl Scouts had been terrorized by these spirits. Beside me Robin was looking upon the figures in terror. I wanted to look away but I was transfixed by them. The drums seemed to fade away as the last of the ghostly figures walked through the cabin.  \n\n\nWe sprang out of bed and ran to the door, watching the procession stop in the field. The torches blazed and an unsettling silence fell over the whole camp. A broad, muscled figure pointed to something I couldn’t see and a group of men walked away, holding spears and clubs. I held my breath, terrified that the ghostly men had been sent to hunt me down. They returned to the field, my friends in tow. Their hands were above them, being pulled along by the impossibly tall and imposing ghosts. My friends were sleepwalking, I realized. Looks of contentment and peace were on their faces and I remembered how peacefully they said they had slept the night before. Why were they unaffected by the ghosts who now claimed them?\n\n\nMy friends were dropped before the tall figure and he looked at them with disgust. He began chanting and I wanted to run away, fear compelling me, as the women in the group began crying. Their shrieks were the same as those we had heard earlier by the pond, hysterical and mournful. They were mourning for my friends, mourning for what was about to happen. I realized what was going to happen the second before it did, as the figure’s chant ended and the men who had fetched my friends beat their heads in with a deft swing of their clubs. I screamed and screamed as the figure began chanting again, drums punctuating the beat of his chant. Robin was pulling me to my feet and I couldn’t stop screaming and crying. \n\n\n“We need to leave, Heather,” He barked at me, and he pulled me along, as the figure continued chanting, cheers coming from the field. \n\n\nWe ran until my sides ached and I couldn’t breathe. I stopped, panting and crying as Robin hugged me tightly. The road to the camp had been mostly deserted but there was a small group of houses at the main road and I was surprised to see that we had reached them. The closest one had its porch light on and I ran to the door, pounding on it. We had to get help for my friends. A light flicked on in what must have been the bedroom and a minute later the door opened, a wrinkled Hawaiian woman greeting me. \n\n\n“Honey girl, what you stay doing out so late?” She asked, the Pidgin she was speaking giving me a glimmer of comfort. \n\n\n“We were at Camp Piiholo and--” \n\n\nHer shriek cut me off and she quickly crossed herself. “That camp is nothing but pilikia, girl,” She said. “It’s trouble girl. Built in the path of the Night Marchers.”\n\n\n“I know,” I said, my eyes pricking with tears. “We saw them and--” \n\n\nShe again shrieked and crossed herself. “Come inside and we’ll sort you out.”\n\n\nI told her about what had happened with my friends as she sprinkled salt over the two of us. Hawaiian salt, she said, would protect us. She called the police and gave us a glass of whiskey to calm us down. \n\n\n“There was nothing you could have done, girl,” she said after I had cried myself tired, drinking the whiskey. “That camp is built in the path of the Night Marchers and you and your friends were trespassing. You were interfering with their ceremonies and they had to get rid of your friends; they were not from here. They were invading the space of the temple.” \n\n\nWhen the police arrived Robin did most of the talking and they drove us back to the camp, though I protested forcefully. The ghostly figures were gone and my friends lay in the center of the field, their heads bashed in. The police grimly searched the camp for something that matched the shape of the weapon used but they couldn’t find anything. They also noted how the expression on my friends’ faces still appeared pleasant and happy, even in death. While they had slept in what had to be another night of the most restful sleep they’d ever gotten, they had been murdered by something not of this world, something that fiercely protected the land that had birthed it. \n\n\nWhen I returned to the Pacific Northwest I quietly withdrew from college and never completed it. I stood wordlessly as eulogies were read for my friends, the speaker never knowing exactly what to say, for the events surrounding their deaths were still so confusing and unexplained. I know, though, that some places are not meant to be disturbed. Some places are still imbued with power, a power that will remove those who invade.\n",

She was the one to help me find the right cleasning product for me.\n\nHibiclense generally just didn't work for me nor did Benzoyl Peroxide. It seemed to make it worse before it made it better.\n\nHowever, my mom introduced me to Noxzema. It is a cleansing cream that helps with acne. Though used as a facial wash i use it on the areas I have/am breaking out on. I've had immediate or next day relief after using this. (For the girls who use this be careful not getting too much on your ladybits. It'll get on it anyways with the water running down your body and you'll know cause It'll feel \"minty\" down there but just make sure not to get any inside and rinse thoroughly!)\n\nI use a 12oz of Noxzema and add:\n▪︎Vitamin E Skin Oil 14,000 I.U.\n▪︎10 drops of pure Tea Tree oil\n▪︎10 drops of pure Eucalyptus oil\n\nI also use Dial antibacterial moisturizing soap to wash with before I use the Noxzema.\n\nI also use coconut oil as a lotion post-shower because it has scar- alleving abilities and helps with chaffing.\n\nI hope this helps someone :)\n\nEdit: I'd also like to add that when I use the Noxzema mixture I massage it in with exfoliating gloves in the shower for deeper penetration as well as getting rid of that dead flakey skin the boils can come along with.\n\n It isn't a requirement though and if hands or rag alone works for you keep doin you!",

Depending on how much water and clay you add, the colour ranges from a light blue/grey to almost black. When these are well combined, add the acid/oil mixture and stir very well. \nApply as needed!

    "body": "After limping around for days due to an incoming boil in my groin which i could only surmise was going to be especially large, i got fed up and decided to try \"Vick's\" (actually a salve called Mentholatum because there is no Vick's where i live, but the ingredients are suspiciously similar, comparison in the bottom of my post) for the first time. I lathered it on a bandage in the morning, taped it on, and my god, the pain relief was INSTANT. I go through my day thinking i've finally found a pain reliever that actually works, and go to bed with the \"vick's\" bandage on too. Before i went to bed, i checked the general area, and saw that the rather dramatic swelling and inflammation in the surrounding skin that had been building up over the past few days, had gone down entirely! \n\nThe next day, and i don't know what i was doing, suddenly it hurt *intensely*. I go to change the bandage, figuring that maybe it's burst already - i don't want the camphor on the bandaid to get into the wound if i can help it. But when i lift the bandage off, i discover that i am now the proud owner of my very first blood blister. It's bleeding slightly, so i very gently wipe it off, and eventually all the blood has drained. One last gentle swipe to make sure i got it all and uh, the entire blister-covering skin came off. Beneat it is that empty gaping hole that a drained boil usually leaves behind, but no pus anywhere in sight, not when i was trying to wipe away blood either. \n\nI bandage it again (no salve this time) because i still need to get through the rest of my day and i'd like to do that as painlessly as possible, but it's still bleeding, so i change it again 3 hrs later. This time, there is a hardish white spot where that drained boil hole is, kinda like a picked open pimple i guess, and part of the white stuff has also stuck to the bandage when i lifted it off. Liberal and lengthy use of hot compresses + a hot shower did absolutely nothing to it, so i bandage the area again. 3 more hrs, new change. This time, the bandage pulled with it all of the weird white stuff, leaving just that 'drained boil hole' look again. It's bedtime and they heal best when they breathe, so i don't cover them up, nor did i cover this one up - and now, it looks like how a boil regularly looks after it's burts except there is no swelling and no painful inflammation, just a generally bruised look - and it's well on its way to closing! \n\nIn my (27F) 6 years of living with this absolute bastard of a disease, i've never had my boils \"behave\" like this. For starters, i was terrified that i would now have a permanently draining-and-filling blood blister smack dab front and center on my hoohah, but i guess since the blister is gone and the skin is healing, it's gonna be fine? I'll pick scarring over groin blood blisters each and every day of the rest of my life 😵‍💫 and second, i've never seen a boil where the pus is hard and needs to be, well, essentially picked out i guess? And thirdly, the entire \"this boil is not a boil anymore\" flattening out of the skin after it had been swelling and starting to look \"boil-ish\" was so out of left field?? It didn't go away gradually over many days like they sometimes do, it just.. went flat?? What?? \n\nAnd i have so many questions now. Firstly, has anyone else experienced anything like this? I've been reading on this sub for quite a while and never seen anyone mention a flat boil with just a little bit of hard pus that won't really drain on its own, but maybe i haven't looked the right places. I had no idea this could happen. \n\nDid i fuck up with the blood blister - could i have made something really bad happen and just got lucky this time? Or did i just accidentally figure out a way to make blood blisters go away? Is it safe to continue to use my salve if this is what's gonna happen?\n\nWhat if the pus isn't actually gone, just buried in there somewhere, and it's gonna come out slowly and be hard and unmovable because i interrupted the process that boils \"like\" to follow ==> i'll end up with an eternally opening-and-closing wound?\n\nWould it have been different if i applied Vick's instantly when i saw the boil coming, instead of letting it build up for 4 days first? Like, maybe there wouldn't have been any pus at all? Does the inflammation or the pus come first? Maybe if we somehow manage to kill off the inflammation once it starts, we can keep the boils from developing and bursting, once they start to form??? \n\nI thought i should share this experience, since i haven't seen it mentioned anywhere else, and knowledge is power, and maybe it can even help someone. I'm so sorry that this became really long, i really tried to keep it consice, but it's been a weird couple of days. Thank you for reading this far, and keep up the fight, we've all at least got each other 💪💕\n\n\nTLDR; tried Vick's / Mentholatum on a closed-skin boil for the first time, worked great for pain relief and inflammation and swelling but made some really strange things happen later. I'm now confused w/alot of questions and worried and slightly hopeful.  \n\n\n\nAnd here's the vick's / mentholatum comparison i promised! \n\n\nVick's VapoRub\n\nCamphor\nMenthol\nEucalyptus oil \nPetrolatum\n-------------------------------\n(+ a bunch of inactive ingredients that i couldn't seem to track down)\n\n\nMentholatum\n\nCamphor\nMenthol\nEucalyptus globulus leaf oil\nPetrolatum\n-------------------------------\nabies sibirica needle oil (antiseptic, anti-inflammatory) \nlinalool (antimicrobial, aroma)\nlimonene (antioxidant)\ntocopherol (antioxidant)",

    "body": "I discovered this subreddit today and it has been a calming presence after testing positive for COVID-19 just 3 days ago. Its hard to determine how long I’ve had COVID-19 or at which stage of the virus I’m currently residing, but after putting the puzzle pieces of symptoms together, this is a rough outline of my experience so far. \n\nMy earliest sign of possible symptoms began on June 22nd. I woke up with what I thought was a crick in my neck and pain in my back from sleeping in my classic “kinda on my stomach, kinda on my side” sleeping position.  A few days pass, and the pain was relentless. Still, I assumed it was from a combination of sleeping wrong and overdoing it during my at-home workouts.  I’m turning 30 this year, so maybe this is just what a rough night of sleep and star crunches feels like now. \n\nJune 24th: I notice a tickle in my throat and occasional cough, and chalk it up to allergies. It’s summer, cottonwood and pollen is visibly blowing past my window. An itchy throat and sniffle is nothing I haven’t been through before.  My neck and back are still sore, and workouts are becoming more difficult to get through. \n\nJune 27-29th:  the tickle in my throat has become irritating, and the coughing more regular. I’m having a hard time falling asleep, and blame it on a new brand of melatonin + anxiety about what my future looks like after 3 months of being unemployed.  My neck and my back still hurt. \n\nJune 30th-July 1st: I’m hot, I’m tired, and my energy is low.  My temperature is slightly higher than usual, but not alarming, and it’s bordering 100 degrees Fahrenheit outside. Saharan dust has blown in and I’m pretty sure I have a sinus infection.  I have an intense pressure behind my eyes and in my forehead. \n\nJuly 2nd: I open a tub of Vick’s to help ease my presumed sinus infection symptoms. I can’t smell it. I try a bottle of eucalyptus oil, peppermint oil, I even waft bleach towards my face. Nothing.  Food has no taste, just texture. This is the final straw that causes me to book an appointment to be tested for COVID-19. \n\nJuly 3rd:   I test positive for COVID-19 and almost 11 days of separate symptoms that I’ve excused as being everything from allergies to anxiety begin to make sense. I’m exhausted, my head is throbbing, and my chest hurts. \n\nJuly 4th-6th:  I’m frustrated, I feel ostracized and guilt-tripped by anyone I’ve had even passing contact with in the past month. I feel foolish for making excuses for so many symptoms. Posts on social media say that contracting COVID-19 is natural selection for the irresponsible. I’ve worn a mask when getting groceries, and have only hung out with a small gathering of friends twice since April, all of whom have tested negative and have no symptoms.  I didn’t expect the toll COVID-19 would have on my mental health. \n\nMy symptoms come and go. I wake up feeling fine and go to bed with a pounding headache and sore muscles, only to find myself unable to sleep for hours.  I thought I was feeling better, but found myself completely exhausted after an hour of cleaning my apartment, and then the headache returned.\n\nI know this is a long post, but I needed an outlet to express how grueling the last 2 weeks has been (physically and emotionally). If you’ve read this, thank you. I am processing this day by day and know that I will make it to the other side, hopefully sooner rather than later. \n\nIf you’ve tested positive, I hope my story helps you feel less alone. Keep your head up and allow yourself the time to rest and recover.  We’re in this together.",

Not sure who they belong to, seems they come at night and no one on our street has this kind of cats. Neighbors that have cats, they are house cats and so fat they not interested in being parted from their food bowls.   \nI do not want to hurt the cats, just encourage them vigorously to get the fuck away from my place.   \nTried vinegar, various smelly things, even vicks, Vaseline, coffee grounds, citronella, lavender, eucalyptus oil etc....  Sensor driven sound emitter works for couple of nights and then they are back, even pissing on it when battery run out.  \n\n\nAny better ideas ?",

    "body": "Hi everyone with really bad hayfever - here is a list of all the things I have found which have helped and do help. Many will probably be familiar but hopefully some things of help to someone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Serious desensitisation - not for everyone but on the two years where I spent hours every day working outside my hayfever was bad, but not as bad as one might expect considering I was literally bailing hay. I have found it only really works with lots and lots of persistent outside exposure.\n2. Chlorphenamine - There are more anti-histamines out there than the standard \"1 a day\" citerizine. I have found Chlorpehanmine to be an effective OtC medication, if you can put up with the drowsiness. There are prescription only drugs too - though you have to make a fuss to your doctor.\n3. Taking more than the recommended dose of antihistamines - I'm not a doctor so I'm not going to comment on this but many serious sufferers take a higher than recommended dose of antihistamines.\n4. Asthma Inhaler - If like me you have shortness of breath and constricted chest that is Allergic Asthma and it is horrible and can be serious. You really need to see your doctor and they will prescribe you a  Bronchodilator inhaler for immediate relief.\n5. Barriers - Sunglasses work. The less pollen in your eyes the better. I don't go out without them.\n6. Washing constantly - wash you hands, wash your face, if you have long hair like me wash it as much as possible, or keep it in such as way that it will not collect pollen. You can get facewipes suitable for regular use (often branded as \"hayfever wipes\") which can be used if you are out an about.\n7. Changing clothes - If you go outside and come back in change your clothes. You will be carrying lots of pollen with you and the easiest way to reduce your symptoms is to get rid of all that pollen.\n8. Change your bedding - Pollen collects everywhere. I find that changing my pillowcase a lot, every every day,  helps with sleeping since it inevitably collects all the pollen that falls our of my hair.\n9. Hoover/Vacuum - especially in your bedroom. The less dust and pollen the better, seriously.\n10. Eyedrops - Instant relief from the hell of itchy eyes. If you have trouble applying eyedrops as I used to I have a method I use which is to apply them with eyes closed. If you tilt your head back and close your eyes then put a drop in the inner corner of your eyes you can then open your eyes and blink the solution around. It means you don't need to drop directly into the eye.\n11. Eyespray/eyemist - You spray your face and eyes. Can provide instant relief from itching.\n12. Nose spray - the absolute worst, but if you get 100% congested nose it can *sometimes* be one of the only things that can unblock it.\n13. Extra strength Menthol chewinggum - I swear by this 100%, particularly Airwaves. It blasts your sinuses with Menthol and Eucalyptus oil enough to clear them. I chew constantly.\n14. Fans - yep, fans. I find that a constant blast of air when I'm working at the computer does wonders, and it keeps you cool since you naturally have the windows closed.\n15. Kenalog  - For around £75 you have a significant chance that a single injection will clear up all symptoms for the year. I have not had it, but people who have swear by it.\n16. Some obvious don'ts - Don't dry your clothes outside (they collect pollen), don't come into contact with freshly mown grass (during hayfever time aerosol-ed grass juice can be just as bad or worse than pollen, causes me to have horrible rashes), Don't let your pets in your bedroom (both because they gather pollen and also because during hayfever time other allergies can appear/worsen)",

I live in Ontario, Canada btw.\n\nTL;DR I got scammed $3500 CAD by PayPal themselves (no, not a vendor using paypal, but paypal themselves). Looking for financial/legal advice, I am even seeking to escalate this to court or a lawsuit if I don't get my money back. Keep reading if you want to hear what happened.\n\nI just opened the account for the first time in March, and was using it to buy products for online retailing (simple things like neem oil or eucalyptus oil which you can get on ebay). I made the mistake of using a user name in the name field, which shouldn't be a problem, you just verify your identity/submit a scan of your drivers license and some banking statements and you're good to go, right? Apparently not. It makes no sense because it is an honest accident that I imagine many people make, and I entered it as my business name (not my personal name). There was no activity in the account prior to March 25th, and one of my withdrawal requests got approved. I tried several times with PayPal to verify my account but my documents (which were perfectly valid) got rejected for increasingly ridiculous reasons:\n\n1. First time my payment got denied I submitted a scanned copy of my ID, utility bills, bank statements, etc. I got approved, my account was reinstated, and I successfully withdrew 770 CAD on April 1st (see 2nd image).\n2. After second payment, on April 1st, I got two emails from PayPal, one saying \"eCheck Payment Denied\" and the other saying \"request for more additional info\", which required me to send CRA tax returns, property tax assessment, resubmit utility bills/credit card statements, and my HST number for my business. I submitted scanned legible documents for all of these within 24 hours of receiving the email (see 3rd image).\n3. Got two emails on April 2nd from PayPal. Said my verification documents were \"rejected\" because the name didn't match that on my PayPal account (paypal username was \"S\\*\\*\\*\\* S\\*\\*\\*\\*\"). The proof of financials was rejected as well for this reason, but I got both overturned, however it took hours of calling and haggling with them. I had to get them to manually approve my request to change my PayPal name to my legal name. (see 4th and 5th image)\n4. April 7th, got a bizarre email from [complianceverifications@paypal.com](mailto:complianceverifications@paypal.com), stating access to my account was restored, but I was still blocked from withdrawing my money, and the email mistakenly referred to me as \"C\\*\\*\\*\\* M\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* O\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\", which isn't a name I know or ever heard of. None of my submitted documents state that name at all. I had to call them back again and explain this was a mistake and that I still did not have access to my PayPal. (see image 6)\n5. April 12th, got an email from PayPal with the correct stated name, saying that access to my account was restored. Immediately after receiving this email I tried for a third (and final) time to withdraw my money. (see image 7)\n6. April 14th, PayPal finally emailed me back saying they rejected my verification documents again (despite them all being valid according to support workers on the phone), saying this time the document \"does not have a company logo\". This makes absolutely no sense because the only accepted documents are CRA tax returns or property tax assessments, none of which allow me to put my \"company logo\" on them. It seems like it was intentionally designed to be impossible to verify myself, and that they are deliberately making excuses not to let me have my money back. It honestly felt very malicious and targeted at me directly, especially since my account was unbanned/restored by their phone support staff, and then this decision was overturned something like 2 or 3 times. They are basically trapping me in a neverending loop and making me go through increasingly impossible and absurd lengths just to verify my identity. After this last email, whenever I log in to my account I get a big warning notice saying \"You can no longer use PayPal anymore.\" (see images 8 and 9)\n\nI feel like I have exhausted myself and all my options are failing, and they are simply refusing to return the money. I am worried that even after the 180 day holding period is over, they will still refuse to give it back due to these ridiculous verification requests (which they will inevitably reject, since they seem to have an excuse every time). I just don't know how to help the situation. I have even consulted with a paralegal and discussed filing a lawsuit against PayPal. I am asking anyone for legal or financial help. Can I sue them if I don't get my money back?\n\nI am thinking of taking these posts elsewhere on social media, and putting PayPal on full blast for their refusal to give me back my money. This was a new account, just opened this March, and this was my first time ever trying to make any transactions on it. All this because I entered a username instead of a real name. It seems like an honest mistake anyone could make. What if an elderly computer user in their 70s misreads the registration form and accidentally inputs a username? What if a foreigner/immigrant who is not very good with English enters the wrong name by mistake? Not only do they get banned for life, but they have to pay for their mistake with a 3500 dollar fine? It is absolutely ridiculous and my blood is boiling. I can't believe such a large company is so dysfunctional and mismanaged. I am NEVER using PayPal ever again.",

What can I do to get it back?**\r\n\r\nOriginal Post: \r\n\r\n>  \n> \n> Long story below. Links to all images here:  [https://imgur.com/a/GORIad0](https://imgur.com/a/GORIad0) \n> \n> I'll narrate what happened so it goes along with each image.\n> \n> TL;DR I got scammed $3500 CAD by PayPal themselves (no, not a vendor using paypal, but paypal themselves). Looking for financial/legal advice, I am even seeking to escalate this to court or a lawsuit if I don't get my money back. Keep reading if you want to hear what happened.\n> \n> I just opened the account for the first time in March, and was using it to buy products for online retailing (simple things like neem oil or eucalyptus oil which you can get on ebay). I made the mistake of using a user name in the name field, which shouldn't be a problem, you just verify your identity/submit a scan of your drivers license and some banking statements and you're good to go, right? Apparently not. It makes no sense because it is an honest accident that I imagine many people make, and I entered it as my business name (not my personal name). There was no activity in the account prior to March 25th, and one of my withdrawal requests got approved. I tried several times with PayPal to verify my account but my documents (which were perfectly valid) got rejected for increasingly ridiculous reasons:\n> \n> 1. First time my payment got denied I submitted a scanned copy of my ID, utility bills, bank statements, etc. I got approved, my account was reinstated, and I successfully withdrew 770 CAD on April 1st (see 2nd image).\n> 2. After second payment, on April 1st, I got two emails from PayPal, one saying \"eCheck Payment Denied\" and the other saying \"request for more additional info\", which required me to send CRA tax returns, property tax assessment, resubmit utility bills/credit card statements, and my HST number for my business. I submitted scanned legible documents for all of these within 24 hours of receiving the email (see 3rd image).\n> 3. Got two emails on April 2nd from PayPal. Said my verification documents were \"rejected\" because the name didn't match that on my PayPal account (paypal username was \"S\\*\\*\\*\\* S\\*\\*\\*\\*\"). The proof of financials was rejected as well for this reason, but I got both overturned, however it took hours of calling and haggling with them. I had to get them to manually approve my request to change my PayPal name to my legal name. (see 4th and 5th image)\n> 4. April 7th, got a bizarre email from [complianceverifications@paypal.com](mailto:complianceverifications@paypal.com), stating access to my account was restored, but I was still blocked from withdrawing my money, and the email mistakenly referred to me as \"C\\*\\*\\*\\* M\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* O\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\", which isn't a name I know or ever heard of. None of my submitted documents state that name at all. I had to call them back again and explain this was a mistake and that I still did not have access to my PayPal. (see image 6)\n> 5. April 12th, got an email from PayPal with the correct stated name, saying that access to my account was restored. Immediately after receiving this email I tried for a third (and final) time to withdraw my money. (see image 7)\n> 6. April 14th, PayPal finally emailed me back saying they rejected my verification documents again (despite them all being valid according to support workers on the phone), saying this time the document \"does not have a company logo\". This makes absolutely no sense because the only accepted documents are CRA tax returns or property tax assessments, none of which allow me to put my \"company logo\" on them. It seems like it was intentionally designed to be impossible to verify myself, and that they are deliberately making excuses not to let me have my money back. It honestly felt very malicious and targeted at me directly, especially since my account was unbanned/restored by their phone support staff, and then this decision was overturned something like 2 or 3 times. They are basically trapping me in a neverending loop and making me go through increasingly impossible and absurd lengths just to verify my identity. After this last email, whenever I log in to my account I get a big warning notice saying \"You can no longer use PayPal anymore.\" (see images 8 and 9)\n> \n> I feel like I have exhausted myself and all my options are failing, and they are simply refusing to return the money. I am worried that even after the 180 day holding period is over, they will still refuse to give it back due to these ridiculous verification requests (which they will inevitably reject, since they seem to have an excuse every time). I just don't know how to help the situation. I have even consulted with a paralegal and discussed filing a lawsuit against PayPal. I am asking anyone for legal or financial help. Can I sue them if I don't get my money back?\n> \n> I am thinking of taking these posts elsewhere on social media, and putting PayPal on full blast for their refusal to give me back my money. This was a new account, just opened this March, and this was my first time ever trying to make any transactions on it. All this because I entered a username instead of a real name. It seems like an honest mistake anyone could make. What if an elderly computer user in their 70s misreads the registration form and accidentally inputs a username? What if a foreigner/immigrant who is not very good with English enters the wrong name by mistake? Not only do they get banned for life, but they have to pay for their mistake with a 3500 dollar fine? It is absolutely ridiculous and my blood is boiling. I can't believe such a large company is so dysfunctional and mismanaged. I am NEVER using PayPal ever again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.6319918 & 17/64ths | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

Sida, alchornea, cats claw, black pepper, dried bidens, licorice root, these are also quite good. Eleuthero, rhodiola rosea, cordyceps, schisandra are very good for fatigue, mood, stress and immune modulation.

It can be super overwhelming when you're new to Lyme, so it can be very valuable to have someone that you can trust to oversee the entire treatment. Especially if you're dealing with brainfog that's a barrier to researching DIY treatments.\n\nI definitely came to herbs later on because I went the LLMD route to begin with. When I talked to people with Lyme in the beginning of my illness, they all recommended the LLMD route to me, no mention of herbs, including in online communities. So maybe this bias has been in the Lyme community for a long time.\n\nI'm now 100% comfortable with herbal treatment and have the cognitive capacity to plan an herbal protocol. But yet, in my relapse, I am using an LLMD for all of my treatment because my condition has become so severe that I'm dependent on my parents for things like opening packages and filling pill cases. They don't approve of self-treatment, probably because they are in the medical field but not doctors themselves. At least they're letting me do LLMD treatment.\n\nI do think we should be promoting awareness of herbal treatments, those of us who have the knowledge. I am most comfortable with protocols designed by someone else, which have been used by a lot of people. But I really appreciate hearing from people like you who experiment a lot and report back on what's working for them.

Also used Biocidin LSF at that time, nothing.\n\nI tried the Artemisia w/Cistus Tea protocol, several rounds, no changes.\n\nI take many supps, including NAC, Lauricidin, Glutathione, D3/K2 & cofactors, Chlorella, BSE/Sulforaphane, ALA, probiotics snd others.\n\nTried high dose Vit D for a few months, no changes, so now take 5000 iu daily.\n\nLast month I added Teasel and Ashwsganda; within a week my arms became severly itchy to the point my scratching broke the skin. Discontinued both, as they were the only recently added items, but still no relief yet. (Its been 2 weeks since pausing them.)\n\nI like that our sub wiki has a section on herbs and I do point that out when responding to some. I agree w/ other comments that newly dxd may be overwhelmed at first diving into herbs and/or self treating. It took me a while, after llmd and abx were not helping etc.\n\nSince starting Buhner protocol, I have improved greatly, in seven months. Im not there yet and always looking for things to add. But due to the current itching/reaction, Im not adding anything now.\n\nCurrently reading Buhner’s ‘Herbal Antibiotics’ to determine next steps, but need to resolve these awful itching arms first. That book cites Cryptolepis as killing almost anything!",

After reading Buhner and Rawls books I added Chinese skullcap, American skullcap, Dan Shen and Japanese Knotweed with continued improvement. Now on to cryptolepis and two mixes - NutraBBT and NutraBBS for co- infections prescribed by my LLMD. For each of these, I started with one drop a day, then slowly added a drop each day to get to around 20 drops. I also take tryptophan and monolaurin to help my nervous system. I take My Community mushroom blend for general immune response, and milk thistle for liver protection. I think the key is to add one thing at a time very gradually. Slow process is frustrating, but seems to be working. No advice here, just my experience",

I had early neuroboreliosis and probably babesia, but also bartonella since i was a child that didnt show many symptoms throughout my life. \n\nI can share that oregano, clove, cinammon oils worked great for me. Used them with doxy for a month and now i am doing a break because oregano shouldn't be used all the time, but will come back to them.\n\nAshwagandha and lemon balm have great calming effect but dont make me sleepy and help my energy levels - no burnouts through day. Promoting ashwagandha to all my friends and family.\n\n\nResveratrol from japaneese knotweed helped me almost instantly as i took it with dizziness feeling. It was a life saver. I continued using japaneese knotweed tincture, also cats claw and introducing andrographis. But i recognised that andrographis messes with my hormones (lowers progesterone which is already low) so i might stop using it.\n\nI started slow so now i take only 15 drops 3x a day and have no more symptoms so i wonder should i continue upping doses. I have only 50kg so maybe lower doses are ok. \n\nThing that worries me now are bruises on my leg. That leg was very painful when i was in my acute phase so now i wonder is it herbals doing their job so veins are breaking?\n\nAlso interesting - i never had bartonella marks until i started treating with japaneese knotweed and cats claw. I know these are not bartonella herbals but they are obviously doing something. Marks would show and disappear the other day. On different parts of body. Not every day, but for example the day i had strong cinnamon tea. Or on the day i started using egcg.",

It was also when the rash started which seemed like an ordinary friction rash from improperly fitting clothing during exercise. but last week I developed some very severe symptoms that landed me in the hospital. So to say I'm worried about the resurgence of the rash is an understatement and I've never liked pharmaceutical medicine. I always prefer natural medicine where it's effective.

    "body": "**Supergoop! Play Everyday Lotion SPF 50**\n\nAlright…time to dive into Supergoop! products! I posted a couple of unboxing/haul videos featuring the brand and have been so excited to put each one of their offerings (or at least a majority of them) to the test. My plan is to do a review for each product as I use it and the have an overall review put together by late summer/early fall.\n\nI decided to start with the Play Everyday Lotion SPF 50 as it seemed to be one of their classic products…I believe it might have even been their first release. The brand was launched in 2007 after the founder’s friend was diagnosed with skin caner. Since then Supergoop! has become one of the highlighted brands in Sephora stores. \n\nThis sunscreen utilizes Avobenzone, Homosalate, Octisalate, and Octocrylene as its UVA/UVB filters. Alongside those…Rice Bran Extract and Sunflower Extract make it into the formula as well. Supergoop! products are all free of synthetic fragrance, vegan, and claim to be non-irritating (we’ll get to that last one). \n\nThe Play Everyday Lotion SPF 50 is a medium weight lotion that sits right in the middle of sunscreen consistencies that I have tried. It isn’t a full on creamy/hold’s its shape when dispensed consistency…but it isn’t “runny” either. It just is right in this nice middle ground that I think most people will be fine with. Once applied, the product smooths out nicely and does have a slight water-y effect. Once again…totally acceptable for most skin types as it doesn’t ever feel heavy or greasy nor is it drying or matte. \n\nI have been using this product on my face and body for about just over two weeks and as a body sunscreen…I am very happy with this product. It absorbs nicely and I am totally comfortable slathering it on at least every two hours for maximum protection. On days that I have been outside either jogging, hiking, or rock climbing…I have appreciated how comfortable this sunscreen is to have on throughout the day. \n\nHowever, on the face…things are a different story. Although Supergoop! removed any synthetic fragrance in their formulas, there is a lot of essential oil ingredients to be found here. Rosewood, Orange Peel, Lemon Peel, and Eucalyptus Leaf Oils are all found here and in pretty high concentrations. While this makes for a lovely herbal /spa scent that I don’t mind on my body…my face tended to react to this product with signs of redness and irritation. I don’t think it ever “caused” breakouts…but the blemishes I did have were inflamed/pissed off by me applying the Supergoop! Play Everyday Lotion SPF 50.\n\nEveryone is different, and I’m sure many people will have zero issue with the fragrance ingredients in the formula. It just didn’t seem to agree with my skin (and to be honest there is a chance that something else in the product produced the results I experienced). If you can handle it…this would be a wonderful face sunscreen option and honestly pretty affordable per ounce compared to other offerings out there.\n\nThis will be something that I come back to as a body sunscreen for sure though. I love the texture, feel, and the fact that I can get a HUGE 18 ounce size to haul around with me. I do wish their smaller sizes of this product had the ability to be refilled from the 18 ounce bottle though. But, I’ve had no problem tossing the biggie size (LOL) into my climbing bag or just keeping it in a tote for quick access. \n\nThe Supergoop! Play Everyday Lotion SPF 50 wasn’t as versatile as the brand claims it to be (for me)…but I enjoyed the product and found it to be a really impressive body sunscreen! \n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nActive Ingredients:\n\nAvobenzone (3%), Homosalate (10%), Octisalate (5%), Octocrylene (7.5%)\n\nInactive Ingredients: \n\nWater, Acrylates Copolymer, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Glycerin, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Isododecane, Lauryl Lactate, Cetyl Alcohol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Brassica Campestris/Aleurites Fordi Oil Copolymer, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Cetearyl Olivate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Hydroxyacetophenone, Sorbitan Olivate, Diethylhexyl Syringylidenemalonate, Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil, Chlorphenesin, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Ocimum Basilicum (Basil) Flower/Leaf Extract, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract, Behenic Acid, Cetyl Behenate, Isostearyl Isostearate, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Tocopherol, Allantoin, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dexpanthenol, Pentasodium Triphosphate, Citric Acid\n\nWhere To Buy (Supergoop!

It was a lot lower when my partner and I both traveled and did other things, but now I get to indulge my love of cooking 90% of the time (a perk and a privilege, for sure). \n\n**Dietary Restrictions:** Nothing strict, but we mostly cook and eat vegetarian. \n\n**Occupation:** Strategist \n\n**Location:** New York, NY \n\n**Stores I typically shop at:** Weekly delivery from a farm box subscription (like a CSA, but aggregates different producers), supplemented by my local Key Foods, and other stores, like Whole Foods or a local food co-op, when I can get to them.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Warning: I'm wordy, even after editing this several times.  \n\n**DAY ONE**\n\n7:40 AM: Out of bed and lazing around on my phone petting my cat after feeding him (do other people’s pets require mid-meal attention breaks, too?). My partner (I’ll call him X because that’s fun) is doing some cleaning he put off yesterday. I make us a pot of coffee, brush my teeth, and throw on some clothes for a quick trip downstairs to drink some coffee in the fresh air.\n\n9:00AM: I make our typical work-from-home-in-2020 breakfast: porridge, baby. Today, it’s classic oats with flax seed, Black Oxford apples (from my farm box, these are INCREDIBLE), dates, coconut chips, walnuts, and a bit of maple syrup. \n\n12:30PM: I break to throw together lunch for us—it’s a weird mishmosh of a few leftovers hanging around from the weekend: a tiny bit of a white bean-sausage-kale bake, some brown rice-tempeh-bok choy-shiitake stir fry, and a little side quesadilla with a wheat wrap, pepper jack and hot sauce to round it out. Strange, but tasty, and I love using all my food!\n\n4:00PM: Snack on a mini Tony’s caramel sea salt chocolate (these are way too good) and some homemade sourdough crackers. My cliche 2020 sourdough habit has resulted in a steep learning curve on bread, but hotdamn, these unfed starter crackers may be the best part of it all.\n\n6:00PM: After signing off from work, X and I head to our local watering hole, which has become one of our favorite (only) 2020 activities. We grab a table outside—the fall weather is unseasonably warm. We each get two beers and some pickles (thank you, Cuomo).\n\n8:00PM: Back home, I heat up some leftovers for us—a fun improvised dinner from Sunday night: poblanos halved and stuffed with Rancho Gordo black lentils mixed with kale stems (sauteed in onion and tomato paste), topped with a cheesy squash sauce, all on a bed of more lentil mix. That plus some extra-crispy Adirondack blue potatoes ain’t too shabby for a Tuesday night.\n\n9:30PM: We polish off some trashy Ben & Jerry’s (the Jimmy Fallon one, I hate him, so not sure why I grabbed this one?) from an election week impulse buy, along with some ginger tea.\n\n**DAY TWO**\n\n8:00AM: Out of bed after sleeping in a little—X has the day off and I don’t have any early meetings, plus it’s a rare morning where the cat doesn’t wake us up with excited meow-screams. I thank him for his patience, feed him, and make coffee while listening to *Reply All*. \n\n9:00AM: Drink my coffee downstairs while I sort through some admin work, enjoying the quintessentially fall air on this grey day.\n\n10:15AM: Back upstairs, X has made us breakfast—Bob’s red mill hot cereal (sort of like cream of wheat with allll the bran \\[read: fiber\\] intact) with apples, coconut flakes, walnuts, and a dollop of damson plum preserves.\n\n12:00PM: X is out, and I take a break from the project I’m working on to roast up some veggies from this week’s produce box. I was tempted to treat myself to something in the neighborhood, but, as always, it’s so much more satisfying to eat something home-cooked—plus I’ll thank myself later for doing this prep. I chop and roast a huge turnip and a few sweet potatoes (different sheet pans!) and roast some whole beets in foil. Then I chop and sautee the rest of a bunch of kale with half a yellow onion, and make a weekday go-to during this remote work era—a whole-wheat wrap with a little melty pepper jack, a Dr. Praeger’s Asian veggie burger, and a heaping of kale, sweet potato and turnip. Topped with some scotch bonnet hot sauce mixed with a dash of Texas Pete’s, it’s the perfect multicolored fall lunch. I have a mini Tony’s chocolate afterward and get back to work.\n\n3:20PM: Quick break to peel the beets and put them in the fridge now that they’re cool. I waited a little too long—if you get them while they’re still warm, you can usually peel the skin off with your hands. Alas.\n\n4:15PM: X is home (he grabbed food on the go), and we take some time to chat and grab a couple packages downstairs. One is a box from Bob’s Red Mill, which I’m very excited about! It’s always really overpriced at my local store, so buying direct feels good. I got a 4-pack of dark rye flour for my sourdough starter/breads, some all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, rice flour, rolled oats, yellow popcorn, and pumpkin seeds.\n\n4:30PM: I take my sourdough starter out of hibernation to warm up a little before I feed it, now that I have flour again. I make X and me a cup of chai with a mix from Spice House (from another bulk order earlier in quarantine times—they have really great spices and have a “flatpack” program with free shipping). Per usual, it’s also cracker o’clock.\n\n6:15PM: I run out to the deli to grab some Frank’s so I can make buffalo cauliflower tonight, along with a small bag of Utz’s because it feels appropriately East Coast to accompany the buffalo. I also stop by the wine shop to restock our cooking wine and vermouth.\n\n6:45PM: Start the buffalo cauliflower and we also each crack a bottle of Victoria left over from an outdoor hang a few weeks ago because buffalo = bar food. To go with the cauliflower, I chop some rainbow carrots into sticks and make a quick sauce with Greek yogurt, lots of fresh lemon juice, microplaned garlic, and a little salt + pepper. Also throw together a salad with mixed lettuce, beet, walnuts, goat cheese, and a quick vin of olive oil-lemon-grainy mustard. Serve everything (chips included) on a shared family-style table—love having a meal like this with different components where you pick and dip. We watch *The Wolf of Snow Hollow* and really like it—good comedy with drama undertones and horror overtones.\n\n10:00PM: After the movie we have some “dessert whiskey”—a little pour of 18-year Jameson each.\n\n**DAY THREE**\n\n8:30AM: Downstairs for some standing around drinking coffee in the fresh air—this time, with rain.\n\n10:00AM: X makes us breakfast while I'm head down in some tedious work—toast from multi-grain bread in the freezer with peanut butter, honey, and a sliced apple for me, banana for him (I loathe the stuff). We stocked our pantry/freezer back in March for potential quarantine, and we’ve started dipping into the freezer stuff because a lot of it won’t stay good for much longer.\n\n12:20PM: Quick break to finish the last of the crackers and have a Babybel each. X and I are obsessed with these as a remote work snack. I have a major salt tooth, so always want a little savory bite like this. I also refill water. Haven’t thought to note this before because I’m constantly doing it—I drink a LOT of water.\n\n1:55PM: Phew! Finally can lift my head out of work for a second. I put together lunch for us—the last of the lentil-stuffed poblanos, rounded out with some kale, sweet potato, and turnip left over from yesterday.\n\n2:05PM: Fuuuck, I totally forgot I have a meeting right now. Thought this was my time to quickly eat lunch and then finish something for a 3:00 PM deadline, but my coworker nudges me to see if I’m joining. Luckily they’re tackling another topic first so I shovel thousands of lentils in my face, Mitch Hedberg-style, and then join the call a few minutes later.\n\n3:00PM: Mini Tony’s chocolate while I work.\n\n6:20PM: That day didn’t quit. I take a break and snack on some pretzel sticks. They are very bad.\n\n8:00PM: Done with one last work thing! That took longer than I thought, but glad it’s out of the way. I do a 30-minute pilates video. My obliques…they ache.\n\n9:00PM: We eat dinner made by X--his favorite chili recipe, to which he adds rainbow carrots and poblanos, and uses chipotle chili powder. It’s spicy and soothing! We’re low on bread-y things (a travesty), so he makes us a couple of whole wheat tortillas with melty pepper jack on the side.\n\n9:30PM: I make us seltzer and add fresh lemon juice, and then we have mint tea and a smorgasbord of chocolate squares.\n\n**DAY FOUR**\n\n7:10AM: Ugh, I’m leading an 8am discussion with a client so I’m out of bed earlier than my lazy work-from-home self normally abides. I give the cat his traditional wake-up brushings and pets, then feed him and make coffee.\n\n9:00AM: Session over! X makes us breakfast—hot cereal with Bosc pear, granola, and some damson plum jam on top.\n\n10:00AM: I look at next week’s farm box and make my selections. Today, there are 9 options and I can pick 7—I choose Bosc pears, honeynut squash, mixed lettuce, leeks, black radishes, Lehigh gold potatoes, and dandelion greens. I also add on some typical extras: grass-fed whole milk, bananas, lemons, fortune apples, red onions, garlic, flash-frozen English peas, and pecans. I do some sleuthing in my cooking spreadsheet, updating ingredients on hand and seeing what I might want to cook with next week’s box. I’ve really enjoyed this nerdy approach to cooking/meal planning this year with the farm box—the spreadsheet helps me gather a ton of recipe ideas and lets me track what I have on hand, so I can make the most of all the incredible produce I now get. I decide I can do some sort of potato-leek soup as well as radish salads, and a squash-greens situation of some sort. \n\n12:30PM: It’s Friday, so we decide we deserve a treat for lunch. X picks up sandwiches from a great deli nearby: one with chicken cutlet and prosciutto and another with tuna and broccoli rabe. He also grabs us two of those tiny Italian San Pellegrino sodas: one orange and one chinotto. I almost never drink soda but chinotto is seriously amazing (if you like Campari, it’s like bubbly, non-alcoholic that).\n\n6:30PM: Finally log off, even though I know I’ll have to do some work this weekend. Sigh. X and I head out on a walk, first taking a shot of whiskey to really shake things up. (We used to have fun…we used to see friends…) We grab a to-go beer each (and metal straws to take home!) and then walk through the park drinking and talking. The park is basically deserted and very magical. It’s a crisp fall night. We decide to keep the bender going and stop by one more spot, where we each grab one more beer and some Cuomo chips. We end up chatting to the manager for a while and it feels so nice to talk to new people (even I, a staunch introvert, miss this in 2020). \n\n8:00PM: Back home, I compile the trashy meal I had dreamed up earlier to balance out our drinking—leftover buffalo cauliflower, some frozen potato-cheese pierogies, and the rest of the yogurt-garlic sauce, which is a pretty good sub for the requisite sour cream. We turn on *Happy Death Day*, crack one last beer, and enjoy a sloppy night in.\n\n**DAY FIVE**\n\n8:00AM: Wow, I’m no spring chicken anymore. Feel pretty hungover but can’t sleep anymore, so I get up and feed the cat and then force him to cuddle with me before making coffee. X gets up eventually and we commiserate over being hungover from our very 2020 version of a night out. I decide to make something hearty and rib-sticking for breakfast—cheesy polenta topped with a fried egg and some kale and sweet potatoes. With plenty of Frank’s on top, of course. It truly brings us life.\n\n12:00PM: It’s been a wonderfully lazy morning. The erasure of FOMO has given me the space to really indulge my sloth-like tendencies in 2020—not always for the better. I eventually get up to start a couple baking projects: cornbread using unfed sourdough starter, to pair with the rest of X’s chili, and crackers also using unfed starter, which I’ve been making basically every week since joining the sourdough cult. I also do the regular sourdough feeding after neglecting my lil’ guy last night—I’ve realized he’s pretty hardy, though, and can bounce back like a champ. The cracker dough goes in the fridge to chill while the cornbread goes in the oven—it turns out deliciously! Next, crackers get rolled out and baked. This batch looks especially pretty, in a rustic cheeseboard sort of way. \n\n2:30PM: After snacking on far too many crackers and too much cornbread, we take a walk to a shop nearby that’s having a sidewalk sale. Do some browsing and X grabs a record, while I get a cute pin as a little something to give my best friend. We cruise through the park on the way home and it’s glorious out. Stop to ID some birds (anyone else get into birding this year?) and then back home.\n\n7:30PM: We skipped lunch knowing we'd grab dinner at a favorite neighborhood spot. We’re seated in their backyard, where they have individual heating lamps for the handful of spread-apart tables. Damn, the amount of money and effort all of these restaurants and bars have had to put in is mind-boggling and impressive all at once. Their policy is to order up front, and then they bring you food, to avoid excessive contact. We have some arugula salad to start, and X gets a hot shrimp sandwich while I get ricotta gnocchi, and we share brussels sprouts and shishitos. X gets a whiskey drink and I get some red wine as well. We round it off with a burnt sugar pot de crème too, because why not. \n\n**DAY SIX**\n\n8:00AM: We’re up drinking coffee, and I boil some water to do a face-over-steam bowl (Bueller? Bueller?), with a few drops of eucalyptus oil added, in an attempt to de-stuff a stubborn nostril. It definitely improves things, and leaves me really wanting a facial. I settle for putting some coconut cream on my face to take advantage of those open pores.\n\n9:00AM: I do a YouTube ballet class video by Maria Khoreva—it’s a real ass-kicker and leaves my legs burning! After showering, I heat up a piece of cornbread quickly in the microwave and add a bit of butter and maple to it.\n\n12:15PM: We heat up some chili with melty cheddar and have that for a brunch-y meal with a side of cornbread (plus butter).\n\n3:00PM: After doing some more meal planning for the week, I run out to the grocery store for a few things to round out our produce box: bacon, cream, Oreos, baking chocolate, chocolate chips, tofu pasta (shape of the week: torchiette), peppermint tea, cultured butter, tahini, polenta, and whole-wheat tortillas.\n\n6:00PM: Since it’s already pitch-black out, X decides to start making dinner now, even though we usually eat later. I finish some more work I had to do today (hate).\n\n7:00PM: We eat! Brown rice with sauteed tatsoi, oyster mushrooms, edamame, crispy tofu, and roasted purple radishes, plus a couple of frozen veggie potstickers on the side because the bag was almost out. Topped with ample sriracha, of course. It’s delicious. We watch *Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon*, a meta horror/comedy/mockumentary that ends up being very funny and charmingly offbeat. We drink herbal tea and have a couple Oreos. There’s a really crazy storm outside (edited: we later find out it was nearly a tornado) that we watch with lights off for a while. So grateful to have food and shelter. I am beyond lucky.\n\n**DAY SEVEN**\n\n8:45AM: After a nice loop in the park, we stop by a cafe in our neighborhood to grab a bag of coffee—we have a recurring order with a local roastery, but it’s a bit delayed so we want to make sure we’re stocked. Also pick up two of these amazing everything croissants they sell.\n\n9:20AM: Croissant + coffee while I read through some notes before jumping on a brainstorming call. Soooo delicious. I eat every single seed/salt flake that falls off onto the plate. Just me? \n\n11:00AM: Start a levain for some 100% whole wheat sourdough (from the Josey Baker cookbook), and then do the regular feeding for my starter and put it in the fridge for hibernation.\n\n1:00PM: Work is nonstop today, but I just finished a client presentation that went really well and was proud of my nonstop-talking-for-an-hour performance. X tosses me a Babybel (literally—he’s always trying to get me to be less of a clumsy oaf) and I eat that with a couple sourdough crackers before getting on my next call. I also grab a Bosc pear to snack on once I realize I’ll mostly be on mute on this one.\n\n2:30PM: Lunch, while multi-tasking! We finish off the chili with some more melty pepper jack, and a side of cornbread. I make us some seltzer with fresh lemon juice afterward.\n\n4:00PM: Mini Tony’s chocolate to get me through this hour!\n\n6:30PM: Aaaand officially done. X brings up the produce box from downstairs and I put away groceries before jumping into ballet class (actual live Zoom one this time). \n\n8:00PM: Shower, and then food time. After mixing the levain from earlier into the full dough and starting the stretch-and-fold process, I throw together dinner: salad with lettuce, roasted beet from last week, walnuts and goat cheese with a mustard vin, and a whole wheat wrap with a schmear of buffalo hummus, topped with a veggie burger, the rest of the buffalo cauliflower, more sweet potatoes, and a crumble of Bayley Hazen blue cheese (the best) left over from Biden win/Trump loss park celebration picnic. It’s a very satisfying pile-of-veggies-style dinner that we both inhale.\n\n11:30: Off to bed after finishing my stretch and folds, putting the dough in the fridge for bulk fermentation, and doing my nightly ablutions. Up for a while reading *My Brilliant Friend* as all the neighborhood boys court Lila (I’m absolutely the Lenù in the corner).\n\n**RECIPES** \n\n**White bean-sausage-kale bake**: Riffed on this, adding a full 6oz of tomato paste, a mix of sharp cheddar and mozzarella, kale, sausage, and using from scratch Rancho Gordo cassoulet beans: [https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019681-cheesy-white-bean-tomato-bake?action=click&module=Local%20Search%20Recipe%20Card&pgType=search&rank=1](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019681-cheesy-white-bean-tomato-bake?action=click&module=Local%20Search%20Recipe%20Card&pgType=search&rank=1)\n\n**Tempeh crumbles** from this recipe (the whole recipe is great, too): [https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/peanutty-noodles-with-tempeh-crumbles](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/peanutty-noodles-with-tempeh-crumbles)\n\n**Sourdough crackers**: I’ve riffed on a few different recipes and have a ratio I use, scaling up or down depending on how much unfed starter I have on hand, and adding in whatever spices/seeds I want. This time it was: 350g unfed starter (I keep this in the fridge, covered, and it usually stays good for up to 2-3 weeks), a mix of flours (90g bread flour, 65g dark rye), 7g kosher salt (Diamond Crystal, of course), 13g olive oil (California Ranch, my go-to basic), 55g softened butter (Kerry Gold, salted), and then I eyeballed some ground mustard, fennel seeds, chile flakes, and oregano. Mix the dough together into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap, let sit in fridge at least 30 minutes (I have kept it in there for up to 5 days or so, but it’s definitely easier to roll out when used more quickly!). Roll out as thin as possible, spritz with water and top with Maldon salt before baking at 350 for \\~12-18 minutes, swapping pans around throughout.\n\n**Crispy potatoes**: I vaguely followed this, minus the animal fat, just eyeballing olive oil, and microplaning the garlic and skipping the pan-cooking: step:[https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/12/the-best-roast-potatoes-ever-recipe.html](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/12/the-best-roast-potatoes-ever-recipe.html)\n\n**Buffalo cauliflower**: [https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019912-buffalo-cauliflower](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019912-buffalo-cauliflower)\n\n**Busy weeknight chili**: [https://food52.com/recipes/78043-busy-weeknight-bean-chili](https://food52.com/recipes/78043-busy-weeknight-bean-chili)\n\n**Sourdough cornbread**: [https://thegingeredwhisk.com/sourdough-cornbread/](https://thegingeredwhisk.com/sourdough-cornbread/)",

    "body": "This is a long and rambling post. Just started writing. Things gets a little specific about my husbands death in the first paragraph. Just wanted to give y’all a heads up. \n\nI’m 16 days out from losing my husband Luke to brain cancer. \n\nHe was 28. I turned 30 during the month he was bed ridden before his death. \n\nLuke was diagnosed only three months before his passing. We thought his quick decline was from his tumor responding badly to the treatment and that he would bounce back if we took a break from treatment. That turned out to not be true. \n\nHe left the earth at 4:04 pm on September 5th in the bedroom of our new and first home together. I held his hand. 10 minutes before I gave him a breathing treatment with some eucalyptus oil.  I thought his labored breathing was his throat clearing up but quickly realized what was happening. I told him I loved him and everything was going to be okay as he left. \n\nI keep picturing this moment. Hoping he wasn’t in pain. Wondering if I did enough in the month prior to take care for him. Feeling guilty that I didn’t. I was his full time caregiver. Like many people with brain tumors (at least I’ve read this), he retreated into himself during August. Moving further away from who he was. Getting overwhelmed with too much stimulation or even brief conversations with family. His family had a really hard time coping with this. I don’t blame them. They just wanted to be with him. But I kind of had to be the bad guy after he kept getting so stressed he would spike a fever and have tremors. During his life he tried so hard to please his family- it was a struggle we had throughout our relationship. He just didn’t have the capacity to make them feel better as he was dying and that was so hard. It was miserable and gut wrenching. Just really difficult. \n\nHis parents didn’t agree with his/our decisions on his treatment. He made me medical power of attorney because he knew his wishes wouldn’t be respected by his family. At one point there was a threat to revoke my POA if I made a decision they didn’t like. Things were bad. Towards the end he was in so much pain and was ready to go. He told me a few times. I wasn’t ready to lose him but knew that the existence he was living wasn’t the life he wanted and that he was in so much pain. His family really couldn’t face what was happening. They were in very deep denial.\n\n(Sorry to go so far into all that. As I said I’m just writing.) \n\nWhat never changed during his last month on earth was that he wanted me by his side. Told me he loved me and that I was his favorite person up until he stopped speaking about 14 hours before his death. \n\nSome background about our journey. \n\nWe had recently moved back to my hometown- New Orleans. Until mid-April we lived in Cleveland, OH, where he had lived his entire life and where his family still is. Uprooting our lives and starting a this adventure as a newly married couple was really difficult and beautiful. All made more challenging by changing relationship dynamics and communication difficulties. We never had issues like the ones we were having in the three months before his diagnosis. I think it was some kind of relief to us both after we realized something else was going on. Obviously the tumor growing over his brain stem wasn’t what we expected. \n\nLuke and I quit our jobs last December to travel the world. We spent two months traveling. Singapore, India, Germany and the UK. The majority of that time was spent in India where his mom’s family is. We met dozens of cousins, aunties and uncles and talked about how we were going to return in 5 years with our kids. Luke had a dream that we’d quit our jobs every 5 years to travel. \n\nWe got married in a ridiculous 6 day love fest. Married in the eyes of god in a Hindu ceremony, a pooja, on 10/10/19, exactly one year after we proposed to each other in our backyard. And married in front of our community (and legally) on 10/13/19. We took singing lessons the summer before the wedding to preform for our friends and family at a sangeeth on 10/12. Our one year anniversary is/was this October. His memorial service was held on the day of our 11th month anniversary.\n\nI know I’m new to widowhood. In the rawest part of this loss. Still not at a point to even completely internalize that my life is going to change completely. We hadn’t restarted our careers before he passed. This next phase of life for me is so confusing. Not falling back into a routine. Creating a band new one. In a way I guess it’s a godsend. But the idea of having to build a new community in New Orleans, outside of the handful of old friends and family here, is terrifying. The prospect of meeting people who won’t have known Luke. Who wouldn’t have witnessed the tender love he had for me. He was the gushier one in the relationship. Our love was beautiful. Our life together made me feel lucky. And now I’m angry and confused and lonely. I know I’ll carry the beautiful feelings and gentle memories with me. But damnit I just wish he was here.",

I'll refer you to [last week's post for the bottom 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/zht512/23_niche_review_of_2022_my_5_worst_releases/) which also include my full rankings 1 to 36. \n\n**Short-form summary**:\n\n\nTop 5 | Bottom 5\n-----|--------\n#1 - bdk Parfums \"**Gris Charnel Extrait**\" | #36 - Maison Crivelli \"**Patchouli Magnetik**\"\n#2 - Nishane \"**Tero**\" | #35 - Matière Première \"**Crystal Saffron**\"\n#3 - Amouage \"**Opus XIV Royal Tobacco**\" | #34 - bdk Parfums \"**Ambre Safrano**\"\n#4 - Maison Crivelli \"**Ingredients 07\\2012**\" | #33 - Xerjoff \"**Sketchbook - P.33**\"\n#5 - Stéphane Humbert Lucas \"**God of Fire**\" | #32 - Kilian \"**Kologne, Shield of Protection**\"\n\n**---**\n\nMoving on to the [hidden gems of 2022](https://i.imgur.com/JMGR8bx.jpg). \n\nI originally had 6 to discuss, but wanted to highlight a couple more, so the image shows 6, but I have 2 honorable mentions at the end for a grand total of 8 hidden gems. Also highlighting where they ranked for me.\n\n * **Gritti** \"**Beyond the Wall**\" (ranked #11 out of 36): I'm sure there are some sharp eyes reading this that managed to notice the bottle of Xerjoff's Alexandria II (\"A2\" going forward) laying in the back. A2, a 2012 release, is unarguably the #1 premium-tier niche fragrance in the market, albeit it does now have some competition from Nishane's Nefs.\n\n A2 makes a feature in this review as the thing that Gritti was clearly imitating. At its core, Beyond the Wall is an A2 dupe without the oud. It doesn't really do a great job at hiding the fact that it's a dupe. What you are mainly smelling are the powdery and soft-sweet tones of Alexandria II without the oud, hurting longevity and sillage in the process (ranking longevity 8/10 and sillage 6/10). There are some interesting sweet facets to this, I get mild hints of cola that make me think of those cola-bottle Haribos. Deep drydown has a clean powdery-woody scent with a touch of sweetness. What Beyond the Wall actually has going for it is that it costs €235 for a 100ml vs. the €545 for a 100ml of A2. \n\n   * **Who should sample this:** If you dislike the oud in A2 or can't stomach paying the retail of A2, this is seriously worth a look.\n   * **Key comparables:** Without a doubt, Xerjoff's Alexandria II (~85-90% dupe, very high quality)\n   * **Profile:** Leans masculine if not outright masculine; 79% of owners on Parfumo are male (92% for A2).\n   * **Wear case:** Fall-winter, given no oud and less sillage it can work in spring (and might end up with poor performance in winter).\n\n * **Goldfield & Banks \"Purple Suede\"** (ranked #10 out of 36) - Nothing in the market quite smells like a Goldfield & Banks. It always feels like that the components they use are not used by any other houses. While I'm not exactly *gaga* for the idea that G&B makes stuff that smells different, I did rate Goldfield's 2021 release \"Silky Woods\" a borderline top 5 last year. Purple Suede, similarly, sat 5th until the end of the year when I kept sampling stuff that overall deserved to be ranked ahead of it. So is there something off here?\n\n As a niche collector, I hadn't smelled anything like Purple Suede before. At the open, I get a very prominent blueberry note in the air which isn't listed. But what is listed is a leatherwood middle note which has been used to create an Armagnac-type vibe (Armagnac is a brandy distilled from wine). The general profile, excluding that prominent fruity accord to my nose, can be figured out without even looking at a scent pyramid - it's lavender and leather. So in the air, you get a fruity lavender and up close you get a fruity-lavender-leather. \n\n There's very little to not like here. I will note that the strength of the lavender is amping up over time, and the ingredients used by Goldfield do not wow me. Outside of those two issues, this is a 100ml priced at €195 (was 20% off on Black Friday, so €156 at that time). Gets great airiness and longevity - rating longevity around 12 hours (9/10) and sillage is more evident as well (8/10). \n\n   * **Who should sample this:** People looking to transition from designer into niche (or looking for niche exposure), more mature people (it's not the most challenging wear, but it is a maturer profile).\n   * **Key comparables:** These are going to be two designers - YSL's \"Tuxedo\", with the general profile somewhat like Tom Ford's \"Tuscan Leather\". Some also compare it to Tom Ford's \"Ombre Leather\".\n   * **Profile:** Leans masculine to me, 66% of Parfumo owners are male.\n   * **Wear case:** Fall-winter only, high performance ratings signal little practicality for spring/summer.\n\n * **Initio \"Paragon\"** (ranked #9 out of 36) - On the 1st of October, Initio revealed Paragon, the third fragrance of the Hedonist Collection (after Rehab and 2021's Musk Therapy). Both Rehab (a well-recognized high-quality niche take of \"Spice Bomb\" by Viktor&Rolf), and Musk Therapy (a fruity-musky profile that sits in the Erba Pura scent class, but leans closer to something like Bal d'Afrique) are among the fan favorites by Initio, largely owing to their wearability and multitude of use cases. Paragon does not appear to differ in that category.\n\n My experience with Paragon is different now that I have a bottle, for 2 days to be exact as of writing this. When I first smelled Paragon, I first likened it to women's beauty products, like a shampoo or a hair balsam. This is mostly due to how Paragon opens - we get a pop of the sweeter musks from Musk Therapy blended with the fruitiness of the plum. And that made me think either feminine-leaning or strictly feminine. As it dried and as I've become accustomed to the fragrance, some of the notes that I did also recognize first are now becoming more prominent. For example, the palo santo in Paragon adds a smoky-woody twist that I find more present in my full bottle than I did in my sample (an official sample from Initio, to add).\n\n It's definitely not herbal, but the general profile *at the open* is aromatic-sweet-fruity-musky in that order (leans feminine or strictly feminine). Give it around 10-15 minutes and the order changes to aromatic-woody-sweet-smoky (musky-fruity tones eventually become a backdrop, but on first sniff, still there) - by this point, we are already at unisex. Deep drydown is also eerily similar to Initio's Rehab, it's that creamy sandalwood Rehab dries to. So it starts close to Musk Therapy, evolves a bit over time, and then dries to Rehab. Initio's value as a house is a bit over the place, but the scents themselves I almost entirely love. This has good longevity (9-10 hours, so worth an 8/10) and actually lasts very well on clothes. Sillage I can't give more than a 7, but I know some people have gotten more.\n\n   * **Who should sample this:** Fans of Initio as a brand, women looking for a spring-fall standout, men that don't get scared off by certain accords that may hint feminine (aka me on first wear).\n   * **Key comparables:** Another hard one. It smells somewhere between Rehab and Musk Therapy, as in it takes accords from both, but doesn't smell that similar to either. I get some comparisons to Vilhelm's \"Dear Polly\" at the open, some comparisons to Royal Crown's \"Imperator\" in the drydown. I won't ace this, so you'll have to try it yourselves.\n   * **Profile:** If you read the reviews, they are all over the place. I am going to claim unisex, but 73% of owners on Parfumo are male (suggesting leans masculine).\n   * **Wear case:** Fall-spring, wore it on a winter day today and doesn't really get good pop without any heat. \n\n * **Xerjoff \"Torino22** (ranked #7 out of 36) - With Torino22 (\"T22\" going forward), Xerjoff released the 3rd scent named Torino, after the original Torino and the well-regarded Torino21, a fresh-citrusy-aromatic summer scent that makes me think of honeyed white florals if that makes any sense. But before trying T22, I actually didn't have a bottle of T21 - I wasn't one of T21's original fans, so I didn't come into this expecting a lot. \n\n So this one is probably the hardest scent to describe, and it definitely doesn't help that Fragrantica reviewers are actually likening this scent to Baccarat Rouge (because it doesn't smell like BR540). So lets try to break through the first spray - prominent eucalyptus oil, prominent warm spices (saffron), and there's also some bergamot in the opening. I am mainly smelling a fresh-aromatic (in a mint way) woody-warm spicy fragrance, with the saffron bringing on additional sweetness. If you wanted to remix Torino21 into a spring-fall fragrance, this is pretty close to what you would do. Longevity around 9-10 hours (ranking 8/10), sillage is upper end of average (7/10). Not priced that badly since it retails €180 for a 50ml. \n\n   * **Who should sample this:** Fans of Xerjoff as a brand, and owners of Torino21 that want a distant flanker for colder seasons.\n   * **Key comparables:** I'm going to liken it to a hybrid masculine-sweet profile like Xerjoff's \"Golden Green\" (which is saffron with juniper). Retains some accords of Xerjoff's \"Torino21\".\n   * **Profile:** Outright masculine; 90% of owners on Parfumo are male.\n   * **Wear case:** Fall-spring, will work in winter but I wouldn't wear it - you'll mainly just get that sweet saffron popping off your skin and nothing else (aka it will wear just like Golden Green).\n\n * **Royal Crown \"Nocturna\"** (ranked #15 out of 36) - Shoutout to those that were able to notice the bottle of Royal Crown \"Sultan\" hiding behind the two Royal Crown (\"RC\" going forward) samples. RC dropped two releases this year - Nizam and Nocturna. I believe these were first revealed as Esxence *and the more time rolls on, the more I need to go*. This is probably one that should've been called an honorable mention, because I don't think there are that many people here willing to buy a 100ml bottle for €579, but hey - if you're one of those people, Royal Crown is currently running a promo and based on some Fragrantica reviews, these do go on sale quite often at some of the resellers whose names you likely have heard.\n\n Moving on to the scent. If you've read my top 5 review, you'll know that I ranked \"God of Fire\" by Stéphane Humbert Lucas at #5. God of Fire is, at its core, a sugared mango fragrance. Well... could I interest you in a sugared peach fragrance by any chance? Because this is a take of the same profile, similarly blended to elite quality, just with the mango being replaced by the three top-notes which are melon-peach-litchi. I objectively can't separate between these three notes that much, but you are essentially getting sweet-sugared tropical fruits with some powdery tones. And it smells awesome. Open was a tad more resinous than God of Fire, blend does have some florals to it also - so this isn't exactly identical, but it aims to compete in that scent class.\n\n I didn't really have much to say for God of Fire either because these profiles are fairly simple. What I would say is that don't look at the Fragrantica accords for Nocturna, thinking that this is a very complex fragrance because it really isn't. I mainly get the sweet/vanilla, powdery, fruity accords with some woody-balsamic (the blend features some of those woody components that those that have tried RC's \"Sultan\" will love), and to me the ambers are only there in the open. Longevity was great, around 12 hours. Sillage was upper-end of average (7/10) - will depend on body temperature and climate as well.\n\n   * **Who should sample this:** Fans of SHL's \"God of Fire\" that want an alternative take, women looking for something that says but doesn't scream youthful, men who didn't get scared away by the profile of \"God of Fire\"\n   * **Key comparables:** Two key comps are SHL's \"God of Fire\", and Gaya's \"Anfas\".\n   * **Profile:** I'm saying leans feminine, but can be unisex. *There are ZERO owners on Parfumo* (Reddit exclusive lol)\n   * **Wear case:** Fall-spring, will work in winter, but I'm not sure it would perform the best.\n\n * **Roja Parfums \"Apex\" [EDP]** (ranked #12 out of 36) - Roja actually received flack within the fragrance community (that he deserved) for releasing a Parfum in 50ml 6 months after releasing the EDP, with the 50ml Parfum being priced higher than the 100ml EDP (and not by a little). But even with that all that said, Apex has been a massive success for Roja and yet another simple all-year(-ish) masculine fragrance that will generate sales.\n\n So what does Apex smell like? Like a bush. Or as the perfume folk say, like a fougere. Clearly a masculine fragrance, has some sweeter tones that help in the blend (sweet bush?) - my nose has the easiest time separating the juniper note here, but there are also fir balsam, oakmoss and cypress blending for this fougere profile (smells like pine tree); meaning the main accords will be woody and aromatic. The top notes don't really ever separate themselves, they barely even appear. I can pick up a tad on the cistus-pineapple middle notes. But we all know the profile. \n\n   * **Who should sample this:** To me, men looking for a mature all-year scent (this is certainly a more mature profile than \"Elysium\" is). Also: men looking to explore niche with profiles that they love in designer.\n   * **Key comparables:** This is a profile that originated in designer, starting with Ralph Lauren's \"Polo Green\", then moving to Tom Ford's \"Italian Cypress\". People also compare it to Dior's \"Sauvage Elixir\". \n   * **Profile:** Outright masculine; 98% of owners on Parfumo are male.\n   * **Wear case:** I think you can do all-year with this if you manage sprays, but it can get a tad much in hot summer and it may not be the best selection as a winter fragrance. \n\n**---**\n\n[**honorable mentions**] *And the two that aren't pictured, but worthy of mention.* \n\n * **Stéphane Humbert Lucas \"Sand Dance\"** (ranked #8 out of 36) - I definitely forgot to include the SHL samples I bought from a Spanish boutique in the picture, because I had 3 SHL fragrances in the top 16 and these three have been getting a lot of love in the fragrance community. While God of Fire received a lot of praise by myself and others in the YT/IG fragcom, the other two haven't gone lost either. I also appreciated what both Sand Dance and Venom Incarnat are bringing to the table. \n\n Sand Dance seemed familiar to my nose when I sprayed it, and I think I've nailed the comparison because I think I understand this scent very well. When you first spray it on, it's sweet-ambry-boozy, similar to Kilian's \"Black Phantom\", but it is missing the caramel sweetness that Black Phantom is known to have. So at first, BP without the heavy sweetness. But as the scent evolves, it dries into another very well known scent - and that is Xerjoff's \"Amber Star\". Fairly dry-woody, powdery with hints of cocoa, and some warm spices.\n\n   * **Who should sample this:** Those looking for a winter fragrance that is not excessively sweet or amber-driven.\n   * **Key comparables:** Within niche realm, I get a hybrid of Kilian's \"Black Phantom\" and Xerjoff's \"Amber Star\". Some have compared this also to Tom Ford's \"Ebene Fume\".\n   * **Profile:** Unisex leaning masculine to my nose, but 52% of owners on Parfumo are women.\n   * **Wear case:** Fall-winter exclusive.\n\n * Stéphane Humbert Lucas \"Venom Incarnat\" (ranked #16 out of 36) - Some pure-fruit fragrances have slowly become niche staples for women, the most known of which I suspect is Xerjoff's \"La Capitale\". And I did recently try another scent that falls in the same class, that being Unique'e Luxury's \"SoScientific\". To my nose, Venom Incarnat is an extension to this scent class, but takes a different direction.\n\n I separate two notes at the open: Strawberry and raspberry. But that is largely the vibe I get in the air. There's a lot more depth to Venom Incarnat when you smell it up close. The main accords that I am getting are fruity,  sweet (caramel top & vanilla base), and woody (cedar middle note). The patchouli-leather combination isn't the most prominent, and they don't make the scent smell earthy or dark. The main thing dragging this scent down to me is the performance. My longevity and sillage ratings were 6/10 and 5/10 respectively when I first wore this, so I'd expect longevity of 6 hours. But it does smell special - a man-eater fragrance that smells inviting if you will. Not similar, but I get the same vibe when I smell Xerjoff's \"Bouquet Ideale\".\n\n   * **Who should sample this:** Women looking for something youthful, fans of profiles like \"La Capitale\".\n   * **Key comparables:** Within niche realm, Xerjoff's \"La Capitale\" and Unique'e Luxury's \"SoScientific\".\n   * **Profile:** To my nose, it's clearly feminine, but only 55% of owners are female, meaning it may have unisex potential.\n   * **Wear case:** Could be all-year due to the poor performance, but works best with mildly warm weather.\n\n**---**\n\nThanks for reading and for the support on the other two posts. This is a close to my reviews for the 2022 releases, feel free to ask me in the comments about fragrances that I sampled among the 36 that I didn't review (I reviewed 5+5+8 so 18-of-36). \n\nThere was only one top 12 fragrance that I didn't review and that was Nishane's \"Papilefiko\" at #6. TLDR: I mainly get Amouage's \"Enclave\" from Papilefiko, given its sweet-minty-aromatic profile; only missing the prominent amber. Others have compared it to original \"Halfeti\" and \"Blazing Mr. Sam\", both from Penhaligons.\n\n**I'm considering two more posts this year** - my winter lineup on the 24th and my most worn fragrances of 2022 on the 31st. But automod tilts me too much, so will see.",

    "body": "Hihi everybirdie! I love sci-fi, so when I saw Stereoplasm's new collection, I sprung for a whole set of decants (thanks u/theyellingcat !) Now, I come bearing out of this world reviews!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Running Up That Dune** *(Aldehyde \\[circa 1985\\], creme de cassis, violet, impatiens and copper sand)* \\-- This is a soft, creamy cassis scent. I can detect the violet in the back, but it's well behaved. The aldehyde and copper give it a little sparkle, and despite the note being copper SAND, this scent isn't dusty or dry at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Etherian Rhapsody** *(cream soda, radish hearts, reptilian scales, dragon fruit and yuzu butter)* \\-- This opens like you just uncapped a fresh bottle of yuzu cream soda! It smells like something I want to drink really bad. It dries down to a creamy, fruity vanilla, and the radish hearts give it a good body-- not necessarily smelling green, or earthy, or herbal... but it's like I Know they're there, Helping!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Thirty-three HZ** *(blue moon roses, hard crack toffee, chipped porcelain and hazelnut cream)* \\-- Starts with a BLAST of sticky toffee, then quickly turns into a fresh rose supported by what I can only assume is the porcelain note. It's sort of cool and smooth, a little mineral-y but not Earthy. It smells a bit synthetic, but in a refreshing way. It does get a bit soapy as it dries, and if I tried to sniff it on my skin directly it smelled like fancy hotel soap, but the whiffs I would get in the air smelled nice. The rose, toffee, and porcelain smell quite intriguing together. I'm not sure I get much of the hazelnut cream, but it could just be wrapped up with the toffee!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Flatland Girls** *(drunken plum, pickled ginger, cherry pits, clove bud and white chocolate)* \\-- Wet, this smells like spiced cherry soda and pickled plums. It's fruity and sour and you can definitely smell the clove. I would love to drink this one too lmao. As it dries, the white chocolate comes out and adds a very nice creaminess to the scent. It's like a weird, fun take on fruit & chocolate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Paradoxical Faith** *(cold wet cranberries, driftwood, afterglow water lily, sea salt and ocean mist)* \\-- It smells like a holiday candle at first, but as it dries, it becomes this soft, almost glowing cranberry. I find it a bit hard to describe, honestly, and I'm not sure if it's just because my nose isn't well trained or if it's just well blended. It's lovely, though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Frequency Operator** *(warm skin, orange blossom honey, angel's trumpets, spiced rum and tobacco)* \\-- The honey and angel's trumpet are sweet and spicy together, while the tobacco and rum keep it warm and a little sensual. If you stick your nose too close to your skin, it's sharp and boozy, and a little overwhelming, but the wafts are warm and pretty. I could see a gorgeous lady spy wearing this while trying to seduce information out of a mark at a fancy party.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Venusian Moon** *(juicy bamboo, sun dried suede, eucalyptus oil, guava and cactus juice)* \\-- This is a smooth, dewy green scent, with the barest hint of guava. I was wary of the eucalyptus, because I really don't like the scent of it, but it mostly just adds a refreshing coolness to the blend. Wearing this made me feel suave as hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd, although it wasn't in the collection...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dr. Tesseract** *(Cool amaretto, anise star, cherry cola, allspice, caramelized carrot,  citrus rind, chewy ginger molasses cookies, tomato leaf, sassafras,  prune leaf and raspberry vanilla cream)* \\-- If you asked me even a year ago if I'd ever wear a perfume that smelled like Dr. Pepper, I'd ask if you were out of your mind, Here I am, though, with this perfume that smells exactly like Cherry Dr. Pepper. As far as I'm concerned, this is witchcraft, and I'm totally into it, actually.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlthough I don't know if I'd FS any of these (maybe Flatland Girls?), I enjoyed all of them! This is a fun, solid collection imo. Thanks for reading, and I'd love to hear others' thoughts on these!",
