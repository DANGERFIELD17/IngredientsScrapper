    "body": "10 years ago I threw away every cosmetics I owned and switched to their natural alternative. It drastically improved my hair and skin but..\n\nWhat I also did is I left my hair and skin alone. \n\nAnd I think that was the biggest factor in the improvement. No crappy foundation on my skin -> clear skin. No hair dye and heat on my hair -> hair reborn.\n\nBut after a few years of using soap base shampoo and oil types of conditioner, my hair got really hay like. So I thought they were \"dry\" and broken, and I conditioned them more. But it got worse and worse.  \nTurns out hair should be dry. Hair doesn't like humidity at all. And \"moisture\" is really just coating your hair with something either fat based (oils etc) or silicon based.\n\nBut oils build up like hell! And the usual tip of \"use shampoo on your roots not your ends\", well, my ends looked fried !! It was building up even more on my ends. \n\nYou know what else builds up ? limescale! And the soap based shampoo are terrible with hard water. Even though I was doing an ACV rinse. \n\nSo at some point I questioned the whole thing. I bought The ordinary shampoo (sulfate, cleanse my scalp amazingly) and conditioner (behentrimonium, fights hard water), and the naked range silicon serum (Amodimethicone, a silicon that doesn't build up).  \n\n\nMy hair is amazingly soft and fluffy again. I thought they were broken but there was just too much crap on it. I really enjoy sulfate as my scalp is finally clean for 5 days. (before they would be oily after 2 days) and silicon was the BIG missing element of my regimen.  \n\n\nI don't want to say that this would work for everyone, but I think that many people are going into the cgm with lots of belief and they may just be beliefs. So I just wanted to share my experience. My hair is wavy to curly depending on how they dry or feel like.",

    "body": "Over the years, I've grown increasingly frustrated by the hair care advice I've come across. Things never seem to work the way they're supposed to, and people seem to exclusively rely on anecdotes and personal experiences when giving their recommendations, often repeating things they read in a beauty mag or blog where the main goal is often to sell hair product or push dogma.\n\nSo I've done some digging, to learn a little bit about the real chemistry and science behind your hair care products, to dispel some myths and get to the truth of what's going on with your hair.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387693/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4458934/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19467087\n\n#What is hair?\n\n>*Hair is an integrated system with a peculiar chemical and physical behavior. It is a complex structure of several morphological components that act as a unit. The hair shaft of mammals is divided into three main regions: Cuticle, cortex and medulla. The medulla is present in corser hair like grey hair, thick hair and beard hair, and it is absent in fine hair of children. There is more medulla in the coarser hair of Asians than Caucasians. The medulla may be involved in the splitting of hairs since it provides an area of weakness as a pathway for the propagation of cracks along the axis of the fiber.*\n\n>*The cuticle is a chemically resistant region and consists of flap overlapping scales (keratinocytes) like shingles on the roof. The shape and orientation of the cuticle cells are responsible for the differential friction effect in hair. The cuticle is generally formed by 6‚Äì8 scales thick for Asians, slightly less in Caucasians and even less in African hair. A thinner cuticle layer makes African hair more prone to breakage.*\n\n[Image](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1083/7638/files/Hair-Anatomy-e1421050694589.png?v=1505924657)\n\n\n#Why do we shampoo? Is it necessary?\n\nOver time, your hair will develop a build up of dirt and other pollutants (eg: campfire smoke, minerals from hard water) as well as sebum, sweat and dead/peeled skin.\n\nPrior to the 1930's we simply used bar soap to wash our hair. The issue with this is that it would often leave a residue/soap scum on the scalp and hair, which is uncomfortable and aesthetically unpleasing. Shampoo was the answer.\n\nIn recent years, you may have heard that you don't need to shampoo, and that it causes your hair to produce more oils. This is untrue- there is no evidence to support the claim that using shampoo stimulates production of sebum on the scalp, including shampoos that contain sulfates and silicons.\n\nMost proponents of no-poo substitute shampoo with an alternative such as ACV or a specially formulated conditioner that effectively serves the same purpose.\n\n#How does shampoo work?\n\nThe main active ingredient in shampoo is a type of molecule called a surfacant. This is typically a sulfate, with the most common being Sodium Laureth Sulfate and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. You may have heard that all sulfates do is \"create suds\" and damage your hair, this is incorrect.\n\n>*Residues are nonsoluble fats (sebum) that do not dissolve with water. In order to be removed from the hair shaft, surfactants present a hydrophobic molecular portion, and another hydrophilic. The former will chemically bond with the fat, while the latter will bond with the water. The surfactants are generally composed of a chain of fatty hydrocarbons (tail) and a polar head. The polar extremity is capable of giving this portion of the molecule hydrophilic traits that allow it to dissolve in water and wash away the residues.* \n\nWhat this basically means is that one end of the surfacant will attract water, and the other will repel it and attract sebum, allowing it to be washed out of the hair along with the shampoo.\n\nSurfacants can be classified into four groups: Anionic, cationic, amphoteric and nonionic.\n\n[Here's a classifications chart of common surfacants.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387693/bin/IJT-7-2-g001.jpg) \n\n* **Anionic detergents:** Among the most popular surfactants, they are named for their negatively charged hydrophilic polar group. Derived from fatty alcohols, they are very good at removing sebum from the scalp and hair. However, the excessively cleaned hair is harsh, rough, dull with frizz and prone to tangling. Among them, different classes of detergents are available with certain selective properties.\n 1. **Lauryl sulfates:** Popular primary cleansers, they work well in both hard and soft water, produce rich foam, and are easily rinsed. They are excellent cleansers, commonly used in shampoos for oily hair. As the hair becomes harsh and rough, careful selection of a secondary detergent and possible use of a conditioning agent is always required as part of the shampoo formulation. Examples of this class include: Sodium lauryl sulfate, triethanolamine lauryl sulfate, and ammonium lauryl sulfate\n 2. **Laureth sulfates:** These are another class of excellent detergents with good cleansing ability and foaming property which are useful for normal-to-dry hair. Examples of this chemical class are: Sodium laureth sulfate, triethanolamine laureth sulfate, and ammonium laureth sulfate\n 3. **Sarcosines:** They are generally secondary detergents, as they do not remove sebum well from the hair to justify as primary cleansers. They are listed as the second or third on ingredient list of detergents. Excellent conditioners are used in conditioning shampoos and dry hair shampoos. Examples are: Lauryl sarcosine and sodium lauryl sarcosinate\n 4. **Sulfosuccinates:** These are strong detergents commonly used as a secondary surfactant in oily hair shampoos. Examples are disodium oleaminesulfosuccinate and sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate.\n\n* **Cationic Detergents:** In contrast to anionic detergents they have a positively charged polar group. They are poor cleansers and do not lather well and are not compatible with anionic detergents, limiting their utility. However, they are excellent at imparting softness and manageability to chemically damaged hair and so are primarily used as daily shampoo for damaged hair such as in case of permanently dyed or chemically bleached hair. Examples are: Long-chain amino esters, ammonioesters, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride.\n\n* **Amphoteric Detergents:** Having both positively and negatively charged polar group, they behave differently at lower pH (as cationic detergent) and at higher pH (as anionic detergent). Subgroups include the betaines, sultaines, and imidazolinium derivatives. They are used in baby shampoo and for those with fine and damaged hair because they don‚Äôt cause stinging in the eyes in children, foam well and leave hair in manageable state. Examples are: Cocamidopropyl betaine and sodium lauraminopropionate.\n\n* **Nonionic Detergents:** They have no polar group and are among the mildest of all cleansers and aid to improve the antistatic qualities of a shampoo. They can be combined with ionic detergent as a secondary cleanser. Examples are: Polyoxyethylene fatty alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol esters and alkanolamides.\n\nAll shampoos contain some variation or combination of these substances to wash your hair. Some sulfate-free shampoos may contain none, but this means that they are basically not effectively cleansing your hair. (most sulfate free shampoos will simply use a surfacant that doesn't contain the word \"sulfate\", though)\n\nHigh end shampoos from salons contain these same ingredients, with the main difference being perhaps nicer smells and a much stronger concentration that requires dilution in water before use.\n\n#####How often should I shampoo?\n\nYou probably do not need to shampoo every day, and you do not need to go weeks without shampooing. Shampoo your hair when it is oily or dirty. Experiment with different shampoos and take a look at the active chemicals that are doing the heavy lifting. \n\n#The benefit of conditioner\n\nModern shampoos are extremely effective. Unfortunately, heavily cleansed hair is not desirable to most, as it is harsh, hard to manage, prone to tangling, and looks dull.\n\nThe solution to this is a conditioner, which are sometimes included in the shampoo itself. \n\nA conditioner is any substance which is intended to enhance feel, appearance, fullness, lubricity, shine, and general manageability of hair. \n\n>*Conditioner molecules contain cationic surfactant which gives a positive electric charge to the conditioner. The negative charge of the hair is attracted to the positively charged conditioner molecules, which results in conditioner getting deposited on the hair, especially on areas where there is degree of weathering. This is true for damaged hair as they are even more negatively charged. Thus, conditioners reduce the static electricity. They also flatten the cuticle scales over the hair shaft, reducing the friction between hair fibers, increasing the reflectance of light which improves shine and color. The smooth feel resulting from conditioner use gives easier combing and detangling in both wet and dry conditions. Conditioners temporarily seal split ends and mend trichoptilosis.*\n\nConditioners will contain a wide variety of ingredients:\n\n* **Cationic surfactants:** Cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, behentrimonium or propyltrimonium, stearamidopropyl dimethylamine. They are considered the backbone of a conditioner\nPolymers: Mono and polypeptides like hydrolyzed proteins (amino acids), polypeptides derived from collagen and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)\n\n* **Bodying agents and thickeners:** Fatty alcohols (e.g. cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol), waxes (e.g. carnauba wax and paraffin wax), or gums (e.g. guar gum) and salt (sodium chloride)\n\n* **Emollients/oily compounds:** These include natural or synthetic oils, but also esters and waxes. Natural oils used in conditioners are, for example, jojoba oil, olive oil, or grape seed oil. The most frequently used synthetic oils are silicone (e.g. dimethicone, dimethiconol, amodimethicone and cyclomethicone) which are even superior to natural oils in terms of film formation, shine and luster. Asian countries have large hair diameters, therefore a higher concentration of silicone is used as compared to that for Caucasian hair (3-5% vs 0.5%)[1]\n\n* **Auxiliary emulsifiers:** Ethoxylated fatty alcohols (e.g. polysorbate-80 or ceteareth-20) which are non-ionic agents seem to be particularly effective at providing emulsion stability if it cannot be acheived by catiionic agents alone in a conditioner.\n\nThe big bogeyman you may notice is silicons. It is not bad for your hair, and not all silicons are equal. If you use a good shampoo with a good surfacant, build-up is not a concern and you likely don't need to worry too much about this. The backlash against silicons cropped up when people decided to eschew sulfates in their shampoo. Many people quickly realized that without proper cleansing, some silicons would build up in the hair over time.\n\nLike all things related to hair care, the key is balance. A fairly comprehensive resource for different types of silicons and how they behave is [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/) on /r/HairCareScience*, keep this in mind when deciding on which hair product to purchase for your hair.\n\n*while /r/HairCareScience has some good information on it and the moderators know their stuff, be wary of basically every comment from the users, as most of them are simply giving others anecdotal advice and spreading bogeymen.\n\n#How to wash and condition your hair.\n\nThe way you apply these products to your hair is undervalued, and doing it properly may have more benefit than you might suspect.\n\nShampoo should be applied starting from the front and working your way to the back. Applying it directly to the top of the head will create friction and cause tangling. \n\nOnce the shampoo has been rinsed from your hair, it's recommended to gently towel dry your hair before applying the conditioner. Conditioner should be applied on the length of the hair, avoiding the scalp.\n\nLeaving conditioner in your hair is not necessary, once the product has been spread over the surface of your hair it has done its job and may be rinsed out completely.\n\nAfterwards the hair may be gently towel dried. \n\n(If your hair is curly, there may be extra steps such as applying a leave-in product while hair is still wet. Using such products on straight thin hair may result in it looking oily and dull.)\n\n#TL;DR?\n\n* Wash your hair when it's dirty/oily. \n\n* There is no evidence to support the claim that sulfates stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more oil than normal.\n\n* Sulfates are not bad for your hair, but may cause it to look dry and become hard to manage. \n\n* Use conditioner or use a less effective surfacant to combat the above problem.\n\n* Silicons are not bad for your hair, most good shampoos will prevent any build up from happening.\n\n* The key to good hair care is not going \"no poo\" or \"sulfate/silicon free\", it's finding the right balance of chemicals to wash your hair and keep it looking good. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": ">There is no evidence to support the claim that sulfates stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more oil than normal.\n\nI would like to add some more information about this, because that part of your post can be interpreted wrongly, as in \"it doesn't matter how much you wash your hair with shampoo, it wont affect the rate at which your hair gets greasy anyways\". I believe your statement to be true that sulfates themselves wont stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more oil. However, washing your hair too often will substantially raise the rate at which your scalp produces oil and thus the rate at which your hair gets greasy. There are two main reasons for this. The first reason is that when you wash your hair and scalp, you'll also inevitably stimulate the skin in that area, creating friction which results in more blood flow that will make the sebaceous glands \"work better\". The second reason is that by washing your hair you'll also remove the oil from your scalp. Leaving your skin in a dry condition. Dry skin will make your sebaceous glands work overtime to fix exactly that problem, as their main function is to lubricate and waterproof your skin. \n\nTldr: Don't wash your hair too often, it will get your hair greasy fast. It can also cause dandruff in the long term by overstimulating the sebaceous glands.\n\nSource: Studied hairdressing and am a barber.",

The skin on your head won't appreciate it, you'll possibly have problems with sebum regulation, skin flaking, redness and itchiness. Every person is different so you'll have to see what works best for you in terms of hair washing intervals. Washing with shampoo every 2 to 3 or 4 days is recommended. Daily washing of your hair with shampoo will cause more harm than good in most cases. If you need to wash your hair daily for whatever reason it's recommended to clean with only water every other day. In fact over washing your hair with shampoo is not only bad for your scalp but also for your hair. \n\n\nYou don't have to believe me, try and see for yourself, shampoo your hair every day and see what happens!",

    "body": "I‚Äôm about to drop a lot of information here, but please read! I learned a lot about how to properly use sulfates and silicones, so I want to share!! \n\nSo here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned from Sarah Tran, who has thigh length hair. \n\nEdit: People have brought up genetics. Of course genetics is a huge factor in hair length, but the point of this post is to maintain *healthy* hair, so that it will grow with minimal breakage and split ends. I bring up her length because it is *healthy* as well as long. \n\nAlso note: silicones and sulfates won‚Äôt directly contribute to hair growth, but will make your hair stronger and less likely to break and fall out, indirectly resulting in longer fuller hair\n\nFirst off, silicones and sulfates are NOT bad. In fact, if she didn‚Äôt use silicones, she couldn‚Äôt protect her hair and have such long hair without split ends. The way most people USE silicones is bad though. \n\nThink about it like this: If you have a pair of high heels that are comfortable and you love them, but your friend asks you to go jogging, the shoes are not the problem, the *use* is.\n\nSilicones do the following: \n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair which makes it easier to detangle \n\n-Provides UV protection\n\n-Seals in moisture to prevent dryness\n\n-Makes hair look shiny\n\n-Reduces frizz and adds definition to curls\n\n-Softens and smooths cuticle\n\nSilicones do all these amazing things!!!! However, there are 4 types: airy, friendly (easy to wash out), resilient, and NO GO silicones\n\n*\n#Airy silicones: \nThese evaporate out of the hair after 10 minutes to a few hours. These do not have any negative effect on hair:\n\n-Cyclomethicone \n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n*\n#Friendly silicones:\nThese wash out of the hair with sulfate free shampoos:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate) \n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n*\n#Resilient Silicones:\nThese do NOT build up on the strand, but are non soluble and *require a sulfate* to remove:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone -Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n*\n#NO GO Silicones:\nThese require multiple washes with sulfate shampoo to remove. NEVER USE THESE!:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone \n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone \n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18 \n\n-Cetyl Phosphate \n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiylamodimethicone \n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n*\n#Mild Sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nThese are Best used to remove airy and friendly silicones and in your regular, daily mild shampoo. These do NOT remove resilient silicones. \n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate \n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n*\n#High Strength HARSH sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nTreat these exactly like harsh sulfates and avoid them when looking for a regular, daily mild sulfate-free shampoo. BEST USED FOR REMOVING RESILIENT SILICONES:\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate \n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n*\n#SULFATES that remove silicones:\nThese strong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Mild sulfates May require more applications to remove resilient silicones:\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n*\n#Also here is a list of cationic (anti-static) ingredients:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n*\n#So basically:\n\n1. Get a good sulfate free shampoo\n\n2. Get a good shampoo that HAS sulfates\n\n3. Use airy and friendly silicones ALL the time\n\n4. Use resilient silicones once or twice a month. This will protect your hair more than friendly silicones. Resilient silicones must be washed out with a SULFATE shampoo at the max FIVE DAYS AFTER APPLICATION\n\n*\n#And one last thing!!!

Having thigh length hair is a great achievement but it doesn't make someone a science expert, so posting this on a science sub is so misleading. \n\nI'm seeing some red flags. First off, no scientific sources. Second, commonly demonized ingredients in the push for \"clean\" beauty are again demonized here without proper given cause. And third, there are a few things that stuck out to me as glaringly false from what research I've done. Lastly, fourth, the phrasing at all of \"no go silicones\" and just the incorrect categorization of silicones that assigns them value (better to look at the truer category names: volatile, amine-modified, etc.)\n\nMost ingredients on that \"blacklist\" have little or absolutely no evidence of being bad. \n\nAnd the thing that strikes me as absolutely false is the list of cationic surfactabts as static causing, when most research and literature says the exact opposite - that they're anti static ingredients. Give me a minute and I'll add a few sources for the anti-static claim for cationic surfactants.\n\n> The widely used cationic surfactant docosyltrimethylammonium chloride was overall well performing, especially when it came to reduction of friction force and reduction of flyaway hair during combing. It was superior to the other cationic surfactant tested regarding reduction of frizz. This study suggests that the silicones and protein derivatives showed less promising results regarding the overall manageability. Preliminary data has implications that the efficiency of anti-frizz is correlated with cationic charge and high hydrophobicity of the conditioning agent. \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DYduaceeTnvMJ \n\n> Behentrimonium¬†chloride¬†and Cetrimonium¬†chloride¬†are known to be very effective hair conditioners with detangling,¬†anti-frizz, and¬†anti-static¬† \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3D0FbAuscGO8AJ",

    "body": "Silicones are the focus of many a haircare discussion. They smooth, soften, and shine the hair cuticle, protect from UV, humidity, and heat styling, and can temporarily repair damaged locks. But they may also be hard to remove and build up on certain people with certain routines, leaving an undesirable greasiness, limpness, and dry strands. \n\nSilicone behavior thus varies widely by type and can either be a pro or con for your haircare regimen. Here is a list of many kinds of silicones and specific information on what they do. They‚Äôre organized into subclasses that pertain to their wash-out and build-up capacities. Within these subclasses, they‚Äôre listed alphabetically along with more info on any noteworthy properties beyond conditioning.\n\n\n**Group 1: Evaporative**     \nAlso known as volatile molecules. These silicones will completely evaporate from your hair anywhere from 10 minutes to a few hours after application, so there‚Äôs no worry about build up or moisture lock out with these (but also no conditioning effect from these alone). For this reason they‚Äôre most used only as delivery systems for other ingredients, as they distribute into a thin, uniform film before evaporation. Additionally, unlike short-chain alcohols, these won‚Äôt carry off moisture. \n\n- Cyclomethicone and other cyclo-XXX-siloxane ingredients ‚Äì note that these are not soluble in water, so won‚Äôt wash out easily if applied right before or in the shower. They will evaporate away afterwards, however, so it doesn‚Äôt matter and can actually help against hygral fatigue. They can also be beneficial for increased ease of combing when hair is wet after washing.    \n\n- Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane     \n- Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane     \n- Hexamethyldisiloxane      \n- Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane     \n\n**Group 2: Easy Wash Out**     \nThese silicones don‚Äôt evaporate, so they are useful as conditioning agents to get smoother and softer hair with less frizz. They also protect hair from UV radiation, heat styling, and humidity and spread out evenly. They do wash out with nonionic surfactants and co-washing, so again there‚Äôs not much concern about these. There are a few caveats to this, however. Larger molecules are more water resistant, especially in hot water, so may need a sulfate shampoo depending on the amount applied. They may also block out moisture from the hair if the user goes a very long time without washing with something besides water. \n\n- Any sort of PEG/PPG modified Methicone or Dimethicone (unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient) - hygroscopic, so may pull moisture out of hair in dry weather. Subtler conditioning effect. Irritation reduction, so good for sensitive skin/scalps.        \n- Diphenyl Dimethicone ‚Äì high shine     \n- Dimethicone (unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient, then Group 3)     \n- Dimethiconol     \n- Disiloxane     \n- Dimethicone copolyol (unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient, then Group 3) ‚Äì hygroscopic, so may pull moisture out of hair in dry weather. Subtler conditioning effect. Irritation reduction, so good for sensitive skin/scalps.\n- Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane     \n- Lauryl methicone copolyol     \n- Phenyltrimethicone ‚Äì high shine     \n- Silica ‚Äì increased body     \n- Silicone resin - increased body     \n- Silsequioxanes ‚Äì increased body     \n- Siloxysilicates (e.g. Diisostearoyl Trimethylolpropane Siloxysilicate) ‚Äì increased body          \n- Trisiloxane     \n\n**Group 3: Hard to Wash, But No Build Up**     \nTake care when using these silicones, as they don‚Äôt wash out easily ‚Äì only a clarifying shampoo with anionic or zwitterionic surfactants will get the job done. Otherwise, hair may dry out over time. These silicones don‚Äôt build up though, as subsequent layers are repelled by the first, so there won‚Äôt be an increasing feeling of weight and greasiness (the exception to this is amine-funcationalized silicones in the presence of a cationic surfactant - if hair is in a product of this formulation for long enough, the silicone will continue to deposit until it is exhausted from the solution). One may choose to use this ingredient if they want the extreme conditioning benefits and plan on using clarifying shampoo on a weekly or biweekly basis. I personally would only recommend these as leave in conditioners to people with damaged hair who heat style and have already tried other conditioners, as these molecules have a greater affinity for the more negatively charged surface of damaged hair. This makes that one layer of product hard to remove, but very effective. Just remember that once on, neither water nor other product is getting underneath to the hair until you clarify (coconut oil for example will only sit on top and be greasy).\n\n- Aminopropyl Dimethicone (unless in the presence of a cationic surfactant - then Group 4)       \n- Amodimethicone ‚Äì potential for irritation (unless in the presence of a cationic surfactant - then Group 4)      \n- Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone     \n- Dimethicone, Dimethicone PEG/PPG, or a -dimethylsiloxane in the presence of another cationic polymer ingredient such as anything ending with bromide or chloride and polyquaternium ingredients     \n- Dimethicone crosspolymer     \n- Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer     \n- Aminopropyltriethoxysilane   \n\n**Group 4: Hard to Wash, Builds Up**      \nThe most difficult silicone to work with. These ingredients are powerful conditioners, but will build up with repeated use, causing greasiness and weighing hair down (which negatively impacts natural texture). They‚Äôre also hard to get out ‚Äì all need a clarifying shampoo, and some may even need multiple washes with one in order to remove completely. Without removal, moisture can be blocked out of the hair shaft, resulting in dry strands and potential breakage. We recommend that you avoid these ingredients altogether. \n\n- Behenoxy dimethicone     \n- Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone      \n- Cetyl dimethicone     \n- Cetearyl methicone  \n- Dimethiconol hydroxystearate         \n- Polysilicone-18 Cetyl Phosphate     \n- Propyl Dimethicone ‚Äì increased body    \n- Stearoxy dimethicone     \n- Stearyl dimethicone         \n- Stearyl methicone      \n- Trimethylsiylamodimethicone ‚Äì irritation potential     \n\n\nI'll add more to the list as I become aware of them.

Assuming the follicle is well-coated without gaps. \n\nSounds like cationic quaternary compounds should fit the bill.

My hair is pretty damaged and its really helped the condition. But after I use it, I then use the Joico K-pak shampoo as well (which has both sodium laureth sulfate and cocamidopropyl betaine in it) before going back to co-washing.

Silicones are gas and vapor permeable, but water resistant. So unremoved silicones often result in dry hair because moisture evaporates out but can't be replenished. Where they become more water conserving is during heat styling, in which unprotected can instantly vaporize the water inside the cortex and fry the fibers. I'd love to do some more research (or see others' work!) on quats and organic polymers when I have the time to investigate their occlusive strength and I definitely accept that those *might* work with hair as they do skin, I'm just also curious if there are actually significant differences between the two as skin is a more complex network of living cells, while hair is mostly a bunch of bundled protein.",

I would love to see other people's reviews on hair products. :)\n\n[Deep Conditioner, Shampoo Brush, Scalp Essence, and Styling Wax](https://preview.redd.it/jxsbjdmqg7811.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8fa1e18447c09eb79feb82246301255d9da84e7b)\n\n**My Hair Background**\n\nHair texture: Wavy, Fine\n\nHair Type: *Dry*\n\nHair Health: *I am starting to get gray hair. I got my first one not too long ago. Split Ends are taking over my hair. I used a temporary color over 6 months ago that has washed out. My hair was virgin before the temporary color, but I don't know if I can still call it virgin since the color wash.*\n\nScalp Concerns: *Extra dry and sensitive, psoriasis.*\n\n**Too Cool For School Egg Remedy Hair Pack**\n\n[Too Cool for School Egg Remedy Hair Pack](https://preview.redd.it/igz4eiczg7811.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8aa9cee3e449a134de056a38e76ba904e542f03f)\n\nI bought this for the protein. It was $10.99 on Amazon.  It is a deep conditioner treatment meant to be used 1-2 times a week. It is for repairing hair. It not recommended for normal hair, or protein sensitive hair.\n\nScent: *Sweet like milk and honey*\n\nTexture: *Thick and creamy*\n\nCurly Girl Method Approved?: *No*\n\nSilicone Free?: *Nope, contains* *Dimethicone, Amodimethicone, and Cyclopentasiloxane*\n\nAlcohol Free? : *No, contains Isopropyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, and Stearyl Alcohol*\n\nAfter one use, my hair is softer and feels smoother. After using it, I put my hair in a microfiber hair cap to air dry. My hair dried straight, instead of wavy. My hair looked more shiny and healthier than before. If you are looking to keep your natural hair texture, I don't recommend this product.\n\nSee full Curly Girl Method Ingredient Breakdown [here](https://isitcg.herokuapp.com/Home/Results/9TayIxixVkeoUwqp7FYTgw).\n\n**Shampoo Brush**\n\n[Shampoo Brush](https://preview.redd.it/ny21b01hl7811.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dd0af98c4e7cf87aa0286fa46ad5ad045b6c42de)\n\nI bought this, because I do a lot of co-washes. I wanted to still be able to scrub my scalp clean, even though I don't use shampoo daily. I picked it up at Daiso for $1.50.\n\nThe bristles are made out of a rubber. It doesn't snag my hair, and I am able to brush through without issues. The handle is comfortable. It looks questionable, but for brushing your scalp it is perfect.\n\nMy scalp feels great when I use it. Using it feels like a little scalp massage. I have been using it for a few weeks now. I have noticed that my scalp doesn't feel as \"tight\" anymore. I really think it is helping, and I am glad I purchased it. I love using it, and will continue to use it.\n\n**Edit:** I forgot to mention that the shampoo brush is easier on my arthritic hands. It gives my scrubbing a little more power and doesn't hurt so much. \n\n**A'PIEU Healthy Scalp Doctor Tonic**\n\n[Hair Essence](https://preview.redd.it/1553s3nrm7811.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3eef80ce12cd882561d123de6c0b13fdbc61d116)\n\nI bought this for my dry scalp. I got it from Jolse for less than $10.\n\nI have been using it for a few months. It is used to treat over-oiled, itchy, dry scalp, and hair loss prevention. It contains Salicylic Acid, Peppermint, Rosemary, Menthol, and Allantoin. It is meant to be used after drying hair every other day. The bottle has a misting cap on it . You mist it directly to your scalp and massage throughout.\n\nOnce applied, it instantly feels cool, probably from the menthol. It does help keep the build up down, and my scalp doesn't have as much dander fallout.\n\nI think this would be better for oily skin. I won't be repurchasing, because I feel like I can find a better product suited for myself. I will use it up, and then try a mist from Innisfree.\n\nI was not able to find the full list of ingredients in English.\n\n**TONYMOLY Make HD Hair Wax - Super Hard Matte**\n\n[Tonymoly make HD Hair Wax - Super Hard Matte](https://preview.redd.it/n5i87lbxq7811.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1dceca026f002ac0b7f8e0c10a3433cfd1462733)\n\nI bought this for my husband. He has short fine black hair. He has some thinning and grays. His scalp is oily, and he has dandruff. I purchased this from Jolse for less than $5.\n\nHe does not care for it, but he says it isn't so bad that he will throw it away without finishing it. It doesn't hold as long as it suggests. It holds hair for about four hours. It dries matte. It doesn't leave a white cast, or white flakes. The color of the product is slightly gray. It has a strong scent of talcum. I will not be repurchasing this one, because the hold wasn't strong enough.",

    "body": "Hi everybody! This is my first post in r/HaircareScience, so let me know if I need to edit anything. I wanted to share some tips I have compiled and tested out for keeping your hair dye from fading as long as possible. I don't have much as far as academic research for this one, but a lot of this can be inferred from what is generally known about cosmetology and how our hair structure works. I personally have long, fine, wavy hair that is naturally a level 4 (medium brown), which I color at home to a level 3 (dark brown). I use permanent color. I am not a professional in either hairdressing or any scientific field; I am merely an average consumer that is interested in science and invested in making my hair color last as long as possible. This post isn't going to cover \"natural\" ways to dye or lighten your hair, such as henna, honey, lemon juice, etc. So let's get into it!\n\n- The Hair Color You Choose -\n1. There is a hierarchy of hair dye types that indicate how long your color is supposed to last. You will get the longest lasting results from a permanent hair dye, which uses ammonia and peroxide to break open your hair cuticle and deposit color into your hair shaft itself. In my experience, this type can still fade a little bit, but it lasts the longest because it changes the composition of your hair. You typically will only have to re-dye the new growth at the roots of your hair in a month or two. This type of hair color is the only way (out of the formulas I am discussing) to lighten your hair, and is the most effective way to completely cover grey hair. It also is the most damaging, just FYI. The next tier below that is demi-permanent hair color. Demi-permanent color formulas typically use no ammonia, but they do use a little bit of peroxide in order to activate the formula. These typically will last on your hair around 28 washes and will fade a little bit with each wash. They can handle a hair color that is the same level or darker than your natural hair color, but will not really be able to lighten your hair. Grey hairs will be \"blended\" in with the rest of the color and may look slightly lighter than the rest of the color, like highlights. The peroxide is slightly damaging to the hair, but is less damaging than average permanent dye formulas. The last type of hair color formula is semi-permanent. This type of color does not use ammonia or peroxide, it usually does not have to be mixed with an activator, and works by depositing color on top of your hair shaft. It doesn't change the composition of your natural hair at all, so it doesn't really damage it. This is the type of formula that \"fashion\" colors come in, AKA unnatural, vivid colors such as pinks, purples, blues, greens, etc. It lasts the least amount of time because it does not alter your hair's composition.\n\nSo, if you are looking to have a very long lasting hair color, go for a color that is labelled \"permanent.\" This isn't really an option if you want a \"fashion\" color, but I have heard rumors on the internet that companies are coming out with demi-permanent fashion colors that would last longer than the typical semi-permanent hair dye on the market, so be on the lookout! Also, many brands of semi-permanent hair dye have more superior formulas vs. their competitors, so checking out reviews for how long a brand lasts can really help you pick out what brand to buy! Which leads me to my next point... \n\n2. Find a high quality hair dye to use. Your best bet is to have a licensed stylist dye your hair for you, because they have access to professional level hair colors that have a very high quality standard. That being said, I am firmly in team \"DIY or die\" so I will tell you my tips for finding high quality hair color to use at home, which is your next best option. I recommend skipping the boxed dye that you can find at any drugstore in the U.S. (Ex: L'oreal, Garnier, Clairol, etc.) These are formulated to apply to any and every person who decides to use them, which means they are formulated to be harsh in order to penetrate even the most coarse, resistant, and grey of hairs. A good chunk of people have finer hair, less or no grey in their hair, or hair that is not resistant to dye uptake, so these dyes are going to be unnecessarily harsh and damaging for those people. (Hair stylists also often claim that the ingredients in these box dyes are inferior in quality to professional brands. This makes sense; however I could not find any consumer or academic studies that definitively PROVE this to be true. It is safe to say that people who went to school and have a license to do hair wouldn't lie about this, I am just reporting what I have/haven't found.) Instead, go to a beauty supply store such as Sally Beauty Supply (a U.S. chain). These stores are geared towards salon professionals, rather than the average consumer, so the dye there is of a higher quality than box dyes. In these stores, you buy your preferred color and developer separately, rather than sold together in a kit, so you can choose the level of peroxide developer that you need to dye your specific hair type. To buy every item that you would normally get in a box dye kit, it is usually between $15-$25 depending on the brand and store. In my experience, these dyes do last much longer than boxed dye kits on my hair. Usually when I use a box kit, the color fades right away as if I used a semi-permanent formula, rather than permanent. I get a very long-lasting result (with less damage!) from professional level formulas, and I highly recommend using them if you are coloring your hair at home. If you are using demi or semi-permanent hair dye, like I said previously, you can look up consumer reviews online and see anecdotal evidence of which brands are longer lasting.\n\n- After-Care for Maintaining Hair Color - \nSo now you've either gotten your hair colored by a professional or experimented at home, you love your new color, and you want to keep it vibrant until you have to touch up your root regrowth. These are tips that I have found effective and are supported by many hair stylists.\n\n1. Water is your hair's public enemy #1. Avoid getting your hair wet as much as you can. This means: wash your hair as infrequently as possible, cover your hair with a shower cap or clip it out of the way when you shower on other days, wear a swim cap if you go swimming, and if you are caught in a rainstorm, use an umbrella or cover your hair with the hood of your coat. You may ask, \"why do I need to avoid water?\" Water has a neutral pH of 7. Your hair has an acidic pH, typically between 4.5 and 5.5. When your hair is healthy and in its preferred acidic state, the cuticles of your hair are laying flat and smooth. When your hair's pH is raised, (Like when your hair is coated in water) the cuticles raise up. Hair dye adheres better to your hair when your cuticle is flat, and it escapes when the cuticles are raised. It's almost like a doorway in your hair composition that the dye molecules can move through. In order to keep your hair color from fading, you have to avoid getting your hair wet.\n\n2. Heat is your hair's public enemy #2! Avoid letting your hair get hot in any way. This includes the obvious, damage-inducing forms of heat such as using hair dryers, curling irons, and hair straighteners. (To see how awful heat styling tools are for colored hair, check out this video from hair colorist Guy Tang: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUG1Rp2FzBk) This also includes sneaky ways that heat gets to our hair, such as washing it in hot water! In addition to water inherently facilitating color fading, the heat from washing your hair in hot water ALSO raises your hair cuticle. Like I said before, this gives hair color molecules an easy way to slip right out of your hair and down the drain. Instead, wash your hair in water that is tepid to lukewarm. Aim for water that is room temperature, or slightly cooler. The water doesn't have to be ice cold, but avoid any steamy temperatures. I know for some people this can be absolute torture. In that case, you can wash your hair upside down in the shower so the spray of water isn't directly hitting your body, OR you can wash your hair separately in the kitchen sink so that you can wear clothes to keep you warm while you rinse your hair. \n\nAnother way that heat can sneak up on us is when the sun hits our hair! When you are outside on a hot sunny day and you can feel the sun beating down on your hair, this can cause your hair to fade! Antioxidants in hair products (such as vitamin E) can give your hair a little bit of protection. There are hair products that boast UV protection, so look for those the next time you go shopping. You can also wear a hat to keep your hair from getting too hot!\n\n3. Healthy hair holds on to color longer. Just like I mentioned above, healthy hair means a flattened cuticle. Flat cuticles will intrinsically hold on to hair color molecules more effectively than raised cuticles. A good guide to follow for maintaining healthy hair is in the sidebar of this subreddit. Things you can do include: trimming off the split ends and damage in your hair, washing your hair less frequently, using heat styling tools as little as possible, using conditioning products such as hair masks and leave-in conditioners regularly, and brushing/combing your hair gently to avoid snapping your hairs off. \n\n4. Use products specifically designed for color-treated hair in your hair care routine. Look for shampoos that are sulfate free, since they use gentler surfactants that strip less color than sulfate based shampoos will. Shampoos and conditioners formulated for color-treated hair will typically contain antioxidants to promote hair color retention and protect hair from the elements, as well as ingredients that keep your hair healthy and make it look shiny, like proteins, oils, silicones, and plant extracts. At the very least, find a shampoo and conditioner that say that they are safe for color treated hair on the packaging. \n\n5. Avoid clarifying treatments or shampoos. These are formulated to strip mineral deposits and product build-up from your hair and scalp. While they are effective, they will take a lot of hair color molecules right down the drain with them. If you struggle with build up on your hair, it's better to avoid the things that cause build-up in the first place. Getting a water filter for your shower will help immensely with mineral deposits in your hair, so if you live in an area with hard water or well water, this can be a lifesaver. If styling products or conditioners build up on your hair, try to identify the ingredients that cause the issue. Find lightweight styling products without heavy waxes. Some people have an issue with silicones building up on their hair. If this is the case for you, you can avoid water-insoluble silicones such as dimethicone and amodimethicone in favor of water-soluble silicones that wash out of your hair easily, such as silicones with the precursor PEG in their name. If you prefer, you can avoid silicones in your hair care routine altogether. \n\nI really hope this guide helps some of you out there. If you have questions, I will try to answer them to the best of my ability, but like I said before, I am not an expert. Thanks for reading!\n\nCitations: \n\nCasse, L. (2016, May 18).

I have tried so many sulphate free shampoos and never stuck to one, i was never impressed with any. So many of them i just ended up using on my body because i got bored of them and didn't like them. At first, i believed the \"sUlpHatEs aRe bAd fOR YoU' movie trop and then, when i got to know about the CGM, i got even more afraid of them (double homicide, if i may). But over the past year ive tried some shampoos with sls in them and i always noticed less hairfall.\n\nI have been concerned about my hairfall for years, ive lost the volume i used to have back in school and mom's comments on my hair is just the cherry on cake i need. I am trying my best to feel confident in the hair I have and not letting insecurities affect me yet trying to take care of them and reduce as much of hairfall as possible. \n\nI am, i think, loosing the normal amount of hair its just my brain telling me that I need to immediately rush to the doctor. Lowkey a triggering topic, tbvh. \n\nI am just thankful i started using sulphates again and i dont have any plans to stop.

I get less hairfall, it emulsifies easily, i dont need to spend a ton of time rubbing it in to remove any sort of build up and I haven't noticed any dryness of my hair as such. I haven't seen any difference in curls either (NOTE: I dont follow CGM rigorously, i have just picked up a couple of steps that suit me).\n\nI shampoo twice a week, once a week i either do aloeing or apply the khadi mask (an HG btw). Then i wrap my hair in a t-shirt and also wear a satin hair bonnet while sleeping. I have almost stopped using hair ties and only stick to those huge-ass clutchers (clips). I dont use any products after shampooing because i hate the feeling. I'll just sometimes use livon to finish that up but i don't think I'll be able to before it expires.\n\nMy shampoo method- I take a little bit of a shampoo in a mug, add water onto it and pour it on my scalp ONLY.

Our hair is dead tissue anyway, it's only the scalp that can benefit to an extent with the extra nourishment. Unless your hair is frizzy, avoid oils on the lengths.

Mukti gold herbal hairwash - this shampoo is used by my whole family and my dad especially have seen a drastic change in his hairfall  and we used to have tresseme shampoo before this, bcuz of which we switched onto this herbal hairwash shampoo\n2. A homemade serum after wash (aloevera gel, rose essential oil, glycerine, rose water), this makes my hair smell heavenly nice. Only I use it \n3. Cold pressed coconut oil before hair wash - for 1-2 hr , only me and my mom do the oiling part.\n4. Washing my hair more often - 3 times a week\n\nNow I would like the share the mistakes I used to make which when corrected helped me in hairfall.\n\n+ oiling for long hours -  I used to oil my hair a night before hairwash day. But one of my friend told me that oiling for long hours is one of the major reason of hairfall. So now I make sure that I don't keep oil in my hair for more than 2 hrs.\n\n+ Oiling with the right oil - I used to oil my hair with dabur amla hair oil  after which I switched to pure coconut oil.\n\n+ Diet - I eat 2 soaked walnuts, 10 soaked almonds, 2 soaked anjeer, 2 cashews. I drink anjeer water with anjeer. I have been following this religiously for a very long time. And I believe this has helped immensely in improving my hair texture. \n\n+ Washing my hair after every 2nd day - I have noticed that after every 2nd my hair gets oily and itchy and if I don't wash it the same day. My hair starts to fall out. I sort of wash my hair at every alternate day.\n\nLet me know if you guys have any questions related to this. \n\nHAPPY TO HELP üòä",

    "body": "Hey there! So I have extremely damaged hair that is breaking off every time I brush it (got a straight perm when my hair was bleached). In an effort to save my hair, I have learned so much about hair care through research and hair care classes and I wanted to share all the information I‚Äôve gathered!\n\n#Understanding Ingredients in Hair Care:\n\n##Surfactants:\nSurfactants are the main cleansing agents in shampoos. They often end in -ate or ‚Äúglucoside‚Äù.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair. They often end in -entrimonium chloride, -quaternium, or ‚Äúmethosulfate‚Äù (note: if an ingredient says methosulfate after a word, it is an **anti-static** NOT a sulfate).\nAnti-static ingredient examples: Behentrimonium chloride, Cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-17, quaternium-22, Behentrimonium methosulfate, etc.\n\n##Ingredients to use with caution:\n**Note: this is NOT a list of ingredients to avoid, but to rather use with caution.**\n\nThat being said, there are some ingredients which I do try to avoid, such as formaldehyde releasing preservatives (Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, and Diazolidinyl Urea).\n\nCocomidopropyl betaine impurities may cause scalp irritation: https://www.healthline.com/health/cocamidopropyl-betaine#how-to-avoid\n\nCoco-Betaine to be used with caution (pg.6-12): https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/alkbet032014final_0.pdf\n\nCocomide DEA and cancer: https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/cocamide-diethanolamine-cocamide-dea-coconut-oil-diethanolamine-condensate\n\nSoyamide DEA irritates unless formulated to be non irritating (21): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581813486300\n\nIsopropyl alcohol or SD alcohol (Volatile alcohols drying in high concentrations): https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/good-alcohols-vs-bad-alcohols\n\nWitch hazel can be drying: https://www.healthline.com/health/witch-hazel-for-hair#safety\n\nTriclosan not recognized as generally safe by FDA: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan\n\nTriethanolamine toxicity: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/706639-TRIETHANOLAMINE-TRIETHANOLAMINE/\n\nPVP/VA mild skin irritation (15-16): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818309140719\n\nIsopropyl palmitate mild skin irritation: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isopropyl-palmitate#section=EPA-Safer-Chemical\n\nQuaternium-15 formaldehyde releasing: https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/quaternium-15/\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate only safe in low concentrations: https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/butylcarbamate_rr.pdf\n\nDMDM Hydantoin and formaldehyde: https://www.chemscape.com/blog/DMDM-hydantoin-shampoo\n(This is the ingredient that OGX got sued over)\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea and formaldehyde: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/701923-DIAZOLIDINYL_UREA/\n\nPolyvinyl acetate insufficient evidence of safety in cosmetic products: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/705158-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE/\n\n#How to use Silicones and Sulfates Properly:\n\nSilicones are great, as they do the following for hair:\n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair shaft, making hair easier to brush and detangle\n\n-Great heat and UV protectant\n\n-Seals in moisture, prevents dryness\n\n-Gives hair a shiny appearance\n\n-Softens and smooths the cuticle\n\n##Silicones to use only if using a strong sulfate shampoo regularly:\n\nThese are very difficult to wash out of hair, even with a sulfate surfactant:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone\n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone\n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone\n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18\n\n-Cetyl Phosphate\n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone -Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n##Volatile silicones:\nThese evaporate after 10 minutes to a few hours after application. (Volatile just means they evaporate quickly):\n\n-Cyclomethicone\n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n##Easy to remove silicones:\nThese condition the hair, provide UV protection, and wash out with sulfate free surfactants:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate)\n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n##Resilient silicones:\nThese silicones can be removed with a sulfate AND some sulfate-free surfactants:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n##Cationic ingredients List:\n(Anti-static ingredients)\nThese ingredients usually end in ‚Äú-imonium chloride‚Äù. These are in basically every conditioner to reduce static in hair:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate (this is NOT a sulfate, it‚Äôs an anti-static)\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n#Sulfates:\n\n##Mild Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are best used to remove volatile and easy to remove silicones. They can only remove resilient silicones with multiple washes, unless paired with many different sulfate free surfactants (a shampoo that has 3-4 or these in their ingredients list):\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n-Sodium Cocoate\n\n-Potassium Cocoate\n\n##Sulfate free surfactants that can remove resilient silicones:\n\nThese can remove resilient silicones, but not on their own, so usually a shampoo will use a combination of 2-3 of these:\n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate\n\n##High Strength Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are technically sulfate free, but they are **just** as thoroughly cleansing as sulfates, so they can still strip hair dye. Best used for removing resilient silicones\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n##Sulfates that remove resilient silicones:\n\nStrong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Do not use if you have colored hair, as it will fade your color\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n#Understanding Protein in Hair:\n\nHair is made of protein, proteins are made of amino acids and peptides. Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt‚Äôs best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this ‚Äúprotein overload‚Äù is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair. This just means putting a light weight oil on towel dried hair. I use the OGX coconut milk serum oil as my sealant:\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/coconut-milk-anti-breakage-serum-xlsImpprod2960061\n\n##Protein Products:\n\n**-Hask Keratin Protein Deep Conditioning

Hydrolyzed collagen, hydrolyzed wheat protein (5th and 6th ingredient)\n\n##I‚Äôve included this product list more for myself because it is very hard to find products with varying protein types and sizes.\n\n##The above information about protein and sulfates was found on Science-y Hair Blog!\n\n#Ingredients for Scalp Health:\n\n##Aloe Vera Gel:\n\nAloe is a great natural scalp soother and also helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it‚Äôs wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

    "body": "Edit: apparently this wasn't clear from my post (sorry!) but I absolutely use regular conditioner, lots of it, when washing my hair. I am still working my way through at least 20 recommendations to try to find one that is effective and haven't found it yet. My disability means my time in the shower is limited, so without the ability to spend 20 or 30 minutes deep conditioning, I rely heavily on leave-ins. I can no longer use my shower chair due to nerve damage.\n\n*****\n\nI have 2C **extra thick** hair that goes down below my butt. I know that my curl pattern isn't very tight, but my hair is much more difficult than people expect. Even when my hair was only shoulder length, I had to warn my colorists that they would need to use twice the amount of product they expected to cover my head. \n\nI managed to take great care of it for years, until I recently, very rapidly, developed a bunch of skin conditions that made me reactive to every last one of my tried and true products.\n\nA test revealed extensive allergies and I'm in tears because I think I may have to cut my long hair off. I have purchased so many shampoos, conditioners, and detanglers and I can't find anything I'm not allergic to that effectively detangles my hair. My hair is knotting so badly I am having to cut the knots out of my hair. The allergy plus curly combo has been lethal.\n\nIt's become a crisis because I'm also severely disabled, and the extra time on my feet spent trying to condition and detangle my hair with inferior products (just so I can remove the knots! I just put it in one big braid after) is injuring me. I'm worried I may have no choice but to cut off all my hair I've been growing out (but regularly trimming) for 9 years.\n\nI know this might not seem like a big deal, but my hair is the only thing I have left that makes me feel pretty after my illness & disability have taken everything else. I am desperate to save it, but I can't maintain it safely anymore.\n\nI am severely allergic (my skin melts right off) to these ingredients:\n\nALL fragrances of any kind. Severely allergic to essential oils & yes, even anything marked \"natural\" fragrance. Unfortunately, if it isn't fragrance-free, I can't use it.\n\nCinnamic aldehyde (cinnamon & it's derivatives).\n\nPropolis (beeswax).\n\nBalsam of Peru.\n\nYlang-ylang (cananga odorata).\n\n\nThe only ingredient I know for certain detangles my hair well enough is Amodimethicone, but of course I'm open to any suggestions. It's been hard to find Amodimethicone in fragrance free options. I tend to need extremely heavy, thick conditioners. Much more so than people would expect with my curl pattern. I would love shampoo and conditioner recommendations as well but it's the detangler that I'm really looking for most of all. \n\nI'm not wealthy, but I won't turn my nose up at any recommendation. If I have even a hope of affording it, I will try to save my hair. \n\nI'm also not opposed to making things at home if my disability allows.\n\nThank you to everyone for any suggestions you may have.\n",

Thankfully Ive never used oils or plug one and have a facial sunscreen that I tested in a patch test and I know I'm not allergic to. So at least I have a few positives",

    "body": "**TL;DR: Don't fuck up like me. Make sure your moisturizer, primer, and foundation all have the same base or you will regret it.** \n\nOk, I know that this topic has come up a lot recently, but I feel like a lot of discussions leave out a key part of the problem. By now, I think most people know that you have to make sure your primer and foundation have the same base i.e. are they water based or silicone based. It makes sense since those two are layered one on top of the other and if they're immiscible then the foundation will just settle on top and come off on everything, defeating the purpose of a primer. Now, what I haven't seen discussed is how your moisturizer may be interacting with your primer and foundation. I've discovered some interesting things through trial and error recently and wanted to share it with the MUA community.\n\nFirst, I recently switched moisturizers. My skin has been a disaster this winter and I needed a major skincare overhaul. I have sensitive skin and Neutrogena has always had my back with great products that don't irritate my skin. One of the new things I got was a moisturizer with hyaluronic acid, the [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/hydro+boost+water+gel.do?sortby=ourPicks). I love this product because it absorbs quickly, eliminated my dry spots, and hasn't caused any irritation. What I didn't take into account when I bought this product was the ingredients list; I was just happy to find a non-irritating hyaluronic acid delivery system. \n\nwater, **dimethicone**, glycerin, **dimeticone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer**, phenoxyethanol, polyacrylamide, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, dimethiconol, C13-14 isoparaffin, **dimethicone crosspolymer**, chlorphenesin, carbomer, laureth-7, sodium hyaluronate, ethylhexylglycerin, fragrance, C12-14 pareth-12, sodium hydroxide, blue 1 \n\nThe bolded ingredients indicate it's a silicone-based primer. Yes, the first ingredient is water, but the silicone is present in large amounts, and it interacts differently with water-based products.\n\nMistake 1: I was going for a low-effort look one day and decided to used some of my face powder and call it good. With face powder I usually wear my [NYX HD Primer](http://www.nyxcosmetics.com/high-definition-primer/NYX_180.html) because it's lighter but still holds the powder in place. That day my makeup was slipping and sliding everywhere and I looked like a cakey hot mess when I got home. I checked the ingredients on my moisturizer, found all the silicone, then looked at the primer ingredients. \n\n**Water/Aqua/Eau,** Propylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Diethylhexyl Maleate, Glycerin, Ethylene/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Dimethicone, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, PEG-15 Glyceryl Isostearate, Trihydroxystearin, Adipic Acid/Neopentyl Glycol Crosspolymer, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Tocopheryl Acetate, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax/Cera Carnauba/Cire de Carnauba, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7, Silica, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin,  Propylene Glycol Stearate, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Laurate, Propylene Glycol Laurate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Butylene Glycol, Salicornia Herbacea Extract, Copper Tripeptide-1,  Chlorphenesin, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, VP/VA Copolymer, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, C12-14 Pareth-7, Amodimethicone,  Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance/Parfum, Citronellol, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. MAY CONTAIN / PEUT CONTENIR (+/-): Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Zinc Oxide (CI 77947), Chromium Hydroxide Green (CI 77289), Ultramarines (CI 77007).\n\nThe water-based primer just sat on top of my moisturizer, making my makeup come off all over everything.\n\nMistake 2: I somehow spaced and forgot all about my moisturizer issues and yesterday I was rushing to leave and decided to just throw on some Sonia Kashuk Radiant Tinted Moisturizer and go. Wrong move. I had already washed my face and moisturized previously, so the Neutrogena moisturizers was under the tinted moisturizer. As I was rubbing the tinted moisturizer on my face, it started to ball up and look disgusting. I quickly wiped it off and left bare faced, but later I looked at the ingredients in the Sonia Kashuk Tinted Moisturizer. \n\nFluorphlogopite, Sorbitan Is Os Tearate,\nTris Iloxane, D Is Teardimonium Hectorite,\nCetyl Peg/Ppg‚Äê10/1 D Imethicone,\nD Imethicone Cros S Polymer, Butylene Glycol,\nSilica D Imethyl Silylate, Synthetic Bees Wax,\nTetras Odium Ed Ta, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium\nChloride, Alcohol, Talc, Peg‚Äê30\nD Ipolyhydroxys Tearate, Aluminum\nHydroxide, Potas S Ium Sorbate, Stearic Acid,\nCaprylyl Methicone, As Corbyl Palmitate,\nTocopherol, Pentaerythrityl Tetra‚ÄêDi‚ÄêT‚ÄêButyl\nHydroxyhydrocinnamate.\nMay Contain: Mica, Titanium D Ioxide, Iron\nOxides , Zinc Oxide.\n\nThis one is a little more tricky, as it does have some dimethicone ingredients, but my best guess is that the other ingredients react negatively with the ingredients in the Neutrogena moisturizer.\n \nNow, I know this sounds like using the Neutrogena moisturizer is too much of a pain, but it's really not that big of a deal. My favorite primer, the [ELF Poreless Face Primer](http://www.elfcosmetics.com/p/poreless-face-primer?dept=face-faceprimer), works perfectly with this moisturizer and my HG foundation, [Revlon Colorstay Whipped](http://www.revlon.com/products/face/foundation-makeup/revlon-colorstay-whipped-creme-makeup#309971347054||0), goes on better than ever. I just wanted to make this post to inform people that mismatched moisturizer can cause just as many issues as mismatched primer and foundation!",

But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/‚ÄãVinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only.

Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff.

I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember. I used up the entire bottle. I think 9ish months?? or more.\n\nConsistency: Normal shampoo consistency, HEAVILY fragranced. It's marketed towards Men, I think, so it smells of Men's aftershave.\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above.

I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

I'm not sure why this works since leaving hair in water isn't good, but it does. Between just straight up applying it and doing this, this works better. I leave it on for 5 minutes and then rinse it off.\n\nReview: This is a cult favourite  around here and for very good reason. I use this in the place of a conditioner. This conditions. I get nice, shiny frizz free hair. The cost - benefit was insane and this was HG. Not going to say anything else, because it's not available and it's pointless.  I paid higher than MRP to get my hands on a tub, when I realised it was going to be rEfORmuLAted and I've had no regrets so far.

Straight up applying and mixing it with water, both works equally well. You might use up more if straight up applying it.\n\nReview: This is brilliant protein conditioner. If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

    "body": "After reading a few comments on this sub I was rather curious about [amodimethicone](https://labmuffin.com/amodimethicone-my-new-favourite-hair-ingredient/). I have thick long 2C/3A hair that has been partly bleached (balayage and an older ombre). Curly hair as-is tends to feel '[dry'](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/lmmlcn/does_water_actually_make_hair_feel_moisturized/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and a lot of my strands are kinky, so when I run my fingers on them they feel rough. Putting that all together I have a lot of hair that is long (has been around 36+ months), has been through bleaching and semi-permanent coloring, is at times heat dried and thus I'll vote for 'damaged' as a qualifier.\n\n*Method:*\n\nI compared a conditioner rich with amodimethicone against one where that was not one of the main ingredients. I did this comparison on air dried hair with and without my styling products. For those keeping score at home, this was 4 different wash days.\n\nThe process was: wash with shampoo twice, apply conditioner, finger detangle the hair, rinse, plop on microfiber for 5 minutes, plop on cotton tshirt for 20. For the styling product arm, I applied product after the towel, by scrunching from ends to roots, and then plopped with tshirt.\n\nNow, were this a quantitative lab experiment I'd have used a simple shampoo (not one with 30+ingredients) and would have made my own conditioner so that the only difference was the amodimethicone. This is NOT a quantitative lab experiment. It is user experience research in that I'm using fully formulated products, in their shiny packaging and with their shiny fragrances.  Serious consumer research tries to eliminate these biases, but here we are.\n\nI picked [L'Oreal Everpure Frizz-Defy Conditioner](https://www.lorealparisusa.com/products/hair-care/products/conditioner/everpure-frizz-defy-conditioner.aspx?shade=frizz-defy-conditioner) as the amodimethicone sample as it is the third ingredient. I chose this one because I had unimpressive results in the past with other products of that line with similar ingredients and no amodimethicone. \n\nI compared the Everpure against Olaplex 5, which has amodimethicone as ingredient 24 and 25. I'm calling that \"significantly less than the L'Oreal product\".\n\nI used Olaplex 4 as the shampoo. It also contains amodimethicone as ingredient number 18.\n\nI'm not worried about the quantity of amodimethicone on the Olaplex products based on the [typical use between 1 and 15%.](https://www.makingcosmetics.com/fact-sheets/fact-sheet-amodimethicone.pdf) and how far down it shows up in the ingredient list.\n\nStyling products: Living Proof Fresh Cut\\*, AG Recoil, DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam.\n\n*Results:*\n\nI like Olaplex 4 and 5, and alternate them with my Deva products. My curls are defined and abundant. I can't finger comb when dry whether or not I have product on. The descriptions below are in comparison to Olaplex 5.\n\n**Air dry, no styling products:** The first thing to note is that L'Oreal's conditioner left my hair super silky. Like, SUPER. Clearly there was a nice, nice film spread on the strands, and it was smooth sailing from root to ends. My dry hair had volume and had defined curls. However all my curls were looser. I'm specifically calling out loose over elongated here, as I went from 2C/3A to 2B all around. Oh, and *seriously little to no frizz.*\n\n**Air dry, styling products**: It took 7 hours to air dry my hair, about an hour longer than with Olaplex products. This can be because of product application and air humidity though. All curls were waves--super defined, 2A/2B with two amazingly glorious tight spirals. This is looser than my normal 2C/3A. There was very little volume, with most of the wave/curls on lower mids and ends. No frizz day-of, very little frizz after sleeping with hair on a pineapple and satin pillowcase. This totally will last a day longer than usual, which is a win. HUGE win: the nape of my hair is not a bird's nest, its normal state.\n\n**End result: I enjoyed the filmy feeling the conditioner left on my hair. The feeling is what I would sensorily call \"healthy hair\". True to the marketing and product name, I had little to no frizz.** \n\n**My curls were looser, more like waves, and it would be most helpful to use this on the wash days I plan on blow drying my hair straight instead of wearing it curly.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*If you are here for the asterisk: Living Proof PhD Fresh Cut Split End Mender has been discontinued. I like it because it leaves my ends feeling smooth but the idea that it 'zips the split ends down' is cute (That is a quote from the company customer support on an email they sent me).",

    "body": "Over the summer, I vacationed in Portugal for three weeks to visit family. I brought my standard products with me, but fully expected my hair to be a frizzy mess because of the humidity. I have fine wavy hair that's a mix of different patterns (can be 2b on the top layers and almost straight at the very bottom layer underneath).\nI've had a really hard time figuring out how to treat my hair and have tried all sorts of different tactics (slicone free, with silicones like amodimethicone, low protein, with protein, with heavy moisturizers like shea butter, with lightweight moisturizers, clarifying with a mild shampoo every day, going a week in between shampooing, etc.). The only consistent thing I've noticed is that my hair does seem to dry quickly - I can only dry it with a towel for a minute or two before it feels like all the water is being sucked out - and I routinely have issues with my hair feeling coarse and frizzy shortly after getting out of the shower, while it's still wet. When it's dry, frizz has always been one of the biggest issues for me. Even when I've over-moisturized and my hair feels kind of greasy and weighed down, I can still have problems with frizz.\n\nAnyhow, during this vacation, I was shocked when I took a shower, put in my leave-in products, went to bed, and woke up and my hair actually looked good. It was wavier than it usually is and the curl pattern was more consistent. It wasn't as frizzy either. I thought this was a fluke, but sure enough, every day I repeated the same routine (shower at night, using the same products that I do at home, go to bed) and woke up with hair that looked great when dry.\nNow that I'm back home, I'm having problems again with my hair feeling stringy, frizzy, and just bad in general. I had my water tested to see what could be going on and noticed there was excessive chlorine in the water. That's been fixed with a new water filter (at least a month or two ago) but my hair only marginally improved. I‚Äôve been trying to keep up with adding salt to the water softener as well, but this also only leads to marginal improvements.\n\nHas anyone else here had a similar experience? Is there any way to recapture what made my hair look and feel so good in another country, or am I out of luck unless I move somewhere with very different water or a radically different climate? How do I begin to piece together what went right and what‚Äôs going wrong now?",

[K√©rastase] is just so dang expensive,\" she says, recalling when she was introduced to the brand almost two decades ago. Her first film had left her hair \"super damaged, it was like sprigs and sprouts,\" so she went to a salon for help. \"They're like, 'And it's $48. I was like, 'Excuse me, per bottle?' And I need four. I need four bottles, so it's going to cost me $200 to wash my hair.\"*\n\n*‚ÄùI wanted to replicate the systems and the patterns that I already loved.\" Lively recently told a small group of editors at a downtown New York City hotel. \"There are different products that were the benchmarks, which I can reference. Are we allowed to... is that illegal? Is that why people don't do it?\"*\n\n*We will leave those questions to her lawyers because Lively was refreshingly transparent about the inspiration for her new collection of eight products, which includes shampoos, masks, and styling products*\n\n*We had Romanowski blindly compare the Blake Brown Nourishing Mask to the K√©rastase Nutritive Masquintense formula, and, he says, \"the main difference between these products is that product A [K√©rastase] contains silicones like amodimethicone and aminopropyl dimethicone. Product B [Blake Brown] lacks silicones, so I would not expect it to work as well for important conditioning properties like detangling, increased shine, and increased smooth feel.\"*\n\nhttps://www.allure.com/story/blake-brown-hair-brand-review\n\n\n...and this is why her products don't work to control frizz! They're not formulated with the essential properties to do so. So Blake, true to form, had been inspired to hijack another's blueprint (she admits to being \"inspired\" by Kerastase - aka the brand that uses conditioning masks in place of conditioner - but for all intents and purposes, the Kerastase masks are an equivalent to conditioner) and churned out a subpar product.\nAs you can see from the professional assessment above, the Kerastase hair masks ARE conditioners. Blake missed the mark, seemingly not being able to grasp that Kerastase DOES in fact use conditioners, they're just marketed as masks.\n\n*You will notice there is no traditional conditioner in the line, and that's because Lively hasn't used one in years.\nDuring her early days on Gossip Girl, she noticed that hairstylists and colorists only used masks after shampooing her hair. \"They were like, 'Oh God, no, we don't use conditioners.\" Ever since, she hasn't either.*\n\n*But Give Back Beauty, the company Lively partnered with for the line, didn't love the idea of skipping the conditioner category altogether. \"They were like, 'You have to have a conditioner offering because if people don't see that you have conditioner, they'll go to someone else with a conditioner and then you may lose the shampoo sale also,\" she recalls. \"I said, I know, but that feels dishonest because I use masks. Every single wash. I don't want to offer conditioner just to offer it.\" She's willing to lose the sale.\nHere's the interesting thing, though: \"From a formula standpoint, [conditioners and masks] are not different,\" explains cosmetic chemist Perry Romanowski. \"They do the same things. They coat the hair, and some ingredients might penetrate the fiber a bit, but [masks] are just a thickened up version of regular conditioners.\" Cosmetic chemist Trefor Evans adds that the benefits of any conditioning treatment, whether it comes in a bottle or a tube or a jar, are \"dependent on how much of the product you put on and how long you let it deposit on the hair.\" Timing really is everything, even with hair care. \"You could completely skip a mask, in all honesty, and just leave your regular conditioner on for an extra two or three minutes.\" Evans savs.*\n\n\nIMO this is why her brand failed, it has nothing to do with Justin. She's sold a hair care system that isn't delivering the results people expect and her own hair is a testament to her products efficacy or lack thereof.\n\nUnbelievable. To lack even the most basic amount of hair care knowledge but to possess the hubris to launch your own product.\n\nIt‚Äôs failed on its own merit, or lack thereof. I postulate she‚Äôs walking around with ruined hair as a result of switching from Kerastase to her own dismal formulations and their lack of conditioning properties.\n\nAll because Blake failed to grasp that KERASTASE MASKS ARE CONDITIONERS ! You were using conditioner, dammit Blake! But given your lack of beauty school, general comprehension etc., you‚Äôve seeming commissioned the formulation of non-conditioning masks (ie.conditioners)* and are skipping conditioner all together.\n\nHer hair is likely overloaded with protein and brittle af, in urgent need of a hedge trimmer and deep conditioning, less chemical and heat processing and leave-in hair conditioner and oil. Oh well.\n\n[https://www.allure.com/story/blake-brown-hair-brand-review](https://www.allure.com/story/blake-brown-hair-brand-review)\n\n* I‚Äôm keen to look into the ‚Äúmask‚Äù ingredients further but will have to be another time‚Ä¶I‚Äôm curious if they‚Äôre protein-rich‚Ä¶you need a balance between protein and conditioning, too much of either aka balance out of whack and hair goes out of whack‚Ä¶more complicated than that and there‚Äôs other factors too to consider, like incorporation of silicones for smoothing of frizz etc‚Ä¶can any hair care professions confirm/correct my statements?\n\n\n\nhttps://www.allure.com/story/blake-brown-hair-brand-review",

Long story short, it doesn't build up on the hair like other silicones can due to its positive electrical charge, so I found a product that lists amodimethicone as the 2nd ingredient.\n\n**My hair went from straw to silk in two washes.**\n\nI think it's because the product I'm using is a leave-in spray rather than a rinse-out conditioner. I am now alternating the amodimethicone spray with my leave-in conditioner. Since I wash my hair about twice a week, this means the spray only touches my hair once per week. I feel the effects all week, even when I put a coat of leave-in conditioner over the top of it two days later.\n\nI can't stop admiring my hair in the mirror and have even started wearing it down in zoom meetings. *That* hasn't been happening in a while. Product is \"Super Strong Liquid Treatment\" by Paul Mitchell. Currently $10 for a small bottle at Walmart and $21 for a large bottle at Ulta/Target. You can also consult INCI Decoder's [extremely long and disorganized list](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone) of products containing amodimethicone.\n\nEdit: added bit about the amodimethicone molecule's electrical charge to shore up evidence/sourcing a bit.",

Since the first layer removes the last one, it won't build up, but to remove the layer if you want to do anything else to your hair, use a clarifying shampoo with an anionic surfactant (Virtually every shampoo has sodium Laureth sulfate) to remove it. OP, can you give an update on whether this is still working for you? Since it's positively charged it will bond more to damaged hair and possibly not the roots which are likely more nonpolar and hydrophobic based on the source listed. Maybe this is what works best for op anyway.\n\nTo be honest though, amodimethicone is already present in a lot of conditioners and combined with dimethicone which is non polar. Amazon Basics Moisture Rich Conditioner has both and might be better cause it will bond to both polar and nonpolar. If prone to buildup, can always use a clarifying shampoo every now and then.\n\nSilicone hate is unwarranted!\n\nSource: [https://www.ijtrichology.com/article.asp?issn=0974-7753;year=2015;volume=7;issue=1;spage=2;epage=15;aulast=Gavazzoni](https://www.ijtrichology.com/article.asp?issn=0974-7753;year=2015;volume=7;issue=1;spage=2;epage=15;aulast=Gavazzoni)",

DevaCurl, Jessicurl, Trepadora, Uncle Funky's Daughter, Kinky Curly, Shea Moisture, As I Am, Curl Keeper, Innersense, Ecoslay, Curlsmith... the list is long. My conclusions: it's all marketing. Most of those hyped up brands are not water soluble and leave buildup on hair, despite being promoted as \"cgm approved\", \"science based\", \"organic\", \"professional grade\" etc etc. The truth is that most brands will launch products with good ingredients and formulations, then once they become established and over-hyped, will reformulate and expand their range with much lower quality ingredients / products and just ride the wave of popularity. All in the name of profits.  Most of the \"big players\" like L'oreal, Garnier etc don't even need to bother, because they are omnipresent and have endless marketing budgets, so they are basically reselling slightly modified formulas with ever-\"innovative\" marketing claims.\n\nHere is the thing: hair is dead matter. It can't heal. It can't be rejuvenated or rebuilt. All we know how to do is to mask the damage. Usually by coating it with silicones, so it appears smoother. Olaplex and K18 can TEMPORARILY restructure broken bonds. The marketing says they \"repair damage\", yet for some reason - you have to continue using it. If something is repaired - why does it need to be repaired over and over again? Ain't no bleached blonde on this planet who could apply one of those \"miracle\" products on their hair and repair it, so it would magically become 100% healthy, virgin hair again. It's all just bs. But as long as people are gonna want to alter the appearance of their hair (by coloring and heat styling - both of which inevitably cause irreversible damage), this industry will be blooming. Because people ignore science and believe their hairdressers and influencers.",

These are all silicones you'd want to avoid:\n \n* Cetearyl Methicone\n\n* Cetyl Dimethicone\n\n* Dimethicone\n\n* Dimethiconol\n\n* Stearyl Dimethicone\n \n* Amodimethicone\n\n* Cyclomethicone/Cyclopentasiloxane\n\n* Trimethylsilylamodimethicone\n\nNot so hard, right? So now lets take a look at some oils/waxes that are generally frowned upon.\n\nHere is a list of waxes and non-natural oils to avoid:\n\n* Castor oil\n\n* Mineral oil (parrifidium liquidium)\n\n* Petrolatum\n\n* Waxes: bees wax, candelia wax, etc.\n\nSo when you've got a product in your hand, you now know what to look for when you're wanting to avoiding buildup.\n\nFor sulfates, there really isn't a cheat sheet, other than looking up the ingredients and comparing to your product of choice.\n\nHere is a list of sulfates to avoid:\n\n* Alkylbenzene sulfonates\n\n* Alkyl Benzene Sulfonate\n\n* Ammonium laureth sulfate\n\n* Ammonium lauryl sulfate\n\n* Ammonium Xylenesulfonate\n\n* Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate\n\n* Sodium cocoyl sarcosinate\n\n* Sodium laureth sulfate\n\n* Sodium lauryl sulfate\n\n* Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n\n* Sodium myreth sulfate\n\n* Sodium Xylenesulfonate\n\n* TEA-dodecylbenzenesulfonate\n\n* Ethyl PEG-15 cocamine sulfate\n\n* Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate\n\nI hope this helps. I know when I first started CG, I was overwhelmed... but once you know what to look for, it isn't as difficult to look up ingredients in the store. :)\n",

It was used to replace formaldehyde as a preservative in products [Winter pg 351]. ‚Äî This is in many of the conditioners I've been using for years, and I‚Äôve had no problems.‚ÄîT \n\nThis is in one of my favorite, go to conditioners that I've been using for well over ten years, and another I've been using regularly for five (even though I'm sure it's in there in a very teeny amount). It has not caused any problems as far as conditioning and defining my hair. That's why I'm calling it a \n\n* * Tried and true ingredient * * * \n\nAlso, here is the other ingredient\n\nStearamidopropyl dimethylamine    \n\nCaution \n\nUsed to keep product from separating, but it can also be used to add slip and conditioning. Made from Stearic fatty acid. Dimethylamine can be slightly corrosive and irritating if it isn't neutralized properly (according to my trusty Organic Chemistry text book, Dimethylamines are very alkaline [pg 983]). This comes in a tan, waxy solid. It's known to cling well to the hair without being greasy [Hunting (Conditioning) pg 395 and Winter pgs 491, 208]. \n\n‚ÄîI have to say that this is in most of my favorite products that I've been using for years, and my hair is fine. I'm thinking this has been neutralized enough so it isn't corrosive and is conditioning instead. This ingredient often gives enough slip to a conditioner that I can comb my hair with it, and not need another slippery ingredient in the product. However, I'm going to put it as a \"caution\" so you can decide for yourself‚ÄîT \n\nThis is in one of my favorite, go to conditioners that I've been using for well over ten years, and another I've been using for about five years. It has not caused any problems as far as conditioning and defining my hair. That's why I'm calling it a \n\n* * * Tried and true ingredient * * *",

        "body": ">Conventional shampoo technology using anionic surfactants and cationic conditioners results in charge interaction and complexing of he ingredients. Neither shampoo nor conditioner achieves the desired result. The successful solution was to incorporate charge neutral dimethicone conditioning ingredients, suspended as microfine droplets within complex crystal lattices, into anionic surfactant shampoo technology. The same solultion has also been applied to amphoteric surfactant systems. This provides complete cleaning, and hair conditioning fully equal to separate conditioners without the problems of build-up. This was achieved by keeping the dimethicone in suspension throughout the shampoo process. During rinsing, excess water breaks the crystalline lattice and allows deposition of the dimethicone droplets onto the hair. Full cleaning and conditioning are, therefore, achieved in one application. Dimethicone build-up is not encountered as subsequent washes first remove soil and previously deposited dimethicone. Neither do neutral dimethicones show any interactions with sebum. \n\n[(Rushton, Gummer & Flasch, 1994)](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/211278)\n\nOne of the authors is affiliated with Proctor and Gamble.\n\nAs to why it doesn't appear to leave build up, the same article states that \"no significant shift compared to untreated hair was found showing that dimethicone does not build-up on the hair surface with continued washing\" and that \"the level of dimethicone deposited onto virgin hair was found to plateau after 5 washes...and remained constant for in excess of 50 washes.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> since shampoo is primarily focused on the scalp does the silicone deposit on it? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure, but I would guess that it might. Silicones are used in skincare though, so I am not sure why that would be a concern:\n\n>The major drawback to pure petrolatum as a moisturizer is its greasiness, which most patients find unaesthetic. This can be minimized by lowering the petrolatum concentration and adding dimethicone, known as an astringent moisturizer,to improve product aesthetics. **Dimethicone is the second most common active agent in moisturizers today** because it too is hypoallergenic, noncomedogenic, and nonacnegenic.4 Dimethicone is one of a family of silicones that form the basis of all oil-free moisturizers and facial foundations......Dimethicone can provide many other skin benefits as an active agent besides moisturization. It can function as an emollient, making the skin smooth and soft to the touch by filling in spaces between the desquamating corneocytes.\n\n(emphasis mine)\n\n[(Draelos, 2010)](https://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/Abstract/2010/02000/Active_Agents_in_Common_Skin_Care_Products.38.aspx)",

I know my scalp and how it behaves and if going back to sulphates and silicones don't help I will definitely check in with a derm but I don't want someone else to wait that long. \n\nThat being said, my problem arouse from cutting sulphates and not cleansing properly because my scalp is oily like the rest of my body. So I'd suggest assessing your scalp type because scalp health = hair health. Trying Neutrogena tsal might help with the itchiness (sadly I can't because it isn't available in India) \n\nNote how many days it takes for your scalp to get greasy and produce buildup, schedule your Shampooing guided by your scalp type and the amount of sebum buildup. For example, If you notice flaking, it might be time for a wash. To protect your hair from getting damaged from frequent shampooing, try the condition-wash-condition method, condition your hair length (NOT THE SCALP, DO NOT PUT ANYTHING ON THE SCALP) then shampoo with the conditioner on the length, rinse everything out and again conditioner your hair length. It will help with the frizziness. Protein treatments might help temporarily like all hair treatments but using a shampoo with sulphates will wash it out. For frizzy try a leave in. You've mentioned your hair is brittle perhaps you need to add moisture to it and a leave in might help. \n\nAlso wash your pillow cases atleast one a week or every five days. This might help with the itchiness and invest in a satin pillowcase to minimise frizz.\n\nAnd for itchiness, this...... Might help.... sesame seed oil when applied on clean scalp has moisturising effect which can reduce itchiness and flaking. \n\n[Source](https://www.healthline.com/health/sesame-oil-for-hair)\n\nAnd lastly as an Indian, I just have to suggest this, it's the law, you probably saw this coming from mile away but apply coconut oil on the hair (if your hair \"likes\" it that is because there are cases of coconut oil sensitivity) coconut oil is the most penetrative oil on earth (that is not an exaggeration, that is a scientific fact) prevents hygral fatigue which in turn lessens hair breakage and damage.",

    "body": "As a stylist, the most frequent question I get is ‚Äúhow often should I shampoo?‚Äù. My response always is \"first and foremost, it's important to know how to shampoo properly so when you do, it counts\".¬† From how shampoo works to the most common ingredients, I answer all of your shampoo-related questions below.¬†\n\n(This is the entire text from my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html))\n\n**How does shampoo work?**¬†‚Äã\n\nYou can think of the active ingredient in shampoo as being within [two categories](https://www.nycoproducts.com/resources/blog/simple-science-the-difference-between-soap-and-detergent/): (1) non-detergents (soap) and (2) detergents. Non-detergents are made from natural ingredients and act as an emulsifier¬†for oil and water. This makes it easier to rinse impurities away when it's washed out. Detergents are synthetic, man-made chemicals with¬†active agents (wetting agents) capable of lowering the surface tension of a liquid. These are known as [surfactants](https://www.hairstory.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-detergent/), and they do this by having a hydrophilic \"head\" and a hydrophobic \"tail\", which essentially allows¬†the shampoo to stick to oils and dirt in your hair. Those oils and dirt are then swept away when washed out. Another way to understand the difference between non-detergents and detergents: the former will leave a residue behind while the latter will not.[ ](https://www.hairstory.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-detergent/)[Simplifying Hair Products II](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-simplifying-hair-products-ii.html) breaks down the purpose of other ingredients you'll find in shampoos to make them effective and pourable (i.e. the opposite of powered shampoos that are becoming more popular).¬†\n\n**How often should I shampoo?**\n\n‚ÄãSome hair types will need to shampoo daily and others only need to wash once every ten days or so. Preference also plays a role here depending if you're trying to achieve a sleek look or a voluminous one. Shampooing less will condense your hair over time and allow it to hold more oils, which shampooing more will remove oils and promote a fuller look.¬†Think about the following factors as you keep reading through this post, and check out [Post-Workout Hair](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-post-workout-hair.html) to learn more tips and tricks for¬†managing your hair with a busy life.\n\n*Your hair's density*\n\n* ‚Äã*Fine:* Needs to be washed daily, particularly if you have skin that is more oily. People with this hair type often feel that their hair looks too flat if they try to style it without washing and drying it first.¬†\n* *Thick:* Can be washed¬†anywhere from once every three days to once every¬†ten days.¬†People with this hair type often feel that their hair looks too voluminous or puffy¬†if they wash too frequently. Thick hair¬†also takes¬†longer to blow dry and style, making it a nightmare to wash daily because of the amount of time it adds to your¬†routine.¬†\n\n*Your hair's condition/damage*\n\n* ‚Äã*Fine:*¬†If your hair is breaking due to damage you should try to shampoo less - every other day to every three days. Giving your hair a break from washing and styling can help with mitigating¬†damage. Use shampoos and conditioners that are moisturizing, even if they give a flatter look then you like.¬†\n* *Thick:* Damage to thicker hair shows more prominently because there is more of it. Straight hair will often appear to have many flyaways, while on curlier hair damage can be easier to hide. Since your styling routine is already longer because of how much hair you have, avoiding a full wash and blow dry (i.e. heat) for as long as possible can help with mitigating damage.¬†\n\n*The type of shampoo and conditioner you use*\n\n* *Fine:* If you aren't worried about damage, look for a volumizing shampoo and conditioner for day-to-day use. Clarifying shampoos will¬†help strip extra oil from your hair, but should only be used once a week alongside a shampoo made for daily use. Avoid clarifying shampoos if your hair is damaged.¬†\n* *Thick:* Look for moisturizing and hydrating shampoos to counteract your¬†volume.¬†[Co-washes](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/news/a56230/co-washing-benefits/) are also a great option for curlier hair, and can be used more frequently since they are a combination of shampoo and conditioner. They're¬†a¬†great option if you need to wash more because of your workout schedule or job.¬†‚Äã\n\n*Your Scalp*‚Äã‚Äã\n\nYour scalp is an important part of figuring out how, and how much, to shampoo. This takes trial and error, plus may change over time. Generally, you should wash as often as your scalp can handle it because, like the rest of your skin, it is constantly shedding¬† cells.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that washing your hair has no effect on the amount of oil produced by your sebaceous glands. This depends on hormonal and genetic factors, and the glands have no way of responding to oils on the surface of your scalp. The theory that you could \"train\" your scalp to be less oily was disproven in 1982 by [Kligman and Shelley](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13525782/).\n\nIf you're trying to avoid washing more frequently, then use a mixed boars bristle brush (BBB) to manipulate the scalp and softly remove cell build up. The Reddit page¬†[No-Poo/Natural Hair](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/)¬†is a good resource for advice on maintaining your scalp when shampooing less frequently.¬†‚Äã\n\n* *Signs you may be washing too much:* a scalp that feels dry or tight\n* *Signs you may not be washing enough:* ‚Äãexcessive product/oil build up‚Äã\n\n**What is the proper way to shampoo?**¬†\n\nTo help the shampoo work, emulsify it in your hands before applying. Start applying in at the back of your head, ending at the crown. Take around a minute to apply it. Similar to washing your hands, shampoo takes a few seconds to lift the oils and dirt.\n\n* *When you're looking for volume:* Pay attention to the sides and back of your head when¬†shampooing and rinsing, as these areas are commonly missed. For thicker hair, consider washing (or rinsing) in two sections. If you've gone 3+¬†days without washing, shampooing twice also makes sense.\n* *When you're looking to smooth/leave natural oils behind:* Generally, use a minimal amount of shampoo and rinse it out fairly quickly. Try conditioning your hair first, then shampooing and conditioning again. See the \"volume\" bullet above if you feel like you need a deep clean. This is helpful but not always necessary.\n\n**Shampoo Ingredients**\n\nMany people search for shampoo via the phrase \"shampoo without chemicals\". Technically, if the shampoo has water in it this will count as a chemical, so a better approach is to search for shampoos via ingredients. I've given you a list to consider below.¬†\n\n*Shampoo Without Silicone*\n\nSoluble silicone formulas can be washed out with gentler shampoos and conditioners that don't contain surfactants, and are capable of achieving the same results as non-soluble silicones.¬†Common names on the bottle include:\n\n* *Non-solu‚Äãble:* Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Amodimethicone, Pheryl trimethicone, Ceteraryl methicone, Dimethiconol, Stearyl dimethicone, Amodimethicone (non-soluble when Trideceth-12 and Cetrimonium Chloride are absent)\n* ‚Äã*Soluble:* Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone copolyol, Lauryl methicone copolyol, any silicone with PEG as a prefix\n\n*‚ÄãShampoo Without Sulfate and SLS*\n\nAs a rule of thumb, ingredients like Ammonium lauryl sulfate and Ammonium laureth sulfate tend to be easier on sensitive scalps than Sodium lauryl sulfate. To learn more about surfactants, check out [Simplifying Hair Products II](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-simplifying-hair-products-ii.html).¬†\n\n*Shampoo Without Parabens*‚Äã\n\nMost water based shampoos contain preservatives because without them they¬† will eventually grow mold or bacteria. Parabens are a type of preservative that are commonly used in hair products. According to The FDA \"scientists continue to review published studies on the safety of parabens. At this time, we do not have information showing that parabens, as they are used in cosmetics, have an effect on human health\" (Source:¬†[FDA, Parabens in Cosmetics](https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetic-ingredients/parabens-cosmetics)).¬†They're usually easy to spot on the bottle because they end in the word \"paraben\". Common non-paraben preservatives are shown in the list below. To learn more about parabens, check out this article published by Cosmopolitan:¬†[Wait, What Actually Are Parabens and Should You Avoid Them?¬†](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a28662211/what-are-parabens/)\n\n* [*Common names on the bottle:* Midazolidinyl urea, Iodopropynyl, Isothiazolinone, and Sodium benzoate](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a28662211/what-are-parabens/)\n\n*Shampoo Without Salt*\n\n[Sodium chloride](https://nutrafol.com/blog/15-shampoo-ingredients-to-avoid/) is another name for salt. It's used in shampoo and conditioner mainly to make the consistency thicker. A trend of \"salt shampoos\" has also been seen, where the benefits include being used as a [scrub](https://www.byrdie.com/what-are-salt-shampoos) for the scalp, plus being gentler on the environment. This has may have been influenced by the idea of adding [salt or sea water ](https://www.gourmandize.com/article-6582-put-salt-in-your-shampoo-to-solve-your-worst-hair-problems.htm)to your current shampoo. I wouldn't recommend adding sea water to your shampoo, as this could potentially generate¬†bacteria and mold in your products over time.¬†\n\n**Shampoo/Ingredients For Hair Care Concerns**\n\n*Hair Loss*\n\nFor assisting with hair loss, there are DHT-blocking shampoos plus ones with¬†ingredients that help with inflammation. Saw palmetto, also known as [Serenoa](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/039463201202500435),¬†naturally lowers the conversion of testosterone into Dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT¬†is a sex hormone that contributes to human developments such as body hair, but it can also make you lose your hair faster and earlier.¬†If you're experiencing any type of hair loss, the first place to start is with a doctor. You don't want to try different shampoos only to later find out a doctor would have pointed you in a different direction.¬†\n\n*Hair Growth*\n\nShampoos with biotin are frequently marketed as being helpful for hair growth. It is also¬†commonly added to shampoos claiming to reduce hair loss, but there is no [evidence](https://www.webmd.com/connect-to-care/hair-loss/does-biotin-really-prevent-hair-loss) that it prevents this. Consuming foods rich in healthy vitamins and minerals will help with overall hair health.\n\n*Dry Scalp*\n\nSome contributing factors to a dry or itchy scalp can't be solved with a shampoo. However, certain ingredients can offer relief.\n\n* ‚Äã‚Äã*Salicylic acid:* This can be found in drug store shampoos advertising scalp health. It will help remove¬†scalp cells causing dandruff while also moisturizing dry spots. Consider using it seasonally during dry winter months, or on a regular basis as needed.¬†\n* *Selenium sulfide:*¬†Formulated to control more serious dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp. It's also used¬†to treat pityriasis versicolour, a common fungal infection that causes small patches of skin to become scaly and discoloured.\n* *Ketoconazole:*¬†An ingredient that provides the same benefits as Selenium sulfide.\n* *Tea Tree Oil:* [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1360273/) have shown that tea tree oil effectively fights many types of bacteria, viruses¬†and fungi. These shampoos tend to be very calming and cleansing.\n\n*Naturally Grey Hair Turning Yellow*¬†\n\nUse two types of shampoo: (1) a purple shampoo and (2) a moisturizing shampoo. Grey hair tends to pick up unwanted yellow tones from the environment, and purple shampoo will help combat these tones. The moisturizing shampoo helps prevent your hair from becoming too dry, which can be exacerbated by purple shampoo. Check out [Purple Shampoo](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-purple-shampoo.html) for more insight on your options for these products.¬†",

    "body": "Hair Type: Thin, 2B/C Curl Patterns, Oily scalp, prone to hairfall\n\nSome hair background:\nSo I switched to using silicone and sulphate free haircare on a whim back in 2017. To my surprise, this changed my previously mostly straight hair to pretty curly. I learnt about CGM afterwards but since that seemed like a lot of effort, I just stuck to using CG friendly products and was happy with what my hair looked like. Cut to 3 months ago, when I moved to a new place with a really humid climate and my hair fall became like 10 fold. I tried going back to products that had worked for me in the past but nothing helped. Eventually, I thought, that the increased frizziness caused by humidity was the cause of the hair fall and since no product seemed to make my hair soft and silky like before, I decided to go back to silicones. A combination that helped my hair fall to some extent was Bblunt Intense Moisture Shampoo (the blue one) and Loreal Professional Serie Quinoa Protein Hair Mask (used this as conditioner after every wash). But this combination also did make my hair straighter than it had been in recent years. Decided to give the BBlunt Curly Hair range a try (the pink color one). This range does contain Silicones, so it is not strictly CG friendly but it has worked for me. I do not use any leave-in products to style my hair, but I don't mind some frizz. The curls I get from just these 3 products are pretty impressive, as good as any other CG friendly shampoo/conditioners I have used in the past. And my hair fall though still not as less as it was 6 months ago, is definitely better. Details below.\n\n1) Bblunt Curly Hair Prepoo (Pink and white tub packaging)\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Aloe Vera Extract, Cocos (Coconut)Water, Aayla mido propyltrimonium Chloride/Acrylamide Copolymer, Citric Acid, PEG-90M, Parfum (Perfume)\n\nThoughts: Definitely my favourite of the 3. I have been looking for a  pre-shampoo product to add to my routine. Oiling and Aloeing have not worked for me. I have previously used some hair masks that said they can be used before shower but they were thick and creamy and impossible to spread properly on semi-wet or dry hair. THIS product is everything I wanted. It is a gel-like consistency, spreads super easily. I usually brush out my hair before showering and this is when I lose the most hair. Since this product claims at helping in detangling I decided to use this before I brush my hair and the hair I lost was significantly less! During and post-shower, my hair maintains great slip!  This has the potential to be HG for me. It has a pleasant coconutty smell, but the fragrances in these products do not last too long, which is nice (The loreal mask makes my hair smell like a salon even 2 days later).\n\nRepurchase Status: WRP Definitely!\n\n2) Bblunt Curly Hair Shampoo (Pink Tube)\n\nIngredients: Aqua (Water), Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Cocamidopropyl Retain, Decyl Glucoside, Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Glycol Distearate, Glycerin, Acrylates Copolymer, Cocamide MEA, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipropylene Glycol, PEG-150 Distearate, Polysilicone-29, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-7, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Magnesium Nitrate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Menthol, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Acetamide MEA, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panthenol, Sorbitol, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acid, Cocoyl Sarcosine,TriticumVulgare (Wheat) Germ Acid, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Polysorbate-20, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Polysorbate-80, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Parfum (Perfume).\n\nThoughts: It is a shampoo that does its job. It cleans my oily scalp well without stripping it too much. It does not lather and spread as well as the blue BBlunt shampoo but that is to be expected as this one does not have SLS. One thing I have to mention is that near my roots this is the only product from the 3 that I used, and I noticed that the hair in that area did have some curls (usually hair close to my roots does not curl up), so this shampoo is definitely doing something right. Smells pretty fresh (like a cactus? or something softer than that lol) cant describe it. But again the smell does not linger post-shower.\n\nRepurchase Status: Maybe (I have a bunch of other shampoos lying around that I have to finish up first post-monsoon. If using any of those increases my hair fall again, will return to this)\n\n3) Bblunt Curly Hair Conditioner (Pink Tube)\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Amodimethicone, Behentrimonium, Methosulfate, Isopropyl Myristate, Dimethicone, Almond Oil, Polyquaternium-10, Silicone Quaternium, Polyquaternium-7, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Acetamide MEA, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Sorbitol, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acid, Cococoyl Satosire, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Acid, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Polysorbate-20, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Panthenol, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Magnesium Nitrate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, MAgnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Trideceth-12, Laureth-23, Laureth-4, Polyglyceryl-3 Caprate, Dipropylene Glycol, Perfume\n\nThoughts: When I first used it I felt like it was super light and would not do much conditioning, but to my surprise when I rinsed it out, my hair had great slip, and detangled very easily. Some of that I will say must be because of the prepoo, but this conditioner also must be contributing. I guess since I was using the super thick loreal mask as conditioner previously, that's why this conditioner feels very light to me, but if it's doing its job, then it's ok of course. This smells like something sweet... white chocolate or marzipan. Overall I like it, and in combination with the prepoo, my hair is a lot softer than the loreal mask. \n\nRepurchase Status: Probably (again have a bunch of conditioners, i wish to use up first)\n\nI am a bit confused that even with silicones, how do these products work so well in giving me curls. Maybe I just don't know enough about how silicones work. But if with continued use I feel like silicone buildup is weighing my hair down, I can use my Fix My Curls Cleansing Shampoo once in a while, I guess.",

Silicones are nothing but emollients just like natural oils that cg community likes to sing praises about... Except silicones are better than natural oils at their job of calming down the frizz and are lighter. And about weighing down, would your hair feel weighed down if you continuously apply oil without washing it off? Yes, yes you will. And what are oils again? Emollients same as a silicones. You see the similarity and the comparison. It took me a while to get out of the influencer-fed info that SILICONES WILL ABSOLUTELY DESTROY CURLY HAIR... Because I use sulphate free shampoo (wow shampoo at that) and silicone conditioner and feel no difference.\n\nSome people cannot tolerate silicones because that's how their *individual* hair is... Just like some people can't tolerate hyaluronic acid or a niacinamide serum. But this fear of silicones and this blanket statement that silicones are bad for curly hair comes from lack of education and knowledge about them. And if you have any doubt, feel free to ask.",

Earlier, I was browsing the HG list on the side bar, and I saw that somebody had annotated the Garnier Fructis Damage Eraser Conditioner as Not CG - Contains Amodimethicone.\n\nThis confused me and I'm pretty careful about not putting silicones in my hair, and I am obsessed with that conditioner. So I look at my current bottle (purchased maybe 2-3 weeks ago) and just like I thought, it doesn't list any silicones in the ingredients list. I then headed to google, and several sites listed conflicting ingredients lists, but the Garnier Fructis website did in face have amodimethicone as the third ingredient (which my bottle doesn't contain and can post a pic of the ingredients if anyone is interested). \n\nI finally just called the company. The woman I spoke to said that, on her part, she hadn't been notified of any formulation change in that conditioner, so it was the same as always. I then told her about my current  bottle and the website, and she said whatever is on the website is the correct, current formulation.\n\nSo to all my fellow CGs out there who like or just use this product - THE FORMULA IS NO LONGER SILICONE FREE. The new bottle doesn't list any kind of formulation change, but the new conditioner does contain amodimethicone.\n\nThis has been a Curly Girl Public Service Announcement XD",

It is high porosity and takes hours to dry, even when chin lenght as it is now. The texture is very mixed, with some slightly wavy strands all the way up to kinky curly ones. I'd say most of it falls in category 2B.\n\n\nI have been wearing my hair curly and was getting fantastic results with a product by Rene Furterer, the Veloute Perfecteur de Boucles. It was a light, non greasy cream and I could use a fair amount of it without any adverse effects. Something in it really helps with curl formation, and all I had to do was put it into still rather wet hair, and let it dry. Perfect, consistent results every time. The hair was curly, light, perfectly hydrated.\n\n\nHere is the ingredient list:\n\n\n*Water, ethyhexyl palmitate, cetearyl alcohol, acanthus mollis leaf extract, amodimethicone, BHT, butylparaben, cetearyl glucoside, cetrimonium chloride, disodium EDTA, ethylparaben, fragrance (parfum), inulin lauryl carbamate, isobutylparaben, maltodextrin, methylparaben, persea gratissima (avocado) oil (persea gratissima oil), phenoxyethanol, polyquaternium-37, polyquaternium-68, propylparaben, trideceth-12.*\n\n\nA few months ago, they changed the line. Now the cream feels sticky and heavy, and although it still does promote curl formation (could be the acanthe extract, that is what the brand claims in their marketing), it makes my hair greasy and stringy and really just not nice. So, cue in another product hunt. Lots of money already into it, I'm not getting there... I now need a leave in, a defining curl cream and a gel to get lesser results, and I have to be so careful not to touch my hair under penalty of turning into a frizz ball.\n\n\nHere are the ingredients of the new, totally not improved product:\n\n\n*Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behenamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Acanthus Mollis Leaf Extract, Alpha Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, BHT, Butylphenyl, Methylpropional, Ceteareth-33, Citronellol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance (Parfum), Glycerin, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Hexyl Cinnamal, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Lactic Acid, Limonene, Linalool, Maltodextrin, Oenothera Biennis, (Evening Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Phenoxyethanol, Polyquaternium-68, Salicylic Acid, Sorbic Acid, Tocopherol, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Dissucinate.*\n\n\n**Is there anyone who is knowledgeable enough to take a look at the differences between old and new and maybe shed some light on how I can find another perfect product?

Since curly hair is perpetually moisture-starved, I got this leave-in a few weeks after it came out.\n\n**Ingredients:** \n\nWater, Cetearyl Alcohol, Amodimethicone, Cetyl Esters, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trideceth-6, Chlorhexidine Digluconate, Limonene, Isopropyl Alcohol, Citric Acid, Cetrimonium Chloride, Coumarin, Parfum/‚ÄãFragrance\n\n**Initial Uses:**\n\nFor the first 3 times I used this, I did as they recommended, i.e. applied it on clean, dry hair at night. It feels a little sticky to touch after application, but that goes away by the morning. After the first use, I did not rinse it off the next morning. It hydrated my hair *very,* my hair was extremely soft. However the amodimethicone in it made my hair kind off frizzy and difficult to manage. For the next 2 washes, I decided to rinse it off in the morning without any shampoo. That ended up working better for me.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. Intensely hydrates.\n2. Has some slip, you could potentially use it as a styling product if you have fine or wavy hair that doesn't like heavy products.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. It has fragrance. Heavy fragrance. *Almost-gave-me-a-headache* fragrance. C*ould-probably-be-used-as-a-perfume-if-you-tried-hard-enough* fragrance.\n\n**How I use it now:**\n\n1. I apply it on wash days as pre-poo. I leave it on for an hour and then wash off.\n2. Also I accidentally spilled some on my forearm once, and turns out it works fine as a lotion lol. So now sometimes I just put some on my arms if they're feeling extra dry. Probably a waste of product to use it like this, but it feels better than just leaving it on the shelf.\n\nAll in all, if you are okay with silicones and fragrance, I would recommend this. However I WNRP myself.",

I did some research online and learned that not all silicones are created equal. \n\nSilicones are usually used on hair products for the \"slippery\" feeling. Cyclomethicone evaporates and won't leave a buildup. Dimethicone copolyol are water soluble and provides little buildup. Amodimethicone and Dimethicone stick better and are harder to wash off. \n\nI'm usually ok if Dimethicone is farther down the ingredient list. But it definitely breaks me out when it's in the first few ingredients. I haven't tried any products with cyclomethicone though. I will probably experiment and see if Cyclomethicone and Dimethicone copolyol are better than amodimethicone and Dimethicone on my skin. \n\nDo you break out from Dimethicone? What products have you tried with silicones that broke you out? What products have you tried with silicone that didn't break you out?\n\nFor me, I broke out from the Missha Sun milk (pink bottle) where Dimethicone was the first ingredient.

Damage also leaves the hydrophilic proteins of the hair more exposed.

All of these purchases have been made on a college/internship budget (that I am still on). I have been working on my curly hair for a year and half, and the products have been accumulated across that period.\n\n**Matrix Biolage Ultra-Hydrasource Mask**\n\nThis is one of my HGs. It is very moisturising. Pretty helpful when my hair feels extremely dry. I used to use it like a conditioner every wash when I was beginning my curly hair journey, but now I use it a few times a month at the most. **10/10**\n\n**Arata Leave-In Conditioner**\n\nVery moisture forward leave-in. Nothing special about it, but what it‚Äôs worth, it works. **7/10**\n\n**Nykaa Rice Water Shampoo**\n\nReceived this one as a freebie along with an order. It‚Äôs just a basic shampoo, nothing more. It is sulphate-free though, so CG-approved. Currently I use this as my regular shampoo, and the Matrix one for clarifying. **5/10**\n\n**Loreal Hyaluron Moisture Night Cream**\n\nIt is hydrating but it contains Amodimethicone. I personally stay away from all silicone types as they make my hair get frizzy and dry. This made my hair soft but it was poofing all over the place. If silicones work for you, this might be useful. But it‚Äôs not for me. **0/10**\n\n**Plum Olive and Macadamia Conditioner**\n\nThis is THE BEST conditioner I have used so far! HG for sure! The definition I get after using this is just \\*chef‚Äôs kiss\\*! It is very moisturising but also contains some protein. **100/10**\n\n**Fix My Curls Flaxseed Gelly**\n\nVery basic flaxseed gelly. Moisture-forward, no proteins. You can also substitute it for home-made ones and it‚Äôd work the same. Soft hold that lasts for 1-2 days. **8/10**\n\n**Fix My Curls Hair Butter**\n\nKind of a protein-free, ultra moisturising leave-in cream. It tends to get greasy if I use a large enough amount. Can also be a bit heavy for fine hair. It does make a difference when your hair is getting dry. **7.5/10**\n\n**Fix My Curls Defining Hair Gel**\n\nMy favourite hair gel so far! Has trace amounts of protein. Thick in consistency and has a strong hold. With this, my curls have lasted 3-4 days without needing a refresh. **10/10**\n\n**Fix My Curls Leave-In Cream**\n\nProtein-forward leave-in cream. It isn‚Äôt bad but I prefer the Arata leave-in or hair cream more. **4/10**\n\n**Matrix Smoothproof 6-in-1 Serum**\n\nVery silicone-heavy. I only use a few drops to SOTC, so this bottle is probably going to last me my entire lifetime. **5/10**\n\n**Matrix Biolage Hydrasource Shampoo**\n\nI only use this for clarifying since it contains sulphates. It is definitely good. However you need to pair it with a moisturising conditioner or mask. **9/10**\n\n**Matrix Biolage Hydrasource Conditioner**\n\nI bought this conditioner as it was very highly recommended by multiple people for being moisturising and CG-friendly. Turns out they have reformulated with Amodimethicone. Doesn‚Äôt work for me and makes my hair poof up when dried. (If anyone has any ideas how to use this up without putting it in my hair, please do share). **0/10**\n\n**Arata Advance Curl Care Hair Oil**\n\nIt is a blend of multiple oils. Makes my hair wonderfully soft. I use it mostly as a pre-poo, and sometimes to SOTC. **9/10**\n\n**Arata Hair Cream**\n\nProtein-free styling cream. It is not from their Curl Care range, but it works wonderfully for styling my curls. 100% would buy again. **10/10**\n\n**Arata Hair Gel**\n\nProtein-free styling gel. This is also not from their Curl Care range. Soft hold, curls last for 2-3 days at the most.

That is, take one small study that is directly funded by a company trying to sell you their product and generalize to all of humanity. Then call it \"scientific.\"\n\nMultiple times I come here and see posts that go something like \"I can't believe people do \\[x\\], it's so unscientific and RUINED my hair.\"\n\nUsually by some European-descent person who tried an extremist version of something that was called \"curly girl method\" or \"no poo\" that they found on a random person's youtube channel in 2015 or something.\n\nThen there will be a comment that basically implies all hair is actually the same (which is patently untrue under a microscope).\n\nThen there will be as study linked that's funded by L'Oreal and shows that for 40 European-descent women living in the Los Angeles metropolitan area in 2012 a specific type of sulfate and amodimethicone worked great, so therefore every type of sulfate and silicone MUST work for everyone and anyone for whom it doesn't work for is lying/anti-science.\n\nThis is not science.\n\nSo many \"studies\" are one-off conference papers that have no peer review and no replicable results that will never be validated at a larger scale (see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1hg1h2e/what_happened_to_the_study_showing_that_hair/) for an example, or this study done on a [single bundle of Mongolian hair](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8991896/)). Still more are funded by haircare or pharmaceutical companies with agendas reminiscent of how the [sugar industry funded studies blaming heart disease on fat, not sugar, despite a clear correlation](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5099084/) between the two harming millions and creating a discourse around diabetes that literally cost lives. Women, along with non-European-descent people, meanwhile spent years suffering because almost all medicinal and surgical [studies](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10264921/) were done on European-descent men. In the beauty industry, very few studies are done that have enough trials to be statistically significant to the general population.\n\nI am not saying that all information is equally valid and true -- or that natural/clean/whatever bs buzzword is trending is inherently better and we should fearmonger the \"evil chemicals,\" what I am saying is the SCIENTIFIC thing to do is critically examine sources and content. Don't fearmonger, but also don't ignore what is personally not working for you.\n\nWe are all unique. No dermatologist would ever dare to say one skin-routine fits all or one ingredient will be always be safe for everyone. People have allergies, genetic conditions, illnesses, environmental factors, etc. Similarly, there is no hair product that will work for everyone. If curly girl method doesn't work for you -- stop. If silicones and sulfates don't work for you -- also stop. If you can hygienically go 3 days without washing your hair, go for it. If you can't, it's no problem either! If your expensive products genuinely work better than drugstore for your hair type, I feel for your wallet but that's fine. If drugstore products work just fine for you, congrats and I am so envious. If you have bleach damage, your hair will respond differently to products than someone with virgin hair. Be a real scientist and experiment with what works best for you. Don't be fear-mongered into avoiding certain chemicals, but also don't be \"science-mongered\" into using those products if it makes your hair look like shit.",

Most of what I‚Äôve learned about caring for hair in a h*rd water environment, I learned from reading peer-reviewed hair science and cosmetology textbooks. So, the lit is out there, and much of it does address the use of sulfates and silicones. I‚Äôve noticed that development of cleansing products and surfactants that cleanse without drying seems to be an ongoing challenge and big concern in this field‚Äîas it is in skincare. \n\nI don‚Äôt think there should be limits to anecdotal and experiential knowledge statements. In real life, epistemology is informed by anecdotal and experiential knowledge. But the design and rhetoric of scientific literature has been crafted to obscure all signs of subjectivity. I think people can contribute this kind of knowledge to a discussion and readers can decide for themselves if it has value. But I think experiential knowledge is key to identifying the various factors that help one decide whether to use sulfates. Individuals are, in other words, a source of knowledge precisely because they bring different experiences to the table. \n\nI would also suggest that scientific literature be used not only to guide discussions but also to challenge certain assumptions. And the peer-reviewed literature is not protected in any way from such challenges. A good deal that has been written about so-called African or ‚Äúkinky‚Äù hair needs to be challenged. So we shouldn‚Äôt treat peer-reviewed lit as the last world. It is never the last word.\n\nBut we could begin the discussion by reorienting ourselves and opening our minds to other possibilities. We can hold multiples things to be true at once: sulfates are helpful and beneficial; sulfates are drying and potentially damaging. There‚Äôs no need to take up an extreme position because in reality all of these things are true.(I realize that there are different kinds of sulfates, some less drying than others; I was just generalizing to make a quick point.)",

    "body": "Hi guys! \n\nI've been no-pooing for about 5 years at this point but have decided to go back to shampoo and conditioner.\n\nIn the past year I have learned a lot about how to care for my skin, choosing an /r/asianbeauty skincare routine. I accidentally get products containing silicone in my hair on a daily basis and have no way of removing them. I am also concerned about the potential effects of getting my sunscreen stuck in my hair next to my skin.\n\nI no longer think that dimethicone is a bad or dispensable ingredient. I understand the difference between sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate and sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate, as well as the difference between cyclomethicone, cyclopentasiloxane, dimethicone and amodimethicone. I just bought a shampoo containing the mild surfactant sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate and a conditioner containing dimethicone after spending an hour reading the back of haircare products at the shops. Crazy, man! This is a huge deal and I'm totally jittery.\n\nI think that no-poo can work well for some people, mainly those with short or curly hair. I have long, semi-straight hair, and no matter how much I used my BBB I could not get my hair smooth. I had frizzy, split ends just a short time after getting my hair cut. I kinda succeeded for a long time while telling myself that this was what healthy hair looked like, then I reassessed my needs and here I am. I got all of the damaged hair cut off today and I'm ready to try this shit out.\n\nGood luck everyone!",

        "body": "Hey, do what works for you! No poo works literal wonders for some people, some people never find the perfect method that works for them. Even so, everyone can learn and benefit from at least some of the techniques and knowledge of no poo, that they can take with them even if they don't stick to no poo. Using a low-poo is still waaaaaaay better than an SLS shampoo.\n\nIf the BBB you tried doesn't work for your hair type (I'm wondering if it has a lot of plastic bristles mixed in, because often they do, and those damage hair), I highly HIGHLY recommend getting a wooden bristled brush-- whether you are no poo or not. The bristles are spread far apart, still flexible if you get one of the squishy brushes, and the wood does distribute natural hair oils a bit, which is still beneficial even if (or especially if) you use a low-poo or shampoo cleanser. It can give some life back to your ends between washes without looking greasy or damaging your hair. You can get them at whole foods or health foods stores or online. Best of luck to you!",

I have naturally curly hair but I hate how it looks. (like Brent Spiner in Independence day!!)  Totally frizzy no matter how much I brush or whatever.  So I straighten my hair with that same BBB and a hair drier.  Looks pretty amazing with a good cut.  Healthy hair isnt going to make your hair smooth if its not.  I use a shampoo bar a couple times a week max and I dont have to use a conditioner or any other products.  (I think using styling products makes it more necessary to wash more often but everyone is different) That said if OTC shampoos works for you then right on.  :-)",

After a while I noticed that my hair got even thinner and my scalp was showing (not sure if it's stress or what). I've discovered that we have hard water at home and the build up was crazy on my head. So last month, I said srew it and went back to an slas shampoo (Johnson's baby shampoo). I do an oil treatment for 2 hours before washing it so the shampoo won't dry out my hair. I no longer use conditioners, I just use a tiny bit of olive oil and that's it.",

I'm new here, and I'm on a mission to have hair that isn't gross and oily by the end of the day.\n\nI have very fine, straight, oily, non-colored hair that goes to just below my shoulders in length. It's a dark blonde, and when it gets oily, it looks gross and wet. Disgusting, really. I have always been a slave to daily washing, and used crappy products. I have lived with the philosophy that conditioner should never go above the ears, and will make your hair oilier if you put in on your scalp. \n\nRecently, a friend recommended Davines NouNou shampoo and conditioner, and swore that it allowed her to go 48-72 hours between washes without getting oily. I have been trying to do this, and using dry shampoo on days that I don't wash. However, it's been a month now, and I am still heavily dependent on the dry shampoo on my no-wash days, and I don't like the way it makes my hair feel. Looking at the ingredients, it contains Sodium Laureth Sulfate, which I'm given to understand is better than Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, but still bad. It also has amodimethicone which I'm guessing is a silicone. \n\nAnyway, I'm rambling now. Apologies for the wall of text. After discovering this subreddit, I am seeking your advice. How can I get to the point where I don't need to wash my hair every day? Are there any products you can recommend that are available at Target? That's easier for me, cause I have a weird housing/mailing situation, but I can also get things from Amazon if necessary. Does conditioner belong on my roots? Thanks in advance!!",

        "body": "I also have fine, straight hair with an oily scalp. Because of daily washing and shampooing with harsh sufactants, my scalp was dry but overly oily. My hairs would get greasy by the end of the day, and you can see the hairs clumping together from the grease. After slowly transitioning to a CO-washing method and clipping my shorter hairs back, I am able to go days without shampooing; I now shampoo about once a week. The decrease in oil production was probably because my scalp was irritated from the constant shampooing, and along with that, I was also shampooing every day. This constant irritation was stripping my scalp of moisture and sebum, which probably led to a higher sebum production to compensate for the lack of moisture and my scalp trying to retain what little moisture it had.\n\nGood thing you took a look at the ingredients in your hair products, because those aren't really suitable for CO-washing. You might still want to keep the shampoo to use a clarifying shampoo. \n\nYou can check the [Product Recommendations](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/wiki/product_reviews) page to see if you can pick up any of those products. Otherwise, check out the [CO-washing guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1m0g7c/conditioner_only_method_cowashing/) to see what ingredients to avoid or to look for.",

Sometimes the products which promise moisture can deliver, but most of the time it's just buzz words.\n\nI'd suggest posting on the curly hair subreddit as I know curly hair tends to be different than straight hair.\n\nHowever, some rules still apply imo: you're gonna have to do your own testing with trial and error to find out what your hair likes and what it doesn't (silicons, what hair oils, sulfates etc) .Everyone's hair is different so what works for me may not work for you.\n\nThe only thing I am going to recommend if your hair ends up liking protein is the Joico Moisture Recovery Conditioner - I use it as a deep conditioner every 3-4 weeks, it has protein in it and shouldn't be abused since protein overload makes hair frizzy,dry and very prone to breakage (as I found out myself in the past).\n\nYou can also try to make your own hydrating/misting spray by mixing water and glycerin (glycerin is a humectant, meaning it attracts water and moisture in your hair, which is especially neat if you live in a humid environment) . Google glycerin water mix for hair and you should get loads of results.\n\n\nIf you still have questions feel free to pm me!

I don‚Äôt know but I will scream at someone if I don‚Äôt type this out. \n\nHair type: between 2C and 3A\nWeather: Dry (Pune weather)\n\nI used to be a body shop banana or Shea range user for the longest time. I mean, like, for years. Then my greed for change got the best of me and I decided to look for other options just for the sake of my hair smelling something other than the same Shea and banana scents that had become super monotonous for me. \n\nI stumbled upon the Wella nutricurls range. They advertise their products to be made for curly hair. I was impressed. Ordered myself the shampoo, conditioner and the mask. The products arrived. Loved the smell. Okay fine.\n\n2 months into using this stuff, my hair had now transformed to a brittle haystack. Literally had straw like unmanageable hair right from hour 1 of drying. The worst part is, the transformation to this horrible hair was so gradual that I didn‚Äôt even notice it completely till my hair was actually at its worst and falling out in clumps. \n\nI finally had it and shifted to my good old body shop again and from the first wash itself my hair is starting to get so much better!\n\nOut of curiosity, I decided to look up the ingredients in each of the nutricurls products. Turns out, ALL of them had problematic ingredients for curly hair.\n\nFirst of all, the Wella Nutricurls shampoo. Claims to be Sulphate free, but contains a controversial ingredient called sodium lauroyl sarcosinate. Fine it is still considered to be a harmless ingredient by some so I‚Äôll give them the benefit of the doubt. \n\nThe Wella Nutricurls mask: Contains isopropyl alcohol high up the ingredient list which apparently dries the hair out real bad. Even the body shop Shea Mask (not conditioner) does contain it, but it is wayyy down the ingredient list so I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs way less concentrated in the Body Shop Shea Mask. \n\nNow, the worst of them all, The Wella Nutricurls conditioner. It has amodimethicone, a silicon, sitting high up on the list. It also has isopropyl alcohol even higher up on the list that it is in their mask. The conditioner was something that I used every wash, even more than the mask. Maybe this is what actually ruined my hair. \n\nI hope I get my curls back soon. As of now, I will be kissing bye bye to the Nutricurls range. WNP",

    "body": "Hey y'all. New guy here. A couple of days ago I read the intro to CG and went straight ahead to a store to find the right products to start using the CG method. Turns out, I had no clear idea of what to go for, since many ingredient's names had no sense for me. Were they alchohol? Silicones? Maybe both of them? Since there's no signal inside the stores, I couldn't even use the ingredients bot.\n\nI got out and checked reddit back and found the holy list of products... except there's an extreme lack of content in the italian list. Having no idea about what to buy, I went back home and started reading more on the wiki. After reading a good amount of articles, I wrote a guide for myself, so I can understand if a product should be the one I need or not. Might as well share it here.\n\nBeing the guide to myself, it's made in my native language (italian). I could make a translation, but you'd notice that it's no more than the content of a couple of wiki pages summarized, so I think it would still be a good idea to go read those, since they're surely better written than mine. Aside from that, in this guide there's the full content of the intro, with all the explanations of all the techinques added (SOTC, Plopping etc.), a list of all the main ingredients you should find on a product, understanding what is nice to have and what should be avoided (among alchohols, silicones and humettants), some dedication about porosity and how to care for your curles during sleep and when you don't wash them. This should hopefully help any italian who gets here to fill the holy list of italian products easily. There you go:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrima di cominciare, leggerai diverse volte il termine \"sgranocchiare\". Si intende tamponare gentilmente i capelli partendo dalle punte, alzando le ciocche fino alla cute, quindi strizzare.\n\nRoutine per lavare i capelli \\[le tecniche in parentesi quadra sono opzionali\\]:\n\n\\- **Reset shampoo** (solo una volta. Solfati, no siliconi) \\[se possibile V05 clarifying, ma va' bene  anche uno della linea Ultra dolce (es. quello alle 5 erbe) o Fructis (es. il Cucumber Fresh) della Garnier. (da riusare non pi√π di una volta al mese)\n\n\\- **Balsamo** (no solfati, no siliconi). Non aver paura di abbondare. Pettina i capelli con il balsamo ancora in testa.\n\n\\- **Sciacqua** via il balsamo, continuando a massaggiare. Puoi valutare di lasciare un po' di balsamo in testa\n\n\\[S2C\\]: dopo il balsamo, aggiungi porzioni d'acqua come se fossero un prodotto. Strizza l'acqua nei capelli per sciacquare poi via il balsamo.\n\n\\- Prendi molto **gel** (no solfati, no siliconi, no alcol) e usalo sui capelli ancora bagnati\n\n\\- **Asciuga** \"sgranocchiando\" con una maglietta in cotone o asciugamano in microfibra. Asciuga col diffusore da lontano, temperatura media.\n\nPer aumentare il volume, puoi mettere dei fermagli sulle radici dei capelli.\n\n\\[Plopping\\]: appoggia una maglietta in cotone su un mobile. Appoggia la fronte sulla maglietta. Lega la maglietta attorno alla testa e solleva nuovamente la testa.\n\nDopo 10 minuti, leva la maglietta e usala per asciugare \"sgranocchiando\" i capelli.\n\n\\- **A capelli asciutti**. \"sgranocchia via\" la \"croccantezza\" causata dal gel, con le mani\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[SOTC\\]: se i capelli risultano crespi, puoi aggiungere un olio, massaggiando dalla punta verso la radice, quando i capelli sono perfettamente asciutti.\n\n\\[Super Soaker\\]: usa tutti i prodotti insieme. Sciacqua usando poca acqua alla volta.\n\n\\[Finger coiling\\]: definisci i ricci applicando il prodotto riccio per riccio. Avvolgilo intorno alle dita e ripeti con il riccio successivo.\n\n\\[LOC\\]: utile sui ricci annodati. Prevede l'utilizzo di balsamo, olio e crema, nell'ordine che ho scritto\n\n\\[Rake & Shake\\]:  dividi i capelli in ciocche e applica i prodotti sulle lunghezze pettinando i capelli con le dita. Una volta alle punte, afferra la  ciocca e agitala per \"riattivare\" i ricci.\n\n\\[Shingling\\]: dividi la testa in 5-6 sezioni e focalizzati su una alla volta, applicando il prodotto aiutandoti col pettine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Alcol:**\n\nAlcuni alcol sono totalmente da evitare (Ethanol alcohol, Ethyl alcohol, Propanol alcohol, Alcohol denat., Isopropyl alcohol, Isopropanol alcohol, Benzyl alcohol)\n\nAltri sono permessi, in quanto non causano danni. Anzi, possono addirittura portare benefici (Cetyl alcohol, Cetearyl alcohol, Stearyl alcohol, Lauryl alcohol)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Siliconi:**\n\nSon divisi in categorie. Alcuni di questi possono essere presenti senza problemi, altri meno perch√® possono accumularsi. Oltre ad accumularsi, comunque, portano benefici vari.\n\n1. Evaporativi. Evaporano nel giro di due ore al massimo, quindi non si accumulano.\n\n\\- Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane, Hexamethyldisiloxane, Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, cyclomethicone (quest‚Äôultimo e altri ciclo-XXX-silosani non sono solubili in acqua, ma evaporano comunque rapidamente, quindi non sono un problema)\n\n2) Facili da lavare. Non evaporano e possono essere presenti nel balsamo. Alcuni di questi, per√≤, possono essere resistenti all'acqua (specie se calda) e potrebbero richiedere uno shampoo coi solfati perch√® vengano rimossi.\n\n\\- Methicone e Dimethicone e Dimethicone copolyol (buoni se non hanno ingredienti cationici),silica, silequioxanes, siloxysilicates (es. diisostearoyl trimethylolpropane siloxysilicate) (questi sono pesanti),diphenyl dimethicone, dimethiconol, disiloxane, Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane, Lauryl methicone copolyol, Phenyltrimethicone, Trisiloxane\n\n3) Difficili da lavare, ma non si accumulano. Si accumula solo in un primo strato. Gli strati successivi eliminano i precedenti, quindi l‚Äôaccumulo non √® troppo. √à comunque meglio evitarli, se possibile.\n\nDimethicone crosspolymer, Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer, Aminopropyltriethoxysilane, Aminopropyl Dimethicone (senza surfatante cationico), Amodimethicone (senza surfatante cationico), Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone, Dimethicone, Dimethicone PEG/PPG, o -dimethylsiloxane, in presenza di un altro catione polimerico come bromuri, cloruri o polyquaterni.\n\n4) Difficili da lavare, si accumulano. Da evitare totalmente. Per essere rimossi si richiede l‚Äôuso ripetuto di shampoo con solfati.\n\nBehenoxy dimethicone, Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone, Cetyl dimethicone, Cetearyl methicone, Dimethiconol hydroxystearate, Polysilicone-18 Cetyl Phosphate, Propyl Dimethicone, Stearoxy dimethicone, Stearyl dimethicone, Stearyl methicone Trimethylsiylamodimethicone\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Umettanti:**\n\nDa evitare in zone calde e umide, in quanto tendono ad assorbire troppo e rendere i capelli troppo secchi.\n\nGlycerin, Propylene Glycol, Honey, Agave nectar, Sorbitol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed silk protein, Fructose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Come trattare i ricci nei giorni in cui non li lavi:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dormi con i capelli avvolti** in una sciarpa in seta, oppure legali in modo da formare una coda partendo dalla cima della testa (metodo ananas)\n\nSe hai i capelli molto lunghi, puoi fare trecce.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ogni giorno** puoi trattare i tuoi capelli in pi√π possibili modi, a seconda dell'umidit√† dell'ambiente in cui vivi e la porosit√† dei ricci:\n\n0) Bagna completamente i capelli, aggiungi un po' di balsamo (eventualmente S2C) e gel. Praticamente lavali di nuovo.\n\n1. Usa uno spray per spruzzare il balsamo (o anche solo acqua) per inumidire, poi \"sgranocchia\" un po' i ricci.\n2. Bagnati le mani con gel diluito, oppure balsamo diluito, oppure anche solo acqua, e \"sgranocchia\"\n3. Valido se hai tempo per asciugarti bene e se hai capelli corti; prendi l'acqua con le mani e \"sgranocchia\" le punte, eventualmente aggiungendo un po' di gel, poi asciuga (eventualmente plopping)\n4. Cerca una sezione particolarmente crespa, bagna le mani, aggiungi una goccia di gel e applicalo sulla sezione (eventualmente finger coiling). \"Sgranocchia\" tutti i ricci un po' in generale.\n5. Agita i ricci e \"sgranocchia\" mentre sei a testa in gi√π. Puoi anche incasinare i capelli un po' ma evita di far passare le dita lungo i ricci o rischi di fare un disastro.\n\nIn particolare, quando fai attivit√† sportiva, √® una buona idea usare un po' di balsamo, ed eventualmente sostituire il gel con creme per ricci.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Porosit√†:**\n\nI capelli possono in genere avere bassa, media o alta porosit√†.\n\nQuesti due link sono i modi migliori per identificare la porosit√† dei capelli: [https://www.curlsbot.com/porosity/](https://www.curlsbot.com/porosity/)\n\nOppure  [http://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2012/06/hair-porosity-how-to-measure-sort-of.html](http://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2012/06/hair-porosity-how-to-measure-sort-of.html)\n\nBassa porosit√†:\n\nI capelli impiegano pi√π di 2 secondi a bagnarsi, anche sotto il getto diretto dell'acqua\n\nL'acqua rimane sopra i capelli invece che bagnarli\n\nI prodotti non vengono ben assorbiti, perci√≤ si accumulano di pi√π in mezzo ai capelli\n\nI capelli impiegano molto a seccarsi\n\nI capelli sono pi√π resistenti a trattamenti chimici (come il colore)\n\n\\- Lavali sempre con acqua calda\n\n\\- Usa gli heating cap\n\n\\- Metti i capelli in una cuffietta per la doccia in plastica e usa un asciugamano riscaldato\n\n\\- Usa prodotti pi√π leggeri, specialmente se usi gli oli, in quanto tenderanno ad appesantire molto i capelli. (Oli leggeri: jojoba, argan/argania, grapeseed/semi d'uva, sunflower/girasole, sweet almond/mandorle dolci). Eventualmente non usare affatto gli oli.\n\n\\- Usa con una certa regolarit√† un prodotto che elimini gli accumuli sui capelli. Il prodotto dev'essere un po' aggressivo ma non quanto un comunque shampoo.\n\nAlta porosit√†:\n\nSi bagnano immediatamente anche con poca acqua\n\nI capelli assorbono rapidamente qualunque cosa\n\nI capelli si asciugano velocemente dopo essere stati lavati\n\nAccettano facilmente prodotti chimici (come il colore), ma possono espellerlo altrettanto facilmente.\n\nPossono sembrare pesanti e secchi\n\nSi annodano facilmente\n\nTendono a essere crespi\n\n\\- Usa oli pesanti (castor/ricino, olive, coconut/cocco, flax/lino, hemp/canapa, jamaican black castor/ricino nero giamaicano) e oli che chiudono le cuticole.\n\n\\- Usa settimanalmente una maschera per capelli\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Altre generalit√†:**\n\nGli ingredienti principali di cui tenere conto sono: solfati, siliconi, polyquats, umettanti cocco. proteine, (in genere i capelli tendono ad accettare o rifiutare gli ultimi due tipi di ingredienti). Evita il calore diretto e i prodotti Pantene.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConsigli da u/GIUlianab\n\nSe vuoi provare a seguire il CG per adesso prova a guardare tra i prodotti Omia e de I Provenzali, dovrebbero avere almeno balsami e maschere senza  siliconi (le maschere della Omia sono buone) e shampoo senza solfati e siliconi. Io personalmente sconsiglio il co-washing, specialmente se  vivi in un luogo con acqua molto dura. Usare uno shampoo delicato (senza solfati o con questi in basso nella lista degli ingredienti, in quanto dovrebbe indicarne una bassa quantit√†) √® sempre meglio secondo me.\n\nLa Biopoint di recente ha lanciato una linea senza siliconi, solfati e  parabeni, se la trovi ed √® nel tuo budget puoi provarla, la Garnier ha lanciato le maschere hair food (solo non lasciarle agire per un minuto, non fanno una cippa in un minuto) e se non sbaglio il balsamo Splend'Or √®  CG. \n\nQuello che per me ha funzionato davvero √® stato usare una vecchia  magliette di cotone per asciugare e plopping, mettere una stoffa di raso sopra il mio cuscino quando dormo, dormire con \"l'ananas\", lo S2C, lo  scrunching e applicare tutti i prodotti sui capelli gocciolanti.",

It leaves hair squeaky clean, and this particular shampoo synergizes well with conditioner containing amodimethicone (or other amine silicones). The apple cider does not remove silicone. What it does is make your hair more acidic, or negatively charged, and amodimethicone is cationic, or positively charged. This means it is attracted to the acidified hair and forms a stronger film. I use Aussie Mega Moist, but the principle is applicable to any amodimethicone based product. Hope this helps!\n\nEdit: Clarification (no pun intended)",

    "body": "Hello Ladies! I thought I would create this post as I haven‚Äôt seen a very detailed thread about hair care yet. We often talk about skincare and beneficial or terrible ingredients here and on the wider web, however I always think hair care is never as thoroughly investigated. I‚Äôm a total newbie at hair styling, however I will blow my own trumpet and say after years of research and trial and error I‚Äôm pretty good at hair care. This will probably be very long even without me going into lots of detail, but feel free to ask in comments for more detail on specific things that interest you and I will expand. Also chime in with any extra info, especially if you‚Äôre curly haired! My experience and knowledge is more based in straight and slightly wavy hair. \n\nA disclaimer ‚Äì proper hair care can be time consuming and require lots of trial and error at first, it did for me and everyone who I know is really into it too, but in my opinion it is worth it. It doesn‚Äôt have to be pricy though, there are lots of great cheap products! Once you find what works for you though, you will really reap the benefits for life. \n\n\nSo, let‚Äôs start!\n\n\n**Finding out the true state of your hair**\n\nMost likely you use silicones on your hair (a lot of products contain them), and silicones coat your hair, make it soft, sometimes weigh it down. They cover a lot of hair care sins. To find out the true condition of your hair, you will need to strip it of silicones. To do this, you will need to use a shampoo with a fairly strong detergent, sodium laureth sulfate (SLES), sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), or sodium coco-sulfate are often shunned, however they are great for removing silicones from hair. You can then apply a non-silicone conditioner, and then wait for your hair to dry naturally. At this stage, you will see how good (or bad) a condition your hair is really like. It may still be looking great, but you may get quite a shock and decide you need quite the chop. I know I did the first time I cleansed my hair properly. It went from being fairly soft albeit a bit flat with just some split ends, to dry, tangled, and extremely brittle on the bottom 10cm. It looked matted. I took off a third of my length immediately and then a few months later another 5cm or so. I will edit this later once I find some before photos of my hair, and I will also do a current photo with my hair free of silicones.\n\n**Figuring out your hair porosity**\nHair porosity is your hair‚Äôs ability to absorb moisture. There is theoretically a simple test [here](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/40/3d/62/403d621b14f0c8c63e04ec9b61c02508.png) you can do, however over time you may find the result of it wasn‚Äôt 100%. I have medium porosity, meaning my hair absorbs moisture okay and keeps it for a decent amount of time. Low porosity hair doesn‚Äôt absorb moisture easily, however once it does, the moisture stays for a very long time. This can lead to product build up which will need to be cleansed regularly. Low porosity often requires using heat to absorb moisture (such as putting on a hair mask, a plastic shower cap and blowing hot air at it). High porosity hair absorbs moisture quickly, but it also lets it out quickly. Often requires good conditioning, but may also require cleansing from time to time. It will often feel frizzy, and humidity will have a big impact on high porosity hair. Unfortunately, you can‚Äôt really change the porosity of your hair, but you can definitely care for it! \n\n\n**Ingredients and Products**\n\nI have to say, compared to the east, the west has actually rather limited hair care options. Most high street and even salon brands are really not fantastic. I live in the UK, but I source most of my products from Eastern Europe, so for those of you in the US my specific recommendations might not be too much help, but you might be able to find some or find alternatives by looking at the ingredients list. \n\n**Ingredients**\n\nThere isn‚Äôt really a super easy way to go about this. After a year or so I learnt the names of ingredients that really work or don‚Äôt work for me and I look for or avoid them. [Here]( http://www.tightlycurly.com/ingredients/) is a good ingredients list which tells you what the ingredient is and what it is used for. It does also have a ‚Äògood‚Äô ‚Äòokay‚Äô ‚Äòavoid‚Äô rating system, however I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily take it into consideration, as how a lot of ingredients affect you is personal (for example some people‚Äôs hair responds well to sulfates or paraffin, others not so much). \n\nThe order of the ingredients list is not accidental. The further from the top, the less of that ingredient there is. Any beneficial ingredient listed after ‚Äòparfum‚Äô is not going to bring you any results, as it is basically a trace, however something that you are sensitive to can still have a negative effect on your scalp even at such trace amounts. \n\n*Things to look for*: \n\n*Oils* ‚Äì any ingredient name that ends with oil (except mineral oil which is paraffin, more on this later!) is beneficial for hair. The more and the closer to the top of the list, the better, especially in masks and conditioners.\n\n*Extracts* ‚Äì again any name that ends with extracts. These are extracts of naturally occurring plants, herbs, or even legumes which have different beneficial effects such as smoothing, adding shine, protecting or strengthening. \n\n*Emolients* ‚Äì lanolin, anything with ‚Äòbutter‚Äô (e.g. shea butter), cera alba (beeswax), pafarrinum liquidum (paraffin, more on this later)\n\n*Humectants* ‚Äì glycerin, urea, mel (honey), aloe vera, fructose (sugars).\n\n*Antioxidants* ‚Äì ascorbic acid (vit C), tocopherol (vit E), Ubiquinone (Q10), retinol/retinyl acelate/palmiatate (vit A), niacinamide (vit B3). \n\n*Proteins* ‚Äì hydrolysed silk, hydrolysed keratin, hydrolysed wheat protein, hydrolysed oat protein. Proteins help to strengthen hair. \n\n*Soothing ingredients* ‚Äì allantoin, arnica montana, calendula officinalis, panthenol. Particularly useful if you have a sensitive scalp.\n\n\n*What to avoid (generally speaking):*\n\n*Sulfates* ‚Äì Sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, although if anything in the ingredients list of your shampoo ends with sulfate, check on the list for strength. Sulfates don‚Äôt always need to be avoided.  They are cleansers and foaming agents used in a large majority of shampoos. They can strip your hair of oils and humectants and dry the skin on your scalp, however they are also useful in the removal of silicones.  They shouldn‚Äôt be used every day, but once a week to every 2 weeks is recommended if you use silicones on your hair. If your scalp and roots respond well to sulfates, you can protect the lengths of your hair by applying an oil or conditioner pre-washing, thoroughly washing your scalp and roots with a sulfate shampoo and only using the leftover foam on the length, then conditioning again. There are more and less harsh versions, and the gentler ones can be used more frequently, please refer to ingredient list! Not recommended for curly hair.\n\n*Parabens and preservatives* ‚Äì Ones I found particularly harmful to me personally: DMDM Hydantoin, 5-Bromo-5-Nitro-1,3-Dioxane, 2-Bromo-2-Nitropropane-1,3-Diol, Diazolidynyl Urea, Imidiazolidynyl Urea, Phenyl Benzoate, Phenyl Dimethicone, Formaldehyde, Methylchloroisothiazolinone. Parabens are used to prevent products from going off. They‚Äôre not the only preservatives used in hair care and by no means the worst ones, but they can affect your scalp and hair. Eco-shampoos and conditioners are often filled with alcohol instead of parabens which can really dry out your scalp and hair. I don‚Äôt find parabens to be bad for my hair at all, but this is personal and you will have to eliminate and reintroduce (see that thing I said about time consuming at the start?) to really find out. You will not be able to find a preservative free product, therefore it is worth checking which work for you. \n\n*Alcohol* ‚Äì alcohol denat and isopropyl alcohol, most others are fatty alcohols which are moisturising. The only time harsh alcohols are useful is when using hair ‚Äòrubs‚Äô, where they help with product absorption. \n\n*Scents* ‚Äì most scenting ingredients are listed under parfum, however some particularly harsh ones are required to be listed separately. These are: limonene, linalool, citronellol, geraniol, coumarin, citral, benzyl benzoate and eugenol. They‚Äôre usually at the very end of the list and in the trace amounts will not usually do any harm unless you have a sensitivity. \n\n*Silicones* ‚Äì similarly to sulfates, silicones are not always bad. I personally like silicones. They work with my hair without concealing its true condition much or weighing it down. If your hair is thin you may find it better to only use the more soluble ones or none at all.\nI avoid shampoos with silicones at all cost though. The job of a shampoo is to cleanse your hair and prepare it for absorption of beneficial ingredients. I allow water soluble and gentle shampoo soluble silicones in conditioners and hair masks, and I use SLS requiring silicones in leave in conditioners that I only put on the ends of my hair. \n\nWater soluble silicones are: dimethicone copolyol, lauryl methicone copolyol, hydrolyzed wheat protein hydroxypropyl polysiloxane and silicones with PEG and a number at the start. The higher the number (especially above 10), the more water soluble the silicone. \n\nSilicones soluble in mild shampoo: amodimethicone, dimethicone, dimethiconol, beheonoxy dimethicone, phenyl trimethicone.\n\nNeed sulfates: simethicone, trimethicone, trimethylsilylamodimethicone, trimethylsiloxysilicates.\n\nEvaporate from hair (only washing with a conditioner to become soluble): cyclometicone, cyclopentasiloxane, cyclotetrasiloxane, octamethyl cyclotetrasiloxane, cyclohexasiloxane.\n\nI would advise completely removing silicones from your hair care routine for a week (you might find out your hair curls when it never did before), and then slowly reintroducing them one by one from the mildest to the heaviest ones to see how your hair reacts.  \n\n*Paraffin*  - Mineral Oil, Paraffinum Liquidum, Paraffin Oil, white oil are most common names of Paraffin. Paraffin has made a bad name for itself, it is known to be comedogenic to skin, however this does not happen to everybody, and even then you don‚Äôt have to put it on your scalp. Paraffin can be found in conditioners, masks and hair oils, and I‚Äôve never had problems with it as an ingredient. It is also found in a lot of baby products, as near enough no one is allergic to it. You will have to experiment to see how it works for you. If it agrees with your hair, it works much quicker than natural oils ‚Äì you will see results from first use, rather than after months of regular use. Products containing paraffin can be used after washing and conditioning to protect your hair from split ends. Paraffin requires stronger cleansing agents such as SLS for removal, and therefore not recommended for curly hair. \n\n\n**Products**\n\nNow, let‚Äôs look at specific products and how to get the most of them. \n\n*Hair Oils*\nI cannot recommend hair oils enough. This is probably the number one thing that changed my hair. I have been using hair oils for 6+ years and have never looked back. I‚Äôve tried A LOT of oils, and my favourite one is [khadi]( https://www.essentialslondon.com/products/hair-care/khadi-vitalising-hair-oil-100ml?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIuOPxmKHw1QIVCrftCh1njgn9EAQYAyABEgIwGPD_BwE#fo_c=762&fo_k=e4b0478aa27161be9771ad687e8f656d&fo_s=gplauk). It promotes hair growth and keeps my hair healthy and shiny, but some people don‚Äôt like the scent. Pure argan oil and rosehip oil are also great for me, as is pure coconut oil or the coconut hair oil from [vatika]( https://www.amazon.com/Dabur-Vatika-Enriched-Coconut-150ml/dp/B006BA3BAY/ref=pd_lpo_vtph_121_bs_t_1/136-1463637-2732606?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=B8H7QG82QJF78X98V78D). There are a lot of oils on the market, just make sure what you‚Äôre using is pure oil, not stuff like the brand ‚Äòmoroccan oil‚Äô because even your cooking olive oil is better than that. You can find a lot of indian hair oils on amazon. Apply by taking a few droplets and warming them up in your palms, then rubbing into the scalp and the lengths of the hair. When I first started my hair care and my hair was quite damaged, I would apply oils overnight every other night (before washing), and sleep with a cotton hair cap on to prevent transfer onto my pillow, then wash it off and condition in the morning. I now wash my hair in the evenings, so I apply it for about an hour before washing and I find that‚Äôs enough, but my hair is not particularly damaged.\n\n*Shampoos*\n\nFor day to day cleansing I try to find as simple a shampoo as possible, such as this [Babydream]( https://www.codecheck.info/kosmetik_koerperpflege/babypflege/babyshampoo/ean_4305615272467/id_792172/Babydream_Shampoo_mit_Kamille.pro). I‚Äôve tried other ones over the years, but always come back to this one as it‚Äôs super cheap and gentle. I also like [Equilibria aloe vera shampoo]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,51609,equilibra-aloe-shampoo.html). Other products that I‚Äôve used as a shampoo that aren‚Äôt a shampoo: [Facelle intimate wash]( http://www.rossmann.pl/Produkt/Facelle-intim-plyn-do-higieny-intymnej-Sensitive-300-ml,101735,7210), [Johnson‚Äôs Baby 3in1 Wash]( http://www.johnsonsbaby.com.pl/johnsons-baby-%C5%82agodny-p%C5%82yn-do-mycia-cia%C5%82a-i-w%C5%82os%C3%B3w-3w1). At the start I found my hair a bit tangled after use, but I think that was partly due to the damage. For heavier cleansing I use [Avalon organics rosemary]( https://www.amazon.co.uk/Avalon-Organics-Rosemary-Volumizing-Shampoo/dp/B001ET78QU) or any of the herbal [Barwa Natura]( https://www.barwa.com.pl/seria/barwa-naturalna/) shampoos. I do this every 10-14 days depending on how my hair feels regarding silicones and paraffin that I‚Äôve used. A special mention goes to [Babuszka Agafia Black Soap]( https://bioika.pl/pl/p/Naturalne-Syberyjskie-Czarne-Mydlo-Agafii-na-bazie-37-ziol/659) which is just amazing. \n\n*Conditioners*\n\nI like to go rich here. I look for alllll of the extracts, oils, humectants, anything and everything. My everyday conditioner is the [Garnier avocado and shea butter]( https://www.fragrancedirect.co.uk/garnier-ultimate-blends-the-nourishing-repairer-conditioner-0083190.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=merchant&utm_keyword=foo&istCompanyId=17773c4e-a26f-4631-9b91-73e6422dbe77&istItemId=xiqwpwpqil&istBid=tztx&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9Oud06Lw1QIVxbztCh0PbQzcEAkYASABEgI4UfD_BwE) and it‚Äôs been with me for years. I also like the [seboradin ginseng conditioner]( https://seboradin.pl/en/seboradin-revitalizing/29-lotion-seboradin-revitalizing.html), Nivea Long Repair, [Balea Coconut and Milk](http://lepotica.rs/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/balea-mleko-za-telo-lepotica.jpg) and [Timotei Precious Oils]( https://www.amazon.com/Timotei-Precious-Oil-Hair-Conditioner/dp/B00UGHRW6M). Currently I apply in-shower for however long it takes me to shave and wash, then rinse off. When my hair was damaged, I would put a cap on and leave them on for 30 mins, then rinse.\n\n*Masks*\n\nAs with conditioners, as many of the goodies as possible. This is probably the product I‚Äôve switched up the most, as there are not very many BAD hair masks, usually they‚Äôre between average and amazing. My favourites over the years have been [Alterra]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,43114,haarkur-granatapfel-aloe-vera.html), [Natur Vital aloe vera]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,40836,naturvital-sensitive-hair-mask-aloe-vera-juniper-zimbro.html) mask, [biovax masks such as this]( https://www.amazon.co.uk/LBiotica-Biovax-Damaged-Hair-250ml/dp/B00N42XUL2), [Babuszka Agafia yeast mask]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,51660,pervoe-reshenie-przepisy-babci-agafii-maska-do-wlosow-drozdzowa-na-pobudzenie-wzrostu.html) and [Kallos Latte]( https://www.notino.co.uk/kallos/serical-mask-for-damaged-chemically-treated-hair/?item=78561&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIqp7vxKPw1QIVbb7tCh2u0QGcEAQYASABEgKtzPD_BwE) mask. I used to apply masks twice a week, but now I do it weekly or even every 10 days. Usually I will apply a mask instead of conditioner, throw on a shower cap, and keep it on for anywhere between 1 and 3 hours before rinsing. Sometimes I will blow warm air from the hairdryer to help the ingredients absorb better.\n\n*Rinses*\n\nThere are many rinses you can make at home, not really available as products to buy. I like a chamomile rinse the best as I‚Äôm blonde, I also like a dissolved aloe one, but you can experiment with ingredients recommended for your hair type. They can strengthen your hair, add shine, reduce frizz, make it sleeker.\n\n*Rubs*\n\nThese are products that you rub into your scalp and roots (and sometimes hair length) without rinsing off. My favourite is from [Jantar]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,69415,jantar-odzywka-do-wlosow-i-skory-glowy-nowa-wersja.html), I also like [Joanna Rzepa]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,17640,rzepa-kuracja-wzmacniajaca.html). There are also placenta capsules after which I got an insane amount of baby hair. Rubs help with growth and strength of hair!\n\n*Hair protection*\n\nI use something with silicones and proteins in to protect my end, usually the silk from [biovax]( http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/like/112353278842?chn=ps&dispItem=1&adgroupid=44158024220&rlsatarget=pla-324287136906&abcId=1128926&adtype=pla&merchantid=115212699&poi=&googleloc=1007281&device=c&campaignid=856227250&crdt=0), but some hair oils (especially coconut) will also do. I do this once my hair is at least half dry and leave it in. If I‚Äôm not washing my hair for longer than 2 days, I will reapply. \n\n*Vitamins, Supplements etc.*\n\nThere are a lot of supplements you can try to help your hair growth or its condition. Vitamin E is obviously a staple. Biotin is fantastic for hair growth. Pregnancy vitamins strengthen hair. Drinking nettle and horsetail tea will do wonders. If you are really, really adventurous and can stomach a lot, drinking yeast (fresh is best, but dry will do) is the best for hair growth. You need to drink it every day for a prolonged period of time though, and it is incredibly unpleasant so requires a lot of commitment.\n\n*Hair styling and others*\n\nAs you might have seen from my previous post, I don‚Äôt often style my hair, and have never done. I do hairdry on cold or lukewarm settings, but I only use heat stylers for events and I chuck in a lot of hair protection. I‚Äôm gonna experiment a little with styling after my most recent post, but after looking for styling products, I‚Äôve found very few that are not harmful to hair. I don‚Äôt brush my hair wet unless using the wet brush, I have a cotton tshirt I use to absorb water from it with instead of a towel, I don‚Äôt sleep with it wet, I keep it in a loose twisted bun overnight mostly to avoid rubbing. I have 3 different hair brushes (sable and synthetic) and a tangle teezer. If it‚Äôs very windy, I plait my hair, and I wear a hat in the sun. I wear a cap to go swimming. \n\n\nWell done if you got to the end, you are a hero. I hope you find these tips useful and can pick and mix as you please! Give most products 3-4 weeks to do their work before you deem them useless though. Looking forward to any tips you ladies might have on hair care, discussion, and what you found works for you and if you‚Äôre as obsessive as I am about it! \n\n\nEdit: link with some [hair photos](https://imgur.com/a/CQU90), 6 year difference",

After I used the treatment in my hair, my hair feels the BEST it has felt in months. It's so soft and I want to keep touching my hair, so I looked at the ingredients for the treatment.\n\nThe ingredients in the treatment: Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Stearoxypropyldimethlamine, etc...\n\nI have spent months avoiding dimethicone (especially if it is listed in the first 5 or so ingredients) because I heard that it coats hair and it only makes it appear nice, but it is not really good for your hair's health. Now, I'm reconsidering it. I debating if I should go to Target and grab some new conditioner...\n\nI have bounced around from different shampoos and conditioners for a bit still searching for my holy grail items. I currently use this shampoo: [https://www.costco.com/Kirkland-Signature-Moisture-Shampoo-33.8-fl-oz-.product.100375353.html](https://www.costco.com/Kirkland-Signature-Moisture-Shampoo-33.8-fl-oz-.product.100375353.html)\n\nand impulsively bought this conditioner (which I now see has amodimethicone further down in the ingredients list): [https://www.albabotanica.com/en/products/hawaiian-conditioner-drink-it-up-coconut-milk-12oz/](https://www.albabotanica.com/en/products/hawaiian-conditioner-drink-it-up-coconut-milk-12oz/)\n\nThey are both okay for me, but they aren't amazing. I'm mostly disappointed more by the conditioner.\n\n...\n\nWith that all said... Here are some questions I have!\n\n1. What are your thoughts on dimethicones?\n2. Do you completely avoid them?\n3. Do you love them?\n4. Do you avoid some, but like others?\n5. Are you indifferent about them?\n6. What kind of hair do you have and what conditioner do you use or love?\n7. I think it's time for me to get a new conditioner! Any help is appreciated!\n\n...\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your responses! :)\n\nFor now, I bought a shampoo with sulfate to clarify my hair. I'm going to order a conditioner online most likely by Shea Moisture or Nature's Gate.",

I have been avoiding silicones for over a year now, and I found it to be difficult at first while I struggled to find products and routines that work for me. \n\nRight now, I am using the SheaMoisture moisture retention shampoo and restorative conditioner. I absolutely love these, because they don‚Äôt have silicones or protein in them (my hair is protein sensitive and gets brittle when I use products with protein). About every 4 weeks I will use a Neutrogena clarifying shampoo, or really whenever I feel like I need it. I also use the Living Proof leave-in conditioner and de-tangler. Lately, I am considering bringing silicones back in to my routine, but I want to be careful not to use too much because I found it weighed down my hair so much in the past. I have replaced my Living Proof detangling spray with a Bumble&Bumble one that has dimethicone, and it has been going pretty well so far.\n\nWhile these products have been working well to keep my hair hydrated and feeling soft without silicones, something I suggest to anyone with thin hair would be either a silk pillow-case or silk night-cap. I use a silk night-cap that has helped me tremendously with breakage and flyaways, and I always wake up with smooth hair ready for the day.

It lubricates the hair and is thought to contribute to easier wet combing (i.e less friction). In hair serum, for thermal processing, dimethicone is a heat protectant. Shampoos with sulfates are ideal for removing products with dimethicone. ([via.](http://www.thenaturalhavenbloom.com/search/label/Ingredients%20Dictionary)) Generally speaking, silicones build up on the hair and can only be adequately removed with sulfates. Sulfates are extremely drying to the hair, and can cause a whole host of problems with hair health. It is best to avoid silicones in hair care, so as to avoid sulfates in hair care. \n\nIn skincare, it prevents water loss by forming a hydrating barrier on the skin. Like most silicones, this ingredient has a unique fluidity that makes it easily spreadable. When applied to the skin, its known for creating a subtle gloss that feels smooth and silky to touch. It also acts a mild water repellent by forming a protective barrier on the skin, and can fill in fine lines/wrinkles on the face, giving it a temporary ‚Äúplump‚Äù look. ([via.](http://www.truthinaging.com/ingredients/dimethicone)) Because silicones sit on top of the skin, they can trap dirt, bacteria, etc. and cause breakouts. \n\nSilicones are not readily biodegradable, so they can have negative impacts when they are washed down the drain.

It is a film former that needs shampoo to remove, but it won‚Äôt usually cause too much build up because of the amine group‚Äôs positive charge. If a spray is dimethicone based, it will contribute to build up. \n\nThe only silicones that evaporate are volatile silicones, such as cyclomethicone or decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane. They generally either will begin with cyclo- or end in -ane. If your spray is based on one of these it will evaporate within 10 minutes and not cause build up. \n\nThere are also water soluble silicones. These usually start with PEG- and then a number greater than 8. These will stay in your hair until the next wash but should be able to be removed without detergents like SLS. \n\nEdit: Typo",

        "body": "As a disclaimer, I‚Äôm not a hairdresser or cosmetic chemist, just someone who has taken a college chemistry class.\n\nCyclomethicone evaporates at room temperature. It‚Äôs used in a lot of skin products to make things spreadable without leaving a residue. Sometimes it‚Äôs actually added to hair products to make them dry faster. So while I don‚Äôt have a direct source for this, I would imagine that you are correct that you should apply heat ASAP. \n\nI‚Äôm not sure whether there are water soluble heat sprays. What you said sounds pretty plausible to me. I wonder if they may be less strong film formers than other kinds of silicones. \n\nSilicones make hair limp over time because most kinds of silicones repel water and attract more silicone (that‚Äôs why if you store two silicone dildoes touching they‚Äôll eventually melt together). A lot of people use many different silicone products layered on top of each other, including dimethicone depositing shampoo. Regardless of the product type, the silicone in it is going to stick to all the previous layers of silicone on the hair, and washing with dimethicone shampoo will add to the film.\n\nThe silicone film is actually a good thing. It locks moisture into your hair and prevents it from escaping when your hair is exposed to heat. It just needs to be removed occasionally by a clarifying shampoo, so it doesn‚Äôt keep building up on itself.\n\nThe exception to this is amodimethicone and other amine modified silicones. They have a positively charged amine group, which makes it attracted to hair but repulsive to more deposits of amodimethicone. For this reason it‚Äôs my favorite category of silicone. There are other ingredients that lead to build up, so I still like to clarify occasionally, even though I don‚Äôt personally use dimethicone in any of my products.\n\nSilicones aren‚Äôt the devil. Dimethicone certainly has its place, especially as a heat protectant. The problem is when people use it in every product, and then there‚Äôs just too much of it stuck in their hair.\n\nEdit: Sorry that got kind of long winded lol.",

If it‚Äôs the former, I‚Äôm guessing you should try to apply heat as soon as you can after spraying (i.e as soon as the spray dries) because the protection is getting weaker and weaker by the minute as it starts to evaporate? \n\n> There are also water soluble silicones. These usually start with PEG- and then a number greater than 8. These will stay in your hair until the next wash but should be able to be removed without detergents like SLS.\n\nI really, really like the idea of water soluble silicones. But so far, I haven‚Äôt been able to find *any* heat protectant sprays that use water soluble silicones only and have them high up in the ingredients list :( (I feel like having water soluble silicones in the middle or near the bottom of the ingredients list would mean there‚Äôs less protection?). I haven‚Äôt looked at high end, expensive products because that isn‚Äôt sustainable for me right now. I guess I also worry that being water soluble, those silicones would somehow be less protective against heat, although I haven‚Äôt read about any evidence of this. \n\nWhen it comes to silicones being accused of making hair limp and flat, why do you think this is? Is it because of build up or something else? would using volatile or water soluble silicones remedy this?",

I explained to her that I had never used it before and that it was not me.\n\nNow today, as I prepared to leave for a holiday in South Korea this morning - my mother asked me to buy another bottle of the hair treatment (without realising it was hair treatment). My sister saw and exclaimed \"so it was you using it!\". My mother explained that she had been using it for some time on her face and that it made it really nice - both me and my sister screamed internally and we had to explain to her that it was hair treatment.\n\nSo what I'm wondering at this point is - would be there be any harms in her using the hair treatment as a face wash? The ingredients are written in Japanese but I pulled the listing from Amazon Japan and have transcribed/translated them below:\n\n> water, isopentyl diol, behentrimonium chloride, glycerin, stearyl alcohol, dimethicone, behenyl alcohol, cetanol, DPG, maltitol, aminopropyl dimethicone, steartrimonium chloride, camellia seed oil, lactic acid, lemon extract, rose water , Royal jelly extract, soybean seed extract, isopropanol, isopropyl myristate, PEG-2 laurate, amodimethicone, SODIUM METHYL COCOYL TAURATE , salicylic acid, PPG-2-deces-12, EDTA-2Na, cetrimonium chloride, BG, tocopherol, Sodium benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Flavor, Red 227, Yellow 4    \n\nI punched them into CosDNA and can't see anything particularly of concern but I'm not an expert by any means but I was hoping to get input from people with more knowledge.",

I'm also able to refresh with this just diluting it with water and scrunching it in (then following with herbal essence spray gel like a hairspray)\n\nI do have to wash/cowash my hair about every other day with this because my roots get oily, but that's not much more than normal for me, and I really don't mind because it dries so much faster than when I use gels (I don't have a lot of luck with mousses on their own) and it makes my hair feel so soft and nearly product free. My hair also gets lots of definition with this; even as it falls it doesn't get stringy, it kind of chunks together into spirals (although I think I have less problems with my hair falling than some people in this sub). This also handles frizz nicely considering how extremely frizz-prone my hair is. It also has that nice garnier fructis signature smell if you know what I'm talking about lol. \n\n*NOTE: while I largely follow the CGM, this product does have amodimethicone and mineral oil. In my research mineral oil is easily removed and amodimethicone doesn't really build up on itself (I still clarify every 3-4 weeks and use a low poo a couple times a week though), but if you want to follow the CGM very strictly this product is probably not for you :)",

I can't say the numbers I know because it was confidential from a lawyer, but will say it was in the tens of thousands that they admitted to to courts in 2015 before it was all over the news and fewer people made the connection.

(FDA is testing probably only newer products, and if it is a quality control type issue, they wouldn't be getting the same batches) At least I would like to evaluate the percentages in the patent do see what else could be at unsafe levels, and what could cause the type of symptoms people complain of at unsafe levels.

Heat protection sprays are designed to protect from heat settings that get up to 450 degrees (depending on the product).\n You can test heat protection sprays and how well they buffer the heat.  1. Simply spray the product on one hand and leave the other hand free from product. I like a liquid spray. 2. Take a blow dryer and apply heat to the hand that has the spray. Count how many seconds you can withstand the heat from the dryer. 3. Next apply heat to the hand that doesn‚Äôt have product and count how long you can stand the heat.\n There should be a noticeable difference between the  heat.

        "body": "Silicon is derived from sand. Each company will add something to modify or enhance the silicon. The difference between the types of silicon in conditioner and heat spray. Heat spray is volatile while conditioner is a thicker form of silicon thus causing buildup. \n Conditioner is made to close and restore ph levels (acidic) from shampoo (alkaline). The cheaper the company the more junk you will have  in your conditioner. This is what causes the build up. Professional products have a guarantee when sold through a salon. It assure people that the product will perform how its supposed to. While most cosmetics sold in bigger stores will not. \n  Liquid Heat spray has silicon that evaporates when heat is added. If you have a serum heat product this may contain the thicker form of silicon which could cause build up. Again this will differ from each company. \n  Silicon is basically used in products to add shine, detangle, and helps to lay the cuticle flat. This all makes wet hair detangle easy and dry hair soft. It also forms a barrier to protect hair from heat.  When combined with other ingredients it will have optimum results. This is where is gets confusing.  \n With conditioner, some companies will add more of one product to give an instant result. Some will add ingredients that will keep your hair dry. Some companies will create products that keep you in a cycle without fixing your hair. Pushing you to try the new products. \n Buying professional usually eliminates this. You need to find a good hairdresser that knows product knowledge. \n Using a clarifying shampoo once a month with a treatment conditioner will keep your hair ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù.  This will keep your hair free from build up. \nUsing a conditioner is not an effective way to achieve the best heat protection. \n Relying on the silicon in conditioner is not an effective way to protect your hair from heat.",

However, many products I was not able to find online or find a reliable source for.\n\nIn addition, the conditioner I recently purchased from Drugstore.com (Renpure) ended up not being CG-friendly (Amodimethicone) but was not listed on their ingredients page on the site. I messaged them about this and suggested they update their product list, however this won't catch every product which has potentially changed to be non-CG friendly.\n\nThis means there's a decent chance when you buy a \"CG-friendly\" listed product, despite reading the ingredients on what you assume is a reliable website, it may not be.\n\nHence my call to action: **If you have purchased a product listed in the Ultimate Product List or one you would like to be in it within the last 3 months, please Ctrl + F to search the name of it and if no one has already commented in this thread with it, snap a quick, (readable) pic of the ingredients and put it here in the comments.**\n\nThis will hopefully keep the product list on track and is helpful to you and the community. I'm hoping we can get this to become a recurring thread. I'm hoping to signify if a product contains proteins or is fragrance free as well, since these topics seem to come up a lot. If you can think of any other thing you'd like to keep track of in the list that may be of interest to others, write it in the comments or message the moderator.",

(Cheap ones, but with Amodimethicone, I was set).\n\nA test revealed extensive allergies and I'm sobbing because I think I may have to cut my long hair off. I have purchased so many shampoos, conditioners, and detanglers and I can't find anything I'm not allergic to that works, and I am having to cut knots out of my hair. \n\nPart of this crisis is that I'm also disabled, and the extra time on my feet spent trying to condition and detangle my hair with inferior products, just so I can remove the knots is injuring me. I'm worried I may have no choice.\n\nI know this might not seem like a big deal, but my hair is the only thing I have left that makes me feel pretty after my illness & disability has taken everything else. It is one of the only things about my appearance I am still in charge of. Or at least, I was. I am desperate to save it, but I can't maintain it safely anymore.\n\nI am severely allergic (my skin melts right off) to these ingredients:\n\nALL fragrance, including essential oils and \"natural\" sources of any kind. I'm allergic to all of them.\n\nCinnamic aldehyde (cinnamon & it's derivatives).\n\nPropolis (beeswax).\n\nBalsam of Peru.\n\nYlang-ylang (cananga odorata).\n\n\n\nThe only ingredient I know for certain detangles my hair well enough is the Amodimethicone, but of course I'm open to any suggestions. I tend to need extremely heavy, thick conditioners. Much more so than people would expect with my curl pattern. In the past I have had success using products that are marketed to mixed and/or Black women because they tend to moisturize & detangle better for me.\n\nI'm not wealthy by any stretch but I won't turn my nose up at any recommendation. If I have even a hope of buying it I will try to save my hair. \n\nI'm also not opposed to making things at home if it's easy enough for me to do with my disability. \n\nThank you to everyone for any suggestions you may have.\n",

So I‚Äôm actually considering co-washing instead. \n\nI‚Äôve had these two conditioners in my closet for a while that I have not used, and I‚Äôve looked through the ingredients list, would they be ok to use for co-washing?\n\n**[Redken Frizz Dismiss Conditioner](https://www.amazon.com/Redken-Dismiss-Conditioner-protection-smoothing/dp/B00UJZRO50)**\n\n> Aqua / Water / Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Paraffinum Liquidum / Mineral Oil / Huile Minerale, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Parfum / Fragrance, Isopropyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, PEG / PPG / Polybutylene Glycol-8 / 5 / 3 Glycerin, Pentaclethra Macroloba Oil / Pentaclethra Macroloba Seed Oil, Hexyl Cinnamal, BHT, Chlorhexidine Digluconate, Citric Acid, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone\n\n\nThis one looks quite fine to me? It seems to be a silicone-free conditioner and I read that Behentrimonium Chloride is quite good to have in a hair cleanser and it doesn‚Äôt seem to have any problematic ingredients in the top five.\n\n**[Klorane Conditioner with Pomegranate ](https://www.amazon.com/Klorane-Conditioner-Pomegranate-5-1-fl/dp/B000Q34W0K)**\n\n> Water (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Amodimethicone, Alcohol, Ceteareth-33, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Isopropyl Alcohol, Methyparaben, Punica Granatum extract, Red 4 (CI 14700), Trideceth-12\n\n\nIt seems the only problem for this one could be the Amodimethicone? Which I gather from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/?st=JGTIBFB0&sh=8c65316e) that it can be hard to wash off but does not cause a build up. I have briefly looked up the rest of the ingredients and they don‚Äôt seem to have serious red flags (except maybe the parabens). Is it still ok to use for cowash?\n\nI plan to shampoo with a sulfate-free shampoo once a week.",

I had a quick look at the ingredients in some popular repairing hair products and almost all of them contained this ingredient.\n\nMy question is - if this is the ingredient that is mostly the reason for hair feeling soft and silky and looking shinier and seemingly ‚Äòrepaired‚Äô, do these repairing products really actually do anything to help or repair the hair? Or is it just the amodimethicone making your fair feel and look restored because it‚Äôs a silicone?",

It can't truly be healed back to the way it was before it was damaged.  When a conditioner says it repairs damaged hair, it's not truly repairing it.  However conditioners can help make it feel softer, smoother, and less brittle so it *feels* more healthy to us (even though it isn't), but these properties also protect it from further damage, so they're beneficial for the health of the hair in the long run.  Brittleness makes it more prone to breakage, so softness/elasticity is a good thing.  Silkiness makes the surface less likely to catch on things and break.  And these ingredients can also make it more water resistant/hydrophobic, which is good because when too much water gets inside the hair, it can cause more damage.  It's not only the silicones doing this, but silicones are really good at doing this.  However formulation still matters; just because a product has amodimethicone in it doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to be as effective as you might like.  What other ingredients are in it and how they interact with each other make a difference as to how the final product behaves.\n\nI think it was in 2015 (9 years ago !!) that the first bond builder was released, and then more came on the scene.  Some of them do have the ability to do something that feels more accurate to describe as repair by rebuilding/altering some of the bonds that hold the fiber together.  So far as I know, none of these treatments permanently repair the hair, but the effect is longer lasting than just the temporary effects that a conditioner would have on the hair.",

Not a super high amount but it might be worth seeing if they still sell it. [https://incidecoder.com/products/whole-foods-market-365-hair-conditioner-fragrence-free](https://incidecoder.com/products/whole-foods-market-365-hair-conditioner-fragrence-free)\n\n[Odele Ultra-Sensitive Conditioner](https://incidecoder.com/products/odele-ultra-sensitive-conditioner) also looks promising.  No added fragrance except Phenoxyethanol, which is a preservative with a floral scent.\n\nYou could also try asking in r/FragranceFreeBeauty to see if anyone there has found anything with low fragrance and high in amodimethicone.\n\nI use the stinky conditioner as a pre-shampoo treatment, BTW, and that works pretty well!  The shampoo washes out the fragrance but not the amodimethicone :)\n\nAnother ingredient to look for is Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone, it has similar cationic properties like Amodimethicone. The Wella Invigo Senso Calm Mask, for example, has that ingredient and no added fragrance other than Phenoxyethanol.

I've been through many products the last year or so trying to find new products for my hair that fit me. I have long silky and straight hair but it gets easily split ends and can get very tangled in the mornings..\n\nI have recently tried a new brand though - the biosilk shampoo and conditioner plus silk treatment. I have paid much for hair salon shampoo and conditioners but these did not work as good as the biosilk products. I'm very surprised how good they work for my hair, the shampoo and conditioner makes my hair instantly combable after showering, which I've never experienced before! So long story short, why does the products work for me? Are the ingredients good long term? Any others who use or have used the products?

For instance, Squalane has 30 carbons and Hemisqualane has 15. Squalane has medium spreadability with a slightly higher viscocity and flashpoint than Hemisqualane.\nBoth represent ideal sustainable, high performance emollients used in nearly every category.\nSqualane is a more stable form of squalene and is a non-polar, fully saturated, and very stable emollient that is easily incorporated into emulsions. Squalane is an excellent moisturizer, keeping our skin and hair properly hydrated and imparting suppleness and flexibility to the skin. It is one of the highest quality and most versatile emollients on the market due to its sensorial profile, biocompatibility and consistently robust composition.\nHemisqualane is Aprinnova‚Äôs SEPAWA award-winning new cosmetics-grade emollient. Hemisqualane provides excellent sensorial and spreading properties, ideal for replacing silicones in color cosmetics, suncare, haircare, and more. It also has makeup removal benefits. It is a top replacement for isohexadecane, amodimethicone, and cyclomethicones like cyclopentasiloxane (D5)",

    "body": "Hey guys! \n\nHere's a recent post I wrote on Silicones.  Thought it might be a good read, especially for people just starting out on a NoPoo routine.\n\nSilicones are a very common item found in shampoos and conditioners.  Do you know what they are or what they do to your hair?  We took some time to help clarify things for you.\n\n**What is Silicone?**\n\nSilicones are polymers comprised of synthetic materials used as plastics or resins.  They are found in everyday life in many many places such as bathtub caulk, silicone breast implants, automotive components, cookware, electronics, lubricants, personal care items etc. \n\nCommon names for silicones are Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Methicone, Amodimethicone, Dimethiconol, Cyclomethicone/Cyclopentasiloxane.  Well known water soluble silicones you can find are Cyclomethicone & Dimethicone Copolyol.\n\n**Why are Silicones added to hair products?**\n\nSilicones are added to hair products for a number of reasons.  Primarily:\n\n* Generally recognized as safe/non-toxic, low instances of negative reaction\n* Can make dry hair appear and feel healthy\n* Can make brushing easier\n* Reduces frizz\n* Can make split ends less visible\n* Heat resistant/protectant\n\n**What do Silicones do to your hair?**\n\nSilicones work on hair by coating each shaft/strand of hair in a layer of silicone which basically seals the hair strand off from the elements (water, air, oils, contaminants).  During initial use, the hair will appear to be shiny & healthy, but the key word here is APPEAR.  While your hair appears to be healthy, is it?  We don't necessarily think so.\n\nOver time, silicones (especially non-water soluble silicones) can build up on your hair causing it to weigh down, become limp, dull and lifeless.  Part of the reason for this is because the silicone buildup becomes damaged over time which shows in the appearance of your hair.  Think about it like waxing a floor EVERY DAY.\n\nAnother potential issue with silicones is that when your hair is completely coated and sealed, it cannot receive adequate hydration or any nourishing natural oils, ultimately affecting the overall health of your hair and look of your style.  This is especially damaging in \"Curly Gurls\" or tight textured ethnic hair which is naturally difficult to hydrate.\n\nAdditionally, silicone can eventually become sticky which will attract environmental contaminants (dirt, dust, etc) which further dulls your hair and is overall undesirable.\n\nWhen these things happen, people generally are inclined to wash more frequently, more vigorously and use more styling products all of which simply compound the issue in a viscous cycle.\n\n**Why we don't use Silicones:**\n\nThere are some very valid and good uses for silicone in hair care products.  For instance, if your hair is extremely dry/dull and you have a photo shoot, a water soluble silicone could get you through the day.  Likewise, if you were straightening your hair for an occasion, a water soluble silicone could provide good heat protection to your hair.\n\nHowever, at [ManeLine](http://manelinehaircare.com), we are of the opinion that silicones simply provide a short term solution/look, while fostering long term damage & frustration.\n\nWe believe that your hair can actually BE healthy vs just appearing healthy through limited ingredient, sulfate and silicone free hair care routines.  The natural oils from your scalp can provide the shine you desire without introducing potential long-term problems to your hair, look and style.\n\n",

Group 4 is bad news in my eyes.\n\nActually I avoid all of the silicone myself, but in case I get into a situation I'll have to use it, group 1 is fine and group 2 is possibly no problem either depending on the product you use to wash it out again.\n\nI hope you don't mind me adding to it, Jeffery c:",

These people found that using a natural product, free from silicones, sulfates and phosphates resulted in fewer allergic reactions, and hair that is shinier, curls that are more bouncy and hair that is easier to style while using less product.   Available in 6 blends and 10 fragrances or unfragranced.\n\n**Blends**\n\n**Fine to Medium textured uncolored hair:**\n\n* **Original Formula:** Suitable for Fine to Medium textured Normal, Oily and Damaged hair including light dandruff.\n\n* **Dharma (Neem):** Dry, itchy, flaky scalp giving you problems?

We‚Äôve added Indian Gooseberry (Amla) which is beneficial for fixing dyes, nourishing the scalp and believed to slow graying of hair.\n\n* **Aura:** Developed for color treated or graying hair with persistent dandruff or dry, itchy scalp.\n\n**Fragrances:**\n\nBelow are brief descriptions of our fragrance offerings.  Fragrance Oils are proprietary in nature and while skin/hair safe, may not be 100% natural.  Should you require a 100% natural product, please see our Essential Oil options.  You can fragrance the product yourself using any skin/hair safe Essential or Fragrance oil.  We recommend you start at 10 drops, shake well and smell, adding more as necessary. \n\n* **Black Amber and Lavender:** \nDeep and sophisticated this fragrance blends rustic Amber with bold Parisian Lavender. Combined with these main scents is a mysterious Black Myrrh, dulcet vanilla Tonka bean, and a splash of Egyptian Musk. We've rounded out the fragrance with a surprising addition of raw Clary Sage resulting in an earthy concoction with hints of sweetness and pleasing floral notes.\n\n* **Two Bits:**\nA masculine scent with clean, sharp finish.  It's the perfect combination of barbershop aromas.  This fragrance combines the scent of a strong yet sweet aftershave along with hints of aromatic spices and orange zest.\n\n* **Energy:**\nA stimulating blend of Citrus, including Grapefruit, Lemon and Lime, with hints of fresh Cucumber and Jasmine, and a touch of Pineapple, Blackberry and Champagne.\n\n* **Bamboo Mint:** (best seller!)\nA clean, refreshing blend of fresh green bamboo and mint mingled with deep florals and musk. Top notes open with fresh pear, mint, black pepper and galbanum. A heart of bamboo, black currant, ozonic lily and tuberose are wrapped in a base of sandalwood, musk and violet.\n\n* **Greystone:**\nThe perfect men's fragrance, this crisp scent is surprisingly also adored by women. It's like navigating a kayak through icy waters - brisk and fresh but casual enough not to overwhelm the senses. Top notes: citrus, black currant and pineapple. The middle notes are: honeydew, muguet and water lily and the base of the fragrance is: vetiver amber and mulberry.\n\n* **Unfragranced:**\nManeLine NoPoo is available for use in its natural unfragranced form.  The natural fragrance of our NoPoo is honestly not incredibly pleasant.  It has a fairly sharp vinegary fragrance.  Blends containing NEEM oil smell substantially LESS pleasant.  Neem oil has a very strong \"nut oil\" fragrance which covers well with fragrance but is not overall pleasing for most people in its raw form.\n\n**Essential Oil Fragrances:**\n\nPlease note, any descriptions of use/benefit are traditional uses and not evaluated by the FDA.\n\n* **Cedarwood:** (best seller)\nDeep and rich classic fragrance of freshly shaved Cedarwood.  All of the glory with none of the sawdust! Stimulates scalp, promotes hair growth, controls dandruff & itching.\n\n* **Orange:**\nAmazing citrus scent.  Soothes irritated scalp, helps itching, promotes hair strength.\n\n* **Lemongrass:**\nCrisp natural lemongrass, antiseptic, antimicrobial, astringent, tightens hair follicles.\n\n* **Rose Geranium *partial fragrance oil:** (best seller)\nSweet rose floral scent, astringent, antiseptic, balances sebum, may help with head lice.\n\n* **Teatree:**\nSlightly medicinal astringent scent, fights lice, dandruff and itchy scalp, promotes hair growth.\n\n**Our ingredients and why we use them:**\n\n* **Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe) Leaf Juice:**  Aloe juice is an excellent natural moisturizer for hair and scalp.  Very few people have negative reactions to Aloe, making it one of the best liquids we could use.\n\n* **Sapindus Mukorossi Berries:**  Nature's very own soap from a tree!  These natural nuts yield a pH neutral gentle cleanser without huge amounts of foam.\n\n* **Acacai Concinna (Shikakai) Nut Powder:**  Shikakai powder is a natural hair cleanser dating back thousands of years.\n\n* **Azadirachta Indica (Neem) Leaf Powder:**  Neem oil and Neem leaf powder have an excellent reputation for naturally combating dry/flaky scalp conditions.\n\n* **Emblica officinalis (Amla) Fruit Powder:**  Amla powder is derived from the Indian Gooseberry plant and is widely used as a natural dye-fixer and preventing premature graying.  It is also very nourishing to the hair and scalp.\n\n* **Lactobacillus Ferment (Natural Preservative):**  Lactobacillus Ferment is a natural preservative, keeping your product fresh and healthy for use.\n\n* **Hydrolyzed Soy Protein:**  Hydrolyzed Soy Protein is a protein rich hair conditioner containing multiple amino acids which can improve hair strength.\n\n* **Glycerin:**  Glycerin is a natural humectant, used to keep hair from drying and becoming brittle.\n\n* **Azadirachta Indica (Neem) Seed Oil:** Neem oil and Neem leaf powder have an excellent reputation for naturally combating dry/flaky scalp conditions.\n\n* **Hydroxypropyltrimonium Honey:**  Honeyquat is a natural conditioner which is commonly used in ethnic and African hair to enhance curls and prevent dryness.\n\n* **Potassium Sorbate:**  Potassium Sorbate is a natural compound, though commercially produced in basically every instance.  It is added to our NoPoo in very small quantities to prevent fermentation and reaction from fragrances.  Fun fact!  Potassium Sorbate is most often used in wine to halt fermentation at a given point.\n\n* **Xanthan Gum:**  Food grade Xanthan Gum is added to our NoPoo as a thickening agent.",

There‚Äôs no real way to predict how and what or when will happen to your hair, everyone‚Äôs body reacts differently.\nThat being said, there are some things you can try. Scalp massages with coconut oil will help improve circulation and will help stimulate new hair growth. Also, eating foods high in omega 3s will improve the strength of skin, hair, and nails. There are also over the counter vitamins you can take, like biotin, to help improve hair growth and strength. Avoid heat styling, get regular trims, and your hair should be just fine.

However, the conditioner I want to try has many of those and amodimethicone in it. \n\nThese are the ingredients in Davines Love Curl conditioner: \n\nAQUA / WATER / EAU, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, GLYCERIN, BEHENTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, CETYL ALCOHOL, CETRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, DIMETHICONE, ORYZA SATIVA CERA / ORYZA SATIVA (RICE) BRAN WAX, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL, BENZYL ALCOHOL, DICAPRYLYL ETHER, PANTHENOL, PARFUM / FRAGRANCE, LAURYL ALCOHOL, AMODIMETHICONE, HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE, DISODIUM EDTA, SODIUM BENZOATE, POLYQUATERNIUM-10, CITRIC ACID, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS SEED EXTRACT / PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND) SEED EXTRACT, TOCOPHEROL, TRIDECETH-12, LIMONENE.\n\nSorry this is a lengthy post, but would just live to clear it up!",

Iirc polyquats are even more difficult to remove than amodimethicone, but why bother? These ingredients impart shine and smoothness and are somewhat protective (among other things). Your hair does not contain living cells and does not require nutrients to be delivered into the inner core, nor does it require water inside the hair shaft. In fact, from my research less water in the hair shaft is ideal. So a layer of emollients will do more good than harm imo.\n\n\nObviously buildup will occur after some time, and when this occurs you can always use a clarifying shampoo. I was strictly no sulfates/silicones for a few years for my curly hair. Nowadays knowing the science behind things, I don't understand the movement.",

My shampoo has that same cleanser, and some people describe it as essentially a sulfate while others say it's the most stripping of the non-sulfates but still weaker. If it were me, I would go by how my hair feels. If your hair seems gunky, sticky, or like it won't detangle the way it normally would, you can throw in a suave daily clarifying wash. If not, maybe your hair just likes being coated in silicone (or the shampoo is cleaning adequately) and you don't have to worry about it. The other thing to watch out for is that those heavy silicones tend to prevent oils from getting to your hair, so if you feel like your hair is really dry, or like the texture of it when unconditioned is getting worse, that may be a sign to switch conditioners or at least do a sulfate wash and use a silicone-free deep conditioner before you resume using the amodimethicone one.",

I did try searching for this issue but couldn't seem to turn up the result I needed, so I'm sorry if this has already been asked and answered or if I do anything wrong!\n\nBasically, I've been searching for a perfect match in foundation for years, and I think I've finally found it in Bare Minerals Original SPF Foundation. I love the colour match, the feel, the way it doesn't seem to break me out, everything. Except... I've been finding that I end up with really patchy skin, exactly like the picture in this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/3zys04/help_why_is_my_makeup_patchy_is_it_the_products_i/ \n\nFrom reading the comments in that post, it seems that the issue tends to stem from using a water based primer against a silicone based foundation and vice versa. But I can't figure out if that's what I'm doing. I'm using Bare Minerals Blemish Remedy Mattifying Prep Gel as a primer (which feels nice and seems to be helping any spots) which I think is water-based, but I'm just not sure of the foundation. So I'm hoping someone here can help! If it is the case, I'd rather drop the primer than the foundation so if anyone has any primer recommendations I'd love to hear them :)\n\n**Ingredients of BareMinerals Original Foundation:** Bismuth Oxychloride (CI 77163), Zinc Oxide (CI 77947), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, 77492, 77499), Mica (CI 77019).\n\n**Ingredients of Blemish Remedy Mattifying Prep Gel:** Water (Aqua/Eau), Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Adipic Acid/Neopentyl Glycol Crosspolymer, Silica, Sclerotium Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Lecithin, Populus Tremuloides Bark Extract, Ganoderma Lucidum (Mushroom) Stem Extract, Micrococcus Lysate, Serenoa Serrulata Fruit Extract, Dimethicone, Zinc Pca, Vp/Va Copolymer, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Amodimethicone, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Sodium Hydroxide, Limonene, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.\n\nIf it's relevant, I've recently (as in about a week now) started an Oil Cleansing Method routine using jojoba oil, a foaming cleanser with BHA and argan oil - could any of this be part of the issue if it's not the makeup? I know oil dissolves makeup but I usually only apply a light coverage of argan oil as moisturiser in the morning, and let it dry completely for 10+ minutes. It's doing absolute wonders for my skin, so I wouldn't want to drop it but would love to hear if this is the issue so I can try and work around it.\n\nThank you all so much!",

I've tried using different types of primers, foundations, powders, and setting sprays but so far I've only learned a few things:  \n  \n- It tends to happen on days where I'm quite stressed or sweating a bit more.  \n- It also happens if I keep powdering my nose all day. Basically the build up of too much product getting cakey.  \n- It looks worse when I use primers instead of moisturisers as a base.  \n  \nThings that helped:    \n\n- Using a longer lasting foundation like MAC's pro long wear nourishing foundation or Max Factor's Lasting Performance foundation for a more affordable alternative.  \n- A mineral based loose powder dabbed/patted on (not wiped on)  \n- NYX's matte finish setting spray.   \n  \nIf it starts happening during the day and I'm at work so I can't just take it all off and start again, I sometimes use a very light CC cream (I use Bourjois 123 Perfect CC cream) and pat a tiny bit on the affected area to smooth it out and then after a minute or so pat on some powder.  \n  \nI hope that makes sense or any of it helps :)",

It's straight, and doesn't hold a curl very well.  I'm currently getting a trim every 2-4 months as needed, so I think it's healthy in the split-ends department.  Mostly it's just poofy and hard to manage after washing it, whether I air-dry or blow dry, and at the moment the ends do weird curly things for day or so when left to their own devices (related to the awkward length my layers are at, I think?).  [Here](http://imgur.com/a/aHvJw) is a quick album of my hair when washed and styled, washed and air dried, and today, with some more info in the descriptions.\n\nI've tried co-washing this past week, using L'Oreal EverPure because I had it around and I saw my Pureology conditioner has amodimethicone in it.  My hair feels much softer after washing, but still poofs near the same amount during the initial drying phase.  I've co-washed every other to every third day, because that's when it felt like I needed it, hopefully I can stretch that out more over time.\n\nI know \"your mileage may vary\" and whatnot, but is there a suggested time frame for when I should use a clarifying shampoo, at least to start?  Do I just wait until it starts to feel icky?  I really don't want to co-wash two to three times per week *and* shampoo every week, if I can avoid it.  And then I use my normal conditioner following the shampoo, right?  I also looked at some of the product recommendations and I may pick up a bottle of Tresseme Naturals, but I did notice that the same product is listed in the co-washing section as well as the leave-in conditioners section.  Stupid question, but does that mean I can co-wash with it, and also occasionally use some as a leave-in if I want, and how small of an amount do you normally use for a leave-in treatment?",

I also took them right when I woke up so excuse any less than stellar focusing/editing.\n\n[Bottles bottles bottles!](http://imageshack.com/a/img910/4102/mVzP1C.jpg) ~**~ [Masks!](http://imageshack.com/a/img901/9827/B78rFB.jpg) ~**~ [Skylake Bae Sample Heaven cont.](http://imageshack.com/a/img661/2466/UkDTBZ.jpg)\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nThe second I saw Skylake opened their English webshop, I hit that place up like a frenzied vulture.  I basically became obsessed after the Mishibox shampoo sample, because I've never had a shampoo work so perfectly for my hair (long, oily scalp) - and I've tried nearly every store brand Target carries, salon brands, organic brands, sulfate frees, etc.  I ran out and was unhappily using Biosilk until my fresh bottle arrived, and lord am I relieved.  \n\nI bought the shampoo, a box of their Elastic/Pore sheet masks, 1 ea. of their Brightening and Relaxing/Trouble Care masks, and a mini Oriental Herbal Relax Toner.  The rest is all samples from the gracious Skylake gods above, they did not mess around for their opening event.  I somehow managed to miss the face powder priceline by like 3 dollars since I didn't pay attention, but I received one anyway!  The best pity.  Samples include:\n\nOriental Herb Hosu Aqua Gel, Oriental Herb Hosu Aqua Skin, Elastic/Brightening soap, Natural Foam Cleanser, Refresh Cleansing & Massage Cream, Oriental Herb Natural Sun Screen SPF50 PA+++, Oriental Herb Lotion & Cream, Green Energy Essence, Natural Multi Blemish Balm SPF36 PA++\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nSo, naturally, I tried some of the samples and the face powder the other day/last night.  My face lately looks like I'm peeling from the devil's sunburn because of tretinoin, no amount of moisturizing layers have been helping me during the day or night, so I honestly figured \"WHAT ELSE COULD GO WRONG\" and just dove right in.  Idiot girl continues to not patch test mass amounts of items, what happens next will shock you.\n\n*My face this morning was actually not bad*.  Consider me hella pleased to see my flaking was minimal, and I actually still looked moisturized to an extent.  If this is just a fluke, I'm still okay with it.  If this is the power of those Hosu samples, I am going to need full sizes.  And on that note, some impressions for items!\n\n------------------------\n\n**ORIENTAL HERB CLEANSING POWDER (blue)**\n\n*cnidium officinale root powder, glutinous rice powder, sodium carbonate, phaseolus angularis seed powder, phaseolus radiatus seed powder, sodium laurate, sodium stearate, sodium myristrate, sodium palmate*\n\nThis powder when mixed with water, for me, tested at a pH of 7.  I tested it a couple of times to be sure, but it definitely reads differently than my DHC powder, so I'm confident that is accurate enough.  However, last night I threw all caution to the tretinoin wind and used it anyway - it's not bad!  It doesn't feel like your skin is taut and dry after, but extended use will need to be tested.\n\nIn the bottle, it smells like an earthy green tea, and it looks like it too.  When in use though, it smells like some baked you a fresh stack of waffles and then went, \"you know what would be delicious on this? Mushrooms.\"  Surprisingly, it is not a bad combo.  In fact, I would rank it as one of my favorite product smells in a while.  The powder is slightly gritty and doesn't entirely dissolve, but it's not scratchy.\n\n~~\n**HERBAL COOL SHAMPOO**\n\n*SKYLAKE oriental herb water (water, angelica gigas extract, peppermint leaf extract, artemisia absinthum extract, morus alba leaf extract,cnidium officinale root extract, licorice root extract, morus alba barf extract, angelica dahurica root extract, scutellaria baicalensis root extract, pueraria lobata root extract, inula helenium extract, laminaria japonica extract, phellodendron amurense bark extract, clove flower extract), disodium cocoamphodiacetate, cocamidopropyl betaine, tea-cocoyl glutamate, disodiumlaureth sulfosuccinate, glycerin, cocamidedea, peg-12 dimethicone, amodimethicone, polygonatum multiflorum, polyqua ternium-7, scutellaria baicalensis root powder, polyquatemlum-10, peppermint leaf oil, menthol, phellodendron ammurense bark, allantoin, panthenol, caprylhydroxamic acid / caprylyl glycol / glycerin, salicylic acid, citric acid, disodium edta, rhizome/root*\n\nI just really love this shampoo and have a lot of feelings about it.\n\n~~\n**ORIENTAL HERB HOSU AQUA SKIN & GEL**\n\nThe skin is super watery and pours out of the sample bottle like the wind, so be careful.  The gel is thin and refreshing.  Both have this smell that is so familiar, but I can't put my finger on it.  It's not a disagreeable smell and it dissipates fairly quickly.  I am super duper impressed by the moisture I got from these samples, and they are both lightweight and breathable.  This seem like ideal items for hot and humid climates, and rough summers.\n\n~~\n**ELASTIC/PORE MASK SHEETS**\n\n*SKYLAKE oriental herb water (water, angelica gigas extract, peppermint leaf extract, artemisia absinthum extract, morus alba leaf extract,cnidium officinale root extract, licorice root extract, morus alba barf extract, angelica dahurica root extract, scutellaria baicalensis root extract, pueraria lobata root extract, inula helenium extract, laminaria japonica extract, phellodendron amurense bark extract, clove flower extract), carbomer 981, sodium polyacrylate, disodium edta, allantoin, glycerin, propylene glycol, hmamelis virgiana (witch hazel) water, 1.3bg, polysorbate 80, scutellaria baicalensis root extract, paeonia suffruticosa root extract, glycerin, butylene glycol, betaine, dipotassium glycyrrhizate, sodium pca, triethanolamine, sodium hyaluronate 1%, natto gum, collagen, portulaca oleracea extract, aloe barbadensis leaf extract*\n\nI haven't tried one yet, but I figured some people might want the ingredients.  I am going to slap one on my face before work though.\n\n~~\n**Oriental Herb Relax Toner**\n\nThis stuff smells like acidy dirt, I don't even know what to tell you.  It's kind of bizarre.  It's wet. I will probably still use it on my face because it's pocket convenient.",

But now... My hair is a frizzy, dry, breaking mess and my scalp is always itchy. I've tried clarifying, deep conditioners, protein treatments and so many different shampoos, conditioners, leave ins, and stylers and nothing was working...\n\nI gave up and today I washed my hair with Garnier Whole Blends Honey Shampoo & Conditioner and did my regular styling routine from CGM. My hair and scalp feel absolutely wonderful! I know it might be a short term thing since silicones can give instant gratification. BUT MAN DOES MY HAIR FEEL GREAT üòÖ. I'm also trying to unlearn that silicones are inherently bad but I don't know enough about them to be honest... the shampoo contains sulfates and Dimethicone. The conditioner contains amodimethicone. I understand they are both non water soluble. I plan on washing my hair twice a week if this works out.\n\nI also bought the Aussie moist shampoo and 3 minute miracle conditioner. I haven't tried them yet. The reviews for both the Garnier and Aussie products I've mentioned have been overwhelmingly positive and that's what drew me in... I just wanted one day of nice soft hair and luckily I got it. I just hope it doesn't come and bite me in the butt later.\n\nTL;DR I was wondering if anyone could tell me if the shampoo and conditioner I mentioned are good/bad for my hair in the long term. Any insight would be appreciated! üòÅ‚ù§Ô∏è THANK YOU!",

I personally use L‚ÄôOr√©al/ herbal essences but any shampoo and conditioner containing silicones gave me mechanical protection while shampooing and conditioning, added slip and better overall moisture retention. If you notice build up just clarify once in a while. I have less build up, less hair fall, no scalp issues and over all 80% better hair going back to sulfates and silicones. I found I have so much less build up with silicones, even water insoluble ones, than with all the natural plant oils found in cgm products.\n\nEdit: I love the Aussie moist shampoo and 3 minute miracle conditioner, especially the conditioner, try that conditioner out ASAP and you‚Äôll see a huge difference!",

I was apart of a lot of forums where I opened up my success with reverting and the response I got was shocking and immature. Opened up my eyes to figure out the actual truth about how these products are formulated (both cgm approved and non cgm approved), it also opened up my eyes that butters and oils can be equally able to build up just as much as silicones can. Silicones just give me a better mechanical protection, a lighter feel, and let my hair stay on my head lol. I have stopped almost all of my use of cgm approved products, a few that were light weight leave ins or stylers I used up but I cycle through herbal essences sham & con, L‚ÄôOr√©al shampoos & con, etc. I stick to drug store because there‚Äôs some good cheap gems but I‚Äôve had success with salon brands as well. I highly believe that everyone, no matter the hair type, should clarify to a schedule they see fit as everything that sits on your hair has a potential to build up. Clarifying more often was a big game changer when I started having problems with cgm. Then slowly I realized that all my great hair days happened after my clarifying. Used my clarifying shampoo on all my wash days after that (I used suave daily essential clarifying shampoo) then I used the Eva NYC hair mask (contains silicones) and had such a good hair day I never went back",

The genuinely functional ingredients in both conditioners are both very common and relatively cheap.  Companies put tiny amounts of \"sexy\" sounding ingredients (natural oils, botanical extracts) that don't actually contribute anything beyond a marketing story.\n\n\"Product X : The same as every other conditioner\" isn't going to sell well.  But \"Nourishing Product X : Grow and Protect, now with Coconut Oil and Rosehip Extract\" (or whatever is trendy in skin/haircare at the moment) might shift some bottles.\n\nThe amount of alcohol isn't likely to be a problem.\n\nThat said, there are potentially other reasons not to use a product designed to be rinses out as a leave-in.  Because rinse-out products are supposed to be in contact with your skin for only a few minutes, they are allowed to use higher levels of certain ingredients that can cause irritation.  Leave-ins need to use lower levels of those particular ingredients.",

One of the earliest recorded use cases was of the [ancient Egyptians](https://www.arabnews.com/secret-ancient-egyptian-beauty), who applied castor oil to their hair. It wasn't until 1950 that a scholar named Martin Levey suggested using the distillation process to extract¬†oils from plants in [prehistoric Mesopotamia](https://exarc.net/issue-2020-2/ea/ancient-distillation-and-experimental-archaeology). He published his findings in a paper called the [Evidences of Ancient Distillation, Sublimation¬†, and Extraction in Mesopotamia](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0498.1955.tb00466.x). With advances in technology, the¬†distillation process looks different today, but it's generally the same and is how the majority of the oils you use every day are made. In this post, I help you understand the different types of oils and which ones you should be using on your hair.  (This is the full blog but if you want to screenshot the ingredient lists, the post is a bit better organized on my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-recommended-product-ingredients.html))\n\n**Types of Oils**  \n*Plant Oils*  \n[These oils](https://cosmeticsandtoiletries.texterity.com/cosmeticsandtoiletries/june_2021/MobilePagedReplica.action?pm=1&folio=24#pg35) are pressed, crushed, and refined from the fatty portions of a plant or botanical. They are less aromatic and have the ability to sink into your hair shaft, unlike mineral oils, which can make them a more effective moisturizing ingredient depending on your needs.¬†  \n\n\n*Mineral Oils*  \nThese oils are made from¬†petroleum that is¬†[highly refined](https://www.chemicalsafetyfacts.org/mineral-oil/). They have a lower price point¬†compared to plant oils and essential oils, which can influence which brands will include them in product formulas. They're known to create a barrier on the surface of your hair shaft to lock moisture in.  \n\n\n*Essential Oils*  \nThese oils¬†are [distilled](https://www.thezoereport.com/p/oils-vs-essential-oils-the-biggest-differences-the-most-popular-uses-more-19442788) from leaves, roots, bark and other aromatic portions of plants. The distillation process turns the raw ingredients left over into a more concentrated, highly aromatic oil. They're used for their smell and are thought to have therapeutic benefits, but will irritate your skin if not heavily diluted with mineral or plant oils.¬†  \n\n\n*Silicone (not an oil)*  \nWhile not technically an oil, silicone provides conditioning qualities that are similar. There are two types to be aware of: (1) soluble¬†and (2) non-soluble. The main difference between them is that one can be broken down by water and the other cannot, meaning it requires harsher shampoos with surfactants to wash it away after continued use. You can tell the difference between them based on their ingredients, which I've listed below. You can also read more about silicones in my posts [*How Often Should I Shampoo?*](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html) and [*Ingredient Lists*](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-ingredient-lists.html).¬†‚Äã ‚Äã‚Äã\n\n* Non-soluble:¬†Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Amodimethicone, Pheryl trimethicone, Ceteraryl methicone, Dimethiconol, Stearyl dimethicone, Amodimethicone (non-soluble when Trideceth-12 and Cetrimonium Chloride are absent)\n* Soluble: Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone copolyol, Lauryl methicone copolyol, any silicone with PEG as a prefix\n\n**Oils for Hair with High Porosity vs. Low Porosity**¬†  \n‚ÄãFinding the right oil for your hair texture can be challenging, but if you can identify the porosity of your hair it will help guide the process. Genetics and they way you care for your hair are the biggest influencers of its porosity. Styling tools with high heat, coloring, perming and other hair care/services can cause your porosity to change. Although the signs of highly porous hair are not widely considered ‚Äúhealthy looking‚Äù, the benefit for some can be more volume and fullness.  \n\n\nHair with low porosity is considered to be ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù, but it comes with its own challenges. According to the [Science-y Hair Blog](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/oils-which-ones-soak-in-vs-coat-hair.html)¬†‚ÄúIf you have fine or soft hair which is easily over-conditioned, those same oils may make your hair feel greasy and lank unless used in very small amounts. Lower porosity hair may do better with blends of penetrating oils and less-penetrating oils.‚Äù The chart below will help you determine your porosity and show you what oils have been found to \"[penetrate the cortex](https://cosmeticsandtoiletries.texterity.com/cosmeticsandtoiletries/july_august_2021/MobilePagedReplica.action?pm=1&folio=DM5#pg51)\", or the second layer of your hair shaft that sits behind your outer cuticle. Your porosity level is a good thing to keep in mind when¬†searching for new hair products.**Signs of Hair with**¬†**High Porosity****Signs of Hair with**¬†**Low¬†Porosity**Hair that is:¬†\n\n* Dry, rough and /or dull\n* Full with volume\n* Coarser than usual (generally on the ends)\n* Tangling easily\n* Experiencing breakage\n* Air drying¬†within 15¬†minutes\n* Soaking up oil-based products quickly¬†\n\nFor oil treatments, use¬†**penetrating oils**¬†on your ends¬† and a¬†**mix of less penetrating oils plus penetrating oils**¬†from your roots to mid hair shaft.Hair that is:\n\n* Smooth and sleek\n* Flat and lacking volume\n* Heavier¬†with a¬†slick/greasy feel\n* Easily combed or brushed¬†\n* Not experiencing breakage\n* Taking 30¬†minutes or more to air dry\n* Unable to soak up oil-based products easily\n\n‚Äã  \nFor oil treatments, mix¬†¬†**penetrating**¬†and¬†¬†**less penetrating**¬†oils.  \n‚Äã  \n‚Äã*Sources:*¬†[*Enhancing Hair Health: Effects of Oiling, Inside and Out - Part I*](https://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/research/literature-data/article/21836362/cosmetics-and-toiletries-magazine-enhancing-hair-health-effects-of-oiling-inside-and-outpart-i)*, Cosmetics & Toiletries*  \n[*Enhancing Hair Health: Effects of Oiling, Inside and Out - Part II*](https://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/research/literature-data/article/21836386/cosmetics-and-toiletries-magazine-enhancing-hair-health-effects-of-oiling-inside-and-outpart-ii)*,¬†Cosmetics & Toiletries*  \n[*Oils - Which Ones Soak in vs. Coat the Hair?*](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/oils-which-ones-soak-in-vs-coat-hair.html)*, Science-y Hair Blog*  \n[*Beginner's Guide to Ingredients in Natural Hair Products*](https://www.texturedtalk.com/how-to-understand-ingredients-in-natural-hair-products/) *, Textured Talk*  \n[*15 Scientific Names for Common Ingredients in Natural Hair Products*](http://www.1blessednatural.com/2015/10/15-scientific-names-for-common-ingredients-natural-hair-products.html)*, 1Blessed¬† Natural Mag***Penetrating OilsLess Penetrating OilsNot Recommended**‚ÄãCoconut *(Cocos Nucifera)*¬†Oil¬†  \n‚Äã  \n‚ÄãSunflower¬†*(Helianthus Annuus)*¬†Seed Oil¬†Olive *(Olea Europaea)* Oil  \n\n\nArgan *(Argania Spinosa)* OilMineral Oil¬†  \n\n\nJojoba *(Simmondsia Chinensis)* Oil  \n**‚ÄãRelated blog posts:**  \n[Ingredient Lists](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-ingredient-lists.html)  \n[Hair Product Labels](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-product-labels.html)  \n[Applying Hair Products](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-applying-hair-products.html)",

    "body": "I've recently moved to an area with higher humidity and have decided to embrace my natural waves. I had been living in the desert before and until now my hair dried somewhat straight. Now, on day 2 after washing my hair I wake up with a tangly and frizzy mess unless I blow dry it straight or fully soak it with water.\n\n**Here are the issues I'm struggling with:** \n\n1. Tangles!  If I use any leave-in products they seem to weigh down my super-fine hair and if I don't it tangles. Brushing or washing always seems to be necessary on day 2.\n\n2. Shape: If I use anything with too much hold I feel like my hair looks like a nest of varying S's and Z's. The next day my hair is even more of a nest. Any attempts to refresh it seem to make matters worse.\n\n**Hair type**: very fine, low density, high porosity (In the desert, \\~1B, anywhere else \\~2a?)\n\nNotes on routine: I wash my hair about every other day, and occasionally need to use an anti-dandruff shampoo (ketoconazole). My hair is color treated, and I do use silicones but feel like it does keep down the frizz to some degree. Monthly treatments include Olaplex 1 and 2, weekly moisturizing hair masks for ends, and deposit only pigment based hair color (but I've used harsher coloring methods in the past). I have recently started weekly dusting of split ends. I have a satin pillow case but doesn't seem to help much, neither does the pineapple, which usually either falls out anyway or leaves lines in my fine hair.\n\n**Routine 1 (solid green shirt):** \n\n1. Wash with Maple Holistics Winter Blend Shampoo\n2. Condition with Kenra Restorative Reconstructor (contains dimethicone)\n3. Use wetbrush with conditioner\n4. Rinse out conditioner and gently support curls\n5. Microplop (all I had was terry that day, but I usually use microfiber)\n6. Mist with water with a small dollop of gel and pump of OGX Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz-Defying Curl Styling Milk mixed in (the milk contains amodimethicone)\n7. Air dry\n8. Day 2: Tangly, cannot finger comb, and needs to be brushed which turns into a frizzy mess\n\n**Routine 2 (camo shirt):**\n\n1. Wash with OGX Strength Length + Golden Turmeric Shampoo\n2. Condition with Keratin Care Keratin Color Care Conditioner (contains silicones as well)\n3. Use wetbrush with conditioner\n4. Rinse out conditioner and gently support curls, upside down\n5. Squish in a pump of OGX Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz-Defying Curl Styling Milk\n6. Squish in about 2 golf ball sized amounts of mousse (all I had was Ion root lifter)\n7. Plop with flour sack towel for 30 minutes\n8. Attempt to fix wonky pieces by wetting and using Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Gel and give up\n9. Day 2: Messy beyond repair and need to wash \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Routine 1](https://preview.redd.it/dxln15ys4ph81.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fffce0506649d58d948baa7cf2c5bf05a7fe952)\n\n[Routine 1](https://preview.redd.it/ca06b4ys4ph81.jpg?width=1743&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5484c99f374a3c83da677087cc9aeeaa30c39e6a)\n\n[Routine 2](https://preview.redd.it/ink6z0ys4ph81.jpg?width=2177&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=691c0c2f5d76e404db364adafd9bf62ee2e90a62)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Routine 2](https://preview.redd.it/2qb351715ph81.jpg?width=1183&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c26703150f307489794ae4d87e54712c1ad93f5b)",

        "body": "Girl I have fine hair too and I feel this post so much. As far as leave-ins, I‚Äôve only found two so far that work for my hair without weighing it down: the Verb curl leave-in and the Living Proof restore perfecting spray. The Living Proof one is a really watery spray, not really a traditional leave-in, but it‚Äôs enough slip for me to get my wet brush through which is vital for me to avoid tangles, and the Verb is more of a traditional conditioner style so I have to use it sparingly but it does a really good job and it‚Äôs my favorite.\n\nAs far as sleeping, I wish I had a good solution. I‚Äôve tried pineappleing, unicorn pineappleing, half up pineappleing, two types of satin bonnets, a satin scarf, Medusa clipping, and a satin pillowcase. None of them EVER work for me. What I‚Äôve settled on as the best of my subpar options is the combination of a silk pillowcase and a special type of memory foam pillow. It‚Äôs kind of hard to explain, but one side is flat and the other side has like a dip/valley thing going down the middle. It‚Äôs meant to support your neck or something. What I‚Äôve found works for me is to use the dip side, lay my head on the edge, and sort of fan my hair above my head into the dip in the pillow. It keeps my big head from squishing my waves to death. The results in the morning aren‚Äôt nearly ready to go level, but they‚Äôre good enough that I only need a little mist instead of fully drenching my head and diffusing again.\n\nSpeaking of diffusing, I would highly recommend it. If I air dry my fine hair all the waves drop out and it weirdly enough gets more tangled than with diffusing. I also use a nice gel (Briogeo curl charisma gel) so diffusing gives me a good cast I can scrunch out, leading to better and longer lasting definition.\n\nI hope any of this helps! Good luck finding what works for you!",

        "body": "I have 2B-3A waves/curls and brush my hair 3x per wash day because my hair is fine and tangles easily.  You may need to do something similar to help with the tangles.  Depending on the technique, I also find that it helps with definition, too. I dry brush before I shower, use a Wet Brush in the shower to comb through my conditioner, and then I brush again after the shower before applying styling products (either with a Wet Brush or Denman).  I scrunch back in water to recreate clumps before adding my styling products. You could also try using a spray bottle to add back in water. This is the best way I found to keep waves/curls intact while minimizing tangles.  Also, have you tried diffusing?  Drying your hair faster might help eliminate tangles.\n\nFor sleeping, I use a satin pillowcase and use a scrunchie.  My hair isn't quite long enough on the bottom for a regular pineapple, but I do a super high ponytail.  I like the scrunchie because it doesn't leave indents in my hair, unlike a regular ponytail.  Maybe give that a try?  I know some other people will also use a buff to protect their hair, but I personally haven't tried it.\n\nYou may also need to experiment a bit with your routine to see if other methods help with the tangles and day 2 hair.  I never plop because it makes my curls wonky, and it took me over a year before I could apply products upside down without getting wonky curls.  It can be frustrating, but I guarantee your hair will continue to improve the longer you care for your waves :)",

    "body": "In early January 2020, actress and hairstyling enthusiast [Taraji P. Henson]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taraji_P._Henson) launched her haircare line, TPH. The collection is currently sold exclusively at Target, both in stores and online. The line contains 18 products and is not designed to be exclusive to any hair type.\n[Five beauty editors at Allure](https://www.allure.com/story/tph-hair-taraji-p-henson-review) ‚Äì including three who have Type 4 hair ‚Äì tested the products and had complimentary things to say.\n\n##Product Details\n* __Price:__ $9.99 + tax for 12 oz. (355 mL)\n* __Hair Type:__ Curly & Coily\n* __Appearance:__ White conditioner\n* __Texture:__ Thick (maintains shape when poured); non-greasy feeling\n* __Scent:__ Light natural scent ‚Äì shea butter, olive oil, sage oil; scent does not linger\n* __Marketing Spiel:__ Hustle & Co is an ultra creamy, suds-free conditioning cleanser that deeply refreshes while moisturizing your coils, curls, and waves. No side hustle (in this case additional conditioner) necessary- Hustle & Co delivers hydrating goodness into your hair without stripping your hair of its natural oils. To use, wet hair and apply a generous amount to hair and scalp. Massage in with your fingertips and rinse. Repeat if needed.\n\n##Ingredients (NOT CG-APPROVED)\nwater (aqua/eau), cetyl alcohol, glycerin, isopropyl palmitate, behentrimonium chloride, ISODODECANE, fragrance (parfum), cetrimonium chloride, AMODIMETHICONE, phenoxyethanol, laureth-4, guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-7, ethylhexylglycerin, panthenol, trideceth-3, trideceth-15, disodium edta, olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, aminomethyl propanol, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, salvia officinalis (sage) oil, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, limonene\n\n###Method\nFor each wash, I poured an Oreo-sized mount of conditioner. I spread the conditioner out over my scalp and massaged vigorously for about two minutes. I then took a paddle detangling brush to spread the conditioner down to my ends and undo knots for somewhere in the 3-5 minute vicinity. I rinsed for about one minute.\n\n##Results & Observations\n * The product spreads super-easily. I got great coverage and had no trouble brushing it down to my ends.\n* While my hair was saturated and even after rinsing*, my hair had a TON of slip and I could have detangled manually if I had wanted.\n* The product absorbs into my hair very quickly. Even  after three washings and trying longer-than-usual rinses, I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure that I had most of it out.\n* I would have expected my Overtone to bleed, but the water rinses out 99.7% clear. My color looks as good as it did on the day I applied it.\n* My hair feels soft and amazing now, wet or dry. \n* My hair is super, *duper* shiny.\n* I‚Äôm getting much better than average volume at the roots, which lasts through my second day.\n* Either I‚Äôm not rinsing well enough or the product is too heavy for my ends to support. I have 2b/2c hair on Day 1 and wake up with 1c hair on Day 2.  (Which I am totally willing to let slide for how nice my hair looks and feels.)\n\n#Conclusion\nI‚Äôm deeply impressed with the salon-like power of this product for its drugstore price. I‚Äôm ready to kick my existing shampoo and leave-in conditioner off the shelf and make TPH a permanent fixture in my shower.",

I Shampoo/Condition my hair 2-3 times a week and dried with a T-shirt. Everything was going great until a week ago where I noticed my hair didn't feel the same anymore. I don't know how to describe it, but it almost feels rough and in need of conditioner? and my ends feel drier that normal. I am not sure whats happening my first thought was damage since I've been growing it out for almost a year without a trim or a cut. Now i'm starting to think that there is some sort of build up? What do you guys think? I have thick wavy/curly hair. Also, how do you know if your hair is moisturized? I always thought soft silky elastic hair = moisturized which is why I am writing this post because it no longer feels soft and silky, it feels rough.\n\nHeres the Shampoo  https://www.makeupalley.com/product/showreview.asp/ItemId=133656/Kirkland-Moisture-Shampoo/Unlisted-Brand/Hair \n\nIngredients: water sodium cocoyl isethionate cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine methyl isethionate disodium cocoyl glutamate sodium lauryl sulfoacetate decyl glecoside ammonium cocoyl isethionate divinyldimethicond/dimethicone copolymer disodium laureth sulfosuccinate helianthus annus (sunflower) seed oil lycium barbarum fruit extract aloe barbadensis leaf extract camellia sinesis leaf extract cucumis sativus (cucumber) fruit extract persea gratissima (avocado) fruit extract punica granatum extract melanin vitis vinifera (grape) seed extract glycol disterate glycerin fragrance quaternium-91 sodium cocoyl glutamate peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate amodimethicone panthenol polyquaternium-10 ppg-3 benzyl ether myristate chlorphenesin methyl gluceth-20 guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride c11-15 pareth-7 laureth-9 phospholipids hydrolyzed vegetable protein pg-propyl silanetriol c12-13 pareth-23 c12-13 pareth-3 trisodium ethylenediamine disuccinate trideceth-12 superoxide dismutase sodium ascorbyl phosphate tocopheryl acetate methylchloroisothiazolinone methylisothiazolinone\n\nConditioner: http://www.makeupalley.com/product/showreview.asp/ItemId=133657/KIRKLAND-MOISTURE-CONDITIONER/Unlisted-Brand/Hair\n\nIngredients: water cyclopentasiloxane cetearyl alcohol stearyl alcohol cetrimonium chloride behentrimonium methosulfate helianthus annus (sunflower) seed oil lycium barbarum fruit extract aloe barbadensis leaf extract camellia sinesis leaf extract cucumis sativus (cucumber) fruit extract persea gratissima (avocado) fruit extract punica granatum extract melanin vitis vinifera (grape) seed extract helianthus annus (sunflower) seed extract glycereth-26 dimethiconol divinyldimethicone/dimethicone copolymer fragrance gluconolactone cetrimonium bromide panthenol ppg-3 benzyl ether myristate jojoba esters quaternium-91 amodimethicone hydroxyethylcelloulose cetrimonium methosulfate sodium benzoate c11-15 pareth-7 peg-45m laureth-9 aminomethly propanol glycerin butyrospermum parkii ( shea butter) c12-13 pareth-23 c12-13 pareth-3 cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride (sunscreens) trideceth-12 citric acid ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate sodium ascorbyl phosphate butylene glycol hydrolyed soy protein tocopheryl acetate (vitamin e) hydrolyzed vegatable protein pg-propyl silanetriol\n\nedit: Some more info, My hair is just above shoulder length, when i get in the shower i use a wide tooth comb to get rid of knots then i soak my hair with warm water then lather the shampoo all over scalp and from root to end then rinse then i take a huge blob of Conditioner and use it the same way and leave it in for 1-2 minutes then rinse with cold water.\n\nThanks for the help!

I hope you can find the right oil for you too! For me the answer was sunflower. Coconut-derived oil ingredients, which is in most products, do not work as well for my hair. This is the entire blog post but if you would rather see it a bit more organized check out [Hair Oils](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-oils.html). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Types of Oils**  \n*Vegetable Oils*  \n[These oils](https://cosmeticsandtoiletries.texterity.com/cosmeticsandtoiletries/june_2021/MobilePagedReplica.action?pm=1&folio=24#pg35) are pressed, crushed and refined from the fatty portions of a plant or botanical. They are less aromatic and have the ability to sink into your hair shaft, unlike mineral oils, which can make them a more effective moisturizing ingredient depending on your needs.¬†  \n\n\n*Mineral Oils*  \nThese oils are made from¬†petroleum that is¬†[highly refined](https://www.chemicalsafetyfacts.org/mineral-oil/). They have a lower price point¬†compared to vegetable oils and essential oils, which can influence which brands will include them in product formulas. They're known to create a barrier on the surface of your hair shaft to lock moisture in.  \n\n\n*Essential Oils*  \nThese oils¬†are [distilled](https://www.thezoereport.com/p/oils-vs-essential-oils-the-biggest-differences-the-most-popular-uses-more-19442788) from leaves, roots, bark and other aromatic portions of plants. The distillation process turns the raw ingredients left over into a more concentrated, highly aromatic oil. They're used for their smell and are thought to have therapeutic benefits, but will irritate your skin if not heavily diluted with mineral or vegetable oils.¬†  \n\n\n*Silicone (not an oil)*  \nWhile not technically an oil, silicone provides conditioning qualities that are similar. There are two types to be aware of: (1) soluble¬†and (2) non-soluble. The main difference between them is that one can be broken down by water and the other cannot, meaning it requires harsher shampoos with surfactants to wash it away after continued use. You can tell the difference between them based on their ingredients, which I've listed below. You can also read more about silicones in my posts [*How Often Should I Shampoo?*](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html) and [*Ingredient Lists*](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-ingredient-lists.html).¬†‚Äã ‚Äã‚Äã\n\n* Non-soluble:¬†Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Amodimethicone, Pheryl trimethicone, Ceteraryl methicone, Dimethiconol, Stearyl dimethicone, Amodimethicone (non-soluble when Trideceth-12 and Cetrimonium Chloride are absent)\n* Soluble: Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone copolyol, Lauryl methicone copolyol, any silicone with PEG as a prefix\n\n**Oils for Hair with High Porosity vs. Low Porosity**¬†  \n‚ÄãFinding the right oil for your hair texture can be challenging, but if you can identify the porosity of your hair it will help guide the process. Genetics and they way you care for your hair are the biggest influencers of its porosity. Styling tools with high heat, coloring, perming and other hair care/services can cause your porosity to change. Although the signs of highly porous hair are not widely considered ‚Äúhealthy looking‚Äù, the benefit for some can be more volume and fullness.  \n\n\nHair with low porosity is considered to be ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù, but it comes with its own challenges. According to the [Science-y Hair Blog](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/oils-which-ones-soak-in-vs-coat-hair.html)¬†‚ÄúIf you have fine or soft hair which is easily over-conditioned, those same oils may make your hair feel greasy and lank unless used in very small amounts. Lower porosity hair may do better with blends of penetrating oils and less-penetrating oils.‚Äù The chart below will help you determine your porosity and show you what oils have been found to \"[penetrate the cortex](https://cosmeticsandtoiletries.texterity.com/cosmeticsandtoiletries/july_august_2021/MobilePagedReplica.action?pm=1&folio=DM5#pg51)\", or the second layer of your hair shaft that sits behind your outer cuticle.

It's seems like the best ingredients for the job are silicones which create a protective layer around the hair. Most people are worried about buildup when it comes to too much silicone but in my case I'm actually looking to create build up as protection. Does anybody know of any products that contain Dimethicone, Dimethiconol and Amodimethicone? I'm intending to drench my hair in them and then apply coconut oil before getting in the surf. If anybody has any suggestions or ideas in line with this let me know! ",

        "body": "So I don't have a complete answer for you, but I can share some insights to help inform your decision on how best to protect your hair. \n\nYou might be interested in [this informal experiment](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/your-hair-on-chlorine.html) by a soil scientist that tested the protective ability of olive oil, coconut oil, a conditioner with silicones, and one without silicones in chlorinated water (I realize sea water isn't exactly the same as chlorine though).  Both types of conditioner and the coconut oil provided good protection for at least 30 minutes (that was the maximum time she tested it); the olive oil wasn't as long-lasting.\n\nI think it's interesting that in the informal experiment, the conditioners with and without silicones both performed equally well.  It might have something to do with the specific formulations of the conditioners used in those experiments, but I think it's worth noting that some of the reputation that silicones have for buildup isn't exactly true.  There are a wide variety of silicones with different levels of \"clinginess\" or washability.  There are other ingredients such as cationic ingredients which can have an even stronger hold on the hair.  Amodimethicone marries the benefits of silicones (water-resistance, slip) with the extra \"stickiness\" that comes from being cationic. Bis-aminopropyl dimethicone is another that is cationic. Take a look at the silicones guide for the sub, I'd suggest focusing on the silicones listed in [Group 3 & 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/).  But one thing that Michelle Wong has pointed out about conditioners is that [they usually form tiny blobs on the hair](https://youtu.be/gLttCDPCADY?si=Jit1qP2jzaJWJAp3&t=1484) rather than a continuous film.  This still works fine to provide conditioning in most situations, but it might not be sufficient when the hair is immersed in water and/or exposed to a lot of humidity from the evaporation and splashes.  In [this article](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2017/05/humidity-resistant-hair-styling-products.html) about ingredients that provide humidity-resistance for the hair, some of them just provide hold to keep the style in place despite the water entering the hair, but some of them will include film-forming ingredients such as acrylates polymers to keep the water out in the first place.  I think you should consider finding a product with [film-forming ingredients](https://cosmileeurope.eu/inci/substancegroup/61/film-forming-agents/).  This was just from a comment discussing the active ingredient in Living Proof products which is patented, octafluoropentyl methacrylate, but there are other acrylates polymers, such as those listed in the article about humidity resistance.  There's another comment about coconut oil that notes that the medium-chain fatty acids in coconut oil are polar, they have the same \"stickiness\" as other cationic ingredients do to damaged areas of the hair especially, which might be part of what made coconut oil successful in her experiment with chlorinated water.\n\n[This study on elite Japanese swimmers](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11092265/) may also be helpful; it tried to determine what exactly the mechanism of damage is from swimming seemed to point to the friction between the hair and the water being a major element of it.  I'm sure as a surfer you know that water is heavy and can apply quite a bit of force on you, and that force is being applied to your hair as well.  In the study, the friction from high-speed swimming literally removed the protective cuticles of the hair, leaving the cortex (where the melanin that gives hair its natural color) resides, as well as the keratin that gives it structure.  Sometimes hair that's seriously damaged from chemical treatments and styling can also be missing the cuticle, or at least parts of it, so products formulated for chemically damaged hair will use a higher amount of cationic conditioning agents, because they are going to be better at sticking to the exposed keratin of the damaged hair.\n\n(I'm close to the comment size limit so I'll continue in another comment)",

        "body": "In swimming pools, one of the best things you can do is to wear a swim cap that keeps it dry, which both provides physical protection from friction of the water (although it may rub against the swim cap itself) and the water, which itself can make the hair more fragile to damage.  A swim cap that keeps hair out of the way even if it's wet probably would still be helpful, but less so.  I don't know how feasible that is for surfing, or if the cap is likely to get pulled off by the water and get lost (I'm not a surfer but I grew up on the Pacific coast so I have some experience with ocean waves).  I'm not sure if wearing a protective hairstyle like a braid would be helpful either; it would keep loose hairs from getting pulled individually (grouped together they are stronger than a single hair strand would be), but the water could still apply a lot of force/friction to the place where the hair is secured, which can cause breakage and even traction alopecia if it's creating repeated tension at the scalp.\n\nFinally, your post noted that you also want to protect your hair from the sun, which is a good idea because sunlight can be incredibly damaging, and if the protective cuticle of the hair is worn off, that would potentially amplify the amount of damage it could do.  [Episode 382](https://www.patreon.com/posts/episode-382-for-118373889) (starting at 38:45) and [Episode 366](https://www.patreon.com/posts/episode-366-will-105996403) (starting at 1:01:20) of The Beauty Brains podcast discuss UV protection for the hair. The challenge with traditional UV filters used in sunscreens for skin is that they don't coat the hair very well and tend to be very oily, however if the product is meant to have an oily consistency anyway (for ex. I have a Joico hair serum with UV filters as well as some antioxidant plant extracts), it could include [traditional UV filters](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/vl8bfi/heat_protectant_in_the_summer/).  There are also ways that these UV filters can be encapsulated in a cationic ingredient to get them to stick to the hair.  Otherwise, look for Polyquaternium-59, Quaternium 95, Polyquaternium-68, Polysilicone-19, or Cinnamidopropyltrimonium Chloride.  There are some plant extracts that are antioxidants such as Caesalpinia spinosa fruit pod extract, helianthus annuus (Sunflower) sprout extract, Rosehip Oil (Rosa Canina Seed Oil), Punica Granatum Extract (Pomegranate), and Tocopherol (vitamin E) to help provide some additional protection, but it's best not to rely on products that use only plant-based ingredients.  These ingredients would need to come from a specific supplier who has tested it to make sure it has enough of the chemical component that offers UV protection, and it would need used in the product in sufficient quantities, so you'd have to rely on the product company to show you the clinical studies they did testing the UV protection that the product offers.\n\nGiven that your scalp also requires protection (unless your head is covered with a physical barrier), you might be better off with a product that has an actual SPF rating, which indicates that it meets stricter requirements to prove that it can protect the skin.  For example the [Sun Bum Scalp & Hair Mist, SPF 30](https://www.sunbum.com/products/protecting-scalp-hair-mist-spf-30) uses mainly traditional UV filters.  Perhaps you can spray that on as your final layer on your hair. It says it's water-resistant up to 4 hours, perhaps due to the acrylates copolymer.  I also see caprylic/capric triglyceride in there, that's the medium-chain fatty acid in coconut oil that's cationic, it sticks really well to hair, but it's near the end of the list of ingredients, so I'm not sure how much impact it has in the performance of the product.",

These are the triglycerides in coconut oil that penetrate the hair, and one advantage is that it comes in liquid form, whereas coconut oil is solid at room temperature and below, so if it's cold out, it may be hard to apply and could potentially make your hair more stiff if it solidifies in your hair.

    "body": "I'm probably making this post a little late in the game, but late is better than never when it comes to doing the best for our hair, right? \n\nTailbone length, fine, curly/coily, dye in length from over a year ago, top is non-dyed hair. Rare/occasional low heat straightening.\n\nTLDR: used Nix lice shampoo which left my hair feeling very dry, what's my best bet for combating the dryness? Coconut oil makes my hair feel like straw. Then had to use the lice comb on my wet, stripped hair. Could feel and hear the hair being squeezed and pulled between the tight tines. (Immediately put in a leave-in for the night) how much damage can I expect? Is there any way to help my hair recover from the mechanical stress? How to protect my hair if I have to do the shampoo again? How to protect my hair when I do the post-treatment combing in about a week? How to help my scalp heal from the scratching and irritation from the lice? Also could use some advice from anyone who has dealt with lice before, this is my first (and hopefully last) lice experience. \n\nBackstory that's largely irrelevant:\n\nSo for a couple weeks I've had the WORST itchy scalp. I started a new job that requires I wear a hat throughout my shift right about when the itching started, and since my head would get sweaty in my hat for 9 hours straight, I attributed the itching to a fungal issue. Plus I sleep with a satin bonnet so my head is covered quite a bit. I was also still only washing 1x per week.\n\nI tried a tea tree treatment that supposedly helps fight fungal infections, and when it didn't improve, I reexamined my hair care routine and thought it was because I started a habit of just not rinsing my conditioner out and I was suffering from build-up and/or a bad reaction to the coconut oil in my conditioner. Used clarifying shampoo, only conditioned the ends and rinsed my new coconut-free conditioner out completely. Pure coconut oil makes my hair feel dry, but generally doesn't bother my hair when it's in a conditioner with other ingredients, but I read that it can clog pores and thought my follicles were jammed. \n\nNothing worked. \n\nThen today on my lunch break while sitting in my car, I was scratching the hell out of my scalp and came up with tiny dark brown/black specs under my nails. I then proceeded to look closely at my scalp and saw a bunch of white chunks on my hair about an inch from my scalp. When I tried to pull them off, they were stuck. That's when it clicked that it might be lice, so I looked it up on le goog, and all the symptoms/signs fit. After (my now very stressful day at) work, I panic ran to the store and bought Nix lice shampoo, the one made of mineral oil meant to drown the beasts. \n\nI drenched my hair, let it sit for the prescribed time and started to wash it out. As it lathered, I could feel my hair turning to straw. I scrubbed suuuuuper well, and lathered it up for a while before I rinsed it out. I followed it with my conditioner (which I rinsed out really well also to be sure I didn't have any shampoo left). \n\nI then spread some of the lice removal solution (CVS brand) meant to make combing easier throughout my hair (glycerin, propylene glycol, basically a lubricant I guess), and sat down for my boyfriend to comb my hair with the lice comb. He was as gentle as possible, but since my hair was wet it was really elastic, and I could feel/hear how tightly my hair was being ran through the comb. (MAJOR shout-out to my man for doing this for me, he was so sweet to me while I was in lice panic and damage dread).\n\nI'm now sitting in my (freshly laundered) bed with a head full of Garnier sleek and shine leave-in (I got it for the amodimethicone-heavy formula). I plan on sleeping with it in my hair, and probably leaving it in until a wedding I'm attending on Friday in hopes I can have my pretty hair for that day. \n\nBottom line questions: pure coconut oil dries my hair, what might be best to get some moisture back into my hair? How much damage has been done by having so much tension put on every strand of hair on my head with the comb? Can it be fixed at all? Any other advice for this predicament? How can I better prepare for my next combing in a couple days to see if it worked? And if I need to re-treat for lice?",

    "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nI‚Äôm a bit of a haircare/hair science newbie, and I searched the sub and combed through the wiki to try to figure this out myself, but I‚Äôm still at a loss, probably because I just don‚Äôt quite understand which haircare ingredients do what. Anyway, all this to say that I‚Äôm sorry if this has been asked or covered before. I just couldn‚Äôt find it on my own. If there are any posts you think I should refer to, please link it below!\n\n\nI recently tried the Pureology Nanoworks Gold shampoo and conditioner set, and after rinsing out the conditioner, I could immediately tell that my hair felt softer. After drying, my hair was much smoother/less frizzy, had a lot of body, and was the shiniest I‚Äôve ever seen it. My parents, who have never commented on my hair, even said that my hair looked really healthy when we were FaceTiming. Given that the price of the products makes me want to cry, I‚Äôm hoping to get some help in figuring out what exactly is in it that my hair really loves, and I want to see if I can find those ingredients in other shampoos/conditioners. \n\n\nA little bit about my hair:\n\n\nI have thin, low porosity (I think), fine, black hair. My ends are drier and I have a very oily scalp. The oily scalp is very odd to me because I am extremely dry everywhere else on my body, but my scalp has always been oily.\n\n\nI wash and condition my hair every night, wrap in an Aquis microfiber towel for a while, remove the towel, spray It‚Äôs A 10 leave-in lite, then dry my hair with a hairdryer. I‚Äôve tried not washing my hair every day, but it just gets too oily by the second day and my hair gets stringy and looks limp. Sometimes I will use dry shampoo, but I find that it just feels like there‚Äôs a lot of gunk in my hair and I break out on my scalp. \n\n\nFor the past couple of years, I‚Äôve used Matrix Biolage Ultra Hydrasource Shampoo and ultra Hydrasource conditioning balm. I‚Äôve also used the Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo/conditioner set on the days I have to wash dry shampoo out of my hair because I feel like the tea tree helps with the breakouts. For deep conditioning, I used the briogeo don‚Äôt despair repair conditioning mask, but honestly that just felt like an everyday conditioner to me, and I would mix that in with the tea tree conditioner because I didn‚Äôt feel like the Paul Mitchell one did anything for my hair. Currently I‚Äôm using the living proof restore hair mask in the same way. When I ran out of the matrix set, I switched over to the Bondi Boost hair growth shampoo and conditioner because when I finally was able to get a hair cut, my hairdresser told me that I had lost a lot of hair. Although I think it was due to stress and the fact that I couldn‚Äôt go get my hair done because COVID and I live in a different state than my home state for grad school, so my hair got really long and I don‚Äôt think it was very healthy (but it also looked really good after the Pureology set, and it looks even better now that I got a haircut and feel like my hair is a bit healthier than before). The Pureology was used here and there throughout my time with these aforementioned products, mainly because I was trying to make the product last longer, but each time I use it, I notice an immediate difference. \n\n\nPlease let me know if there‚Äôs any other info you need to know about my hair, and thanks in advance for reading this post and for any insight you might have for me!\n\n\nShampoo Infredients:\n\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Glycol Distearate, Divinyldimethicone/Dimethicone Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, Glycereth-26, Panthenol, Parfum/Fragrance, Sodium Chloride, Ppg-5-Ceteth-20, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyquaternium-10, Amodimethicone, Peg-55 Propylene Glycol Oleate, Propylene Glycol, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Carbomer, C11-15 Pareth-7, Benzoic Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter/Shea Butter, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein Pg-Propyl Silanetriol, Laureth-9, Glycerin, C12-13 Pareth-23, Benzyl Alcohol, C12-13 Pareth-3, Trideceth-12, Helianthus Annuus Seed Extract/Sunflower Seed Extract, Magnesium Nitrate, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Acetate, Salicylic Acid, Isopropyl Alcohol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Melanin, Potassium Sorbate, Sorbic Acid, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Pentylene Glycol, Bht, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide.\n\n\nConditioner Ingredients\n\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Amodimethicone, Parfum/Fragrance, Isopropyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Panthenol, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter/Shea Butter, Benzoic Acid, Trideceth-6, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein Pg-Propyl Silanetriol, Potassium Hydroxide, Caramel, Cetrimonium Chloride, Sodium Chloride, Helianthus Annuus Seed Extract/Sunflower Seed Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Potassium Sorbate, CI 15985/Yellow 6, CI 14700/Red 4, BHT, Melanin, Pentylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin.",

        "body": "AHA's can potentially alter how the hydrogen bonds respond to water, essentially making the hair more water resistant.  This is a phenomenon that has been documented when using [at least 5% of a carboxylic acid](https://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/testing/efficacy/article/21837243/your-hair-on-acid-the-influence-of-carboxylic-acids) (AHA's are in this category of acids), however given the list of ingredients you shared, the first AHA ingredient is malic acid at #11 of 29 ingredients.  It's highly unlikely that the amount of malic acid is 5% or higher in that formula.  What I see above it on that list are almost all cationic ingredients, which are really helpful for conditioning damaged hair, but they're nothing new or unique and wouldn't change it from the inside.\n\nAs for the Omega 9, I have never heard of this being marketed as a bonding ingredient.  [Their website says](https://www.wella.com/professional/en-EN/ultimate-repair/behind-the-science/omega-9):\n\n>With time and all the different stressors, hair loses its natural surface lipids. These lipids help protect the integrity of the cuticle. Omega-9 is a bio-identical lipid, targeting the hair surface. It does not only coat the surface but also penetrates the cuticle and on its way fills the spaces to re-create a protective barrier. This reduces cuticle lifting and is noticeable in a smoother feel, less frizz and less breakage.\n\nIt's true that hair loses its natural surface lipids, this is the F-layer or lipid layer of the cuticle, composed of 18-MEA fatty acid.  Oils can't really stick to hair to condition it unless this layer is in decent shape, because oils attract oils.  However I don't know enough about the molecular structure of oils to confirm whether Omega-9 is bioidentical to 18-MEA.  So far as I know, there's no way to replenish the 18-MEA/repair the lipid layer once it's damaged.

I would love to hear from any chemists who have deeper knowledge than I do, but I think it's unlikely that this product does much beyond what a normal conditioner for damaged hair can do.",

The Redken & L'Oreal acid bonding lines include both a pre-shampoo treatment, which may help protect porous hair through the washing process, and a leave-in conditioner, which may help protect dry hair from humidity.  These products have a higher percentage of citric acid than the shampoo or conditioner (I think it's rare that a shampoo or conditioner could do much to change the bonds of the hair).  Anecdotally, I've read that someone found that this line helped make their hair more humidity resistant as they live in a humid climate, but of course anecdotes alone should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nThe [Cosmetics and Toiletries article](https://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/testing/efficacy/article/21837243/your-hair-on-acid-the-influence-of-carboxylic-acids) I linked to in the other thread is the most technical source I could find, and as I'm not a chemist myself, some of it is over my head, but it's not discussing chelating.  It notes that:\n\n>Glyoxylic acid treatments are now being pushed as an alternative to Brazilian Keratin products,^(3)¬†while a disruptive product claiming to induce new cross-links in the hair is based on maleic¬†acid.\n\nThis article on [the chemistry of different straightening treatments](https://karger.com/sad/article/7/4/265/291632) discusses the use of formaldehyde-free keratin treatments that use glyoxylic acid.\n\nAnd as far as exactly how it works, the C&T article states: \n\n>This mechanism is believed to involve simple steric effects, wherein molecules penetrate hair and obstruct sites where water would otherwise adsorb.\n\nThis seems to be confirmed from a brief moment in [this IG video](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C1qFlgNSgLp/) from Michelle Wong (PhD in chemistry), which is a bit all over the place and because IG videos can't be paused, I have had to re-watch it a bunch of times to fully grog each component, but she mentions that when citric acid binds to the Hydrogen bonds, they're occupied and water can't bind to them.\n\nCosmetic chemist Valerie George has also discussed it on the Beauty Brains podcast, [Episode 312](https://www.patreon.com/posts/episode-312-and-70562917) (starting at 16:42) and although she doesn't go into detail about the mechanics of how it works, she mentions that it's related to \"hair adsorption isotherm\", so you could look that up if you want to understand the mechanism a bit better.\n\nThe C&T article does have citations to other research that you're welcome to look up as well.",

To clarify, I've already tried it in the past, but as an occasional scalp exfoliating treatment, but I didn't see the benefit of using it in hair. I've been a bit sceptical about the bonding claims of the citric acid series and couldn't identify anything that should have a bonding capacity. pH benefits should quickly get lost as the product is washed out, so I don't imagine that it would have much use unless it were a leave-in perhaps? Chelating seems most likely, and maybe they can advertise that as bonding on a technicality. I can buy the acid keeping water out a little bit, which should be a factor of pH, but that circles back to the problem of rinsing out. At the time when the problem is applied, the cuticle is already filled with water, and then it's rinsed out. Then, it's supposed to make dry hair water resistant?

Of course, I want to make sure I won't be damaging my hair in the process or ruining my curls, so I've been doing my research and looking around for my holy grail heat-protectant - one that can tolerate high-heat (around 425 F), has water-soluble silicones, no proteins, and no drying alcohols. I've already found a heat-protectant that I plan on trying soon (Discover Found Avocado Oil Heat Protectant Spray), however I'm still looking for a hydrating, heat-protectant leave-in conditioner to use prior to blow-drying. It's been a long search, and although I haven't found the perfect product I think I've come close enough with some of these. I'm open to some exceptions, such as using Amodimethicone because from my understanding it creates a thin film over the hair, doesn't build on top of itself, and mainly builds in damaged areas in the cuticle. Proteins are something I'd highly prefer to avoid as my hair seems to like getting as much moisture as it can get, but in really small quantities I may be fine. Also trying my best to avoid drying alcohols. So with all that in mind, I'd love to get some second-opinions on these products and which would be the best fit for what I'm looking for. I've left some notes on these, so I hope that won't confuse anyone lol. Any other product suggestions would be highly appreciated.

So, trying my best to recollect my memory here: I decided to go with the TIGI Bedhead Lotion since it was one of the cheaper options and PEG-12 Dimethicone was one of the first ingredients mentioned and the wheat protein wasn't very high up there (also a heat protectant). I only used it once or twice, and from what I recall I couldn't stand the smell and it left my hair feeling dry and not very well protected :/ The Found Avocado Heat Protectant left me similarly dissatisfied when I compare it to older thermal sprays I tried before. It didn't give me that sleek coating I was looking for and it felt like it was absorbing quickly into my hair rather than sticking and protecting. When I get a chance, I'd like to try either the Shu Uemera serum or the Kerastase mask next (if they're still on the market).",

Although it does form a film, this film can't really build up and it's fairly thin. Most conditionering agents aren't actually absorbed into the hair anyways and their benefits come from coating the surface. I can think of very few besides coconut oil and olaplex that actually work by being absorbed into the hair. Overall I don't think it'll change the effectiveness of any other product. Amodimethicone is often mixed with many other conditioning agents in formulas so I can't imagine it would prevent those other ingredients from working. \n\nMore info on amodimethicone: https://labmuffin.com/amodimethicone-my-new-favourite-hair-ingredient/",

Around the same time, I also started taking more biotin vitamins (roughly 6000mcg/day), plus added this shampoo and conditioner to my regimen: https://dslaboratories.com/products/revita-shampoo https://dslaboratories.com/products/revita-conditioner.\n\n\nAfter 6 weeks of injecting 0.5mL of 40mg/mL estradiol valerate weekly, my test results for estradiol levels came back at 852 pg/mL. We thought these were really high, so I went down to 0.3mL/week for the next 6 weeks. My test results came back at 853 pg/mL. I did some reading and found that the biotin might be messing with the tests (https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/fda-warns-biotin-may-interfere-lab-tests-fda-safety-communication). I cut out my vitamins and shampoo/condition for about a week and did another blood test, and it came back at 684 pg/mL. It's better (so there was at least some amount of interference), but everything I read about biotin made it seem like even just 72 hours would clear it from my system, so I was still expecting something much lower? I always take the blood test before my injection on the same day, so it should be relatively consistent.\n\n\nHas this happened to anyone else, or anyone else have similar experiences? What did you do?\n\n\nHow low of a dosage can you go on and still have HRT remain effective? I'm scared the high result will keep pushing my dosage lower and lower, and the fact that my levels were on the lower end when on the maximum amount of pills makes me think it's just other things messing up my test results. \n\n\nJust in case one of these ingredients in the shampoo/conditioner jumps out at anyone as also causing issues (searching around I only found biotin to be an issue), here's what's in them:\n\n* Procyanidin B2\n* Caffeine\n* Taurine\n* Ketoconazole\n* Niacinamide\n* TriCopper Peptides\n* Rooibos Tea\n* Cysteine\n* Biotin\n* MSM\n* EUK134\n* Ornithine\n* L-arginine\n* Methionine\n* Stem Cells Extract\n* Ginseng\n* Copper Peptides\n* Carnitine\n* Lupine\n* Zinc Gluconate\n* Biotinyl\n* Arginine\n* Amodimethicone\n\n\nThanks!",

I never knew about silicones, sulfates and that basically all the ingredients in a shampoo is harmful (*sarcasm intended ffs)* before I go on a rant, here's a bit about my hair.

High androgens.*\n\nNow, I'm sick, like actually sick of seeing everywhere that oily scalps should avoid silicones in their **shampoos** at all costs as it clogs scalp, causes hair-loss, makes hair greasy, builds up etc etc, don't use this, don't use that blah blah blah (mind you I've used shampoo with silicones all my life and never had a reaction, hair's beautiful below waist length) \\~ should just stop washing my hair yeah?? smh\n\nMy current shampoo is formulated for all hair types and has the **following ingredients:** \"*Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, Dimethiconol, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Cannabis Satvia Seed Oil (Hemp Oil), Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract (Hibiscus Flower), PEG-45M, Carbomer, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Cocamide MEA, TEA-Dodecylbenzenesulfonate, TEA-Sulfate, Glycol Distearate, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Mica, Titanium Dioxide.\"*  \n\n\nAs you can see dimethiconol is in the shampoo with SLES, but even if a shampoo works well for me, I get paranoid if it's not clear, like I know it sounds stupid but it's taken a huge toll on me, as I'm taking a holistic approach to managing PCOS, and I love my hair so I've been experimenting and trying out different shampoos, as I can't stick with one due to all the advice about \"don't use this, don't use that\" despite a shampoo feeling good on hair, I feel depressed as it feels like oh there's dimethiconol in my shampoo it's probs secretly damaging my hair and I don't know about it.   \n\n\n**Can someone,** *who hasn't graduated from tiktok university,* **please please tell me, are silicones really that bad for oily scalps??**  especially if it's in a shampoo that has SLES in it? how do silicones stick to **scalp** and lead to buildup? doesn't buildup happen if you don't wash your hair?  in that case anything and everything can build up? Why can't I find specific information about dimethiconol vs dimethicone, my conditioner has both dimethicone and amodimethicone, and no please don't stick a link from labmuffin talking about silicones, I've seen it, she doesn't go through it in the detail I'm looking for, and ps she talks about conditioners, I don't care about conditioners, as my **hair is not oily**, but sometimes dull, lifeless, and limp, sometimes frizzy, but **my scalp is oily.**  And **why and how does dimethiconol stick to hair and lead to buildup if the shampoo has SLES in it which is designed to cleanse and thus gets rid of the dimethiconol? if so, why is it used in shampoos then? and if it's getting cleansed, why would it buildup??**  \n\n\nI like washing my hair regularly, I don't believe in hair training or all that bullcrap, as sebum production is genetic and other factors play roles such as certain conditions and etc ie: PCOS. What bothers me is that people say \"shampoos for oily scalp's too stripping, shampoos for dry hair is too moisturising\" so isn't it better to use a hydrating shampoo that's formulated for all hair types that cleanses and also hydrates and provides a balance??  \n\n\nCongrats for making it to the end...üôèüèΩ",

I ask because she specifically addresses the concern of silicone buildup on the skin.  She talks about how it doesn't create an impenetrable coating in the skin, and even if it did, it would come off eventually as the outermost dead skin cells naturally are shed.  If you're really concerned about scalp buildup specifically, you can integrate a scalp exfoliant into your haircare routine to help it shed those dead skin cells.  Salicylic acid is great for oily scalps because it's lipophilic.\n\nAccording to [this sub's own guide on silicones](https://new.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/), dimethiconol specifically is in Group 2, so it's relatively easy to wash out with shampoo.  I really don't think you have anything to worry about.  But if you're still worried, you could try writing to her directly; she loves to geek out about silicones specifically so I bet she would be willing to answer your question.

I avoided shampoos and conditioners with silicones (and sulfates) for a while. But lately I‚Äôve become serious about growing out my hair and found that some people use silicone to achieve healthy hair. \n\nIt‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve used a shampoo with silicones but I can remember that most of them just weighed my hair down and made my scalp more oily or irritated so i just don‚Äôt buy it. As for now, I personally prefer a sulfate free/silicone free clarifying shampoo that I‚Äôve found during my ‚Äúfree of all things bad‚Äù phase. And yes it‚Äôs clarifying but the one I‚Äôm using - I don‚Äôt find it to be harsh or stripping at all and it‚Äôs the only shampoo i like that makes my hair feel clean and light and most importantly keeps my scalp from getting oily within a day.  i still need to wash every other day but my scalp just feels a lot more comfortable with that shampoo. \n\nI‚Äôve also tried other brands of shampoos that were sulfate and silicone free yet they were making my scalp oily and weighing my hair down?! Sooo‚Ä¶?!?!\n\nBut I do now use a  conditioner containing silicone and it‚Äôs been awesome. Before, I had been using conditioners without silicones and all the ‚Äúnasties‚Äù yet those kinds never helped to truly condition or hydrate my hair and just made the ends of my hair a tangled mess. \n\nMy hair feels and looks healthier than it has in the past with my current regimen. \n\nSo use whatever you feel is working for you and what your scalp and hair is feeling comfortable with. Everyone‚Äôs scalp is different. Just keep a clarifying shampoo or a clarifying rinse on hand!",

        "body": "I'll add that it's a fair question regarding why silicones wouldn't be broken down by the surfactants in a shampoo, what function do they serve.  It depends of course on the formulation, but there is a technology that was developed in the 1980's to create 2-in-1 shampoo+conditioners by essentially suspending silicones in such a way that it will deposit on hair from a shampoo while it‚Äôs being rinsed.  Pantene later applied this technology in their shampoos without calling them a 2-in-1, and now many shampoos use this technology to add some conditioning to the hair even before a conditioner is used.\n\nIt's explained simply here: [https://thebeautybrains.com/2015/11/if-pantene-is-so-good-why-isnt-it-sold-in-salons-episode-108/](https://thebeautybrains.com/2015/11/if-pantene-is-so-good-why-isnt-it-sold-in-salons-episode-108/)\n\nand in more detail here: [https://new.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/lmbrwj/how\\_does\\_dimethicone\\_behave\\_in\\_a\\_sodium\\_laureth/](https://new.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/lmbrwj/how_does_dimethicone_behave_in_a_sodium_laureth/)\n\nApparently guar is often used to create this suspension of the silicone; note that your shampoo contains Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride.",

I've heard so many things about the magical properties of water-soluble siliciones - you get all the benefits of silicones, but don't need to use harsh sulfates to wash them out! And yet for some reason, I have such a hard time finding products that contain water-soluble silicones specifically. You would think that there would be tons of heat protectants out there that take advantage of this, but I just can't seem to find any. I either find heat protectants that have non-water soluble silicones in them, or I find heat protectants that are silicone free, but I don't trust those (I think you need silicones for anything more intense than light blow-drying). I haven't looked at those heat protectants that are $20 for 4 ounces, true, so maybe that's where I'd find a solution. Either way, I just find it maddening that there don't seem to be any decent, reasonably-priced heat protectants out there that use water-soluble silicones and water-soluble silicones only (there don't seem to be many products that take advantage of this period, now that I think about it). \n\nI feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. I do enough heat styling that I need to use a heat protectant regularly. I've found one that has only one silicone - amodimethicone. But I can't be using harsh sulfates on my hair regularly to wash this out so moisture can penetrate my hair. At the same time, I don't think going silicone free (and therefore heat free) is an option for me right now). Hence the catch-22. Sorry if this was ranty. ",

    "body": "Hey guys! \n\nHere's a recent post I wrote on Silicones.  Thought it might be a good read, especially for people struggling with their hair, or those trying more natural routines.\n\n\nSilicones are a very common item found in shampoos and conditioners.  Do you know what they are or what they do to your hair?  We took some time to help clarify things for you.\n\n**What is Silicone?**\n\nSilicones are polymers comprised of synthetic materials used as plastics or resins.  They are found in everyday life in many many places such as bathtub caulk, silicone breast implants, automotive components, cookware, electronics, lubricants, personal care items etc. \n\nCommon names for silicones are Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Methicone, Amodimethicone, Dimethiconol, Cyclomethicone/Cyclopentasiloxane.  Well known water soluble silicones you can find are Cyclomethicone & Dimethicone Copolyol.\n\n**Why are Silicones added to hair products?**\n\nSilicones are added to hair products for a number of reasons.  Primarily:\n\n* Generally recognized as safe/non-toxic, low instances of negative reaction\n* Can make dry hair appear and feel healthy\n* Can make brushing easier\n* Reduces frizz\n* Can make split ends less visible\n* Heat resistant/protectant\n\n**What do Silicones do to your hair?**\n\nSilicones work on hair by coating each shaft/strand of hair in a layer of silicone which basically seals the hair strand off from the elements (water, air, oils, contaminants).  During initial use, the hair will appear to be shiny & healthy, but the key word here is APPEAR.  While your hair appears to be healthy, is it?  We don't necessarily think so.\n\nOver time, silicones (especially non-water soluble silicones) can build up on your hair causing it to weigh down, become limp, dull and lifeless.  Part of the reason for this is because the silicone buildup becomes damaged over time which shows in the appearance of your hair.  Think about it like waxing a floor EVERY DAY.\n\nAnother potential issue with silicones is that when your hair is completely coated and sealed, it cannot receive adequate hydration or any nourishing natural oils, ultimately affecting the overall health of your hair and look of your style.  This is especially damaging in \"Curly Gurls\" or tight textured ethnic hair which is naturally difficult to hydrate.\n\nAdditionally, silicone can eventually become sticky which will attract environmental contaminants (dirt, dust, etc) which further dulls your hair and is overall undesirable.\n\nWhen these things happen, people generally are inclined to wash more frequently, more vigorously and use more styling products all of which simply compound the issue in a viscous cycle.\n\n**Why we don't use Silicones:**\n\nThere are some very valid and good uses for silicone in hair care products.  For instance, if your hair is extremely dry/dull and you have a photo shoot, a water soluble silicone could get you through the day.  Likewise, if you were straightening your hair for an occasion, a water soluble silicone could provide good heat protection to your hair.\n\nHowever, at [ManeLine](http://manelinehaircare.com), we are of the opinion that silicones simply provide a short term solution/look, while fostering long term damage & frustration.\n\nWe believe that your hair can actually BE healthy vs just appearing healthy through limited ingredient, sulfate and silicone free hair care routines.  The natural oils from your scalp can provide the shine you desire without introducing potential long-term problems to your hair, look and style.\n\n",

I used to use Aussie products and for years 3 Minute Miracle was my go-to conditioner and it always treated me well.  About 1.5 years ago I switched to Nexxus Keraphix because I was hoping to add some weight to my hair.  It has always dried really light and fluffy, if that makes sense.

Even a wide-tooth comb is hard as it knots up right away.  I'm 40 years old and this is a completely brand new thing for me.  I have no idea what is going on.  I have used dry shampoo and leave-in argan oil occasionally as well.  I've tried using a couple other random shampoo/conditioner combos to see if maybe it is the Keraphix for some reason, but the results were the same.  I have also been getting knots in my hair while I sleep which is a new thing, too.  Any thoughts or advice are welcome.  I feel like my hair is ruined!

When your hair gets too much protein it causes issues- like making it dry, brittle, and tangly. You may consider a moisturizing deep treatment and switch to a shampoo and conditioner that doesn't include keratin or other proteins. Our hair needs the right balance of protein and moisture or it tends to tangle easily. So of course too much moisture can also be an issue so once you get to a balance you may want to rotate your current shampoo and conditioner with a moisturizing one to maintain the balance. \nI wouldn't worry much about brushing it wet. Use a detangling brush and have conditioner or detangler in while brushing. I've got curly hair and when it's wet it literally the only time curly hair can be brushed so that's how we detangle our hair. But once you get your hair balanced you should have an easier time detangling it when dry, assuming your hair is relatively straight.",

    "body": "# Protecting Your Hair from Heat Damage\n\nProducts that claim to reduce damage to your hair when used during styling with heat tools like blow dryers, curling irons and flat irons are considered heat protection. They can come in the form of sprays, creams, lotions and/or serums. In this post, I break down how to think about the temperature of your heat styling tools and the product ingredients that are best for heat protection.‚Äã (This is the full blog beside a diagram of all the heats listed below, the post is a bit better organized on my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-protecting-your-hair-from-heat-damage.html))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Effects of Heat Damage**The diagram below shows how hair reacts to different blowdryer temperatures. A good blowdryer can be judged by (1) how strong the air flow, or blow force, is from the device and (2) how hot that air can get. The cost of a blowdryer can range anywhere from $20 to $250+, with the more expensive brands often offering better quality tooling that produces those effects to a greater degree. Those factors matter because they can contribute to cutting your blowdry time in half,¬†which is a life saver when¬†you have an 8am meeting to get to. However, more powerful tools are only useful if you know how to use them. Often people mistakenly abuse a higher quality blowdryer by overheating areas of their hair, or by not concentrating on certain spots for long enough.  \n\n\nAt work and at home, I use a¬†[Dyson Supersonic](https://www.dyson.com/hair-care/hair-dryers/supersonic) blowdryer. I frequently use the \"fast drying and styling\" temperature (shown on the diagram below) on my own hair and with clients.¬† The \"cooler drying and diffusing\" setting is more commonly used on curly hair, while \"constant cold\" is for smoothing your blowdry with a blast of cool air right after it's done.  \n\n\nWhen considering the diagram below, imagine what a strand of hair looks like under a microscope (visual [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=hair+under+microscope&oq=hair+under+microscope&aqs=chrome.0.0i433i512j0i512l5j0i22i30l4.2387j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)). A healthy strand will appear smooth, while a damaged strand will appear rough and as though jagged shingles are coating the outside. Those jagged shingles are cracks in the hair's cuticle that are caused by overuse of heat and chemicals. I give an overview of the risks of different types of hair damage in my post [Hair Challenges: Part I](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---dry-hair.html) and [Part II](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-ii---build-up.html). In general, with heat damage your hair is more likely to break, tangle, have unexpected reactions to color, and adopt casts of green or orange by soaking up minerals from your tap water. These conditions make it¬†harder to grow and maintain your hair over time.¬†\n\n**‚ÄãHeat Protection Ingredients**Now that we have a little insight on how heat affects hair, let's look at some ingredients that can help create a barrier from that heat. According to [L'Or√©al](https://www.lorealparisusa.com/beauty-magazine/hair-care/damaged-hair/heat-protectant-for-hair.aspx),¬†their products are \"often¬†formulated to protect hair from temperatures as high as 450 degrees\", which means some products are designed to protect from heat all the way up to the \"danger zone\". There is more to maintaining healthy hair than heat protection alone, but when that is top of mind for you below is a list of ingredients that will help, plus a few to avoid.\n\n**Protein:**¬†found to prevent cuticle cracking¬†\n\n* P/DMAPA Acrylates Copolymer¬†\n* Protein polysiloxane copolymer\n* 2% glycerin (that is a lot for any formulation)¬†\n* Polyquaternium-55¬†\n* Hydrolyzed wheat protein¬†\n* Hydrolyzed vegetable protein PG-propyl silanetriol¬†\n* Hydrolyzed wheat protein PG-propyl silanetriol\n\n‚Äã  \n**Oils and Silicones:**¬†products that disperse heat, found to prevent cuticle cracking¬†\n\n* Sodium polystyrene sulfonate ([stable up to 576¬∞F](https://salonkhouri.com/blog/2018/04/10/whats-inside-killer-curls/))\n* Sodium laureth-40 maleate/styrene sulfonate copolymer¬†\n* Dimethicone\n* Amodimethicone\n\n**Conditioning Agents:**¬†not found to prevent cuticle cracking¬†\n\n* Polyquaternium-11\n* Cetrimonium chloride\n* Stearalkonium chloride\n* Quaternium 70 (Stearamidopropyl Dimethyl Ammonium Chloride)\n* Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine\n* Triglycerides, silicones, mineral oils and petrolatum\n\n*Sources:* [*How Hot is Too Hot for Healthy Hair?*¬†](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2012/02/how-hot-is-too-hot-for-healthy-hair.html)*by the Science-y Hair Blog*  \n[*The Cracking of Human Hair Cuticles by Cyclical Thermal Stresses*](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286849276_The_cracking_of_human_hair_cuticles_by_cyclical_thermal_stresses)*, Manuel Gamez-Garcia*",

I've always WANTED curly hair but just didn't know how to keep the curl that I have when my hair is wet from drying into a frizzy, unkempt mess. Even after sleeping on cotton all night (Satin bonnet arrived today ;) ) and doing nothing at all to refresh my hair this morning, I have better curls than fresh after the silicone-having wash. I'm definitely a believer now, and super excited to see how my hair heals with proper treatment! THANK YOU all for making this information available and for posting such beautiful inspiration of your own amazing curls!\n\nMy first CG attempt was wash with Mane N Tail, s2c with Garnier Fructis Sleek and Shine Intensely Soft leave in conditioner, then Garnier Fructis Curl Sculpting Cream and Aussie instant freeze gel, then plopping in cotton t-shirt for 20 minutes, air drying, and sotc. My reboot was exactly the same but with Not Your Mother's Naturals conditioner (the royal honey and Kalahari desert one) instead of the Garnier Fructis leave in - same other products, same methods, the weather didn't even change.",

Currently use Balea med shampoo. What I like about it is that it doesn't have fragrance and silicones. I have eczema-prone skin so I tend to avoid fragranced products. I am not afraid of silicones but I have noticed that most silicons except amodimethicone cause major build-up and feel heavy on my not-so-thick hair. The problem with my current shampoo is that for some reason it doesn't foam up so I need to use a lot of it which in the end causes dry kinda brittle hair. I need a gentle shampoo, silicone-free (except amodimethicone) possibly fragrance-free (If not, at least doesn't have a very strong lingering smell) that makes hair shiny but still leathers well. Also if it is possible doesn't contain propylene glycol because I am allergic to it? I know I have a lot of requirements but I would appreciate it if someone with similar concerns to mine hadsome recommendations.",

I have fine wavy hair that's a mix of different patterns (can be 2b on the top layers and almost straight at the very bottom layer underneath). \n\nI've had a really hard time figuring out how to treat my hair and have tried all sorts of different tactics (slicone free, with silicones like amodimethicone, low protein, with protein, with heavy moisturizers like shea butter, with lightweight moisturizers, clarifying with a mild shampoo every day, going a week in between shampooing, etc.). The only consistent thing I've noticed is that my hair does seem to dry quickly - I can only dry it with a towel for a minute or two before it feels like all the water is being sucked out - and I routinely have issues with my hair feeling coarse and frizzy while it's still wet. When it's dry, frizz has always been one of the biggest issues for me. Even when I've over-moisturized and my hair feels kind of greasy and weighed down, I can still have problems with frizz.  \n\nAnyhow, during this vacation, I was shocked when I took a shower, put in my leave in products, went to bed, and woke up and my hair actually looked good. It was wavier than it usually is and the curl pattern was more consistent. It wasn't as frizzy either. I thought this was a fluke, but sure enough, every day I repeated the same routine (shower at night, using the same products that I do at home, go to bed) and woke up with hair that looked great when dry. \n\nNow that I'm back home, I'm having problems again with my hair feeling stringy, frizzy, and just bad in general. I had my water tested to see what could be going on and noticed there was excessive chlorine in the water. That's been fixed with a new water filter (at least a month or two ago) but my hair only marginally improved. \n\nHas anyone else here had a similar experience? Is there any way to recapture what made my hair look and feel so good in another country, or am I out of luck unless I move somewhere with very different water or a radically different climate?",

The product also contains several beneficial oils and extracts that can nourish and soothe the scalp and hair. However, the presence of an essential oil blend for fragrance can cause irritation for some babies, especially if they have sensitive skin or underlying conditions like eczema.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Butoxy PEG-4 PG-Amodimethicone, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Benzoate, Coco-Betaine, Citric Acid, Polysorbate 20.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Typical ingredients description and side effects\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Butoxy PEG-4 PG-Amodimethicone\n   * Butoxy PEG-4 PG-Amodimethicone is a type of silicone that is water-soluble and often used in personal care products such as baby wipes. It's primarily used as a conditioning agent, providing a soft, smooth feel to the skin. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, there's limited specific research available on the side effects of Butoxy PEG-4 PG-Amodimethicone. However, considering its chemical structure and similarities with other types of silicones, potential side effects may include.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Although rare, this ingredient could potentially cause skin irritation in some individuals, particularly those with sensitive skin. This might manifest as redness, itching, or a rash.\n      * Allergic Reactions: Although very rare, there could be a risk of an allergic reaction. Symptoms might include severe redness, itching, hives, or swelling.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Sodium Benzoate\n   * Sodium benzoate is a type of salt of benzoic acid and is commonly used as a preservative in many types of products, including food, medicines, and personal care products like baby wipes. It's used to prevent the growth of microbes, thereby prolonging the shelf life of products.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Some people might experience skin irritation from products containing sodium benzoate. This could present as redness, itching, or a rash. Babies have sensitive skin, so they may be more susceptible to irritation.\n      * Allergic Reactions: Though rare, some individuals may have an allergic reaction to sodium benzoate, which could result in symptoms such as redness, swelling, or hives.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Polysorbate 20\n   * Polysorbate 20 is a common ingredient in many personal care products, including baby wipes. It acts as a surfactant and emulsifier, helping to mix oil and water components, and it's generally regarded as safe for use in cosmetics and personal care products.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Some people may experience skin irritation when using products with Polysorbate 20. This could result in redness, itchiness, or a rash. This is more common in people with sensitive skin or those who are allergic to the ingredient.\n      * Allergic Reaction: In rare instances, some people might have an allergic reaction to Polysorbate 20. Symptoms could include severe skin redness, swelling, hives, or, in the most serious cases, difficulty breathing.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe grading system used by EWG in the Skin Deep database is as follows:\n\n1 to 2: Low hazard\n\n3 to 6: Moderate hazard\n\n7 to 10: High hazard",

    "body": "Prior to HRT, I had very little acne and nobody really complimented my skin at all. These days, pretty much everyone I know especially people who haven't seen me in months always compliment my skin and ask to rub my face and even are even surprised that face looks like this even though I have no makeup on (I usually don't wear makeup these days). \n\nI'm not sure if the spiro and feminization were the primary cause of my skin becoming as it is right now though. A little after I started HRT, I changed my shampoo and conditioner, facial cleanser, body wash, facial moisturizer, and body lotion to another product line entirely and as far as I can tell, that resulted in a huge difference as well. I noticed my skin started to change massively only about roughly 3 weeks into HRT and I was only on 50 mg/day of spiro at the time which brought my testosterone levels from 500 [units] to 350 [units] or so (still the male range). After switching just my shampoo and conditioner though, I noticed a massive difference in my hair/skin about 1-3 days after the switch and I seemed to be completely immune to getting acne afterward.\n\nIn case anyone's wondering, the difference in what I was using compared to what I'm using now is that my shampoo and body wash contained sodium laryl sulfate (very drying cleansing ingredient) and amodimethicone (silicone that forms a \"protective layer\" of silicone that lets no moisture in/out and needs a strong cleanser like a sulfate to be washed off). The stuff I use now contain no sulfates or silicones and it feels like the amodimethicone clogged my pores which resulted in acne.\n\nI'm mainly worried that my skin's texture and clarity will get worse than what it is right now after SRS leaves me with no real reason to take spironolactone. Did anyone post op pay close attention to how their skin was after recovery and after they stopped using spiro after a while?",

Also didn't cause make up to oxidize, if that's a concern. It brightened my complexion within 2 weeks of twice daily use.  \nETA: Not sure why I was downvoted for answering a legitimate question. I bought this serum as it was rated 5 stars on beautypedia and affordable for a vit c serum, and I liked it. Not everyone has an issue with fragrance or alcohol.
