I decided to go back to an older foundation after a new foundation broke me out horribly in huge cystic acne lumps (the Fenty one, in case any of my fellow dimethicone sensitive people want to stay away). I was asked by an employee if I needed help, and gave in so I could confirm whether my previous shade was actually the correct match.\n\nAs if on cue, when she was testing out the foundations she started interrogating me about skincare. What I removed my makeup with, washed my face with, used for acne, blah blah blah. It wasn’t really a huge deal for me because I already knew it was worse than usual. But deep down I was annoyed at her asking about if I washed my face, just because I generally associate that with condescension, and felt a lot of the feelings that people have talked about on here when harassed about their skin by Sephora staff. I kind of just shut her down by saying all my shit is from the derm.\n\nIn the end, she gave me a little slip with a QR code to fill out a survey that she said would really help her. She was very eager to help and did help me find my shade, so I went home, still a little pissed off, and filled out the survey. Lo and behold, among regular questions about customer satisfaction, there was an entire *page* dedicated to whether the employee who helped you asked you about your skincare regimen and recommended  you any products. I guess Sephora is really trying to push that aspect of the store, which makes sense considering their marketing as of late.\n\nI’ve worked in retail and other minimum wage jobs before and it is hell. So I feel the urge to go easy on them—they’re just trying to hustle and make a living. If you get asked about your skin by a Sephora worker—it’s probably not your skin, it’s Sephora corporate.",

        "body": "I work at Sephora. It's true that we are encouraged to sell skincare, and build baskets so our store can make budget. However, I've always held the philosophy that your makeup is only as good as your skin. I'm not asking about your skincare necessarily because we're supposed to, but because I truly want you to like the foundation and how it looks on you. No foundation is going to look good on flaky, rough, dehydrated skin. So if you tell me your makeup separates throughout the day, I want to know if you're using moisturizer. If you're always seeing texture no matter what foundation you use or how you use it, I ask how often you exfoliate. So many things tie back to skincare and I am there to help you look and feel your best, which means exploring all avenues that might help you reach that goal. I do not judge, and if someone clearly has acne or skin struggles I never allude to it, instead I gently probe by asking general questions and letting you tell me yourself what your concerns are. If you don't want to talk about it, that's totally fine. I might push a little by talking about my own experiences and how skincare has helped me, but if I get brushed off then I just focus on what you are asking for and that's it.

We don't work on commission at all and we bonus at the end of the month based on the survey metrics clients provided. Metrics we don't make are pushed on us by management each day.  Most of the girls that I have worked with really cherish all of the positive client interactions we have at the end of the day. We love having clients come back to us because the foundation or the serum we recommended worked for them. It really makes up for all the clients that ignore us or snap at us because the store doesn't have the product they were looking for. At the end of the day I go to work to help people and make them feel beautiful, I would hate for any of my clients to feel like I was judging them or criticizing them.",

That being said, I think there’s definitely a way to get in the skin care plugs without making somebody feel like complete shit. Ie if they’re asking about foundation, “This foundation is really great, but I think often the most important factor in getting a flawless base is how you prep the skin beforehand. Do you mind if I ask what primers you’ve tried? What about your skincare routine?”. Idk, it can all be pretty awkward. Basically what I’m trying to say is that sometimes the employees feel even more awkward than you do.🤷🏼‍♀️",

Most people rather be left alone to browse but unfortunately these hard sells do still work on people. I left sales and will never go back for this reason. It really does look to prey on people who are too nice. And this tactic  of being super pushy. \n\nI worked at EB Games and it was worse. We had to do \"three approaches\" on each customer. Meaning we had to approach them once, leave after a bit and repeat 2 more times trying to sell them something and trying to get answers out of them. Then at till we had to offer (convince) them about 5 extra different add ons that costed more money. Alot of people just want to buy their shit and leave. The way we had it set up, alot of customers would get pissed off at us. And I understand why! Company's still don't care. They just want more money. \n\nSales also really does encourage lying. No matter what company's tell you on how they don't. It doesn't matter how good you are at selling something, alot of people don't want to hear it so alot of employees, from banks to Sephora will lie to get their sale and even add on something you didn't ask for (might be an extra couple bucks so you don't notice) . Sales is a disgusting world imo sucks the soul right out of you. I really wish more employees in sales would realize you have to do all this shitty annoying stuff just make someone else's pockets fatter.

They were super hard on us about it and the survey reflects that- we were constantly trying to find ways to ask about skincare that would get us positive answers on surveys. We were regularly called out if a client made it to the cash register without some sort of skincare in their basket. It's obviously annoying to be asked those questions  (and very annoying to have to ask them when you know someone isn't interested) but they are graded on it and their bonuses depend on you doing that survey.\n\nThat being said- I did work with one color consultant who made multiple teenagers cry when they came in for custom makeovers because she was so rude about skincare. \"Do you even wash your face? Are you sure?\" Annnnd those clients complained and got free gift cards. So if you feel like one was super rude, feel free to mention that on the survey.

    "body": "\nNgayong araw i-rereview ko ang Hikari Ultrawhite Sunscreen. Bago pa na-i-launch yung tinted sunscreen ng same brand, sobrang hype nito sa Tiktok, at marami na ding mga content creators sa Tiktok ang nakapagreview dito. Magbabahagi lamang ako dito ng point of view ko bilang isang cosmetic chemist at titingnan at magkukumento ako sa mga technical na detalye na nakapaloob dito sa produkto na ito. \n\nBago ang lahat, binili ko itong product sa legitimate na distributor ng brand sa Tiktok. Marami na kasi akong napanuod na videos nung CEO ng brand na kung saan sinabi nya na pinepeke daw ang product na ito. Gusto ko lang na lehitimong product ang gagawan ko ng review. Saktong sakto din na fresh batch yung dumating kong order, dahil kita naman sa batch code nito na nitong April 2025 lang ito na-produce. \n\nPagkabukas ko pa lamang ng product, ang unang bumungad sa akin ay ang fragrance nito. May kalakasan ang fragrance nito na may floral at milky scent. Maaring di akma ang produkto na ito sa mga end user na may sensitivity sa mga fragrance. \n\nSunod kong napansin ay yung kulay nito. Makikita nyo sa pic na kulay pink itong product. Mahalaga itong property na ito ng sunscreen kaya balikan ko ito mamaya. \n\nKapag inilagay na sa daliri yung product para sukatin ito bago ipahid sa balat, napansin ko na medyo nagtutubig or nagiging runny. Babalikan ko din ito mamaya pagdating natin sa analysis ng ingredient list nitong product. \n\nKapag ipinahid na ito sa balat, lightweight naman ang texture nito. Madaling ma-blend at walang white cast, na ok para sa moreno kong balat. Wala din akong napansin na pilling o paglilibag during application nitong sunscreen. So far, so good. \n\nNgayon, tumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list:\n\nAqua, Glycerin, Octyl, Methoxycinnamate, Dimethicone, Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Leaf Extract, Hyaluronic Acid, Polypodium Extract, Baicalin (Scutellaria Root Extract), Phenoxyethanol, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Carbomer 940 & Fragrance\n\nKung nabasa nyo na yung previous review ko sa Hikari Premium Sun Perfect Tinted Sunscreen Broad Spectrum, lahat ng typographic errors  at maling INCI name ng ingredient na nasa ingredient list ay nandito din sa Hikari Ultrawhite Sunscreen. Ang kinaibahan lang, yung tinted, may Niacinamide at Vitamin E. \n\nNgayon, balikan natin yung kulay nitong sunscreen na ito. Sa ingredient list, wala akong makita na ingredient na naging dahilan kung bakit naging kulay pink itong sunscreen. Walang colorant na ginamit. Sa mga nakalistang ingredients, walang isa jan ang kulay pink. So kung ano man ang nakakapagpa-pink jan ay hindi nakadeclare. Bakit kaya? \n\nBalikan naman natin yung napansin ko na nagtutubig yung product kapag in-contact na sa daliri. Marami akong nakitang users na sa Tiktok na nagtataka bakit daw watery or nagtutubig yung sunscreen. Dahil yan sa carbomer (ito ang tamang INCI names hindi  Carbomer 940). Ano ba itong carbomer na ito? Itong ingredient na ito, kapag ihinalo sa tubig at inadjust ang pH sa 5-7, pinalalapot nito ang tubig at nagiging gel. Ito gel na ito ay inherently na nagbe-break kapag ito ay napadikit o nalagyan ng ions. And since sagana ang ating balat sa ions (mula sa pawis, at naiiwan sa balat kahit natuyuan na ng pawis), expected talaga na magbe-break yung gel at magtutubig. \n\nNabanggit ko na din lamang na kailangang i-adjust ang pH ng tubig na may carbomer para lumapot, bakit kaya hindi nakalista sa ingredient list yung mga neutralizing agents (halimbawa: sodium hydroxide, triethanolamine) na normal namang ginagamit kapag may carbomer sa formulation? Napansin  ko din ito dun sa tinted version ng sunscreen ng Hikari. \n\nIsa pang napansin ko sa magkaparehong sunscreen ng Hikari, bakit hindi nakalista yung emulsifier na ginamit? Papaanong nabuo itong gel cream na ito kung walang emulsifier? Kasi kung walang emulsifier sa mga sunscreen na binanggit ko, hindi mabubuo at maghihiwalay lang yung water at oil phase ng mga unscreen na yan. Baka naman meron, pero di lang inilista? Kung meron man, dapat nakadeklara yan, alinsunod sa Cosmetic Labelling Requirements ng ASEAN Cosmetic Directive. This applies din dun sa mga nauna kong binanggit (yung nagpapapink dito sa sunscreen, at yung neutralizing agent na ginamit para sa carbomer). Paano kaya to nakalusot sa FDA? \n\nNgayon punta naman tayo sa mga product claims nito na may concern ako:\n\n* UVA/UVB SPF 50 PA++++\n* Non-comodogenic\n* Repairs sun damage\n\nItong sunscreen na ito ay gumagamit ng tatlong UV filters:\n\n* Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (ganito ang tamang INCI name) \n* Zinc Oxide\n* Titanium Dioxide\n\nAng Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate at Titanium Dioxide ay parehong UVB filters, samantalang ang Zinc Oxide naman ay UVA/UVB filter. Ang tanong ko lang, papaanong pumalo ng SPF 50 ang rating nito at may PA++++ rating pa, samantalang mas mababa pa ang concentration ng zinc oxide at titanium dioxide sa phenoxyethanol? Assuming na isinagad sa 1% yung phenoxyethanol, ibig sabihin nito, mababa pa sa 1% yung zinc oxide at titanium dioxide. Papaanong papalo yan ng SPF 50 at magkakaroon ng PA++++ sa ganyang kababang amount? Napapaisip tuloy ako kung SPF tested ba talaga to. May pinakita na bang SPF test result para sa sunscreen na ito, pati na din dun sa tinted? Kasi diba ganun ang uso sa mga local brand owner ng sunscreen, kanya kanyang lapag ng SPF test report as part of their marketing? \n\nDoon naman sa NON-COMODOGENIC, please lang, uso ang mag proof-read bago mag-approve ng packaging layout ha. Kasimple-simple e. \n\nSa claim na \"Repairs sun damage\", bawal yang claim na yan dahil ini-imply na may physiological effect (repair sun damage) ang sunscreen na yan, na dapat wala, dahil iyan ay isang cosmetic product. Yung mga claims na ganyan na may physiological effect e papasok na sa drug category, at hindi na sa cosmetics. Paano kaya nakalusot to sa FDA? \n\nFinal words:\nMula sa formulation, claims, at ingredient list, napansin ko na ang daming problema nitong product na ito (maging yung tinted version nito). Sana naman e ma-review ito ng brand owner para ma-address yung mga punto na nabanggit ko dito. \n\nSa FDA naman, wag naman sana basta-basta approve ng approve ng CPN ng mga cosmetic products ng hindi na-a-assess ng maayos. Kaya bumababa ang kumpiyansa ng mga tao sa locally produced cosmetics e.\n\nAyun lang, maraming salamat sa pagbabasa. ",

    "body": "tl;dr Monat is a cult \n\nCont’d in comments\n\n1. It’s a damn cult. You’re told that there are zero excuses...literally zero...for not attending zoom calls, in person trainings, or convention. I missed a really important family event to go to convention because I was shamed so much and afraid of being ostracized by my “friends.” You’re literally brainwashed. \n\n2. Those “friends” in that “community” (cult) you’ve built WILL stop talking to you the MOMENT you shed doubt on anything. The new skincare line didn’t jive with my ingredient-sensitive skin. When I voiced that to my friends, all hell broke loose. The same thing happened to a friend of mine. He had a large following and Monat went as far as to disable his account...because he publicly said he was switching back to dermalogica. \n\n3. If your “friends” are your upline, you’ll stop hearing from them the moment they decide you aren’t going to help them get to the next level. If you do hear from them, it’s because you doing x number in sales, hitting a certain rank, or bringing on new MPs helps them get a new rank or maintain the one they’re at. Better yet, your uplines may not even acknowledge you in public 😬, and if you leave, they’ll tell all of your “teammates” to black list you. \n\n4. Monat shampoo is not silicone free. Let me repeat. MONAT IS NOT SILICONE FREE! They just disguise them with different names. Before the skincare launched, the no list said no PEG and no silicones. However, they put PEG dimethicone in several skincare products, so now it says no cyclic silicones. \n\n5. They brain wash you into thinking Monat will work for everyone and if it doesn’t it’s user error. There isn’t a single product anywhere out there that works for every person on the planet. That’s just not possible because of biology. Different people respond to different things in different ways. Allergies are a thing. So yes, you can in fact break out from Monat. \n\n6. They said you only need one hour per day. Uhhh what? I spent HOURS upon HOURS “working” my business by sending messages to my customers, creating content (because you better not use what someone else made. That’s stealing), listening to podcasts, watching lives, tuning into zooms for “training,” and commenting on random people’s posts on IG in hopes they’d respond, we’d start chatting, and eventually I’d make a sale.\n\n7. Yes, you can make money by only making sales and not enrolling anyone as a market partner, but at 15% commission and the average order being $100 retail, you’d need 200 orders per month to make $3k per month. The products DO last a long time, so people order every 3-4 months. So, you’d need around 600 or more customers to make a living wage off of sales alone. \n\n8. They want you to “be authentic” on social media...but don’t post about your mental health. That’s bad for business and you just need to move on and stop living in the past. WTF?!\n\n9. They told us the lawsuits were all thrown out. There are still valid, active lawsuits against Monat. \n\n10. They tell you that “no” really means “not yet” and you should keep trying. Don’t bring up Monat, but keep engaging so you show up in their feed. Eventually, after seeing how much you love it, they’ll change their mind and sign up.",

They continuously say “you can work this into the books and crannies of your life” and shame you for watching Netflix or mindlessly scrolling rather than working. In other words, the only appropriate form of self care is an oil treatment and washing your hair. Use every moment for Monat. \n\n 12. You better be full faced with makeup, hair done, and have a beautifully curated feed or you won’t make money. \n\n 13. The gratitude initiative, in my opinion, is just another way for them to bring in money. The CEO had bomb ass seats at the super bowl and the whole family took an over the top elaborate ski trip for Xmas. The women are always wearing expensive clothes. They’re the elite. \n\n 14. If it’s not a pyramid, then why are the same people consistently the top income earners but I don’t see them out there recruiting ever? Oh...because they don’t have to because you’re doing all the work for them underneath. \n\n 15. They pride themselves on being vegan and cruelty free but they just launched a ton of paper lanterns yesterday night in Grand Cayman. Even the biodegradable ones are awful for the ecosystem, and I don’t even want to think about how many animals are going to die from them.",

First off, I was legit homeless, living in the woods in a tent homeless, and was volunteering at the library as I was always there anyway \\~ it's air conditioned/heated, free computer use, known homeless hangout in the U.S., and I have always loved the library at every stage of life. So with being there 40 hours a week anyway, I observed Librarians and Library Assistants in their natural habitat and also befriended one who taught me, more than anything, that a Ph.D. certifies you successfully know how to go to school and get a Ph.D..\n\nI saw that particular librarian fighting with a patron, on a regular basis, loudly and in plain view of all patrons.  I witnessed two others fighting with each other, loudly, in front of patrons, while each walked away from other down the length of the library, still insulting each other. The patron-baiting librarian was enraged and insulted when told that shelving magazines and books was part of her job and that she was to do those jobs as part of her employment. She felt her degree meant she was solely to sit behind the desk and answer questions using the computer.  This was a library in a very poor area so the questions rarely needed actual computer consultation. When La Librarian was unavailable, I answered the questions.  My official volunteer position was Computer Coach, which primarily meant handling the ''difficult'' patrons who would not stop coming to the library and bothering the staff with ongoing questions regarding job searches, resume construction, and so on.\n\nThis was not the only library I volunteered at over the years, but it sure was the most enlightening one as for human behavior and ''lofty'' opinions of one's self.  Last comment here - when the male librarian chased a five year old around the children's area, and out the library to the child's mom, because she was stealing the legos.  She had, in fact, brought those particular legos to the library with her, and there was no question about it. The police were called and he ultimately chose to resign.  He would be divine in MLM.",

Trained to take as many pictures as they can and save them for everyday use to make it seem like the Monat Hun is always on the go at events or parties or travel. The trainer literally said she has videos of her vacation on archive to use daily or later in the year to make it look like she keeps flying. the last part that made me laugh hard inside (as I was sitting two rolls in front of the speaker) was when she said...if you have a break up and been home all day crying..post that you are at an event or on a plane or whatever, the people on your feed wont know and they will be curious and want your life and want to join Monat.

    "body": "Welcome back, friends! Yesterday, I posted about [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and today I wanted to pop in with Moisturizers. There's some imagery that this post does well with, which Reddit doesn't lend itself to, but [here is the primary image you'll want to keep in mind for this post](https://skinolog.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/stratumcorneumtoplayerofskingraph.png). \n\nLet's get started.\n\n---\n\n**An Introduction to Moisturizers**\n\n\"Moisturizer\" is a bit of a vague marketing term. Moisturizers do not necessarily add moisture to the skin as much as they reduce or slow the amount of water that skin loses. They're important to everyone who cleanses their skin, whether with water or a cleanser, but even more critical for those with conditions that cause the skin to lose moisture more easily, such as eczema. In short, moisturizers provide a barrier against moisture loss by creating a soothing, protective film.\n\nBut let's slow down a little. Why does the skin lose moisture in the first place, and where does it even get moisture? To answer this, I present to you a helpful diagram of the skin's epidermis.\n\n[LAYERS OF THE SKIN - IMAGE](https://skinolog.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/epidermal_layers.png?w=318&h=462)\n\nYou may remember from Health or Biology class that skin is generally broken into three major layers: Epidermis (or the upper most layer -- what we can see with our eyes), the dermis (the middle layer -- where most of the nerve endings, oil glands, hair follicles, blood vessels, and collagen hang out), and the hypodermis or the subcutaneous layer (where our fat lives).\n\nAs with onions, there are layers inside of layers, but we will be focusing on the layers of the epidermis, particularly the stratum corneum.\n\nThe epidermis is composed of thousands of cells known as keratinocytes. They begin life deep in the stratum basale, where they slowly make their way upwards, propelled by the growth of new cells below. As these cells get closer to the surface, they flatten down, harden, die, and eventually flake away. Some skin does this well, some not so well (dry skin, acne skin, etc.).\n\nThis process is generally referred to as skin cell turnover, and as we get older, this process gets slower and slower. In children, this only takes about two weeks, and in teens it is three to four weeks. Once you're into your adult years, this slows down to a month, and by the time you're over 50, it's closer to 45 to 90 days.\n\nNowadays, we have ingredients that can speed this process up when applied topically, but that's another post for another time.\n\nThe water that keeps these skin cells happy and healthy comes from deep within the epidermal layers and works its way upwards, until it is eventually lost to evaporation, but just like any organ of the body, it functions best with moisture. When skin is broken or it's natural processes disrupted by wounds, burns, exposure to surfactants (cleansers), or extreme dryness (winter), it loses water quicker. That's why doctors tell you to keep wounds moist and covered and you feel the desire to use richer moisturizers in the winter. When you keep even the upper most layers of the skin hydrated, the cells aid in elasticity and the enzymes within the skin are able to function more efficiently.\n\nIn short, moisturizing helps to repair the skin, increases water content, reduces trans-epidermal water loss (water evaporating out of the skin), and maintains the appearance of the skin. They do this by acting as humectants, occlusives, emollients, and rejuvenators.\n\n**Occlusives**\n\nOcclusive is a fancy word for a sealant -- a compound that is generally hydrophobic and prevents water from evaporating.\n\nThey're not typically very appealing because they can feel heavy or greasy, but they are the most effective ingredient at reducing trans-epidermal water loss. This property makes them particularly effective when used immediately after a shower or cleansing, while the skin is damp.\n\nThe most effective occlusive agent is petrolatum -- a bland little ingredient with a bad reputation. It is the most commonly used ingredient in skin care and reduces water loss by 99%. It's able to initiate production of lipids by penetrating into the upper layers of the stratum corneum (\"sealing the cracks\" in the skin, so to speak), and can reduce the appearance of fine lines and dryness caused by dehydration.\n\nThe second most common ingredient is dimethicone, though it is permeable to water vapor, which makes it less ideal for compromised or damaged skin.\n\nOcclusives, when used alone in a skin care routine, are the last step. I personally apply a touch of Vaseline on the driest parts of my face after applying moisturizers and prescription medications.\n\nOther common types of occlusives include squalene, paraffin, lanolin, cetyl alcohol, beeswax, and cholesterol.\n\n**Humectants**\n\nHumectants are kind of like the hydrators of skin care ingredients. They're hydroscopic, meaning they are able to attract and hold onto water molecules. However, due to their water-loving way, they can pull water away from the dermis and cause excessive water loss. This is why humectants are almost always combined with occlusives, like petrolatum.\n\nThe most common humectants are glycerin or glycerol and hyaluronic acid, but there are also hydroxy acids (another post, another time), propylene glycol, and urea.\n\n**Emollients**\n\nEmollients are the ingredients that serve the primary function of filling in the cracks between skin cells. Many times, occlusives can be used and function as emollients. These ingredients are what make your skin feel soft after applying a moisturizer, and are commonly natural oils like rosehip seed oil.\n\nWhile simple, these ingredients can assist in the inflammatory response of the skin, and are very individual. For example, you may notice that your skin seems to act better when you use rosehip seed oil, thanks to the linoleic acid (an omega 6) within the oil.\n\n**Rejuvenators**\n\nRejuvenators replenish the proteins in skin, and include ingredients such as collagen, keratin, and elastin. These ingredients have limited permeability due to their large molecular size, but they can fill a similar role as emollients, filling in fine lines and smoothing the skin.\n\n---\n\n**A Note on Ceramides**\n\nCeramides are a fairly new(ish) breakthrough in cosmeceuticals. They're naturally found in the lipids of the skin, and help to maintain the skin barrier (the function of the skin that holds onto moisture and keeps out unwanted chemicals). In a 1990 study, \"it was found that the level of ceramides was greatly reduced in the stratum corneum in patients with atopic dermatis. It was subsequently concluded that an insufficiency of ceramides in the stratum corneum is an important factor in atopic dry skin. Subsequently, ceramides have been added to many moisturizes used in the treatment of both atopic and normal skin.\" [1]\n\nYou can find ceramides starring in many creams and lotions now, and even at your local drugstore in brands like CeraVe.\n\n**All Tied Together**\n\nWhen I first began resolving my own skin issues, the greatest barrier (and what finally solved my acne) was finding a moisturizer that worked for me. I have several sensitivities and am unable to use a handful of common ingredients as well as a large number of uncommon ingredients. Skin needs are unique and individual in this way. You may find that you need to try many products to find what works best for you, but here are some guidelines to get you started.\n\n* **Look for simple ingredient lists.** Ingredient lists proven by the science are the best kind. Try to find something without fragrance, essential oils, and if you have particularly sensitive skin, without natural nut or plant oils, such as jojoba, rosehip, marula, or almond oil. This also makes it easier to rule out what causes your skin problems, so you aren't fluttering from one product with an exhaustively long ingredient list to another, just hoping.\n* **Use an occlusive on your driest parts.** Vaseline (brand name for petrolatum) is one of the most bland products on the market, and is comprised of one of the most boring molecules around. It is incredibly non-reactive and well-tolerated. Pat it on after a shower, after your moisturizer, on damp skin.\n* **Moist skin heals best.** Keep cuts, scrapes, and scratches under a bandage with a glob of Vaseline. Same for acne spots with an open wound. Moist skin also scars less.\n* **Seek out ceramides.** These crown jewels are amazing for all skin types, but especially skin that is dry or acne-prone.\n* **Don't be afraid of moisture if you have acne.** Many times, we fear moisture and oil as the cause of acne, but as I'll start to explain, skin that is prone to acne tends to lack a lot of the moisture and good fats that keep it healthy.\n* **Hydrated skin absorbs ingredients better.** Remember when I said that skin that is hydrated functions more efficiently? Skin that is hydrated also uses other ingredients more efficiently. This means that you may experience more irritation from topical prescriptions like tretinoin/retinoids, AHAs, BHAs, LHAs, etc. Simply back down on how much you use of these products and celebrate -- your skin is healthy!\n* **Use a humidifier if it's dry in your home.** I have a simple digital humidity gauge in my bedroom so I can track the humidity of the room at any given time. Ideal humidity levels are between 40-60%. When humidity levels dip below this, such as in the winter when the heat is running frequently, I use a humidifier to boost the humidity levels. This is fantastic for your skin and prevents humectants from \"pulling\" too much moisture out of the deeper layers of your skin.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n\n* [Nolan, K. and Marmur, E.

        "body": "Love this post! Nicely explained.\n\nI would like to point out something about your point about humidity at the end. You are speaking about humidity in your home/indoors and you mention that skin is happier at 40-50 percent humidity, but I just wanted to point out that this humidity level is only for indoors (where temperatures are usually around 65-75 deg F), and does not work when thinking about humidity outside. I only make this point because I have dehydrated skin, and so I try to think about the humidity outside as well, and try to take preemptive measures (like a thicker day cream) if I see it’s dry out, but the humidity from the weather report is misleading!\n\nWhen you check the weather report, the humidity it gives you is “relative humidity.” This measure of humidity doesn’t tell you how much water is in the air, it tells you how much water is in the air compared to how much water the air can hold at its current temperature. Air can hold more water when the temperature is higher. When it’s cold out, the air can hold less water. \n\nFor example, there is less water in the air when it’s 100 percent humidity and it’s 0 deg C (32 deg F) outside than when it’s 50 percent humidity and 27 deg C (80 deg F)\n\nI think dew point is a better measure if you want to know much moisture is in the air, or how wet outside it feels. When there is a lot of water in the air, it will start to condense out (dew) at higher temperatures. So the higher the dew point, the more water is in the air and the more humid it actually is, and therefore the easier it is for water to be accessed by the skin. \n\nI have no idea at what dew point skin is happiest though. Generally they say a dew point of 30 or below is when your skin will get dry and cracked. If you have oily skin you probably will prefer dew points 50 or below. They say people start feeling it’s humid and a bit sticky at around 60. For me, I have a high tolerance for humidity discomfort, and since my skin is dehydrated i tend to prefer it when the dew point is at least 60 or higher.\n\nI grew up in a humid place but now live in a dry place, and it’s amazing to me how I look 10 years younger, my fine lines disappear, my skin looks clearer, and I stop itching everywhere almost immediately whenever I visit home.",

I've got a follow-up question - most directly relating to the rejuvenators and ceramides.\n\nI have this general suspicion about health products, that just because an ingredient is \"good for you\" doesn't mean that the method of delivery is at all effective. As a non-skin related example, turmeric has some chemicals in it that are great for brain health, but they don't cross the blood-brain barrier so eating turmeric really doesn't do your brain any good.\n\nSo when I read that things like ceramide and collagen are present in healthy skin/missing from unhealthy skin, I'm not sure whether that means applying a product containing those ingredients is actually going to deliver them to my skin tissue in a way that is beneficial.\n\nIs there reasonable evidence that application through a topical moisturizer is an effective way to deliver things like ceramides, collagen, keratin and elastin to the skin? Or is it possible they just sit on top of the skin and don't do all that much? Are there certain types of products that are more effective at delivering them (e.g. a water-based product vs. oil-based)?",

Sulphate free, silicone free, etc. For years my hair seemed to just get worse and worse, which sucked after having such nice, easy hair as a teenager. \n\nRecently, maybe 6 months ago, I decided to switch back to the cheap stuff. Cheap shampoo filled with sulphates, cheap conditioner filled with dimethicone. The only thing I use that isn’t cheap is my Moroccanoil, which is argan oil and a mix of silicones - but the rest is dirt cheap.\n\nI’ve been amazed at the improvements in my hair since switching. I’ve stopped losing crazy amounts of hair every time I wash it. My hair never tangles anymore. It’s not somehow frizzy but also weighed down simultaneously anymore; rather the opposite.\n\nBoth pics my hair is just air dried hair after washing it the day before - no styling. I still only wash my hair once a week, but nowadays I do a double shampoo every second wash.\n\nMy routine now is cheap shampoo (double cleanse every second week), cheap conditioner, then after my shower I’ll put a bit of cheap leave in conditioner and then top it off with a bit of Moroccanoil.\n\nIf anyone is having trouble with their hair and they can’t place why, consider the ingredients in the products you’re using and whether or not they’re working for you. I finally did after years and I’m so glad I did.\n\nP.S. first pic is two years ago, second pic is today!",

My scalp hates them, though, so I use them only in conditioners, not in shampoos (I need to be careful about that and double check). I remember around 10 years ago, when natural stuff just started coming, I got one of these shampoos, and oh boy, my hair were never so stripped and tangled, because well, all that stuff was based on saponified oils, which are usually extremely drying and stripping for skin and hair.

Some of you may recognize a good portion of this, but I've added some points because I'm trying to make this post as comprehensive as possible.\n\nIn order to determine whether a product is water-based or silicone-based, you have to look at the ingredients. -Cone/-methicone, and -siloxane words near the top of the list tend to signal a silicone-based product. Water will be at the top of the list for any liquid product because water makes it liquidy. It doesn't mean that a product is water-based. Without water, the product would not be spreadable/blendable. For example:\n\nMAKE UP FOR EVER HD Microperfecting Primer Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Aqua (Water), **Dimethicone**, **Trisiloxane**, PEG-12 **Dimethicone**, **Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone** Crosspolymer, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Squalane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Lauryl PEG/PPG-18/18 Methicone, Phenoxyethanol, Ceteth-10, Laureth-4, Ethylglycerin, Panthenol, Potassium Sorbate, Polysorbate 60, Parfum (Fragrance), Argania Spinosa Extract (Argania Spinosa Kernel Extract), C12-14 Pareth-12, Hydrolyzed Algin, Dodecene, Sorbitan Isostearate, Isostearyl Alcohol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Tromethamine, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. [CI 19140 (Yellow 5 Lake), CI 75470 (Carmine), CI 77007 (Ultramarines), CI 77288 (Chromium Oxide Greens), CI 77289 (Chromium Hydroxide Green), CI 77491 (Iron Oxides), CI 77492 (Iron Oxides), CI 77499 (Iron Oxides), CI 77742 (Manganese Violet), CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide)].\n\nSee the bold words? Definitely silicone-based! Again, the water keeps it a more liquid-y consistency so it's easily spreadable. It doesn't mean that the product is water-based. Particularly with primers, I can always tell because it has that \"silicone\" feeling. Now let's look at a water-based primer:\n\nLaura Mercier Foundation Primer - Oil Free Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Isodecyl Isononanoate, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, C22-20 Alcohols, Squalane, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Esters, Phenoxyethanol, Boron Nitride, Silica, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Allantoin Tocopherol Acetate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hamaelis Viginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Cucumis sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Retinyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Polyamino Sugar Condesate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Chlorphensin, Benzoic Acid, Polysorbate 60, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Saccharomyces/Xylium Black Tea Ferment, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Potassium Sorbate, Green 5 (CI 61570), Yellow 5 (CI 19140).\n\nSee how there are no -cone/-methicone or -siloxane words near the top of the list? That means that it's water-based. This primer does contain dimethicone, which is a silicone, but it's relatively low on the list, which means that it contains a very small amount of silicone (ingredients are typically listed in order, beginning with what is in there most and ending with what is in there the least). Thus, because this primer contains much more water (and other ingredients) than silicone, it is water-based.\n\nOil-based foundations are exceptionally rare. After much searching, I finally found one: Alexandra de Markoff Countess Isserlyn Cream Makeup (another is NARS Balanced Foundation, which has been discontinued, so I could not find an easily copy/paste-able ingredients list). Let's look at the ingredients:\n\nWater (aqua), **Decyl Oleate**, **Lanolin Oil**, Propylene Glycol, Talc, Isotearic Acid, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetyl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Fragrance (parfum), Emulsifying Wax NF, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Acetylated Lanolin Alcohol, PPG-12-PEG-65 Lanolin Oil, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben. May contain Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI77492, CI 77499, Ultramarines (CI77007)\n\nYes, water is listed as the first ingredient, but that is to keep the product more blendable. The second and third ingredients (in bold) are definitely oils. Phew! You don't know how many ingredients lists I went through to find that! I swear unicorns are easier to find! ANYWAY, they should play well with silicone-based primers. However, this is unlikely to be of concern to you because chances are you're not using an oil-based foundation (if you are using an oil-based foundation, check your closet for a herd of unicorns).\n\nIn general, you want water-based primers with water-based foundations (or tinted moisturizers, BB creams, CC creams, concealer, or any other base products; I'm just going to keep typing \"foundations\" for the sake of brevity), and silicone-based primers with silicone-based foundations. The two different bases (water and silicone) can cause your foundation to pill when layered on top of each other. In particular, using a silicone-based primer with a water-based foundation on top of it often causes the foundation to pill because the primer creates a silicone barrier. When you try to apply a water-based foundation on top of that, the silicone repels the water in the foundation, and the water in the foundation does not absorb properly into your skin, resulting in unevenness.\n\nPlease remember to moisturize well underneath your makeup (and to give your moisturizer time to absorb fully, meaning your skin should no longer have that \"tacky\" feeling that you have right after applying moisturizer). If you use sunscreen (which you should, especially with summer coming up), you need to let that absorb as well. The base of your moisturizer/sunscreen is irrelevant, because if you allow them to absorb completely, they will not affect makeup application at all. If you begin applying primer and foundation before your moisturizer and/or sunscreen has fully absorbed, they can cause your makeup to break up sooner, which is the opposite of what you want.\n\nAlong the same line, your powder is irrelevant to the base of your foundation/primer. There is no such thing as a water-based powder (it then wouldn't be a powder). If your powder isn't working with your foundation/primer and giving you the look that you want, it is not related to the base of your foundation/primer. Also, not everybody needs to use powder on top of their foundation, so if you're not liking the look, you may consider skipping powder altogether.\n\nAdditionally, you only need a small amount of primer for your face (a very thin layer is sufficient... your face should not feel too slippery). Do not apply too much primer. Water-based primers will absorb into your skin better, but silicone-based primers tend to sit on top of it. Using too much will create a slick film that causes your foundation to slide off much sooner. Remember that it is easier to add more (and I recommend that you add more gradually, little by little) than to take primer off of your face. Over time, you'll get used to the amount you need for your face.\n\nWhile pore-filling primers, such as Benefit Porefessional, NYX Pore Filler, and Too Faced Primed and Poreless, are designed specifically to fill in your visible pores, you can also use any primer to do this (though in my experience, they do not do as well at filling in pores as pore-filling primers, and silicone-based primers work best for filling in pores). Just make sure that you tap the primer into your pores rather than rubbing. Tapping gets the product into your pores to fill them in. Rubbing does not do the same (though you can rub afterward to make sure the surface is smoothed out) and will not give you the same pore-filling results.\n\nFinally, please remember that just because you are using two products with the same base, it doesn't necessarily mean that the products will work for you. Not every product works for every person. You may need to experiment to find the right combination for you. I highly recommend asking for samples, as they are a much cheaper (i.e. FREE) method of trying out a product. You can ask for samples of any product that can be sanitized and put in a small sample jar, such as primer and foundation.\n\nI hope this post has been helpful.

    "body": "Happened upon a guide from a dermatology magazine from ye olde days of circa 2004 which outlined in laymen's terms the core principles of cleansing and moisturizing for different skin types and conditions. These basic key points haven't changed in well over several decades, despite all the gimmicks and new breakthroughs. Thought it'd be an interesting read for both skincare newbies just embarking on their journey and enthusiasts alike. \n\n \n\n# Making the Choice\n\nEvery patient needs to cleanse and moisturize skin properly using suitable cleansers and moisturizers containing the appropriate ingredients. In patients with compromised or sensitive skin, proper cleaning and moisturizing is even more critical. Using too harsh a cleanser or an inappropriate moisturizer can, in many cases, exacerbate certain conditions and can cause contact dermatitis and other problems. \n\nThe plethora of cleansers and moisturizers available today makes it difficult to keep current with new ingredients and their actions — or to guide patients in the selection of these products. In addition, few trials have looked at cleansers and moisturizers and their therapeutic value. \n\n“Dermatologists must understand the ingredients in the products their patients use and what they do to or for the skin. However, the market changes quickly and it is very difficult to keep up,” says Zoe Diana Draelos, M.D., P.A., Clinical Associate Professor, in the Department of Dermatology at Wake Forest University. “They need to keep abreast of this as much as they keep abreast of any aspect of their medical practice by reading journals and going to meetings This aspect of the dermatology practice is just as important as any other since cleansers and moisturizers have a dramatic impact on the skin.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What to Look for in a Moisturizer:**\n\nXerosis occurs when the water content in the skin is less than 10% to 20% — depending on the measurement method, and there is a loss of continuity of the stratum corneum. While moisturizers cannot repair skin, they can help restore the skin barrier and protect the skin as it heals. \n\n“Moisturizers need to stop water loss, decrease itching and burning, and make the skin feel smooth and soft,” says Dr. Draelos. “This creates an optimal environment for healing. Because the skin turns over every two weeks, healing can occur rapidly.” \n\nA good moisturizer should also be hypoallergenic, non-sensitizing, and non-comedogenic. The ingredients in moisturizers are often divided into occlusive agents, humectants, and emollients. \n\nOcclusive agents physically prevent or retard water loss. The most effective occlusive moisturizer is petrolatum. Lanolin, mineral oil, and silicones, such as dimethicone, are also very effective occlusive moisturizers. Applying an occlusive moisturizer immediately after bathing may be an effective way to trap additional water in the skin. \n\nHumectants attract and bind water and can improve the hydration of the stratum corneum. Effective humectants include propylene glycol, glycerin, urea, hyaluronic acid, and pyrrolidone carboxylate (NaPCA). However, high levels of humectants can draw water from surrounding cells and can actually dry the skin further. if not trapped by an occlusive agent. \n\nEmollients soften or soothe the skin by filling spaces between skin flakes and creating a smooth skin surface. They are usually light oily substances, such as octyl octanoate, sesame oil, grape seed oil, or cetyl stearate. Some emollients can also function as occlusive moisturizers. When combined with an emulsifier, the oily emollients are thoroughly mixed with the other water-soluble ingredients in the moisturizer. Emollients are probably the most important consumer ingredient in moisturizers since they provide the smooth skin feel associated with well-moisturized skin. \n\nMoisturizers may contain additional additives such as vitamins E, A, C, niacin, panthenol, peptides, polyphenols, aloe vera, and others. Alpha hydroxy acids, such as lactic acid or glycolic acid, may also be added to decrease cohesion of the excess stratum corneum cells, reducing roughness and scaling. The special ingredients are designed to function as cosmeceuticals imparting unique attributes to standard moisturizer formulations.\n\n Their final efficacy depends on how much of the ingredient is in the moisturizer and how the final formulation interacts with the skin. Despite their benefits, many patients resist using the most effective moisturizers since they often have unappealing characteristics. \n\n“Petrolatum is actually the very best moisturizer available, but it stains clothing, smells bad, and is greasy,” says Dr. Draelos. “Every other moisturizer on the market is trying to achieve the benefits of white petrolatum without the bad aesthetic effects.” \n\nAccording to Dr. Draelos, a good moisturizer should start with an occlusive agent, such as petrolatum or mineral oil, which is not as thick or greasy. It should also include occlusive ingredients that reduce greasiness, such as dimethicone, a type of silicone. \n\n“You might add grape seed, sesame, or some other lightweight oil and emollients, such as cetearyl alcohol,” says Dr. Draelos. “These are oils that can fit between the dry skin cells and make the skin feel smooth and soft.” It is also now possible to synthetically produce ceramides, which are some of the newest occlusive agents to enter the marketplace. \n\nDr. Draelos is excited about some of the newer developments in moisturizers. “The next generation of moisturizers are moisturizers used in a shower. Patients put the moisturizer on in the shower, and then rinse off. This novel technology effectively moisturizes the skin with long-lasting effects and is known as a new category of skincare products known as moisturizes.” *(These are available to us now.)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What to Look for in a Cleanser:**\n\nExcessive cleaning can damage the skin by washing out the natural humectant agents, change the pH value of the skin, and cause irritant contact dermatitis. \n\n“Cleansing damages the skin because the soap cannot distinguish between unwanted dirt and intercellular lipids,” says Dr. Draelos. “Synthetic detergents known as syndets are not as effective at removing dirt, but they do not remove as many intercellular lipids and are pH adjusted. A good alternative is the newer body washes that remove dirt, but leave behind a thin layer of petrolatum, especially if used with a puff.” \n\nWhen cleansing, all patients should use warm — not hot — water and bathe for not more than 10 minutes. Cleansing agents should be spread sparingly on the wet skin and, after briefly taking effect, completely rinsed off. \n\n“When looking for a cleanser, most patients should avoid cleaners with parabens, fragrances and detergents. Patients should also avoid detergents such as sodium lauryl sulfate,” says Leslie S. Baumann, M.D., Director of Cosmetic Dermatology at the University of Miami. “Ingredients to look for depend on the skin type, but acne-prone patients should look for cleansers with salicylic acid, while those with rosacea would look for sulfacetamide.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Acne** \n\nSome people with acne may try to stop outbreaks and oil production by scrubbing their skin and using strong detergent soaps and rough scrub pads. However, scrubbing will not improve acne; in fact, it can make the problem worse. Astringents are not recommended unless the skin is very oily, and then they should be used only on oily spots. \n\nPatients with acne should use a mild cleanser (5% benzoyl peroxide wash), once in the morning, once in the evening, and after heavy exercise. Acne suffers generally have oily skin, but the skin barrier can be compromised by treatment, leading to flaking and itching. \n\n“I recommend skin lubricants in the silicone family like cyclomethicone and dimethicone, which soften and hydrate without oils,” explains Mary Lupo, M.D., a dermatologist in private practice in New Orleans and professor of dermatology at Tulane University Medical School in New Orleans. “Cleansers should be mild if on treatment, but high surfactant cleansers or those with salicylic acid are good for oily and acne-prone skin.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Eczema & Other Dermatoses** \n\nAny skin disease will benefit from a moisturizer that strengthens the stratum corneum barrier, even blistering bullous pemphigoid. Moisturizing with a good moisturizer is also very important for a disease such as psoriasis. \n\n“Since this is a disease characterized by hyperkeratosis, keratolytics can play an important role in its treatment. Propylene glycol and lactic acid can be sole, or integral parts, of treatment regimens by effectively removing adherent scales,” says Andrea Trowers, M.D., a pediatric dermatologist who has completed a fellowship in pediatric dermatology at the University of Miami. \n\n“Plastic wrap, plastic gloves or plastic shower caps can be used to occlude the affected area after application of a keratolytic, resulting in increased efficacy.” Patients with eczema usually have an impaired stratum corneum barrier so they can benefit from a moisturizer that will help replace cholesterol, ceramides, and fatty acids. The only skin diseases that generally do not benefit from a moisturizer are conditions that are skin manifestations of internal diseases such as skin cancer. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Photoaged Skin** \n\nPhotoaged skin is generally treated with retinoids, which can dry the skin, especially during winter. For these patients, applying a moisturizer is helpful. The best moisturizing agent is petroleum jelly, but it is too greasy for most people, though a creamy version is available that is almost as moisturizing as the original. If other moisturizers are used, they should be the cream versions of the moisturizer. \n\n“Patients with photo-aged skin should avoid detergent cleansers with lots of surfactants. And they should look for added emollients like petrolatum to soothe,” explains Dr. Lupo. “Sodium laurel sulfate and many polysorbates can be very drying. Moisturizers with safflower oils and ceramide complexes are good. Humectants like glycerin are good as well.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Ethnic Skin** \n\nPatients with darker skin tones, often referred to as “ethnic skin,” have special concerns. “Ethnic skin is generally no more or less sensitive than lighter skin and all the same precautions apply,” says Heather Woolery-Lloyd, M.D., Director of Ethnic Skin Care for the University of Miami Department of Dermatology. “However, ethnic or darker skin is subject to certain conditions not usually associated with lighter skin, such as hyperpigmentation following irritation.” \n\nIf a cleanser or moisturizer causes an irritation on a fair-skinned person, any redness heals and the skin returns to its normal appearance. However, a darker-skinned individual may be left with dark brown patches on their skin, which is especially bothersome if it occurs on the face. E\n\nExcessive scrubbing and harsh cleansers in patients with conditions such as rosacea and seborrheic dermatitis heighten susceptibility to irritation that can lead to hyperpigmentation. Those patients should use the mildest cleanser and least irritating moisturizers. \n\n“While it is difficult to specifically predict which individuals will be irritated by a particular ingredient, a dermatologist should make sure that patients use products with fewer known irritants,” says Dr. Woolery-Lloyd. “Soapless cleansers are generally milder than traditional soaps and are especially useful in patients with sensitive skin prone to irritation. Additionally, traditional soaps combine with minerals in hard water and can leave an unwanted residue on skin and hair.” \n\nPatients with pseudofolliculitis barbae may find that cleansers with glycolic acid offer some relief. In addition, shaving gels with salicylic acid can be effective against in-grown hairs. However, these products can be very irritating and should not be used for individuals with sensitive skin. Another issue with darker skin is the ashy appearance of the skin when it becomes dry. While not necessarily a medical issue, it is still of concern to darker-skinned individuals. \n\n“Patients with dry, ashy skin will find products with lactic acid or urea to be effective,” says Dr. Woolery-Lloyd. “Because they not only moisturize and hydrate the skin, but they also exfoliate the superficial dry scale.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Elderly Skin** \n\nSince elderly patients do not produce a lot of sebum, their skin is dry and prone to itchiness. As a result, the elderly need to be especially careful about skincare. They should wash less frequently and should avoid cleansers as much as possible, relying almost exclusively on warm, not hot, water to rinse away surface dirt. Mild soap, such as glycerin soap, should only be used for local cleaning of, especially soiled areas. The elderly should moisturize frequently, especially after bathing when the skin is still moist. Bath oil can also be used, but patients must be careful about slipping. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Young Skin** \n\nMoisturizing is very important in pre-pubescent children since they do not produce a lot of sebum, and they generally get dirtier and require frequent bathing, which dries the skin. “As far as moisturizers, individuals with healthy skin can use most of the products. Just pick a product that leaves skin smooth, not tight or greasy,” says Dr. Lupo. “A combination moisturizer and sunscreen is an excellent choice because you can hydrate the skin and have the added benefit of preventing aging skin and skin cancers.” \n\n“Young children with ethnic skin who have dry skin — especially those living in colder climates — can relieve the dryness and alleviate the ashy appearance by using products like petroleum jelly or even vegetable shortening that has been refrigerated for a cooling effect,” says Dr. Trowers. \n\nOlder children often resist this approach because of the greasy feel, but products such as Cetaphil emollient cream can be almost as effective, with better cosmetic tolerance. According to Dr. Trowers, children of all skin types who suffer from atopic dermatitis often have more bacteria on the surface of the skin. More severe cases can be cleansed below the neck with chlorhexidine, or in milder cases with a product such as Cetaphil anti-bacterial soap, then bathed in a solution of Alpha Keri bath oil. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Understanding the Ingredients:**\n\nConsidering the difference that proper cleansing and moisturizing can make to dermatology patients, it is essential that every dermatologist understand the ingredients that go into moisturizers and cleansers — and the impact that those ingredients have on a patient’s skin. \n\n“Good practice in cleansing and moisturizing can make a significant difference for patients with certain skin conditions and as a therapeutic response to the side effects of medications used for treatment,” says Dr. Baumann. “It is very important for dermatologists and their patients to become familiar with the individual ingredients in moisturizers and cleansers and to know what they really do. Without this knowledge, you may not be able to respond appropriately because your patient has come in with an unfamiliar product, and you are unable to offer sound medical advice.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n   \n*Source: The Dermatologist Volume 12,  Issue 6,  June 2004*",

So I went searching for their MSDS to compare the components they contained to figure out which one I should go for.\n\nWell, Every lemon oil/fretboard conditioners I checked (all the big brands; Dunlop, D'ADDario, Dr.Duck, Music Nomad and more) are 100% White Mineral Oil (CAS# 8042-47-5). Stuff that is supposed to make your strings slick too, like Dunlop 65 Ultra Glide is just mineral oil with <1% silicone oil (Dimethicone) added. And the different brands have different colorings and scents.\n\nSo, on to the savings part. Checked a couple of non-additive baby oils, guess what, same exact white mineral oil (CAS# 8042-47-5). Using CAS number is the best way to identify same compounds, as one compound will only have one CAS number, but the chemical and trade names can be plentiful and confusing.\n\nAnd a bottle of 500ml Johnson's Baby oil is about 2$ and a bottle of 50-100ml \"Lemon oil\" is 5-10$. That's a nice mark up, no wonder everyone has their own Lemon oil to sell you.",

There's tung oil and Tung Oil™, and there's raw linseed oil, boiled linseed oil, raw linseed oil with additives, and boiled linseed oil with additives. Only two of the above listed oils are safe to use in very thin amounts very infrequently, the others will eventually polymerize and form hardened shells like shellac. And some of these have been known to cause spontaneous combustion when oily rags are disposed in clumps due to a natural exothermic reaction that occurs as the oil dries.\n\nThis comes at a premium, but [StewMac's linseed oil blend](https://www.stewmac.com/strings-and-accessories/instrument-accessories/cleaners-and-lubricants/colortone-fretboard-finishing-oil.html) is probably the only non-mineral oil anyone should use unless they've been educated properly by a lutheir.",

    "body": "Timeout muna sa review ng mga serum lotions dahil isang panibagong sunscreen na naman ang irereview ko ngayong araw. Ito ang Kagayaku Premium Tinted Sunscreen SPF 70 PA++++. Ang tagal kong hinintay nitong sunscreen na ito bago mai-deliver: inorder ko ng week ng April 21, dumating ng May 3. Uuriratin ko itong sunscreen na ito at titingnan kung worth it bang bilhin o waste of money lang. \n\nTLDR:\n\nHindi dapat tawaging premium ang sunscreen na ito. Tadtad ng errors ang ingredient list. Halatang di dumaan sa review bago i-mass print ang box at tube. Aside sa errors, magkaiba ang IL na nasa tube at nung nasa box. Plus, sobrang sakit sa mata basahin nung text na nasa back panel ng box, dahil sa white font na ginamit. And walang SPF test report. Sayang lang pera nyo sa product na ito. \n\nNabili ko itong sunscreen na ito sa halagang 295 pesos sa Tiktok. Out of the box, ang itsura ng tube nito ay reminiscent sa tube packaging ng SKIN1004 na sunscreen. From the tube, pump, pati na din sa cap nung pump. Pero walang silbi yung pump nito, hindi nadidispense yung laman kahit na makailang ulit na akong nagpump. So, no choice na ako kundi alisin ang pump cap at i-squeeze yung tube para lumabas yung laman. Apparently, masyadong viscous yung laman para lumabas sa pump. Halatang may mis-match sa characteristics nung content sa packaging na pinili. \n\nThe bulk product itself, sabi ko nga e viscous, pero nagbebreak ang emulsion upon skin contact. Yung binili ko e kulay brown, and ang appearance ng product is parang chocolate mousse. Yung amoy nito ay may chocolate gourmand notes, as well as konting floral notes. Lightweight ang product, madaling mag-spread sa balat, may light to medium coverage, walang whitecast, at kapag nag set na sa balat e wala akong nafi-feel. \n\nTumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list ng product na ito. Pinasakit ng IL ng product na ito ang mga mata ko. First, dahil ang hirap basahin ng text sa likod ng box dahil sa white font on top ng light beige background. Kinailangan ko pang i-edit yung contract settings nung pic para lang mabasa yung IL ng box. Second, dahil magkaiba ang IL na nasa box at nung nasa tube.\n\nIngredient list ng nasa tube:\n\nWater, Disodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate (and) C20-22 Alcohols, PEG-100 Stearate (and) Glyceryl Stearate, Polysorbate 60, Octocrylene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diisopropyl Adipate (and) Diisopropyl Sebacate (and) Propylene, C15-19 Alkane, Dimethicone, Titanium Dioxide (and) Alumina (and) Methicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate, CI 77491, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance\n\nEto naman ang IL na nasa box:\n\nWater, Disodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, C20-2 Alkyl Phosphate (and) C20-22 Alcohols, PEG-100 Stearate (and) Glyceryl Stearate, Polusorbate 60, Octocrylene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diisopropyl Adipate (and) Diisopropyl Sebacate (and) Propylene, C15-19 Alkane, Dimethicone, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate (and) Zinc Oxide (and) Polyhydroxystearic Acid (and) Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Titanium Dioxide (and) Alumina (and) Methicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate, Copolymer (and) Isohexadecane (and) Polysorbate 60 Iron Oxides (C.I. 77491) (and) Diisopropyl Dimer Dilinoleate (and) Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate (and) Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone (and) Hexyl Laurate (and) Perfluorohexylethyl Triethoxysilane, Titanium Dioxide (and) Diisopropyl Dimer Dilinoleate (and) Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate (and) Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone (and) Hexyl Laurate (and) Perfluorohexylethyl Triethoxysilane, Phenoxyethanol (and) Chlorphenesin (and) Aqua (and) Glycerin, Water, Gosypium Herbaceum (Cotton) Seed Extract (and) Punica Granatum Seed Extract (and) Glycerin (and) Trehalose (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Fructoligosaccharides (and) Water (Aqua) (and) Phytic Acid, Parfum (Fragrance) \n\nWhoo! Inang yan, ang sakit basahin at ilista nung IL. Sa dami ng mali sa IL nito, hindi ko alam kung ano uunahin ko. Pero dahil nasimulan ko na, sasagarin ko na:\n\n1. Dahil karamihan ng mga ingredients na ginamit dito ay complex mixtures (mapapansin nyo yung mga ingredient na tadtad ng (and) sa pagitan), either tinamad yung gumawa ng IL or just plain incompetent. Ang siste kasi kapag gumamit ng mixtures as ingredients sa isang formulation, kailangang alamin ang % composition nung mixture, then imutiply yung % ng every component ng mixture sa % nung ingredient mixture na ginamit sa formulation. Either tinamad na alamin at i-compute yung exact % nung mga components nung ingredient mixtures or hindi ito alam kung pano gawin nung gumawa ng IL. \n\n2. Hindi ko din alam kung anong trip nung gumawa ng IL at bakit inilagay as 2nd ingredient ang Disodium EDTA (chelating agent) at 3rd ingredient ang Triethanolamine (pH adjuster / neutralizing agent). Ang typical usage rate ng Disodium EDTA is usually below 1% (0.05% - 0.1%), samantalang ang Triethanolamine ay may maximum allowed use na 2.5% according sa Annex III ng ASEAN Cosmetic Directive. \n\n3. Sa tube IL, walang Zinc Oxide. Pero pagdating sa box IL, meron na. So, ano ba talaga, meron o walang Zinc Oxide sa sunscreen na ito? \n\n4. Since tinted sunscreen ito, expected ang presence ng Titanium dioxide, Iron Oxide Red (C.I. 77491), Iron Oxide Yellow (C.I. 77492), at Iron Oxide Black (C.I. 77499). Pero bakit sa IL ng tube at box, wala ang Iron Oxide Yellow at Iron Oxide Black? Yung totoo? \n\n5. Sa IL ng tube, Phenoxyethanol lang ang preservative. Pero pagdating sa IL ng box, may Chlorphenesin na.\n\n6. Sa IL ng box: Polusorbate 60. Polysorbate 60 dapat yan. Pero weirdly, tama naman nung naulit sa Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate, Copolymer (and) Isohexadecane (and) Polysorbate 60 (pero wala dapat comma after Taurate:   Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer ang tama) \n\n7. Sa IL ng box: entry should be Fructooligosaccharides, hindi Fructoligosaccharides. \n\n8. Sa IL ng box: Diisopropyl Adipate (and) Diisopropyl Sebacate (and) Propylene.  Propylene ano? Wala kaming time hulaan kung ano yan. \n\nIto na ata ang pinakamaraming mali na nakita ko sa IL ng isang product na na-launch sa Market. Sa dami ng pera (daw) ng brand owner nito, di man lang naisip mag-hire ng regulatory consultant man lang para ma-check yung IL ng product nya. \n\nNgayon, punta naman tayo sa product claims. \n\n* SPF 70 PA++++ UVA/UVB Protection\n\n* Tone Adapt Technology\n\n* Lightweight\n\n* Anti Aging\n\n* Whitening\n\nSa SPF claims, wala pa akong makita na SPF test result nito from the brand owner, kaya di ko muna paniniwalaan itong claim nila na ito. \n\nSa claim na Tone Adapt Technology, kalokohan yan. Marketing term lang yang tone adapt technology na yan. \n\nIn terms of being lightweight, yes lightweight naman ito nung sinubukan ko. For anti aging, pwede naman, since sunscreens helps with aging, specifically sa photoaging. But since wala pa akong makita na SPF test report ng product na ito, di muna ako agree sa claim na ito. In terms naman ng whitening, wala akong makita sa IL na skin whitening actives sa product na ito. \n\nFinal words:\n\nDi ko alam kung saan kumuha ng tigas ng mukha yung brand owner na tawaging \"Premium\" itong sunscreen na ito. Ni hindi nga nagawa ang bare minimum na i-check ang mga nakasulat na text sa packaging bago magproceed sa mass printing. Sa dami ng pera (daw) ng brand owner, mano man lang na nag-hire ng consultant para i-check yan. Tapos wala pang SPF test report. Sana nagpa-conduct sila ng 3rd party in-vivo SPF test, meron naman nag ooffer nyan dito sa Pilipinas. Afford naman nung brand owner, mayaman naman (daw) sya e. E di sana solid yung claim nyang SPF 70 PA ++++.\n\nHindi ko alam kung seryoso ba talaga yung brand sa paglaunch nitong product na ito o nagpapapansin lang, kasi sa buong pagwowork ko sa cosmetics industry, ngayon lang ako naka-encounter ng ganitong klase ng product na hindi ko mawari kung pinag isipan ba o napagtripan lang. \n\nSorry, pero first time ko sasabihin to sa pagrereview ko: Wag kayo magpabudol sa product na to. Masasayang lang pera nyo, marami pang ibang sunscreen jan na mas maganda. \n\nAyun lang. Maraming salamat sa pagbabasa. At laging maging mapanuri sa mga binibili at balak nating gamitin na products.

    "body": "Hello all! So I was answering a question on r/AsianBeauty, but I thought maybe it will help some other people out who is dealing with dehydrated skin.\n\nSeveral years ago, I was a dumbass and used vitamin c crystals and mixed with water and used that for my \"vitamin c serum\" and completely overexfoliated my skin/got a chemical burn basically. And before and after that too, I thought exfoliating more was better (using AHA/glycolic acid/lactic acid), and did that everyday, which caused my skin barrier to get reck'd.\n\nIt took me a good year/year-and-a-half to fix my skin. This is what worked for me personally:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what I do is use a very gentle, non-foaming cleanser (I use [LRP Gentle Hydrating](https://www.amazon.com/Roche-Posay-Toleriane-Hydrating-Gentle-Cleanser/dp/B01N7T7JKJ/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538877830&sr=8-1&keywords=la%2Broche%2Bposay%2Bhydrating&th=1)) and while my face is still wet, put on all my hydrating toners and serums. Then go into lotions and creams RIGHT AWAY. Putting on occlusives right away after you wash and put on humectants is super important. Otherwise they can actually dry your skin out more.\n\nWhen my skin was SO full of pain, from extremely dry, tight skin and irritated acne-like cysts everywhere, the only thing that didn’t hurt like a mf was Vanicream. It took me hundreds of dollars and tons of trial and error and babying my skin to get it back to normal. Now I can use AHA, azelaic acid, vitamin c, and even tretinoin and hydroquinone without a problem!!!\n\nNo one or two products fixed my dehydrated skin. It took a TON of research over the years learning which ingredients were the most healing, moisturizing, how they work, etc.. And an entire routine around hydrating and moisturizing as much as possible. \n\n**I always make sure to include ingredients like:** panthenol (derivative of vitamin b5), allantoin, urea (a HUGE factor in getting my skin back to normal), hualuronic acid, glycerin, aloe, colloidal oatmeal, ceramides (important!!!), niacinamide (especially useful for brightening and healing your skin), petroleum (studies show that there is NOTHING out there that reduces transepidermal water loss like petroleum can. I tried to be all \\~natural is better\\~ for a while, but realized it wasn't doing anything to help fix my skin), etc.\n\nAnd not just adding these helped fix my skin, but **leaving things out** was a YUGE step in finally letting my skin heal. I avoid these like the plague: fragrance, natural (essential oils) or synthetic, alcohol anywhere other than sunscreen, sodium lauryl sulfate (sodium LAURETH sulfate is the gentler one, but I avoid that for my face too anyways. Surfectants can be aided to be milder by adding cocamidopropyl betaine), **LAY OFF all acids** until my skin could handle them (interestingly enough, vitamin c serum actually helped my skin hold more water instead of hurting me), and things that I know irritate my skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Things that were/are biggest contributors of keeping my skin moist and hydrated, in no particular order:**\n\n[**Thayers Unscented Alcohol-Free Witch Haze**l](https://www.amazon.com/Thayers-Alcohol-free-Unscented-Witch-12-oz/dp/B0045PCAI6/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871279&sr=8-1&keywords=thayers+unscented) \\- the first thing that goes on my skin after washing. It's just water, aloe, glycerin and witch hazel. It's so simple but idk why my skin likes it so much, lol. It's HG for me.\n\n[**Hadalabo Premium Lotion**](https://www.amazon.com/Hadalabo-Skin-Institute-hyaluronic-solution/dp/B013HHJV0C/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871410&sr=8-1&keywords=hadalabo+premium) \\- HG, must have. **Hyaluronic acids**, urea, algae.

(People demonize silicones, but they are not bad ingredients. They are actually really helpful in keeping in moisture, providing slip, and smooth feel for skin and hair. And no, they don't prevent other things from reaching the skin. [More on silicones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXHA7_dBRJY&t=12s).)

You can use both.\n\nAnd of course, [**CeraVe Moisturizing Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Cream-Daily-Moisturizer/dp/B00TTD9BRC/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871829&sr=8-3&keywords=cerave+cream) \\- **ceramides, cholesterol, must have skin-identical lipids** that dehydrated skin lacks, hyaluronic acid, petrolatum, dimethicone. This by itself didn't help a whole lot, but with an army of all the different gentle, soothing things, it helped tremendously. There are lots of other \"golden ratio\"/fragrance-free ceramide stuff out there, CeraVe isn't the only one. Some of them are: [Stratia Liquid Gold](https://www.stratiaskin.com/products/liquid-gold), [Meishoku CeraColla gel](https://www.ebay.com/itm/JAPAN-MEISHOKU-CERACOLLA-MOISTURIZER-CREAM-50g-FACE-SKIN-CARE/173351832927?epid=1541103247&hash=item285c930d5f%3Ag%3AjbkAAOSweEFbFoJ-&LH_BIN=1) (they have toners as well), [Superdrug Hydrating Serum](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face-Skin-Care/Face-Serums/Superdrug-Simply-Pure-Hydrating-Serum-50ml/p/342700), [Curel Fragrance-Free lotions](https://www.amazon.com/Cur%C3%A9l-Fragrance-Comforting-Lotion-Sensitive/dp/B00171ETM6?th=1), [Ziaja Med Atopic Dermatitis Regenerating Face Cream](https://yanca.co.uk/product-eng-16098-Ziaja-Med-AD-Atopic-Dermatitis-Regenerating-CREAM-oiling-the-skin-atopic-for-infants-children-and-adults-50ml-5901887027942.html), among many others.\n\n[**CeraVe PM**](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Facial-Moisturizing-Lotion-Lightweight/dp/B079H99466/ref=sr_1_1_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1538872080&sr=1-1&keywords=cerave+pm)\\- same as the cream, but much, much lighter and has 4% **niacinamide** I believe. Niacinamide has been key to helping my dry-ass skin. It does SO many things. Heals and mends, fades spots,etc. etc. I DIY 6% niacinamide and 5% **n-acetyl glucosamine** to boost the niacinamide even further. (Commercial version [Skinlex 10% Niacinamide Serum](https://www.skinlex.com/product/10-niacinamide-serum-60ml/)) But you can find this ingredient in loads of Asian Beauty things and Olay products. Make sure the Olay stuff is fragrance-free if you get them. I like the [Olay Anti-Aging Face Cream](https://www.amazon.com/Olay-Anti-Aging-Moisturizer-Micro-Sculpting-Fragrance-Free/dp/B007M81B4M/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872043&sr=8-3&keywords=olay+fragrance+free) a lot. It really helps refine texture, as well. You can use the CeraVe moisturizing lotion if you for some reason can't tolerate niacinamide, but want something lighter than the cream. Really, any one of CeraVe products is good, they have loads.\n\n[**Aquaphor Healing Ointment**](https://www.amazon.com/Aquaphor-Advanced-Therapy-Ointment-Protectant/dp/B0107QPFBU/ref=sr_1_5_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872144&sr=8-5&keywords=aquaphor) \\- SLUG LIFE is a MUST if you have dehydrated skin. You can use Cerave healing ointment too, but it's redundant if you use the cream or lotion. It's not as occlusive as aquaphor. Aquaphor isn't just a more pricier Vaseline as people suggest. It does have white petrolatum that is oh-so helpful, it also has healing ingredients like panthenol and bisobolol, and also lanolin alcohol and glycerin for humectants.\n\nIf you wanna go a step further and go super saiyan, and you aren't sensitive to lanolin, you can use [**Lasinoh Lanolin**](https://www.target.com/p/lansinoh-hpa-lanolin-tube/-/A-92544) before or after Aquaphor. I can't stand the smell of lanolin, but this one is medical-grade and doesn't have a smell. Lanolin is SUPER helpful because of it's crazy humectant properties but it also acts as an occlusive.\n\nFor just uber **Panthenol** healing, you can get something that stars it as the main star ingredient, like [**DML Forte Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/DML-Forte-Panthenol-4-Ounces/dp/B000052YN6/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872923&sr=8-3&keywords=forte+cream) or [**Timeless Skin Care Vitamin B5 Serum**](https://www.timelessha.com/products/vitamin-b5-serum-1-oz)**.** I don't use the cream anymore, but I do still use the serum. It looks expensive, but if you get the refill sale, it's about $7/oz (this is the price for me in the U.S.). I HIGHLY recommend their [vitamin c, e, ferulic acid serum](https://www.timelessha.com/products/20-vitamin-c-e-ferulic-acid-serum-1-oz) as well when your skin can handle it. It works out to **about $8 an ounce** if you get it during refill sale. It stays good for a while in the fridge. I wrap it in foil to keep more light out and transfer some to a 1 oz dropper bottle for using it in my bathroom. It gives glow to your skin like ***NOTHING ELSE***, and boosts your sunscreen (the antioxidants slow the degradation of sunscreen ingredients) and has helped me with water retention. If you can't get it on refill sale, use the HotandFlashy (I also recommend her Youtube channel) code hf5off to get $5 off. It's a forever coupon code.\n\n**Urea** is **SO, SO,** **SO** helpful for healing dehydrated skin. It's an amazing humectant but also a mild exfoliator if you have a high enough %. [**Eucerin 5% Urea Face Cream**](https://us.feelunique.com/p/eucerin-dry-skin-replenishing-face-cream-night-5-urea-50ml?utm_source=googlebaseus&utm_medium=gen&gclid=eaiaiqobchmi4cftgp3z3qivc39-ch3qhgiheakyaiabegjud_d_bwe&gclsrc=aw.ds&curr=USD) is awesome for this. I don't use that anymore simply because it's more of a hassle to get (not available in the U.S.). My skin looks AMAZING with the [**TriDerma MD Eczema Fast Healing Cream**](https://www.walmart.com/ip/TriDerma-MD-Eczema-Fast-Healing-Face-and-Body-Lotion-with-Bonus-Tube-4-2-oz/21656991) used as a sleeping pack. It's full of skin-healing goodies, like urea (of course), 1.5% Colloidal Oatmeal, aloe, allantoin, arnica extract (a flower thingy that helps heal wounds), beeswax (beeswax and lecithin have great skin-identical components much like ceramides), shea butter, zinc and sodium PCA, and squalane.\n\n**Squalane** is another skin-identical ingredient that you can incorporate into your skin care. I use [this](https://www.timelessha.com/products/squalane-100-pure) one for now, but you can also get the oil at [gardenofwisdom.com](https://gardenofwisdom.com) or [lotioncrafter.com](https://lotioncrafter.com). The GoW one is a little bit more thinner more astringent-feeling to me for some reason than Timeless's.\n\nAnd while you're at it, mix in some other healing oils that help heal skin. Linoleic acid is very important in skin health and wound healing. Oils that tend to be high in these go off faster, however. So you may want to keep them in the fridge. Add in 1% mixed tocopherols (vitamin e) to extend the shelf life of your oils. I like hemp seed, wheatgerm, chamomile/calendula, rosehip oils (can aggravate acne if you're acne-prone). My choice of oils for my facial oil serum: 50% borage seed oil (the best healing), 29% squalane oil, 10% seabuck thorn BERRY oil (very different fatty acid profile to the seed oil), and 10% pomegranate (filled with antioxidants), 1% mixed tocopherols.\n\nSomething that really helps is layering a ton of humectants/watery steps in my routine. You can experiment with this, but right now I'm using the Thayers witch hazel, my vitamin c serum, timeless vitamin b5 serum, [**innisfree aloe gel**](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Innisfree-Aloe-Revital-Soothing-Gel-300ml/302699871225?epid=4002960484&hash=item467a517bf9:g:gy4AAOSwsTday~0A) (unscented, aloe, centella stuff), CosRX Snail, and Hadalabo Premium. I plan to get [Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495) (way cheaper on eBay- like \\~$12).\n\nYou don't **need** a shit load of expensive things to heal dehydrated skin. In fact, a lot of the expensive stuff I see are filled with tons of unnecessary, possibly skin irritating plant extracts and essential oils, super fragranced. Many people go, oh it's fine bc it doesn't irritate my skin, but it's not just \"I'm sensitive to this\" vs \"I'm not\". It's likely that you can develop an allergy or sensitivity to a certain ingredient the longer you use it.  Like how some people develop sensitivity to latex after using eyelash glue with it in it for a while, or people developing sensitivity with lavender after prolonged exposure to the essential oil or something.\n\nAnyway, I hope that was helpful to anyone out there who struggled like I did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: Also, I realized throughout my journey and research, a lot of things that look like \"break outs\", pimples, acne, aren't actually acne. Yeah, you can have acne due to bacteria or fungus or whatever else, but the stuff I'm talking about isn't really acne. Inflammation doesn't just manifest as rashes and thelike. A lot of things that look like acne are actually your skin saying \"no, this is irritating! Get it off me!\", like after you try a new thing for example. But that doesn't mean it will irritate it forever. You can use things that used to irritate your skin after your barrier heals. But some things you may be sensitive to forever..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDITED TO ADD 06/26/2019: AMINO ACIDS are also very important! They make up 40% of our stratum corneum (according to Susan from swiftcraftymoney)! If you want to fix your barrier, you want ingredients like amino acids, sodium PCA, sodium lactate, urea, and sugars like glycerin, fructose, what-have-you! For fatty acids, you want things like linoleic acids, oleic acids, and linolenic acids. Beeswax, lecithin, and lanolin are all great for rebuilding your barrier.\n\nI have not tried this, but The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA is a really good product with all of these NMFs. A pricy one is Paula's Choice Omega+ Complex (the serum, the moisturizer is okay too, but the serum has a lot more skin rebuilding goodies).",

I'm gonna switch out those two for something else because I love those creams and would like to have the choice to use it.\n\nThe La Roche Posay cleanser actually washes off clean, unlike the CeraVe Hydrating.\n\n(For people who are worried about parabens and hydroquinone, there is no need, we eat FAR more parabens and hydroquinone than we would ever put on our skin. Hydroquinone is not \"banned\" in other countries. It's just prescription-only because it's a very strong active so governments decided that people will need to use it under a doctor's supervision to avoid abuse.)",

Would it be: \n\nAM:\n\nWash ( I use Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser)\nThayer’s Alcohol Free Witch Hazel with Aloe\nHada Labo Premium\nEucerin Facial Cream with 5% Urea\n\n(All applied with no wait time, then just wait after to put on sunscreen and makeup?)\n\nPM: \n\nSame routine as above but finish with a thick layer of Aquaphor Healing Ointment\n\nThank you again for making this post. Any response would be greatly appreciated!",

        "body": "hey this post is a few weeks old but hopefully you can help me a bit; im also a dumbass and i recently fucked up my skin with overexfoliation. i thought my skin was sensitive before, but holy cow, it was nothing compared to how its been the past few days. it feels dry and irritated in a way that it's never felt before (i'm typically oily/acne-prone but it seems very dehydrated now)\n\nat the moment, i can't seem to tolerate any sort of fragrance or alcohols (including fatty alcohols). i had a lot of moisturizing steps in my previous routine, but they all had fragrance of some sort,so today i went to square one and tried to start a new routine. i've tried a few cerave lotions before and they didn't work well for me, so today i picked up cetaphil moisturizer (face + body) but that seems to irritate me a bit too. \n\nSo right now, I'm using a hyaluronic acid serum, aquaphor, and carrier oils that are high in linoleic acid (I happened to have black currant seed and grapeseed oils; they've been sitting in the closet for awhile but they smell and feel fine... and I picked up some \\[toasted\\] pumpkin seed oil, but its made for cooking and i'm not sure if there's a noticeable difference between this and others marketed for skin/hair care...)\n\nOH, and what's been the most soothing has been putting honey (mixed with a carrier oil) on my face. I picked up some vegetable glycerin to mix with the honey and I'm going to try that tomorrow. But as I've been trying to research this stuff, I've read some things about how using too much glycerin can make your skin drier? Honestly, I'm so overwhelmed and confused.\n\nI'd love to incorporate more moisture layers into my new routine, because I definitely feel like my moisture barrier is damaged and I'm trying not to freak out. I'm hoping it won't take me super long to recover, since it's really just the past week that I went overboard and hurt my skin. But who knows, maybe I have made my skin upset over time with fragrances and actives over time :/\n\nhow did you go about introducing new products when your issue started? I want to start using the cetaphil moisturizer if possible, and other products with ceramides, urea, etc etc BUT i can't seem to find any that are totally free from the ingredients that seem to be irritating me now... I dont want to buy products that will just sting and irritate me further, but I also don't want to prolong healing by not giving my skin everything it needs?\n\nsorry this is so long ashdsgkhflj thank you if you read this far\n\nEdit/update: I can tolerate the cetaphil Moisturizer now and it helps me feel hydrated, but I’ve started breaking out with some whiteheads, which is atypical for me (usually I get cystic pimples and CCs)",

Sunscreen reviews on SCA have been incredibly helpful during this process, so I'd like to give back to the community by providing some content myself.\n\nThis is a comparison review of two American sunscreen options:\n\n* cult favorite [**Supergoop!

I picked up the Kroger dupe as well to compare for \"fun\".

Glow Oil SPF 50](https://supergoop.com/products/sun-defying-sunscreen-oil-with-meadowfoam) (5.0 oz for $38.00 / $7.60 per oz). I am not planning on trying either of these myself, so if you have tried these, please share your thoughts for us!\n\n# 🌞 Review\n\n**PROCESS**\n\nI have been using both of these intermittently for the past couple of weeks. I also did a direct comparison one day where I applied Supergoop on one half of my face and Kroger on the other.\n\nI did not purchase a full size of the Supergoop, so feel free to take this as my \"initial impressions\", as the Supergoop sample size only provides about 8 applications using the 1/4 tsp rule. (If they're available, I prefer to try sample sizes of the products I'm considering before committing the counter space and the ca$h to full-size versions.)\n\n**Relevant about me and my skin:** Female, late 20s. Relatively pale. My skin is oily but loves hydration. No known ingredient sensitivities, skin is relatively clear except for occasional hormone-induced breakouts. Other skin concerns: mild redness, managing pore appearance and sebaceous filaments, fading hyperpigmentation and previous sun damage.\n\n**Since this is a sunscreen review, my current morning routine may be helpful, too:** Rinse face with water, pat dry. Timeless Vit C 20% + E + Ferulic. The Ordinary Caffeine 5% + EGCG under eyes. Hydrating serum if the mood strikes. Sunscreen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**APPLICATION**\n\n* **See photos:** [Packaging](https://i.imgur.com/mo8jhT5.jpg) | [Dispensed onto my arm](https://i.imgur.com/8clDq0R.jpg)\n* The Kroger formula does appear darker when coming out of the tube, but it is not actually tinted. Both sunscreens do not have any noticeable tint upon application for me.\n* They both have a similar gel texture, similar to...buttery Neosporin, in a non-gross way? The gel is not runny or goopy, but quite easy to spread as it glides easily over the skin. No issues with pilling, even upon reapplication. Easy to apply the recommended 2mg/cm^(2) \"dosage\" (\\~1/4 tsp).\n* Both make my hands feel weirdly greasy after applying for a bit, even after washing.\n* Neither have a distinct scent to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LOOK & FEEL**\n\n* **See photos:** [Immediately after application](https://i.imgur.com/safMkZr.jpg) | [10 minutes after application](https://i.imgur.com/ydlue5M.jpg)\n* Once applied, both the Supergoop and Kroger look essentially identical on my face. No whitecast whatsoever. Both have the signature \"velvety finish\" that Supergoop is known for, which is neither dewy/shiny nor mattifying.\n* Thanks to the silicones in these formulas, both provide a very slight smoothing effect. The Unseen has been described as [similar to the Smashbox Photo Finish Primer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sephora/comments/ghcihy/supergoop_unseen_sunscreen_spf_40_reviews_and_the/). I rarely wear a full face, so I did not test how these wear under makeup.\n* They both feel very soft and almost weightless on the skin. Both are quite moisturizing, which I appreciate since I prefer to have sunscreen double as my AM moisturizer.\n* Despite feeling quite light on my face, I find that both sunscreens take an annoyingly long time to \"set\" after application. The Kroger sunscreen dries more slowly than the Supergoop and feels a bit heavier to the touch, which to me is the only notable difference between the two. (Weirdly, this isn't noticeable in terms of how the sunscreen feels on my face – I'm only aware of it when I happen to touch my face with my hands, if that makes sense.) The Supergoop seems to finally mostly set after about two hours; the Kroger takes about three. In the meantime, it seems like there is still some malleability to the sunscreen finish. I wonder how susceptible the coverage is to getting disrupted up if I happen to touch my face.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PROTECTION & PERFORMANCE**\n\nPlease take the following with a grain of salt, as these are just my personal musings. I'm not a dermatologist or cosmetic chemist, I'm just a random person on the internet with skin.\n\n**UVA**\n\n* Since these are both American sunscreens, we already know that UVA protection is relatively lacking due to the abysmal selection of FDA-approved sunscreen filters. (For those not familiar with UVA protection ins-and-outs, [I enjoy this breakdown from LabMuffin](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-feature-why-you-should-protect-yourself-from-uva/).)\n* I emailed Supergoop and Kroger last week requesting current PPD ratings and both said they couldn't provide this info. Here's [Supergoop's response](https://i.imgur.com/KsL1tIA.png) and [Kroger's response](https://i.imgur.com/C33WWG4.png). \n* Supergoop [lists the Unseen as PA+++](https://thebrightside.supergoop.com/pa-sunscreen-rating-system/), so we can assume the PPD is somewhere [between 8-16](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-feature-why-you-should-protect-yourself-from-uva/#:~:text=PA%20is%20a%20similar%20concept,2number%20of%20plus%20signs.). They did actually provide PPD ratings at one point – [per this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/brih2q/i_emailed_supergoop_about_ppd_ratings_sun_care/) from May 2019 that lists Supergoop! Unseen as PPD 9.9 – but this was pre-formulation (that removed octinoxate at the end of 2019).\n* Without confirmation from Kroger, I am assuming the PA rating for the Invisible Gel is similar to the Unseen Sunscreen. Both contain [avobenzone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyl-methoxydibenzoylmethane), the only FDA-approved chemical filter that provides proper protection across the entire UVA range, but it is not photostable (degrades quickly with exposure to sunlight). The Kroger Invisible Gel does have a higher concentration of [octocrylene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/octocrylene), which is supposed to help stabilize avobenzone, but I am absolutely *not* qualified whatsoever to say if this actually results in improved UVA protection.\n* For some peeps, PA+++ is far too low of a level for UV protection. I feel like I'm personally in this category at this point in my Great Summer of Sunscreen Experimentation – especially on days that I'm going to be outside for long periods, I want a sunscreen that gives me better overall protection. \n\n**UVB**\n\n* Both sunscreens are SPF 40.\n* I did not notice any visible burning while wearing either sunscreen, but I also didn't use them on days when I was outside during peak sun exposure times.\n\n**Ingredient sensitivities**\n\n* Neither of these sunscreens caused breakouts or irritation, but my skin is not very sensitive in general. For those sensitive to chemical filters or silicones, these may not be ideal picks for you. Both are fragrance-free, however the Kroger does contain [citrus peel oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citrus-aurantium-dulcis-peel-oil), which could also be problematic for some.\n* Those with sensitive eyes may want to exercise caution when applying the Kroger Invisible Gel, as I did experience some minor irritation one day when I had liberally applied close to my eyes and got a bit sweaty. I haven't noticed this much with the Supergoop, but I'm not sure why – it could be because of the formulation differences, because I happened to not apply it as close to my eyes, or because I just simply didn't apply sweat as much on the days I wore the Supergoop.\n\n# 🌞 Conclusion\n\n**I'd recommend the Kroger Invisible Gel as a budget-friendly pick for Americans who currently love or want to try Supergoop! Unseen, but don't want to pay Supergoop prices.**\n\nIf you are willing to compromise just slightly on texture to pay literally *one fifth of the price per ounce*, give the Kroger a try so you can slather yourself in velvety sunscreen without emptying your wallet. For those with sensitivities to chemical filters or silicones, or who don't like the primer-esque texture, this is probably one to skip.\n\nYou're kind of prioritizing cosmetic elegance over higher UVA protection with both options, but this may be somewhat unavoidable for those who don't want to deal with sourcing foreign sunscreens or a [Zuckerberg-esque whitecast](https://www.reddit.com/r/awfuleverything/comments/hu8m7g/mark_zuckerberg_surfboards_in_hawaii_with_way_too/).\n\nIf you're in the US and willing to regularly spend $20 per ounce for a cosmetically elegant sunscreen like Supergoop, it may be worth your time to explore La Roche Posay or EltaMD sunscreens that offer equal elegance and better sun protection for your buck. Or even better, source Asian or European sunscreens to get better broad-spectrum protection.\n\nIf you don't live in the US, I would not recommend either of these sunscreens, as you probably have more easily accessible options at home that fit your criteria for UVA/UVB protection, cosmetic elegance, and/or budget.\n\n**Would I personally repurchase?**\n\nNot planning on it at the moment, given my focus on sunscreens that provide better UVA protection. If I were on a trip and forgot sunscreen or something, I would pick up the Kroger Invisible Gel again, since I know it is excellently priced, easy to apply, and has zero whitecast. Personally, the gel vehicle isn't my fave. I found it annoying that it takes basically eons to set on my face, and the slightly lighter consistency of the Supergoop does not justify the huge price jump for me.",

I easily use and reapply these types of sunscreen although they provide inferior protection as opposed to european and asian sunscreens that I am reluctant to reapply. The best sunscreen is the one you can easily use and reuse. I use antioxidants on my skin and internally when I can to also assist my sunscreen and covering up when possible. Sunscreen on it's own can only do so much anyway.",

        "body": "I know this post is a little old, but I thought I'd add in my own experience with buying the Kroger Supergoop! dupes... a couple of weeks ago I went into a store and bought both the gel and the body oil. \n\nThe Kroger gel feels the same as the Supergoop! gel I've tried, although I would recommend shaking them both before dispensing them. The oil generally feels nice, like a moisturizing body oil does. I haven't tried the Supergoop! one, so I can't compare them. I'd also add that the oil does have a pretty strong smell. It's not a bad smell-- I actually liked it, but if you're sensitive to fragrance on the body, maybe skip that one. I also don't feel like I would use it on a sunny day while I'm outside. As an everyday sunscreen, I'm happy to use it. I also didn't notice any issues using it on my neck, which has a tendency to turn red if any sort of product touches it ever. \n\nAll fine and good so far, until I realized the next day that I made a rookie mistake and hadn't checked the expiration dates before buying. The oil expires 10/21, the gel 11/21. Took them back to the store just hoping to exchange them... all the bottles there were the same expiration dates. So I just got refunded.\n\n  \nToday I went to a different store and both the oil and gel were in stock. Unfortunately, all the oils still expire 10/21 and most of the gels expired 11/21. I managed to search through and found a gel with a date of 4/22, so I went with that one. I haven't repurchased the oil, but I would like to. \n\n  \nTL;DR: good sunscreens that feel great, but be sure to always check the expiration dates on the sunscreens!",

Blending it with your fingers is Slightly better but it’s still very patchy, and even though it has a velvety texture it Looks dry. Love the scents though.

        "body": "Don't let them gaslight you, many of these \"mushy\" products or lip muds in C-beauty (or whatever the Korean copycat call themselves) act like that. They don't set on the lips and rely on influencers or users who have natural or artificial plump lips and use filters on their photos to sell the products for them. In person they slip & slide in perpetuity, and on anyone with any natural vertical lip lines, they just gather in those cracks and make them look so much worse. I have run into so many lip products like that in C-beauty, even the originator of this trend, the Into You lip muds, are like that. You can only apply them on your lips, never purse or push your lips together like any normal human being would on any normal day of their lives, and hope for the best.\n\nOf everything I tried so far, I only came out with 2 of them that I actually like, because they actually set/dry on the lips while still being comfortable & not drying, and they're buildable. If the tariff doesn't hurt you too much, check out the Joocyee Lip & Cheek cream 2.0 (and only the 2.0 b/c the original also sucks just like the other fails I mentioned), and the Judydoll MultiUse Watery Colour Balm. The Joocyee is dimethicone based so it's got that muddy texture that feels really creamy and has some but not very impressive blurring effect. The Judydoll is water based so it feels & visibly plumps up my miserably dry lips, so it does in fact minimise my vertical lip lines. It works amazing as a lip base to layer other product on top & seriously extends their wear time too. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason for Joocyee shade range, but Judydoll splits their 6 shades into 2 warm shades (both lean orange/red), 2 cool shades (pinks) & 2 neutrals (both red), and there's always 1 shade (W01, C02, N01) one is always sheer, 1 is more opaque (W02, C01, N02). Other than the colours & opacity, there's no difference in performance among them at all. If you get a chance to try them, this is a dry lips recommendation of excellence service 🫡 I have 5 of the Joocyee 2.0 cream & 4 of the Judydoll. I can't see inside the Joocyee packaging, but the Judydoll comes in a 6g pot and I hit pan on 1 in just a few months, and digging deep into the other 3 everyday 🎖 They're just creamy/moisturising to wear all day without needing a lip balm, and look good to put on because a clear lip balm everyday bores me. Speaking of which, they have no tint, but Judydoll stands up better to food, even oily fried meals.",

Mario Badescu is canceled, Thayer’s Witch Hazel, just rub some vodka on a cotton ball and use that, Cetaphil is bad, Cerave is bad, I feel like someone will actually call the police if I say I still use St Yves apricot scrub, Tatcha isn’t good, Drunk Elephant is garbage, Nivea is going to disfigure you, so is Ponds, so is literally every product ever sold. (Again this isn’t MY personal opinion but a brief list of brands and products that have been heavily criticized by either regular folks or so called licensed estheticians recently). Phthalates are evil, sulfates are evil, fragrance is a crime, dimethicone and silicones  are a nuclear weapon against humanity and so on and so forth. The only things that seem to be unanimous is sunscreen and retinol. Eye cream is also a myth and “won’t do anything”, I’m just exhausted trying to find decent products at ANY price point nowadays. Is it just me and I should just not watch as much stuff and make up my own opinions on a product or are we actually declaring war on dermatology as a whole nowadays? Curious to see if it’s just my perception of skincare trends or is anyone else witnessing this. Even holy grail products seem to get trashed lately.",

As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

Even though I haven't gone to the dermatologist, I don't think I have rosacea but just really dehydrated skin + sensitivity. I use Pixi toner day and night, it's given me a really nice glow but it might've been too much use. I'm also using HA (unrelated to this post) but I think due to my dehydrated skin, it's becoming even more dehydrated. I will try TO's Mandelic and maybe alternate it with Pixi day to day.  I have just read a blog entry about TO Mandelic vs Stratia Mandelic and found it very informative.

Couple questions though: \n\n1) The PH is usually around 3. Most cleansers leave you around a 5 or so. Can you recommend any cleansers or toners to bring your skin's PH down to the appropriate level before applying HAs? \n\n2) Is there any issue with using two different HAs at the same time? Can I use some stridex pads and then throw some TO Glycolic Acid on top? Or do I want to wait 20 minutes in between each HA?\n\n3) If we are to wait in between HAs, then I wash my skin down to a good Ph to apply my first HA..but then 20 minutes later my Ph is going to be back to a 6. I wouldn't want to wash again, what do I do to repeatedly drag down my Ph??",

    "body": "About four years ago, I wrote the currently sidebar'd post, [\"Evaluating Your Current Routine\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1x1ubd/evaluating_your_current_routine_read_me_before/). In that, I recommended things to ask yourself and consider before buying new products or changing your routine entirely.\n\nI recently began blogging, but I wanted to bring these posts to Reddit as well for people who did not want to click out of the sub. \n\nLots of this is content that has been referenced over the years on this subreddit, as well as elsewhere. However, I understand the frustration for new users stumbling in, seeing product recommendations and terminology being thrown around, as well as an enormous sidebar. It's pretty anxiety-inducing. I also see a lot of people skipping from products to products, asking what to try next. \n\nMy goals with this series is to break down *what* goes into your cleansers and how it affects your skin so you are empowered to make better choices as well as understand some of the science that gets passed around.\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down your average, general cleansers as well as oil cleansers (or the oil-cleansing method aka OCM) and micellar cleansers. Let's dive right in!\n\n---\n\n**Introduction to Cleansers**\n\nCleansers work by dissolving or binding to things on the skin that aren't normally rinsed away by water, such as the waxes or oils produced by our skin.\n\nWithout getting too into the weeds, they are able to do this with surfactants  (or \"the thing that makes cleansers sudsy\"). The most common surfactants, and the ones you may have heard of are SLS and SLES (sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate). These ingredients work by binding to the lipids (oils such as jojoba oil or silicones like dimethicone) and then being whisked away by their water-loving properties. Once mixed with water, surfactant molecules cluster together into little spheres known as micelles. Some surfactants molecular size allows them to penetrate deeper into the skin (namely SLS), where they can bind to skin cells. As you can imagine, this is very irritating to skin, and is what causes the eventual drying that you may experience after using some products.\n\nSo by increasing the size of these molecules or adding additional ingredients, we get a gentler cleanser.\n\nIf you've hung out in any beauty circle, you've probably also heard chatter of pH - \"What is the pH of that cleanser? Have you tried the CosRx Low pH Cleanser?\". The pH value of a cleanser can have an impact on how harsh your cleanser is on your skin as well, and simply put, it's because the surface of your skin is naturally pretty acidic.\n\nGoing back to Chemistry class really quickly, you'll probably remember something called the \"pH Scale.\"\n\nThings on the left side of the scale (1-6) are considered acidic. Things on the right side (8-14) are considered basic or alkaline. And of course, there is what is considered neutral, or pH 7. Skin has a pH of around 5.5, but becomes more basic the further down into the dermis you go, reaching a pH of about 7. Why is this important, you may be asking? Well, if you think back to your high school Chemistry course, you may have remembered the good ol' baking soda and vinegar reaction. When this reaction -- called an acid-base reaction -- occurs, the baking soda and vinegar exchange atoms and form different compounds, namely water and carbon dioxide. This is because bases are compounds that generally want to donate atoms and acids are compounds that generally want to accept atoms.\n\nAs skin comes in contact with other ingredients, even water, the pH temporarily raises and other compounds are created. Fatty acids (read: acidic components) of the skin are removed.\n\nHealthy skin can usually re-balance itself within an hour or so. Some skin takes longer to do this, especially skin that is prone to irritation, such as skin with acne, rosacea, eczema, or psoriasis. This is why your boyfriend can cleanse his face with a Dial soap bar and have glowing skin an hour later, while you're busily slathering on layer after layer of moisturizer.\n\nUsing a cleanser that is closer to our skin's natural pH is the obvious solution to this problem, and most modern cleansers are formulated much better than those of the past.\n\nSo now you're probably asking yourself: *Well, how can I test the pH of the cleanser I would like to buy? And how do I know the surfactant isn't going to irritate my skin?*\n\nA general rule of thumb is to look for mild surfactants, such as decyl glucoside, or multiple surfactants, like decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside, disodium cocoyl glutamate, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, cocoyl methyl glucamide, sodium cocoyl isethionate, and lauryl lactyl lactate.\n\nYou should also look for moisturizers, like oils, ceramides, cholesterol, and humectants (water-binding ingredients such as glycerin, hyaluronic acid, or squalane). Avoid saponified oils (please don't use Dr. Bronner's on your skin) and bar soap.\n\nNow I know you're asking: What about oil cleansers then?\n\n---\n\n**Oil Cleansers**\n\nWhat if I told you that your grandmother was ahead of the game?\n\nNearly all of us have seen a tub of Pond's Cold Cream hanging out in our grandmother's bathroom or on her vanity. You might've seen her dab some all over her skin and wipe away all of her makeup with a tissue. She may have sworn by it as the thing that kept her looking young, and she's not entirely wrong.\n\nI like to think of oil cleansers as being broken down into two types of cleansers -- wipe-off cleansers like your grandmother's Pond's, and emulsifying cleansers like the translucent oil cleansers that come in a pump or tub.\n\nThe former -- wipe-off cleansers -- are the most common mixtures in the cosmetics industry. They are usually simple mixtures of oil and water, and are high in water content, which makes them inexpensive.\n\nThey spread easily and often leave an oily or richly moisturized feeling behind. They're typically purchased by people with mature skin, but are a great alternative for people with dry skin.\n\nThe latter -- emulsifying cleansers -- are also mixtures of oil and water, but are higher in oil content, which makes them more expensive. They contain emulsifiers that bind well to water, which allows them to rinse away in water.\n\nThe benefit of these cleansers is there is no real \"sudsing\" action on the skin. Indeed many of them can actually feel \"moisturizing\" due to their ingredient makeup. They are also excellent for breaking down make-up and other waterproof things, such as mascara, due to the high oil content.\n\nWhen picking out an oil-cleanser, look for shortened ingredient lists. Don't be swayed by extracts or other frills that will wash away. The oil itself will be the biggest point of irritation (or not) for your skin, so don't be afraid of \"boring\" oils like mineral oil or petrolatum, which is one of the blandest, most non-reactive molecules around.\n\nJust one more to go...\n\n---\n\n**Micellar Cleansers**\n\nMicellar water is quite literally made up of micelles, or the molecular bunches of surfactants that group up, their water-loving butts faced outwards. These larger bunches of molecules, diluted in combinations of water and hydrating ingredients (such as glycerin), are the most mild of cleansers.\n\nThe percentage of surfactant to other ingredients is generally so low that micellar water does not need to be washed away. This allows the hydrating ingredients, such as glycerin, to stay on the skin after the debris has been removed.\n\nThis makes micellar water ideal for sensitive skin or prepping the skin for product application, when cleansing with a standard cleanser and water will be too drying.\n\n---\n\n**All Wrapped Up**\n\nSo what does this all mean? Here are some general skin cleanser guidelines to follow:\n\n* **Cleanse your skin at least once a day.** At the end of the day, your skin not only has a build-up of oils, but also debris and particulates in the air.\n* **Don't pile it on.** Your non-sudsing cleanser does not need to suds to work.\n* **Two-step cleanse for removing make-up.** Most make-up is waterproof and does not easily cleanse away. Use an oil cleanser to break down the make-up and remove it.\n* **Use cottons to remove cream cleansers like Pond's.** The friction will help to remove grime and dirt. Splash with water after to remove any leftover emulsifiers.\n* **Use cool water when cleansing.** Hot water can make surfactants penetrate deeper by reducing the size of the micelles, which is why your hot shower is more irritating and drying to your skin than the less-fun cooler shower.\n* **Moisturize.** Even water strips away the valuable fatty acids in your skin. Using a moisturizer on your skin after will help your skin to re-balance itself quicker.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n\n* [Kind of Stephen](https://kindofstephen.com/)\n* [DermaScope](https://www.dermascope.com/ingredients/surfactants-and-emulsifiers)\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n",

    "body": "I've been searching for potential biodegradable reef-safe mineral sunscreens for a diving vacation (though now realising I should probably always wear reef-safe sunscreen no matter where I am) and thought I'd share in case it's helpful to those wanting to choose a sunscreen that's not harmful to marine life. \n\nThis is still a work in progress but I've seen more and more posts on the sub about this subject so I thought I'd go ahead and share. If I've missed any brands out or included any products I shouldn't have please let me know and I'd love to hear reviews if you've tried any. (Also this is my first post, I hope the formatting is okay, please be kind, thanks)\n\nNote: the criteria for inclusion here are no nano zinc oxide or nano titanium dioxide, and no oxybenzone, octinoxate, octocrylene, PABA, enzacamene, octisalate, homosalate or avobenzone. And I've tried to mention if a sunscreen contains silicones as these may potentially be a problem for marine life. As with everything, we each have to weigh up a variety of concerns, and I'm not trying to suggest that there's no point in using sunscreens containing silicones, just as I'm not trying to tell anyone that they should feel guilty if they can't use reef-safe sunscreens for any reason.\n\nHere are the brands I've looked at so far:  \n- **[Alba Botanica](https://www.albabotanica.com/en/products/#/category=body&sub-category=sun-protection&worry=all)** (mineral formulations only, SPF 45, 7% TiO2, 9% ZnO, $2.24/oz at Whole Foods, also available at Walmart, some locations in store, otherwise online)  \n- **[All Good Products](https://allgoodproducts.com/)** (SPF 50, 25% ZnO, $9.99/oz, SPF 30, 12% ZnO, $3.66/oz, can currently get 30% off with code ALLGOODMAMA)  \n- **[Attitude Living](https://www.attitudeliving.com/Sun-Care-s/2023.htm)** (SPF 30, 20% ZnO, $4.80/oz, $10 off first order via referral link)  \n- **[Australian Gold Botanical](https://www.target.com/s?searchTerm=australian+gold+botanical)** *(available at a Target and Ulta, contains silicones)*  \n- **[Babo Botanicals](https://www.babobotanicals.com/)** (SPF 30, 19% ZnO, $6.70/oz, use NEWS25 for 20% off or $10 off $10+ orders w code HAPPYMOM10)  \n- **[Badger Balm](https://www.badgerbalm.com/c-24-natural-sunscreen.aspx)** (SPF 35, 22% ZnO, $4.34/oz, promo code with newsletter signup)  \n- [Bare Republic](https://www.gobareoutside.com/) some formulations are non-nano - includes all baby and spray products.

From their website:\n\n>\"Love Sun Body 100% Natural Origin Mineral Sunscreens active ingredients are non-nano zinc oxide/and or titanium dioxide and inactive ingredients contain no GMO, parabens, phenoxyethanol, nanoparticles, silicon, PEG, synthetic perfumes, dyes or animal-derived ingredients.\"\n\nThey also tout that all their formulas are rated #1 by the Environmental Working Group. It's sold on DermStore so I think I'm going to try it out along with La Roche Posay Ultra Light Mineral SPF 50. Will report back!\n\n​\n\nI can also say that I have tried the Mychelle SPF 30 Mineral Spray and I do not like it. It does not absorb and leaves a granular white cast on the skin, seems to have pretty good staying power though.",

    "body": "I know CeraVe in the tub is quite popular here, but I just wanted to provide a quick overview of other CeraVe moisturizers for those who aren't familiar.\n\n**NOTE**: All CeraVe moisturizers contain cetearyl alcohol/cetyl alcohol, which may cause breakouts to those who have a sensitivity to fatty alcohols.\n\n**Cerave Moisturizer Overview**\n\n[**Cerave Moisturizing Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/moisturizing-cream) (also known as Cerave \"in the tub\") is a thick, creamy moisturizer with ceramides, hyaluronic acid and petrolatum.\n\n[**Cerave Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/moisturizing-lotion) comes in a bottle and is a thinner consistency. It also has ceramides and hyaluronic acid but no petrolatum.\n\n[**Cerave AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/am-facial-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a small pump bottle and has a thick, creamy (slightly greasy) texture. It is SPF 30 and contains the following active suncare ingredients: Homosalate (12% - for UVB protection), Octinoxate (7.5% - for UVB protection), Octocrylene (2% - for UVB protection), Zinc Oxide (3.5% - for UVA protection). It also contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/pm-facial-moisturizing-lotion) (my fave) comes in a small pump bottle and is a silky/gel texture. It contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and places more focus on chemical exfoliation. Notable ingredients are mineral oil, ammonium lactate (similar to lactic acid), salicyclic acid, ceramides and a lower concentration of hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-cream) comes in a tub and is a thicker version of the SA lotion and contains similar ingredients with the addition of niacinamide.\n\n[**Cerave Skin Renewing Night Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/skin-renewing-night-cream) comes in a tub and contains shea butter, ceramides, niacinamide, peptides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and contains niacinamide, ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and allantoin (an anti-irritant derived from urea). \n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-cream) comes in a tub and contains glycerin, petrolatum, ceramides and hyaluronic acid. No niacinamide or allantoin in this one.\n\n**Notable Ingredient Overview**\n\n**Ceramides**: Naturally occurring, long chains of skin lipids (fats) that are major structural components of the skin’s outer layers. Skin as a barrier system inhibits water movement via its extracellular matrix, which has a unique composition of 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% free fatty acids. Together, these lipids form what researchers refer to as \"crystalline lamellar structures\". Ceramides are necessary for the skin’s water-retention capacity as well as for barrier repair and cell regulation. Adding ceramides to skin-care products can help to restore the skin’s barrier system.\n\n**Hyaluronic acid**: Component of skin tissue that is used in skin-care products as a good skin-identical ingredient. Hyaluronic acid can boost skin's moisture content, reduce inflammation, have cell-communicating abilities, and help prevent moisture loss.\n\n**Niacinamide**: Also known as vitamin B3 and nicotinic acid, niacinamide is a potent cell-communicating ingredient that offers multiple benefits for aging skin. Assuming skin is being protected from sun exposure, niacinamide can improve skin's elasticity, dramatically enhance its barrier function, help erase discolorations, and revive skin's healthy tone and texture.\n\n**Ammonium Lactate:** Ammonium lactate is a mix of lactic acid and ammonium hydroxide. It is used as a skin moisturizer lotion to treat dry, scaly, itchy skin. Those who are using it should avoid exposure to sunlight or artificial UV rays, such as sunlamps or tanning beds. Ammonium lactate makes skin more sensitive to sunlight. Skin is more likely to sunburn. Use sunblock and wear clothes when exposed to sunlight.\n\n**Salicylic acid**: Referred to as beta hydroxy acid (BHA), it is a multifunctional ingredient that addresses many of the systemic causes of blemishes. For decades dermatologists have been prescribing salicylic acid as an exceedingly effective keratolytic (exfoliant), but it also is an anti-irritant This is because salicylic acid is a derivative of aspirin (both are salicylates—aspirin’s technical name is acetylsalicylic acid), and so it also functions as an anti-inflammatory.\n\n**Shea butter**: A plant lipid extracted from the karite tree that is used as an emollient in cosmetics. Shea butter is a rich source of antioxidants.\n\n**Ingredient Lists**\n\n> **CeraVe Moisturizing Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n>\n> **CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Active Ingredients: Homosalate (12%), Octinoxate (7.5%), Octocrylene (2%), Zinc Oxide (3.5%). \n> Inactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate and Boron Nitride, Dimethicone, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Hyaluronic Acid, Phytosphingosine, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n> \n> **CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Renewing SA Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Mineral Oil, Ammonium Lactate, Salicylic Acid, Trolamine, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG-100 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3 in Corn Oil), Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Dimethicone 360, Methylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Propylparaben, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Renewing SA Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Ammonium Lactate, Salicylic Acid, Triethanolamine, Cetyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, PEG-100 Stearate, Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3 in Corn Oil), Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Methylparaben, Edetate Disodium, Propylparaben, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Glyceryl stearate SE, Stearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Saccharide Isomerate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterols, Ceramide 6 II, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 1, Niacinamide, Hyaluronic  Acid, Caprooyl Tetrapeptide-3, Tripeptide-1, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Behentrimonium Methosulphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Tocopherol, Allantoin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Phytosphingosine, Dextran, Xanthan Gum\n>\n>**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**\n>\n>Purified Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetostearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Emulsifying Wax, Niacinamide, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lauric Acid, Zinc Citrate, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Arginine PCA, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, EDTA, Sodium PCA, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer\n>\n>**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Cream**\n>\n>Purified Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Petrolatum, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Behentrimonium Methosulphate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nHopefully this information will be useful to people interested in trying Cerave.",

Nakabili ako nito nung nag live selling nito yung dalawang sikat na content creators sa Tiktok: Skincarebyruzz at Wearsunscreen.\n\nTingnan muna natin ang ingredient list nitong sunscreen (pwede din tingnan sa pic na nasa itaas):\n\nAqua, Glycerin, Octyl, Methoxycinnamate, Dimethicone, Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Leaf Extract, Hyaluronic Acid, Polypodium Leucotomos Extract, Baicalin (Scutellaria Root  Extract), Vitamin E, Niacinamide, Phenoxyethanol,Titanium Dioxide, Carbomer 940 & Fragrance\n\nComment:\nUnang tingin pa lang, kita na agad na ang daming mali-mali sa ingredient list na inilagay sa box. Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate ang tamang entry dapat dun sa UV filter na ginamit, hindi Octyl, Methoxycinnamate (pati yung comma sablay ang pwesto). Making entry din ang Vitamin E sa ingredient list, either dapat Tocopherol o kaya Tocopheryl Acetate ang inilagay jan (kung alin man jan sa dalawa ang ginamit), dahil hindi considered na INCI name ang Vitamin E. Meron pang isa, yung Carbomer 940. Carbomer lang dapat ang nakalagay jan, dahil ang Carbomer 940 ay isang grade lamang ng Carbomer at hindi ito tamang INCI name. Isa pa, since tinted itong sunscreen na ito, bakit hindi nakalagay ang mga pigments na ginamit dito (Iron oxide Red / C.I. 77491; Iron oxide Yellow/C.I. 77492; Iron oxide Black/C.I. 77499)? Panghuli, hindi gumagamit ng \"&\" symbol sa ingredient list kapag nasa dulo. \n\nNgayon tingnan naman natin ang ilan sa mga product claims nito namedyom problematic (makikita sa Pic 1 at Pic 3):\n1. SPF 50 PA ++++ UVA/UVB Sun Protection (Pic 1) \n2. Broad spectrum (Pic 1) \n3. Fragrance Free (Pic 3) \n4. Provides broad spectrum SPF 50 coverage using zinc oxide... \n\nAnong mga problema sa mga claims na ito?\n\nUna sa lahat, paano papalo ng SPF 50 ang sunscreen na ito kung ang UV filters lang na ginamit ay Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate at Titanium Dioxide lang? Kahit pa sabihin nating nakasagad sa 10% ang Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate na ginamit, malabo pa din mangyari yan. \n\nIkalawa, papaano na-claim na broad spectrum ang sunscreen na ito at may UVA protection, kung malinaw naman sa ingredient list na walang nakalagay na UVA filter? Ni hindi nga ito naglagay ng Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane (Avobenzone) para masabi man lang na may UVA filter ito.\n\nIkatlo, claim ng product na ito na may zinc oxide ito kaya naging broad spectrum. Paano mangyayari yan e wala naman sa ingredient list ang zinc oxide? \n\nIkaapat, nag-claim ang product na Fragrance free. E ang linaw-linaw sa ingredient list na may Fragrance. At nung ginamit ko yung product, meron ngang fragrance, pero hindi kalakasan, sakto lang para ma-mask yung amoy ng base. So basag na agad yung claim nito na Fragrance free. \n\nNgayon, tumungo naman tayo sa actual product use. Una kong napansin dito ay yung packaging. In fairness, cute naman ang bote, hugis araw. Ok sana tong bote kasi yung gitna nung bote e gawa sa squeezable material. Ang problema ko lang, nababakbak yung white na print, which is ok naman sana, kaso sumasama sya sa kamay kapag pinapahid na sa mukha yung sunscreen, kaya napagkamalan ko pang titanium dioxide na hindi na-disperse ng maayos. In fairness naman din sa product, hindi naman nag-pill sa balay ko nung ginamit ko na. \n\nFinal Verdict:\nKung hindi ko inurirat yung mga nakasulat sa box nitong product na ito, aakalain kong ok or matino ito. E ang kaso, ang daming mali at inconsistencies nitong product nito sa kanyang mga claim, kaya magdududa ka talaga kung maayos e. Di komo FDA notified ang isang product e maayos na. Kaya sa ating lahat na gumagamit ng skincare products, lagi tayong maging mapanuri sa mga binibili nating produkto. ",

I posted a TikTok regarding the “fragrance” part kasi how can they claim to be “fragrance-free” and have “fragrance” on the ingredient list. \n\nI also reached out to the CEO OF HIKARI via DMs and other skincare influencers (who are promoting it) to get their thoughts baka ako lang ang misinformed and I’m assuming incorrectly. I have not received any response pa. \n\nI also sent the company an email via their website and I still have not received any feedback I feel like I’m taking crazy pills (lol) \n\nI also joined one of the livestreams ng CEO nila and asked the question on live but it was just ignored. \n\nThank you for posting this it’s eating me up",

Hindi naman sa pagiging matapobre no, pero looking sa price point ng products ni Hikari Skin Essentials (not just their sunscreen but their rejuv products too) you will really question yung quality ng binebenta nila. Sorry pero it's giving Rosmar and Viyline levels na ang target market is low-income people na naghahanap ng madaliang solution to skin problems at a low price point, regardless of the sussy quality.\n\nIf anyone needs affordable na locally-made beauty products, better stick na lang to mainstream brands na available sa Mercury and Watsons. Sure, malakas mambudol si Watsons as we all know pero surely every single brand they sell (including theirs) dumaan yan sa maayos na R&D at quality control.\n\nAnd if kelangan talaga ng  products na may pangmalakasang support like sunscreen, dun na mag-invest ng magandang brand if your budget can accommodate it.",

Hindi ko din alam kung may mga existing kayong condition sa balat (e.g. melasma, rosacea, atiouc dermatitis, atbp.). Pangalawa, hindi ko din alam kung anong preference nyo sa isang sunscreen. Kung ang gusto nyo ba e matte o dewy, or kung pang daily use lang ba o pang beach. Ikatlo, hindi ko din alam kung magkano ang budget nyo sa sunscreen. Dahil alam naman natin na mumurahin, mid-range, at premium na sunscreen. \n\nAng tanging masasabi ko lang is kung meron na kayong ginagamit na sunscreen ngayon na inyong na-research ng maigi at kumportable naman kayong gamitin araw-araw ng walang problema, at pasok sa budget nyo, e para sa akin, yan na yung akmang sunscreen para sa inyo.",

    "body": "So today I came upon this ad on newspaper: https://i.imgur.com/XjvriDS.jpg\n\n> Shampoos contain Sodium Laureth Sulphate (SLS), a surfactant found in many cleansing product. Also an insecticide, the sodium and ammonium laureate sulphates are known cancer-causing ingredients. Also causes liver damage, skin rashes, depression, diarrhea and eye damage.\n\nAll of their shampoos, \n\n*Kesh Kanti Milk Protein: https://i.imgur.com/wg74frd.jpg\n\n*Kesh Kanti Anti Dandruff: https://i.imgur.com/nkY0CNV.jpg\n\n*Kesh Kanti Alovera: https://i.imgur.com/Z4flo71.jpg\n\n*Kesh Kanti Shikakai: https://i.imgur.com/Hd8KOh6.jpg\n\n*Kesh Kanti Natural: https://i.imgur.com/Okct6Re.jpg\n\n*Kesh Kanti Reetha: https://i.imgur.com/Jl2lpBR.jpg\n\nare surfactant based, they aren’t mentioning what surfactant they are using. So I guess they are using ALS (Ammonium Laureth Sulfate) which most herbal brand uses including Khadi, but no one never mentions it. \n\nHere’s a natural surfactant list: https://i.imgur.com/ptzExJE.png thanks to http://library.essentialwholesale.com/6390-2/\n\nbut Patanjali is saying: \n\n> the sodium and ammonium laureate sulphates are known cancer-causing ingredients. Also causes liver damage, skin rashes, depression, diarrhea and eye damage.\n\nOkay Patanjali, that’s okay let’s move on to other points.\n\n>Dimethicone is silicon oil that can make the scalp and skin incredibly dry and irritated. Found in Shampoos, it forms an almost plastic-like barrier on the outside of the skin and traps bacteria, sebum and impurities with it. It is also an eye irritant and non-biodegradable and horrible for the environment.\n\nWTH Patanjali your own so called 100% natural product contains Dimethicone! \n\n*Kesh Kanti Shikakai Shampoo: https://i.imgur.com/Hd8KOh6.jpg\n\n*Kesh Kanti Almond Hair Conditioner: https://i.imgur.com/2MygB8G.jpg\n\n*Kesh Kanti Damage Control Hair Conditioner: https://i.imgur.com/B9jVJ9k.jpg\n\nOops! Busted. ;)\n\n>The goodness of all the herbs, together with Henna, Shikakai, Tulsi and others is brought together by Patanjali in its Kesh Kanti hair cleansers and oils. With 100% natural ingredients and the pure goodness of Ayurveda, embrace Patanjali for the best hair care. \n\nMaybe they should retire the term ‘100% natural ingredients’ because their own Hair Cleansers including Kesh Kanti Reetha, Natural, Shikakai & Milk Protein except Anti Dandruff and Alovera contains Diazolidinyl urea.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazolidinyl_urea \n\n>Diazolidinyl urea is found in the commercially available preservative Germaben. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germaben\n\n>Germaben II contains parabens, some studies have raised concerns that these substances may be carcinogenic owing to their effect of mimicking the body's hormone estrogen.\n\nAccording to: https://www.truthinaging.com/ingredients/diazolidinyl-urea\n\n>A lot of controversy surrounds the safety of diazolidinyl urea. Many believe it to be both toxic and carcinogenic, mainly due to the fact that it's a proven formaldehyde releaser. However, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel evaluated the available data on this ingredient (and reevaluated it in 2006) and concluded it as safe to use on cosmetic products at a maximum concentration of .5%. Their studies demonstrated it to be neither toxic nor photosensitizing. However, tests did show it to produce mild skin irritations in some (1 out of 1000), so this ingredient should probably avoided by those with very sensitive skin.\n\n>While it is fair to say that no available data leads us to confidently categorize diazolidinyl urea as toxic and carcinogenic, many well respected scientists and doctors still recommend avoiding it. In You Being Beautiful, Doctors Michael Roizen and Mehmet Oz include it on their list of ingredients to avoid. This is because it may be contaminated by formaldehyde.\n\nSee the sentence “While it is fair to say that no available data leads us to confidently categorize diazolidinyl urea as toxic and carcinogenic, many well respected scientists and doctors still recommend avoiding it.” ? \n\nI’m so confused Patanjali, first you make certain claims like SLS and ALS are known cancer causing ingredient then completely forgot mentioning diazolidinyl urea that exists in your products?!\n\nNow I have checked three different shampoo in our home: Clear Anti Dandruff, WOW 10in1 Miracle Shampoo and Tresemme Hair Fall shampoo but none of them seem to contain it. \n\nand WTF is “Sugandhit Dravya”, can’t you simply name it as perfume? Yeah you guys got reasons because I guess “Sugandhit Dravya” sounds less chemical-e?\n\nThis doesn’t end here, their Damage Control Hair Conditioner contains quaternium.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternium-15\n\n>Some consumer cosmetics contain quaternium-15 for its antimicrobial properties. The American Cancer Society states that although quaternium-15 releases formaldehyde, a known carcinogen in laboratory test animals at relatively high doses, because the amount of formaldehyde released from these products is low, it is unclear that avoiding quaternium-15 in cosmetics provides any health benefits. Even so, Johnson & Johnson announced plans to phase out its use of quaternium-15 in cosmetic products by 2015 in response to consumer pressure.\n\nSo what do we learn from this, don’t believe in this 100% natural, 100% pure Ayurveda chutiyapa and largely in this stupid company who has questionable R&D and simply wants to sell us products in the name of Swadeshi, saving and servicing the nation. What do you expect from a company who wants us buy their product because it’s cheaper than the rest and most of the time they aren’t because Patanjali thinks we buy all products in MRP with no discounts?  Compare this products https://i.imgur.com/KI1o5q7.jpg with the rest and you’ll see Patanjali just copy pasted the MRP while we get them at cheaper rate, little to no difference from Patanjali’s pricing in some products. Yeah some other companies does the same but Patanjali is no better.\n\nThanks for reading, have a nice day! :)\n\n \n",

    "body": "Hey y’all,\n\nI wanted to review all the Isntree products I have tried over the past few years in one place for anyone who is looking into the brand. I find them to be basically unrivaled when it comes to ingredient lists, and have been tempted into buying essentially their entire line as a result. I get rewards through winning contests at work, and bought many of these in the 50% off sale on Stylevana, so I tried these gradually over the course of three years.\n\nI am at the halfway point between white and tan skin, I have dry skin in the winter/oily skin in the summer, and you’ll find my routine below:\n\nAM:\n\n1. Rinse with water\n2. Hydrating toner/essence\n3. Fermented essence\n4. Niacinamide serum\n5. Gel cream\n6. Sunscreen\n\nPM:\n\n1. Oil cleanse\n2. Second cleanse\n3. AM steps 2-5\n4. Heavy Cream\n\nI have a bias against serums in the way that they are less product for more money, so I will hold it against them if they're not justifying that. I also strongly dislike silicones, which is something else that other people won't necessarily share.\n\nI’m going to format it by product type, and will rate it on a scale of 1-5. You can assume I will at some point probably repurchase a product (on sale) unless otherwise noted. I have reviewed some of these before, so I will be using a bulk of what I said before on those with added updates. One final note is that I don’t fully remember some of these to give a full review, so some won’t have scores but rather descriptions and impressions. Alright, let’s dive in!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCreams:\n\nOnion Newpair Gel Cream\n\n4.5/5\n\nThis is a great option and one of their best moisturizers - I am shallow so I won’t lie about being obsessed with the slight purple hue. I’ve seen it retail from $10 USD all the way up to $40, and I have no idea why haha. It is not a holy grail hyperpigmentation treatment, but it is fantastic at evening out skin tone and giving you a nice healthy glow. It has 71% Onion Extract as well as Niacinamide, which are the two main ingredients I would purchase this for. While it has tranexamic acid, a vitamin c derivative, and a bunch of other great ingredients; they are probably all well below .1%. This does dry down pretty quickly, so it makes a fantastic daily moisturizer under sunscreen. What I love about this gel cream is that your face could be violently wet, but this would still apply like a normal moisturizer. It absorbs moisture and locks in whatever you’ve done before better than most, which is a compliment I’d pay to a lot of their gel creams. I wish this one didn’t have dimethicone, though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nC-Niacin Toning Cream\n\n5/5\n\nThis is a very similar cream to the Onion Newpair, but instead of a light purple, it’s a vibrant orange. Trade onions for sea buckthorn, and you’d get this product. This is better to me, though, because of the fact it is their cheapest moisturizer almost at all times, the lovely yet natural smell, and it is the best glow booster I have ever used. It dries down so well, but it will leave you with a glowy, hydrated complexion while staying dry to the touch. It is glass skin in a tube, essentially. The blend of oils, addition of beta glucan, and removal of dimethicone just overall makes this their best cream.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCica Relief Cream\n\n1.5/5\n\nThis is a strange addition to their catalog and it seems like they’ve phased out the entire line, perhaps to relaunch it as they do. It is one of those creams that further emulsifies on contact with water, so it becomes impossible to use if you use the wet skin method. It is legitimately impossible to blend in without white streaks. The ingredient list is impressive with basically everything you could ask for (especially the peptides whew), but its lack of utility would never make me feel comfortable recommending it. It is also piss-poor at locking in moisture because of this, which is again pretty point defeating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHyaluronic Acid Moist Cream\n\nImpressions: I did rate this in a recent point somewhat poorly, but in retrospect it really is a decent cream. I find that you need to apply it to a dryer face as it will end up not very significant on a wet face. I don’t find I have this issue with the aqua, but for this one I remember just not being able to feel any kind of locked in feeling I like to feel from moisturizers. I’m going to try it again one day, maybe this summer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHyaluronic Acid Aqua Cream\n\n4/5 \n\nI like this cream a lot, and have already repurchased it. I rate it lower because it is both not significant enough to be used alone most of the time, while also leaving a pretty glowy finish if used alone. I will typically use this at night before another moisturizer, and will use a more natural-finish sunscreen if used during the day. I find this to be intensely hydrating in a way most moisturizers fall short, however, and will stay loyal to this just for the punch it packs in that department. I will often combine it with squalane or hemisqualane to give it an additional oomph, but this is for sure a go-to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHyaluronic Acid Water Sleeping Mask\n\n5/5\n\nThis is an all-time great. They struck gold with this formulation, and I hope they never stop making it. I have bought at least 15 of these, and considering how much I like to try new things, something becoming a staple means something haha. I would describe this as a goopy occlusive containing almost no occlusives that somehow just works. If you use it as your final step, your skin will be well protected and wake up so hydrated. If you want to use it as a serum, it absolutely smashes all other hydrating serums and you only need a little. I will alternate between both using it as a serum and an occlusive depending on the weather. One drawback is that it is so THICK that you do need to melt it down in your hands sometimes depending on how much you’re using.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChestnut PHA Clear Cream\n\n4.5/5\n\nAnother fantastic product that is actually super new. They used to have a PHA sleeping mask that caught them in hot water because it had some fragrant extract (lol), but this updated version adds chestnut extract and removes any fragrance. According to their insta, they wanted this to be more of a daily moisturizer akin to the onion and c-niacin creams, and I’d say they mostly succeeded in doing this. The ingredient list is another humble brag, and I’d say overall this has helped me so much with daily usage. The benefits of getting minor exfoliation every single day kind of speak for themselves. I will say that this doesn’t dry down as well as their other daily moisturizers, but I would just use less of it if this bothers you. I also find it doesn’t “lock in” as well as some moisturizers do, but having a PHA 5% gel cream is just too useful for me to not love it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMugwort Spot Gel Cream\n\n4/5\n\nI’m gonna be honest, I find it suspicious that this doesn’t smell like mugwort even a little bit. I could add a drop of One Thing’s Mugwort toner and make this thing so fragrant, so I am just a bit confused there haha. This is very, very similar to the onion and c-niacin creams in the way that it locks in everything really well and dries down quickly. It doesn’t have Niacinamide, which is a bit of a drawback overall to me, but if you are one of the B3 haters out there, then this would be the one for you. It does a great job at reducing redness and was a great medicinal treatment of a burn I got recently. I’d recommend this cream up and down, but it is typically just a bit too expensive for what it is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYam Root Cream\n\n5/5\n\nThis is a unique product in their line as it is their only moisturizer outside of the HA sleeping mask that aims to be heavy. It has 57% yam root extract with a bunch of other great, soothing/brightening extracts like rice, soybean, and oat. It also has 5 ceramides and cholesterol, which isn’t a common feature for them. This does dry down pretty well, but not nearly as well as the others, seemingly by design. It applies like a luxury cream and was so similar to Then I Met You’s Renewing Rich Beauty Cream that I just put the rest of the cream in that packaging and mixed it with hemisqualane to provide even more moisture. This is their best moisturizer for people with dry skin IMO\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIsntree’s Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel SPF50+ PA++++\n\n4.25/5\n\nI recently reviewed this on here and gave it a worse score and a mediocre review. I would like to publicly apologize. This is for sure not a summer sunscreen, but I find I can wear it almost all year round and look incredibly healthy without eating a single vegetable. (This is a joke please stay well nourished.) It is so oily on me if used in humid weather, and is one of the more emollient sunscreens I’ve used in Korean and Japanese beauty. In the winter I see that as a plus! It is a runny but significant emulsion type liquid, spreads really well and evenly, and is an easy sunscreen to reapply as it will never pill for me. Overall a big fan!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToners:\n\nGreen Tea Fresh Toner\n\n2.5/5\n\nI find that this toner didn’t do much of anything. I love the experience of using it as it smells amazing, but it has this slipperiness to it that I couldn’t really get behind. It is purported to have a complex that helps with oil control, but I don’t find this to be something the product does well. It has a series of botanical extracts, beta glucan, hydrolyzed HA, and allatoin. It is very no frills, and something I’d recommend if green tea works well for you. For me, this didn’t hydrate much at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHyaluronic Acid Toner Plus\n\n5/5\n\nThis is essentially a top-quality hyaluronic acid serum packaged as a toner and sold at an excellent price. I will forever return to it because if used sparingly like a serum, it can last you a year. It’s gorgeously goopy, smells just a bit funky, and will at times foam when used in large quantities and allowed to lather on the skin. I have been told this is not a red flag, and will pass this vague assurance onto you. Both this and the normal HA toner are composed of 50% HA aqueous solution, but this one has 5 types of HA rather than the 3 in the standard. There are a host of typical botanical extracts like centella, birch juice, rosemary, and licorice. Sodium PCA, beta glucan, and panthenol round out a beautiful ingredient list and a super hydrating product I have already repurchased. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHyaluronic Acid Toner\n\n4/5\n\nThis is a basic hydrating toner, and doesn’t try to be anything more. No active ingredients, no frills, just a solution of 50% hyaluronic acid composed of three different kinds, other humectants like glycerin and beta glucan; and some barrier supporting ingredients like panthenol and sodium PCA. It’s slightly more viscous than water, so it is far more dispensable than the plus version. As far as the effect of it goes, it is expectedly super hydrating, and softens the skin upon application. All of the other toners they have are like upgraded versions of this, so I won’t repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnion Newpair Essence Toner\n\n5/5\n\nThis is the perfect toner in my opinion. I often look for and extract based as opposed to water, 2-4% niacinamide, watery texture, and a decent amount of humectants; and this delivers on all in spades. I enjoy the purple color, and do find that the onion extract supports the product in a way that yields brightness and evens out skin tone. It has a skin-softening effect once applied, and feels like a burst of hydration. It is overall somewhat basic, but it succeeds. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYam Root Vegan Milk Toner\n\nImpressions: I dropped this product in the sink while it was full of water, so I threw it away after only a few uses. It is 80% yam root extract, and is otherwise what I would describe as a Cream Skin Refiner with a much more complete ingredient list. As far as ingredients, it has a well-selected series of oils like meadowfoam seed, argan, sunflower, and macadamia; a milk replacement themed list (lol) of extracts like oat, almond, and rice; and some barrier supporting ingredients like panthenol, ceramide NP, and cholesterol. This is a top tier milky toner, and I enjoyed it while I had it haha\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnion Newpair Clear Pad\n\n5/5\n\nI very much enjoyed using these in the morning instead of rinsing my face with water. The pads are soft, somewhat easy to separate, and are adequately soaked in product. The ingredient list is a bit simpler, and in my opinion better than the toner as it mostly gets rid of the botanical extracts to focus on the barrier-supporting ingredients like Panthenol, hyaluronic acids, allantoin and adenosine. The tranexamic acid and vitamin c derivative are also higher up on this ingredient list, but that doesn’t mean anything necessarily. Once done using this, my skin is super glowy and healthy looking to the point where I don’t know if I need to do anything else. These are often super expensive, like the rest of this line; but you will be able to find everything here for cheap on Stylevana at some point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSerums:\n\n(their new serum packaging is super ugly, will try not to mention this again)\n\nC-Niacin Toning Ampoule\n\n3.5/5\n\nThis would get a perfect 5 out of 5 from me if it were less watery. From my perspective, serums have a certain responsibility to have a certain viscosity to them so that they feel a bit more significant and spreadable on the skin. This felt like a toner packaged in 50ml serum packaging, if that makes sense. Apart from that, this is a top tier product. It focuses on superfoods like sea buckthorn, pumpkin, and turmeric; while having a great ingredient list featuring niacinamide at the top. It is a bit too basic for a serum, for me, as I typically will only buy serums for a buffet type product. This would get a 5/5 as a toner\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGreen Tea Fresh Serum\n\n1.5/5\n\nI found this serum to be super oily, and it broke me out. I really couldn’t tell you why when looking at the ingredient list, but I ended up using it on my body because I just really didn’t like it. This has a great ingredient list, but again I just hold serums to higher standards (as we should) and this is fairly basic for them. Again, if a green tea-based oily serum appeals to you, however, I would definitely recommend this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpot Saver Mugwort Ampoule:\n\nImpressions: I ended up just combining this somewhat early on with a One Thing toner and using it on my body, so I don’t deserve to rate this. I find this to be mid as far as mugwort products go, and that is overall the extract my skin fucks with the most. It has a perfectly serviceable ingredient list with beta glucan, panthenol, and ceramides all combining to create what is in the end an effective serum. I would recommend One Thing’s Artemisa Toner over this, though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCleansers:\n\nGreen Tea Fresh Cleanser:\n\n5/5\n\nI love this cleanser so much. It smells insanely good, has this amazing goopy texture, and it has tea leaves in it. I find that they don’t do much exfoliation, and I honestly never see them again after cleansing it off. It is surprisingly gentle for being so thorough. This feels like a luxury cleanser, and is better than almost every luxury cleanser I’ve tried for cheap. Count me as a big fan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnion Newpair Cleansing Foam:\n\n4.25/5\n\nThis was my HG cleanser for a while, and while I wouldn’t buy it again, I will describe it to identify why that is and why it might work for you. I have water that rinses cleansers off well, but when I go to other people’s places I find that film-leaving cleansers will be difficult to completely remove, which bothers me. This has your typical whipped creamy cleanser texture, with a slight purple tint. I am not a fan of this type of cleanser as it is everywhere in Asian Beauty, it a bit stripping, and is somewhat difficult to completely remove. If you are looking for a thorough creamy cleanser with added brightening benefits, then this is it. Final note: it smells like caramel corn. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nChestnut LHA Jelly Cleansing Oil\n\n1/5\n\nI would consider this something of a formulation failure in the way that it is almost impossible to get an oil texture out of this. Naturium also has a first step cleanser like this: it just spreads like a gel. You have to really rub it in, and I need to have some slip to my cleanser as I have skin that is sensitive to rubbing, so this wasn’t something I could really use. I also can’t imagine it is super adept at removing makeup as a result.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYam Root Vegan Milk Cleanser:\n\n4/5\n\nThis is a great cleanser for people who have sensitive skin, but only on wet skin. I used this as a second step cleanser when I wanted a non-foaming option, and it always left my skin so soft and well-cleansed. I don’t have too much purpose for it as I would prefer other non-foaming options purchased locally, but this is the best non-foaming AB cleanser I’ve used by far. It does, however, fail at being a makeup remover/first step as it is truly like a cream. It just sinks in. You can’t get any slip on it because your skin is drinking it up. Apart from this, I do recommend it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEverything Else:\n\nChestnut BHA 2% Clear Liquid:\n\n4.5/5\n\nThere are so many BHA liquids on the market, but this is a really solid one if you are looking. It is a simple ingredient list with 3 types of hyaluronic acid, allantoin, and glycerin. I have really not much to add - it is watery and thin, sinks in quickly, and is super friendly to sensitive skin. Peach Slice’s has the best version of this, though, IMO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChestnut AHA 8% Clear Essence\n\n4.5/5\n\nLike the BHA, this is one of the best options for the type of exfoliant it is. It is a massive upgrade from the previous version as it removes the fragrance and adds the chestnut extract, which I do enjoy. I find that when I use this, my pores look so clean and healthy. It has 4% both glycolic and lactic acids, which I enjoy as most multi-AHA exfoliants are mostly composed of glycolic acid with a low concentration of any others present. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMugwort Calming Clay Mask\n\n4/5\n\nI find clay masks almost all the same, so this doesn’t get altogether too much praise from me in the way that it’s very similar to other products. However, it is the best clay mask I’ve used as far as experience goes as it smells really nice (IMO), has large enough granules to not feel like a scrub, can be easily combined with serums or spot treatments (it will usually get really creamy like mint ice cream), and dries down quickly. I love the tugging/tightening sensation of clay masks, and I will say this one does deliver.\n\nSo that’s it! I clearly love this brand. I want to acknowledge that people aren’t always big fans because they use preservatives that have not historically yielded the desired results. I have never had a product go bad on me, and I haven’t experience a product becoming less effective quickly. That doesn’t mean this hasn’t happened, though; as I have seen a lot of people on this sub mention it. I don’t know where Isntree is at with this, but it hasn’t impacted my experience in any capacity.\n\nIn looking at my reviews, I definitely prefer their toners and creams over everything else. If you have any questions for me, I am here! Thank you for reading.",

I was chatting over at the /r/beautyguruchatter Discord when NoSpelledWithAK said that she thought that the formula was changed and that no one said anything.

Probably the one everyone is going to latch onto is that Subculture shadows are based on talc, whereas MR shadows are based on mica, but it looks like the entire formula got changed between the two palettes. This likely explains why people are having problems with Subculture not blending in as well as MR, as well as some major kickback issues.\n\nInterestingly enough, the ingredients for MR aren't [listed on the ABH website](http://www.anastasiabeverlyhills.com/modern-renaissance-palette/ABH01-18170.html). I wonder why.",

So, from that standpoint, this switch is ethical. But, you know, the brand wasn't sitting there making this decision because of ethical mica concerns.  \n\nI guess what I'm saying is that ABH could have announced this and made it a good thing. If they partnered up with a children's rights org, and put out this palette as a first step toward using less mica. There was a way to have spun it.  \n\nBut even if they had spun it and we were sitting on this website gushing over how ABH supports human rights, the reality is that they did this to make their shadows cheaper. Lower quality. And that's a bummer. I definitely have been channeling my inner Kimberly Clark on this one. Don't need it, not gonna buy it.",

To me, it's not the talc that is the issue but the overall change in formulation (quite a few ingredients and their position on the list are different btwn subculture and modern renaissance)",

    "body": "Hey y’all,\n\nThis is gonna be a really long one, so I’ll try to keep introductions brief. I love trying new things for the purpose of data, and sometimes I actually sit down and share it lol. I am going to go through what I look for in a moisturizer, my routine, and my skin type before getting to the reviews. The longer ones come first because when I wrote out this list, I decided to do it by brand, so the brands I had the most experience with ended up coming first.\n\nFor a moisturizer, it’s often difficult to nail down what works best. I have normal skin that leans combo or dry depending on the weather, so when I use a moisturizer I want something that will be significant, but not too emollient. For a daily moisturizer, I prefer something that dries down quickly, so that the time between that and my sunscreen can be minimized. There needs to be a certain thickness to it, though. If it applies like a serum, it’s a no for me. In addition, while I love when it dries down quickly, a lot of creams designed with this in mind end up taking away more than they add in terms of moisture. Ingredients like dimethicone, silicone, and hydrogenated lecithin leave me oily yet dry - I can tolerate them depending on the cream, but if it is a drawback I’ll mention it.\n\nMy routine is as follows:\n\nAM:\n\n1. Light cleanse (nothing, water, toning pads, or Sanskrit Saponins by NIOD)\n2. Toner\n3. Serum\n4. Daily moisturizer\n5. Sunscreen\n\nPM:\n\n1. Double cleanse\n2. Toner\n3. Serum\n4. Daily Moisturizer\n5. Treatment\n6. Occlusive\n\nI try to stay fragrance free, use as much Niacinamide as I can, and cover Ceramides, Peptides, Beta Glucan, and Panthenol through the routine I choose. I will be using a 5 point system based on my preferences, so stuff like fragrance being a negative for me is obviously not a negative for everyone.\n\nIsntree’s Onion Newpair Gel Cream\n\n4.5/5\n\nThis is a great option and one of their best moisturizers - I am shallow so I won’t lie about being obsessed with the slight purple hue. I’ve seen it retail from $10 USD all the way up to $40, and I have no idea why haha. It is not a holy grail hyperpigmentation treatment, but it is fantastic at evening out skin tone and giving you a nice healthy glow. It has 71% Onion Extract as well as Niacinamide, which are the two main ingredients I would purchase this for. While it has tranexamic acid, a vitamin c derivative, and a bunch of other great ingredients; they are probably all well below .1%. This does dry down pretty quickly, so it makes a fantastic daily moisturizer under sunscreen. What I love about this gel cream is that your face could be violently wet, but this would still apply like a normal moisturizer. It absorbs moisture and locks in whatever you’ve done before better than most, which is a compliment I’d pay to a lot of their gel creams. I wish this one didn’t have dimethicone, though.\n\nIsntree’s C-Niacin Toning Cream\n\n5/5\n\nThis is a very similar cream to the Onion Newpair, but instead of a light purple, it’s a vibrant orange. Trade onions for sea buckthorn, and you’d get this product. This is better to me, though, because of the fact it is their cheapest moisturizer almost at all times, the lovely yet natural smell, and it is the best glow booster I have ever used. It dries down so well, but it will leave you with a glowy, hydrated complexion while staying dry to the touch. It is glass skin in a tube, essentially. The blend of oils, addition of beta glucan, and removal of dimethicone just overall makes this their best cream.\n\nIsntree’s Cica Relief Cream\n\n1.5/5\n\nThis is a strange addition to their catalog and it seems like they’ve phased out the entire line, perhaps to relaunch it as they do. It is one of those creams that further emulsifies on contact with water, so it becomes impossible to use if you use the wet skin method. It is legitimately impossible to blend in without white streaks. The ingredient list is impressive with basically everything you could ask for (especially the peptides whew), but its lack of utility would never make me feel comfortable recommending it. It is also piss-poor at locking in moisture because of this, which is again pretty point defeating.\n\nIsntree’s Hyaluronic Acid Moist Cream\n\n3.5/5\n\nThis is a serum, essentially. I can’t imagine what the Aqua is like, because the Moist version doesn’t lock anything in on a wet face at all. As always, the ingredient list is fire, but this doesn’t succeed as a moisturizer for me. It’s a pretty cost-effective serum, though!\n\nIsntree’s Hyaluronic Acid Water Sleeping Mask\n\n5/5\n\nThis is an all-time great. They struck gold with this formulation, and I hope they never stop making it. I have bought at least 15 of these, and considering how much I like to try new things, something becoming a staple means something haha. I would describe this as a goopy occlusive containing almost no occlusives that somehow just works. If you use it as your final step, your skin will be well protected and wake up so hydrated. If you want to use it as a serum, it absolutely smashes all other hydrating serums and you only need a little. I will alternate between both using it as a serum and an occlusive depending on the weather. One drawback is that it is so THICK that you do need to melt it down in your hands sometimes depending on how much you’re using. \n\nIsntree’s Chestnut PHA Clear Cream\n\n4.5/5\n\nAnother fantastic product that is actually super new. They used to have a PHA sleeping mask that caught them in hot water because it had some fragrant extract (lol), but this updated version adds chestnut extract and removes any fragrance. According to their insta, they wanted this to be more of a daily moisturizer akin to the onion and c-niacin creams, and I’d say they mostly succeeded in doing this. The ingredient list is another humble brag, and I’d say overall this has helped me so much with daily usage. The benefits of getting minor exfoliation every single day kind of speak for themselves. I will say that this doesn’t dry down as well as their other daily moisturizers, but I would just use less of it if this bothers you. I also find it doesn’t “lock in” as well as some moisturizers do, but having a PHA 5% gel cream is just too useful for me to not love it.\n\nIsntree’s Mugwort Spot Gel Cream\n\n4/5\n\nI’m gonna be honest, I find it suspicious that this doesn’t smell like mugwort even a little bit. I could add a drop of One Thing’s Mugwort toner and make this thing so fragrant, so I am just a bit confused there haha. This is very, very similar to the onion and c-niacin creams in the way that it locks in everything really well and dries down quickly. It doesn’t have Niacinamide, which is a bit of a drawback overall to me, but if you are one of the B3 haters out there, then this would be the one for you. It does a great job at reducing redness and was a great medicinal treatment of a burn I got recently. I’d recommend this cream up and down, but it is typically just a bit too expensive for what it is.\n\nIsntree’s Yam Root Cream\n\n5/5\n\nThis is a unique product in their line as it is their only moisturizer outside of the HA sleeping mask that aims to be heavy. It has 57% yam root extract with a bunch of other great, soothing/brightening extracts like rice, soybean, and oat. It also has 5 ceramides and cholesterol, which isn’t a common feature for them. This does dry down pretty well, but not nearly as well as the others, seemingly by design. It applies like a luxury cream and was so similar to Then I Met You’s Renewing Rich Beauty Cream that I just put the rest of the cream in that packaging and mixed it with hemi-squalane to provide even more moisture. This is their best moisturizer for people with dry skin IMO\n\niUNIK’s Propolis Vitamin Sleeping Mask\n\n4.5/5\n\nI love the concept of this cream - both propolis and sea buckthorn joined together. It’s like a trip through the superfoods section of your local supplement shop. This does have niacinamide, but at a probably lower concentration than the other ones above (though who really knows? lol). This one is significant to me because it very firmly locks in everything before it and dries down pretty quickly to a dewy finish. I don’t think it’s the best sleeping mask in the world, but it’s a great daily moisturizer. \n\niUNIK’s Beta Glucan Daily Moisture Cream\n\n3.5/5\n\nY’all already know I love beta glucan, but this cream is the exact same consistency as the HA Moist Cream from Isntree. It is more of a serum for me than a moisturizer. I still loved it in this capacity, but I find their beta glucan serum to be a much better option and just a bit more expensive.\n\niUNIK’s Centella Calming Gel Cream\n\n1/5\n\nThis isn’t even a cream at all, which makes me laugh a little bit. It would make a really watery serum, too. It is a bit fragrant and is essentially an overpriced cica gel. I’d just get Isntree’s Aloe options if you’re looking into this one. I don’t really understand how this is sold as a facial cream.\n\nIlliyoon’s Ceramide ATO Concentrate Cream\n\n3.75/5\n\nThis is of course an HG, but it is a bit drying for winter temps because of the dimethicone/hydrogenated lecithin. Since this dries down while just sitting on your face, it makes your face somehow dry to the touch AND super waxy. The benefits speak for themselves, and it has helped me through some difficult skin eras, but my time of using it has passed. I also think the ceramide beads are a neat trick that does help deliver those ingredients freshly to your skin, they make the product into a bit of a scrub. My skin is sensitive to rubbing/friction over really anything else, so applying this to compromised skin always made me worried even though it helped in the end haha. \n\nIlliyoon’s Ceramide ATO Soothing Gel Cream\n\n4.75/5\n\nImagine if you took what I liked about the Isntree daily moisturizers and reduced it down to the most basic possible ingredient list. This gets docked for only having .05% ceramides, but I don’t really care to be honest. In the world where I stop feeling like trying something new every day, this is what I would choose as my everyday moisturizer and my nightly gel cream as I prefer basic formulations. This is never my final step, but if it is, it will leave your skin looking a bit wet/glassy for a while. It’s somehow dry to the touch during this stage, but a lot of people wouldn’t really love that.\n\nCOSRx’s Hyaluronic Acid Intensive Cream\n\n4/5\n\nIf this came in a tube, I would be giving it a perfect rating, and would actually purchase and use it regularly. The smell is *heavenly*, the consistency is so delightfully goopy, and it goes on like a luxury gel cream. COSRx is legit WILD for making a bunch of creams and somehow ONLY putting their goopy creams in tubs - it’s genuinely illogical. It’s why I’ve never purchased the snail cream - like why would I? lol This also leaves a pretty oily film on your skin after, but I don’t even care. I just love the texture - if I’m ever rich I am going to buy this in bulk and bathe in it.\n\nCOSRx’s Balancium D-panthenol Cream\n\n4/5\n\nThis has silicone and dimethicone, so it does dry down super quickly. It is the only cream of theirs that I’d feel comfortable using as my final step, though, and I find it to be more than enough at night. The drying down aspect makes it a fantastic daily moisturizer, as well. Purito’s 10% is a bit better, but this one would function better as a daily moisturizer. I do like this as it helps firm and even out redness, but I wouldn’t repurchase it unless it was on a good sale.\n\nCOSRx’s Rice Spa Overnight Mask\n\n2.5/5\n\nThis isn’t a sleeping mask, and yes I am docking it for this. This is the same consistency as the Isntree HA Moist Cream/iUNIK Beta Glucan Cream and this one is just egregious because it’s a sleeping mask. It is somehow, at the same time, quite oily looking after. I would compare it to Illiyoon’s ATO Lotion (not reviewed here) in the way that it’s not nearly enough to be a moisturizer while somehow never sinking in and clogging pores lol. I know a lot of people love this one, but it wasn’t for me. I ended up using it on my body.\n\nCOSRx’s Balancium Comfort Ceramide Cream\n\n1.5/5\n\nI really didn’t like this one - it was this gross waxy texture because they went for a “matte balm” texture. This is achieved by making a SUPER emollient cream and adding dimethicone, trimethicone, and hydrogenated lecithin. I am assuming they are trying to duplicate the Ceramidin smell with the bergamot, but this is somehow way more fragrant than anything I’ve used from Dr. Jart (SOMEHOW). It is to me a bit of a formulational failure, so I wouldn’t recommend it; but I am sure this is many people’s holy grail. YMMV\n\nCOSRx’s Propolis Overnight Mask\n\n4.5/5\n\nAnother serum! This one does work as a sleeping mask, but it is a very liquidy texture for such an impressive gel cream. This is one of my favorite CosRx products because it’s basically just propolis goop. If you want to use it as a sleeping mask, your face has to be completely dried down or else it will apply like a serum. I ended up not using it very often, so I added it to my One Thing Mugwort Toner and made a super viscous and frothy toner. I call it Iced Tea.\n\nCOSRx’s Cica Pure Fit Cream\n\n2/5\n\nI experienced no lift on my redness with this, and it dries down to the point where it takes away more than it adds. It has a beautifully thick and creamy texture that goes nowhere once applied. I ended up using this on my body because of the dryness it caused on my face, but this would be a decent daily cream for people as long as it goes under a sunscreen. I used this as a sleeping mask once and my skin was so dry the next day - wouldn’t recommend it at all for that.\n\nRound Lab’s Pine Cream\n\n3.75/5\n\nAyyyyyyyy another serum I actually like. This doesn’t do anything as far as locking in moisture goes, but it’s an awesome antioxidant-based hydrating serum. It has LHA, which is meant to help with evening out your skin tone. I found this was an excellent hydration and glow booster, but it really did help even out my tone. I am a big fan of this one, but considering it isn’t a great moisturizer, I’ll just spring for the serum next time.\n\n9Wishes Pine Cream\n\n1/5\n\nThis, just like Round Lab’s cream, was more of a serum than anything else. It lightly burned on contact (like CeraVe or Paula’s Choice moisturizers) and has terrible pump packaging that makes it super difficult to get the product out. I love the sunscreen and the toner from this line (both perfect 5/5’s), so this was a huge disappointment for me.\n\nApieu’s Madecassoside Gel Cream\n\n5/5\n\nI am surprised I haven’t repurchased this as I was a massive fan. It was scentless to me, which is an experience I haven’t had with any other A'pieu product. It does dry down really well while sealing in everything very well - this is a cream that perfectly strikes the balance for me. It is not so drying that it takes away moisture like some of the creams above, but it’s a great priming moisturizer before sunscreen or makeup. \n\nApieu’s Madecassoside Moisture Gel Cream\n\n3.5/5\n\nIn terms of texture, this is a cream that is directly comparable to Isntree’s Onion Newpair cream for me. Hydrating, moisturizing, and dries down quickly - it’s just blue instead of purple. It does have dimethicone, but I only hold certain ingredients against the product if it seems to do the thing I hate LOL - this isn’t drying and it doesn’t just sit there. It is also quite fragrant, which I wasn’t a fan of. \n\nThen I Met You’s Renewing Rich Beauty Cream:\n\n5/5\n\nThis is the best cream I have ever used, and it makes me so sad because it’s $54. I compared the Yam Root Moisturizer to this, but in reality this has a much more luxurious texture. Imagine if you took an expensive Asian ginseng-based anti-aging cream, removed all the bad ingredients, and put it in beautiful periwinkle packaging. You’d have this.

Recently purchased their Chestnut AHA, haven't tried it yet but now you really made me want to buy that water sleeping mask 😍 \n\nAnd the water sleeping pack seems like a suitable candidate as a lip moisturizer. My current fav lightweight yet effective lip moisturizer is Illiyoon Ceramide Cream's old formula which used leave a wet feeling/finish behind. Most moisturizers don't do this so every single one I've tried has failed as lip moisturizer. Hmm... u/Commercial_Poem_4623 still has the sleeping mask, forgot to ask how it performs on the lips 😆\n\nThis thread is really amazing, I'll definitely share the post link to my friends with dry skin. \n\nIt'd be really great if there's someone else who'd post another thread like this but for oily/combination skin 😆 tho i may not be able to try em all due to my facial eczema, i would love to recommend them to my friends. Some moisturizers in this list would definitely suit oily/combo skin pretty well at least in PM if not AM.",

So I went searching for their MSDS to compare the components they contained to figure out which one I should go for.\n\nWell, Every lemon oil/fretboard conditioners I checked (all the big brands; Dunlop, D'ADDario, Dr.Duck, Music Nomad and more) are 100% White Mineral Oil (CAS# 8042-47-5). Stuff that is supposed to make your strings slick too, like Dunlop 65 Ultra Glide is just mineral oil with <1% silicone oil (Dimethicone) added. And the different brands have different colorings and scents.\n\nSo, on to the savings part. Checked a couple of non-additive baby oils, guess what, same exact white mineral oil (CAS# 8042-47-5). Using CAS number is the best way to identify same compounds, as one compound will only have one CAS number, but the chemical and trade names can be plentiful and confusing.\n\nAnd a bottle of 500ml Johnson's Baby oil is about 2$ and a bottle of 50-100ml \"Lemon oil\" is 5-10$. That's a nice mark up, no wonder everyone has their own Lemon oil to sell you.\n\nEdit: Someone wanted a cross-post to r/bass fro r/guitars, so here it is.",

The previous version of the Allie gel, [Allie Extra UV Gel](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-gel-spf50/)^(E) (without the “N”), was released on February 16, 2018 (2018 formula), and all the presently discontinued formulations released in 2018 and 2019 were also rated SPF 50+ PA++++.\n\nI’ve been using the Allie gel for nearly a decade now, starting with [the second formulation](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-gel-mineral-moist-n/)^(E) released in 2012. [This 2013 article](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/japan-pa-system-for-uva-protection-revised/) from RatzillaCosme reminded me that I picked it up in the first place because it was one of the first sunscreens to be labelled PA++++. I do still try out other sunscreens from time to time, but I always have a tube of the Allie gel open concurrently with anything else I use. I’ve posted about the difference between the 2018 and 2020 formulas [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/gkgwm8/sunscreen_kanebo_allie_februaryapril_2020_new/), and reviews of each version [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/bz8r9t/japanese_sunscreens_allie_extra_uv_gel_highlight/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/jmkjlk/japanese_sunscreens_pt_2_allie_extra_uv_gel_n/), with an update to the 2020 review coming up.\n\n# On testing and reformulations\n\nAfter learning about the loophole in Korean law through [Odile Monod’s video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC8r3S0i0Ro) (via u/bloominglace’s [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mvajyp/korean_sunscreen_controversy_industry/)) and [Instagram Highlights](https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3OTA0MjgzMTIwODUyNTQ4?story_media_id=2553999541407826596_1588058418) (via u/FrenchbunnyG’s [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mvajyp/korean_sunscreen_controversy_industry/gvbbsmz) in the same post), I tried to find information about the laws surrounding SPF/PA testing for reformulated products in Japan (because I live in Japan and therefore use Japanese sunscreens) but kept getting a bunch of hits about testing methods in general, and gave up trying to sift through it all.\n\nThe only product I personally really care about is the Allie gel, so I wrote to Kanebo directly and asked whether they test their reformulated products individually, with the 2018 and 2020 formulas of the Allie gel as an example, or whether their test results are carried over across formulations. Their response as of April 26, 2021 is that they test each version separately (“SPF/PA値の測定に関しまして、それぞれ測定しております”).\n\nI don’t know whether the same goes for all companies in Japan or not, or even for all Kao/Kanebo brands, but that’s one less thing for Allie users to worry about.\n\n*—And after leaving this sitting in my drafts for a couple of weeks, I am adding that* u/ysy_heart *has posted* [*this*](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/n8afq7/discussiondirector_of_japan_cosmetic_industry/) *about what the director of Japan Cosmetic Industry Association said about what their guidelines are on this subject.*\n\n# Hong Kong Consumer Council (October 2020)\n\nIn [the October 2020 report by the Hong Kong Consumer Council](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/jj0n81/sun_care_test_report_of_30_sunscreen_products/)^(E/TC) that everyone keeps referring to, the 2018 formula of the Allie gel (as seen in [the photo](https://imgur.com/seDmooL) published with the report) was rated SPF 61.7 PPD 9.8 (PA+++).\n\n*I’ll post a simplified version of [the results table](https://imgur.com/fPhhBUm)^(E/TC) in the comments, mostly for my own convenience. Pay attention to the countries where they were manufactured, because it won’t always be what you would expect based on the brand name alone (e.g., the Skin Aqua sunscreen they tested is not the version sold in Japan).*\n\nThis report has however been [strongly disputed](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/industry-backlash-against-hong-kong-055209520.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAK4TL438S1-PdoMMNuPEgQDoqSsnxGnrdJkx3KD1AFFKhT954eT6y5wqfPHlPNFMeiTWZ-lR6QpiWq3MZrp6PHVo_bdAglpeqsFmR8XtBe5pnnk4BJt4fd153Auf6s1hr1H2AEnr-eQiw-Q7kFDoSSSO7LigiM7a2-yDLpXE0fxK)^(E) (bold added by me):\n\n>Pharmacology professors also warned that **variations in testing meant some results were not conclusive and flagged as an issue the sampling of Australians for a product designed for Asians**.  \n>\n>\\[…\\]  \n>\n>**The Consumer Council outsourced the checks to laboratory company Eurofins in Australia which tested the PA factor in vitro rather than on human skin.**  \n>\n>The products were analysed under a European Union framework as the city currently does not have regulatory standards in place for measuring SPF and PA effectiveness.  \n>\n>The testing recorded the efficacy of Fancl’s Sunguard 50+ Protect UV sunscreen as SPF 14.3 and PA++, but reports from the United States and China, which both tested on human skin, reported an SPF of above 50 and PA++++.  \n>\n>\\[…\\]  \n>\n>“Although the Consumer Council test was conducted in 2020, they’re using the methods from 2010,” \\[Michelle Ma Chan Mok-lan, co-founder and executive director of Fantastic Natural Cosmetics Limited, the sole distributor of Fancl products in Asia excluding Japan\\] said at a press conference on Wednesday ahead of the watchdog’s publication of results.  \n>\n>\\[…\\]  \n>\n>The International Organisation for Standardisation updated its methods relating to sunscreens in 2019 which recommended testing the SPF level on human skin.  \n>\n>\\[…\\]  \n>\n>Henry Tong Hoi-yee, honorary associate professor at the University of Hong Kong’s department of pharmacology and pharmacy, said that **results reported from a single test should not be deemed conclusive as laboratories varied in their methodology and sample testing, often leading to large disparities**, citing three international scientific papers.  \n>\n>“Personally, I think a re-test \\[of the product\\] is needed in order to determine the reason for the large disparity,” Tong said.  \n>\n>He added that **the Eurofins laboratory results might not be entirely incorrect as it was a reputable institution, but its methods were not holistic enough**.  \n>\n>Professor Bernard Cheung Man-yung, from HKU’s department of medicine and president of the Hong Kong Pharmacology Society, said **the Eurofins report unfairly ran the tests on an Australian audience based on European standards**, rather than relying on a local sample, given **the products tested by the Consumer Council were formulated for Asian skin**.  \n>\n>Cheung said consumers should not rely on sunscreen alone to protect themselves against harsh rays, advising the public to wear light long-sleeved clothing and to shield themselves with a hat or umbrella when exposed to sunlight for long periods of time.\n\n*Excerpted from Kathleen Magramo, “*[*Industry backlash against Hong Kong Consumer Council study which finds 83 per cent of sunscreen products do not meet protective claims*](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/industry-backlash-against-hong-kong-055209520.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAK4TL438S1-PdoMMNuPEgQDoqSsnxGnrdJkx3KD1AFFKhT954eT6y5wqfPHlPNFMeiTWZ-lR6QpiWq3MZrp6PHVo_bdAglpeqsFmR8XtBe5pnnk4BJt4fd153Auf6s1hr1H2AEnr-eQiw-Q7kFDoSSSO7LigiM7a2-yDLpXE0fxK)*,”* South China Morning Post*, October 14, 2020.*\n\n**SPF testing:** According to both [the SPF Testing factsheet](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601368/spf-testing.pdf)^(PDF) and [the ISO Protocol factsheet](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601367/spf-iso-protocol.pdf)^(PDF) that Eurofins links to from [this page](https://www.eurofins.com.au/dermatest/sunscreen-testing/spf-tests-and-related/) on their Australian website, their SPF tests are performed according to the [ISO 24444:2010](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:24444:ed-1:v1:en)^(E) protocol, which they claim is accepted in Japan (p. 1 on the second PDF; Japan is listed twice, even). However, the current standard for SPF testing in Japan is [ISO 24444:2019](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:24444:ed-2:v1:en),^(E) effective as of February 21, 2020 according to [this notice](https://www.jcia.org/user/common/download/business/guideline/spf/SPF-jcia-r020221.pdf)^(J) (linked from [this page](https://www.jcia.org/user/business/guideline/spf)^(J)) issued by the [Japan Cosmetic Industry Association](https://www.jcia.org/en/)^(E) (JCIA)—or maybe it was also accepted before then? JCIA isn’t a government organization, by the way, so I don’t think they can actually enforce anything, but they seem to be in charge of setting industry-wide guidelines and work directly with the government in some capacity. Anyway, the same notice states that ISO 24444:2019 was issued in December 2019. The major changes between the 2010 and 2019 versions are listed in the Foreword of ISO 24444:2019:\n\n>— The definition of the minimal erythema response (MED) criteria has been revised.  \n>\n>— The choice of eligible test subjects is now based solely on individual typology angle (ITA°) with a requirement for the average ITA° for the test panel to be within the range 41° to 55°, with a minimum of three subjects within two of the three ITA° ranges.  \n>\n>— The ITA° is used to define the range of unprotected MED doses for the provisional or the test day unprotected MED determination (if no provisional MEDu determination is made).  \n>\n>— Three new reference standard sunscreens have been validated and added to the method to validate SPF test panels for products with SPF equal to 25 or higher (P5, P6 and P8).  \n>\n>— New test methods are provided to determine the uniformity of the beam of both large and small beam size solar simulators. A requirement for uniformity greater than or equal to 90 % has been added.  \n>\n>— Sunscreen application procedures have been described in greater detail.  \n>\n>— An informative Annex F has been added with photographic examples of erythema responses with guidelines for grading.  \n>\n>— The reporting tables in Annex G) and the requirements in Clause 11 have modified to provide more complete information on the results of the testing.  \n>\n>— The bibliography has been updated.\n\nThe notice from JCIA also lists most of these changes, with a few additional details. They point out for example that the Fitzpatrick skin type is being phased out as criteria for test subjects in favor of individual typology angle (ITA°), which will be relevant later in this post.\n\n*If you have no idea what an “individual typology angle” is (like me), it’s strictly based on skin color and seems much less open to interpretation than the Fitzpatrick skin type criteria. I found* [*this 2013 review article*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/bjd.12529)*^(PDF)* *in the* British Journal of Dermatology *really informative, though I admittedly have only skimmed through it very quickly.*\n\nIt’s possible that Eurofins just hasn’t updated their website, but I think this is what Michelle Ma Chan Mok-lan (Fancl) is talking about in the quote above about the HKCC report using testing methods from 2010. [Fancl Sunguard 50+ Protect UV](https://www.fancl-hk.com/product_details.asp?item_id=5685),^(TC) their product in the report (rated SPF 50+ PA++++ and tested at SPF 14.3 PPD 6.8 or PA++), was apparently released in [2018](https://www.cosme.net/product/product_id/10153767/top)^(J) in Japan, but according to the *South China Morning Post* article, “\\[Ma Chan\\] said that its product went through two rounds of testing by Cantor Research Laboratories in the United States in 2019 and the Chongqing Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital in China in 2017.” (Fancl also seems to point out that their product needs to be shaken before use in [this article](https://beauty.ulifestyle.com.hk/beauty/skincare/20099/fancl防曬-對消委會測試報告表示失望-強調產品完全符合標示-消委會就事件最新回應),^(TC) which could indeed potentially be something that affected the test results. I feel like it’s common knowledge among anyone that’s familiar with milk sunscreens at all, though, and I would hope that any lab conducting these tests would be aware of this. They also seem to say in the same article that any sunscreens that had extremely different test results should be re-tested in more than one lab, which is fair. But keep in mind that I’m reading a machine-translated version of the article for these observations.)\n\nI’m going to ignore the test run in China in 2017 because I believe it would have been following the so-called outdated testing methods, or ISO 24444:2010 (see the section titled “The Chinese version” below). [Cantor Research Laboratories](http://www.cantorlabs.com) basically just has their contact information on the website, so I can’t tell whether they would have conducted their test according to ISO 24444:2019, which would have been possible if the test took place in December. Cantor Research Laboratories was composed of 15 employees and specialized in anti-aging claims [as of 2016](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cen-09419-cover). *(They apparently do testing for Amway, a major MLM company, by the way; try googling* `\"Cantor Research Laboratories\" Amway study`*. —No, I don’t know whether that actally means anything, it’s just something I noticed.)* Eurofins Scientific on the other hand is composed of approximately 50,000 employees in 800 laboratories in 50 countries ([source](https://www.eurofins.com)), though I don’t have numbers for the Australian location specifically. I don’t know whether larger labs would necessarily produce more accurate results, but I would assume they generally wouldn’t be likely to be *less* accurate (or am I completely mistaken?). Interestingly, Dermatest, an Australian lab that was acquired by Eurofins ([source](https://dermatest.com.au)), lists Cantor Research Laboratories among their “Scientific Associates” on [their Links page](https://dermatest.com.au/information/links/). They also cite Cantor Research Laboratories’ Operating Procedure Manual on what appears to be another one of their factsheets, “No. 28 Antiperspirant Efficacy,” published on p. 12 of the February 2017 issue of *The Science of Beauty* (vol. 6 no. 7; [PDF](https://ascc.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SOB-Feb2017.pdf)). On Eurofins’ Australian website, they instruct that samples should be sent to “Eurofins Dermatest,” located at the same address on the Dermatest website ([example](https://www.eurofins.com.au/dermatest/sunscreen-testing/spf-tests-and-related/)), so I’m pretty sure we can think of them as the same entity. Clearly they know of Cantor Research Laboratories, and I wonder what they would say about the discrepancy.\n\nReturning to the *South China Morning Post* article, I assume that “the sampling of Australians for a product designed for Asians” is in reference to SPF testing, not PA testing, since the latter was *in vitro*. According to Eurofins’ [SPF Testing factsheet](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601368/spf-testing.pdf),^(PDF) their test subjects “consisted of fair skin individuals with Fitzpatrick skin types I, II or III” (p. 3). As mentioned above, ISO 24444:2019 no longer uses Fitzpatrick skin types as criteria for test subjects, so I think we can establish that the SPF results in the report cannot be compared directly with any SPF ratings based on ISO 24444:2019. There are however multiple sunscreens that were released before 2020 and would have been based on ISO 24444:2010.\n\nSo referring back to ISO 24444:2010, according to [this PDF from some time before 2013](https://www.tes-h.co.jp/documents/SPFPFA.pdf)^(J)—but I’m not sure whether it’s after 2010—Fitzpatrick skin types I, II, and III were part of the criteria for SPF test subjects (and types II, III, and IV for UVAPF). This would definitely be before 2010, but [this paper](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/sccj1979/26/3/26_3_207/_article/-char/ja/)^(E/J) published by JCIA in 1992 also specifies Fitzpatrick skin types I, II, and III for SPF testing. As discussed below, the same goes for China as of 2015. So it seems like the Eurofins test subjects and test subjects in Japan and China (before ISO 24444:2019) would have the same Fitzpatrick Skin types, but Dr. Dray suggests in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGwjKOHq02w) (“Can we trust sunscreen? Korean SPF controversies,” April 30, 2021) that test subjects in different regions are likely to be skewed toward different skin tones. This is just speculation, but maybe it’s possible that more of the test subjects in Japan and China could have been types II and III, for instance, and more of the test subjects for the HKCC report could have been types I and II. (I’m guessing that this is what Professor Cheung means when he says that “the Eurofins report unfairly ran the tests on an Australian audience \\[…\\] given the products tested by the Consumer Council were formulated for Asian skin.”) In that case, while we absolutely couldn’t say that the ratings for Asian sunscreens are “incorrect” or that the companies are “lying” based on the HKCC report, perhaps the report’s SPF ratings could possibly be pertinent if you have type I skin. But again, this is entirely speculative.\n\n**PA testing:** The Australian Eurofins website seems to confirm that their UVA tests are performed *in vitro*. I’m assuming they follow the [ISO 24443:2012](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:24443:ed-1:v1:en)^(E) protocol (*in vitro*), since they have [a factsheet](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601373/iso-24443-in-vitro-uvapf.pdf)^(PDF) for that too, linked from [this page](https://www.eurofins.com.au/dermatest/sunscreen-testing/spf-tests-and-related/uva-tests/) on UVAPF testing. (ISO 24443:2012 is also mentioned at the bottom of [the report’s results table](https://imgur.com/fPhhBUm)^(TC) in footnotes 4 and 5, but I gave up on trying to figure out what it actually says.) In Japan, however, UVAPF testing is performed according to the [ISO 24442:2011](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:24442:ed-1:v1:en)^(E) protocol (*in vivo*). Eurofins themselves state in this factsheet that both the Japanese and Korean markets require *in vivo* testing, which they also point out is much more expensive than *in vitro* testing (p. 1). They also state that UVAPF ratings determined by these tests are considered **estimates** of Boots Star, FDA Broad Spectrum,\\* and JCIA UVAPF (= what most of us know as PA) ratings (p. 2).\n\n*\\* The FDA website says in vitro testing is accepted in accordance with* [*21 CFR 201.327(j)*](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=b97fda59bb83d2742a276a215cdc115e&mc=true&node=se21.4.201_1327&rgn=div8)*, which I didn’t have the energy to actually read and am assuming is the same thing as Eurofins’ factsheet on* [*FDA Broad Spectrum Testing*](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601376/fda-broad-spectrum.pdf).*^(PDF)* *They say it’s based on ISO 24443:2012 but with “differing film thickness and pre-irradiation requirements” (p. 1).*\n\nIf the UVAPF testing for the HKCC report was indeed in accordance with ISO 24443:2012, I wouldn’t discredit the results entirely—but again, I’m not an expert. While we can’t say that the ratings for Asian sunscreens are “incorrect” or that the companies are “lying” based on the HKCC report (same as the SPF ratings), it seems to me that the PPD ratings they give in the report could potentially be used to make comparisons with sunscreens from other countries where UVAPF ratings are also determined in accordance with the *in vitro* ISO 24443:2012 protocol, or at least with other results within the same report (though we would still have to keep in mind that “results reported from a single test should not be deemed conclusive”). Eurofins’ own factsheet suggests that ISO 24443:2012 is accepted in Australia, New Zealand, and the EU, but I haven’t done any research to back this up, and we have already seen that their factsheets might be outdated.\n\nThe next versions of [ISO 24442](https://www.iso.org/standard/75496.html)^(E) and [ISO 24443](https://www.iso.org/standard/75059.html)^(E) are about 40% through their respective development processes, by the way, so that’s something to keep an eye on if you’re looking into this stuff.\n\n**EDIT:** u/lovethewayyoulick has posted [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/nds8nn/discussion_on_spfpa_testing_in_japan_and_the/gycvnq4/) about the formulation of Allie sunscreens, specifically regarding Kao/Kanebo’s proprietary “[ADVAN Technology](https://www.kao.com/jp/skincare/surface/surface-02/),\" the name ADVAN coming from “Anti-Damaging uV-A Network.” In a nutshell, their sunscreens are designed to work with sebum to provide higher UVA protection, which would not be reproducible with standard *in vitro* testing. It also seems to explain why Allie sunscreens don't always do too well in casual experiments using light-sensitive materials (as I discuss in the section I had to delete for length posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/nds8nn/discussion_on_spfpa_testing_in_japan_and_the/gyc9sqv/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)). I’m now also thinking of other Japanese sunscreens that claim to work with different factors to increase their protection. Shiseido’s [Anessa](http://anessa.shiseido.co.jp/about/) sunscreens, for instance, advertise their “Thermo-Booster Technology” to work with heat and “Aqua-Booster Technology” to work with sweat and water. These product-specific factors may not necessarily be taken into account in third party testing.\n\n**Other possible issues:** Even after looking into all this (without actually reading all the publicly available details in each ISO… sorry, that’s beyond my mental capacity right now), I still don’t know whether the difference between the testing methods would really explain the larger disparities in the SPF results, like the Fancl sunscreen. I’ve seen some of you make a very good point that how old the bottle used for the test is (and I would assume things like storage conditions; last summer was a particularly hot one, and some supplements I ordered from the US arrived practically melted together in the bottle) or even the specific batch could potentially affect test results, too.\n\nFor more information about the actual testing methods, see [\\[Discussion\\]How SPF and PA are measured in Japan](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mqysux/discussionhow_spf_and_pa_are_measured_in_japan/) by u/ysy_heart. (I want to note that the SPF testing methods described here are based on ISO 24444:2010 and have technically been phased out, but it seems general enough to be at least mostly applicable for ISO 24444:2019, too.)\n\n*—Phew, that was long! I keep seeing this report being mentioned, so I wanted to try my best to do my due diligence. I don’t have a background in science, though, and it’s my first time even actually looking at ISOs, so I’m sorry if I’m completely off.*\n\n# National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan (May 2020)\n\nIn another [report by the National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mx54m7/discussionthirdparty_testing_on_27_japanese/)^(E) published in May 2020, either the 2018 formula or the 2020 formula of the Allie gel (unclear) was confirmed to be SPF 50+ PA++++ in two out of two tests using a spectrophotometer, though I’m honestly skeptical of the general accuracy of these tests, seeing how four sunscreens claiming to be SPF 30–35 tested consistently at SPF 50+. I guess Japanese companies *could* plausibly be motivated to label their products with lower ratings than what they actually are, since many consumers here believe that high-SPF products are rough on your skin and can actively seek lower-SPF products for daily use, but as an amateur, it seems like it would be easier to actually make a low-SPF product if that’s what you want to sell.\n\nAgain, these tests were performed with an *entirely* different method, and I imagine their results can only be used to draw comparisons with other results in this same report, if anything at all. (For more information on the testing method, see u/ysy_heart’s research and thoughts in the link for the report.)  If there’s so much hubbub about the testing methods in the HKCC report, I’m sure testing with a spectrophotometer would be even further off. I want to give the NCACJ credit for at least running each test twice instead of just doing it once and being done with it, but I also don’t know whether running the spectrophotometer tests even a hundred times would necessarily be credible.\n\nAlso, although the HKCC report seems to have product name errors too (I’ll cut them some slack because they’re dealing with products from other countries, and the photo helps with product identification), I can definitively say that the report the NCACJ published has [some mistakes and ambiguities](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mx54m7/discussionthirdparty_testing_on_27_japanese/gvsj5eh).^(E) This doesn’t necessarily mean that the tests themselves are equally faulty, but it does make me wary of any other potential mistakes in printing the test results.\n\n# The Chinese version\n\nThe Allie gel is also rated SPF 50+ PA++++ [in China](https://allie.cn)^(SC) (and SPF 45 PA++++ after being immersed in water according to [their official TMall page](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?spm=a212k0.12153887.0.0.1a67687dAgrr3k&id=596686898582),^(SC) if I’m interpreting “浴后防晒指数” correctly), where they require testing at National Medical Product Administration (NMPA) accredited labs in China, as well as additional *in vivo* testing ([source](https://www.cosmeticsdesign-asia.com/Article/2019/08/19/Sunscreen-regulations-in-the-world-from-European-Union-USA-Canada-to-China)^(E)). The NMPA-approved testing methods seem to be detailed in [this 11 MB PDF](https://www.nmpa.gov.cn/directory/web/nmpa/images/MjAxNcTqtdoyNji6xbmruOa4vbz+LnBkZg==.pdf)^(SC) of their Safety and Technical Standards for Cosmetics (2015), SPF testing from p. 546 and PA or PFA testing from p. 554. I’ve given up on trying to decipher everything, but it appears that their SPF testing either follows or is based on ISO 24444:2010 (so it might have been updated by now), using test subjects with Fitzpatrick skin types I, II, and III, and their PA testing either follows or is based on ISO 24442:2011, using test subjects with Fitzpatrick skin types III and IV.\n\nInitially I was satisfied in thinking of this as another separate test performed on the Allie gel, but then it occurred to me that I don’t know whether the Chinese version has the same formulation as the Japanese version or not, though I assume they would at least be very similar. [Based on the packaging](https://imgur.com/a/WbH2gAS),^(E) I’m guessing that the current version there is basically equivalent to Allie Extra UV Gel (the 2018 formula in Japan). [This page](https://www.jeebei.com/pingce/hufupin/ql1z6.html) lists the ingredients as follows:\n\n> 水，乙醇，氧化锌，三乙氧基辛基硅烷，甲氧基肉桂酸乙基己酯，丁羟甲苯，甘油三（乙基己酸）酯，异壬酸异壬酯，丙烯酸钠/丙烯酰二甲基牛磺酸钠共聚物，异十六烷，聚山梨醇酯-80，丁二醇，甘油，双-乙基己氧苯酚甲氧苯基三嗪，乙基己基三嗪酮，聚二甲基硅氧烷，黄原胶，EDTA 二钠，水解胶原，苯氧乙醇，透明质酸钠\n\nThis translates to:\n\n> Water, Ethanol, Zinc Oxide, Trimethoxycaprylylsilane, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, BHT, Triethylhexanoin, Isononyl Isononanoate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Polysorbate 80, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\nThis is the ingredient list for the Japanese 2018 formula, according to the packaging of a tube I bought in a major drugstore in Japan:\n\n> Water, Zinc Oxide, Ethanol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Triethylhexanoin, Isononyl Isononanoate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Isohexadecane, Polysorbate 80, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, BHT, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Collagen\n\n*Both are my own translations and I don’t have a background in chemistry. Also, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate = Octinoxate, Ethylhexyl Triazone = Uvinul T 150, and Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine = Tinosorb S.*\n\nObviously, the order of the ingredients differ, but I don’t know whether China has the same rules about the order of the ingredients or not. One definitively different point, though, is that the Chinese version contains Phenoxyethanol and the Japanese version doesn’t. So while I can’t say how different or similar the two versions might be, it’s clear that they aren’t exactly the same.\n\nIt’s been pointed out that the [Bioré UV Athlizm essence](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/biore-uv-athlizm-skin-protect-essence/)^(E) and the [Bioré UV Aqua Rich gel](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/biore-uv-aqua-rich-watery-gel-2019/)^(E) and [essence](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/biore-uv-aqua-rich-watery-essence-2019/)^(E) are all rated SPF 50+ PA+++ [in China](https://www.kao.com/cn/products/biore/),^(SC) and not SPF 50+ PA++++ as they are rated in Japan, but since they are sold ~~(and possibly manufactured)~~ locally by Kao (China) Holding Co., Ltd. rather than as import products from Japan, you would have to consider the possibility that they may not necessarily have the same formulation as the Japanese equivalents.\n\n**EDIT:** I’ve just figured out that the Chinese versions of the Allie gel and Bioré UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence are made in Japan with different formulations specifically for the Chinese market. See links re: each product [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/nds8nn/discussion_on_spfpa_testing_in_japan_and_the/gyhq3fu).\n\nSimilarly, RatzillaCosme says in a comment on [this page](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/skin-aqua-uv-super-moisture-gel-spf50-4-plus/) that “Rohto products that are marketed for outside of Japan have different ingredients/formulas than Japan’s and they’re not Japan-made (despite the Japanese printed). If the Japanese version is what you want, both the packaging and product name need to be exactly the same as what \\[is\\] shown in my site.” They also say in a comment [here](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/skin-aqua-uv-super-moisture-essence-2020/) in response to an inquiry about [Sunplay Skin Aqua](http://www.mentholatum.com.cn/home/products/skincare/sunplay/index.shtml) Watery Essence SPF 50+ PA++++ (I’m not sure but possibly [this](http://www.mentholatum.com.cn/home/products/skincare/sunplay/detail-75.shtml)^(SC)), “That product isn’t Japanese — it’s made in China by a different company. It isn’t produced by Rohto Pharmaceutical in Japan.” (Credit goes to someone on this sub for mentioning that Ratzilla talks about this in their comments section. I’m sorry I can’t remember who it was.) Going back to the HKCC report, the results table says that [Sunplay Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Gel](http://www.mentholatum.com.cn/home/products/skincare/sunplay/detail-72.shtml)^(SC) is manufactured in China (in addition to the “Sunplay” in the product name already being a giveaway; in Japan, [Mentholatum Sunplay](https://jp.rohto.com/uv-sunplay/) is a separate Rohto brand alongside Skin Aqua, so “Sunplay Skin Aqua” doesn’t exist), so the results in the report would not necessarily be applicable for the Japanese product, not to mention the other concerns I discussed.\n\nSo the situation arises where there are products that aren’t “fake” but also aren’t exactly the same thing as what’s sold in Japan, kind of like how the American versions of LRP sunscreens wouldn't contain their more advanced filters (which is probably more drastic of a difference than what I’m discussing here). This might be especially important for anyone buying the product from non-Japanese vendors. Double check to make sure you’re getting the version you intended to buy—and if you specifically wanted the non-Japanese version, that’s great too. Like [the American and Japanese Curél Intensive Moisture Creams](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/labr3m/difference_between_japanese_and_american_version/), it’s possible that the end result (the user experience) is pretty much the same anyway, but in the case of sunscreen, make sure you know what the SPF/PA rating is for the exact version you’re buying.\n\n# Using sunscreens from major corporations\n\nIn [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNsoPyo1PjA)^(J) posted on March 26, 2020, skinfluencer Arata Tomori says that SPF testing is usually outsourced to a third party lab, and that PA testing is often performed in-house (I haven’t looked into this). She says that different labs can come up with different results, and based on her own past experience with trying to make a sunscreen (I think she has her own skincare line), she has heard of labs that are actually known to give higher SPF ratings. She recommends that we stick with major corporations that are more likely to be working with labs that would provide accurate results.\n\nIn [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTS0Xd-T97s)^(J) posted on March 28, 2020, cosmetic chemist YouTuber Sumisho discusses issues with SPF ratings in general, with the AMA Laboratories case in the US as an example. He says we should be careful with smaller brands, and advises that it’s a good idea to pick products that are made by major corporations that put a lot into sunscreen R&D. He also advises that products sold in China go through additional testing and could be more reliable, and that you could check Tmall for listings, but I want to add again that you would need to make sure you’re looking at the version you want.\n\nOdile Monod also breaks down the difference between OBM, OEM, and ODM products in [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC8r3S0i0Ro) I mentioned earlier. Although she’s talking about the Korean beauty industry, I think this part probably applies for other countries, too, and she advises that it’s (not necessarily foolproof but) a good idea to pick OBM products that are formulated and manufactured in-house.\n\nAnd now [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/n8afq7/discussiondirector_of_japan_cosmetic_industry/) about the response u/ysy_heart got from the JCIA director can be interpreted to back up this approach as well. I’m generally in favor of indie brands in spirit, and usually I would think more about how these people might be benefiting from making these claims, but I do see how major corporations would have a lot more to lose from these sunscreen scandals. I also don’t think I’ve seen companies like Amorepacific (for instance) mentioned in connection with the recent scandal in Korea.\n\nI’m still looking up different sunscreens and who actually manufactures them, but the Kao Group (including Kanebo), the Kosé Group, the Pola Orbis Group, the Rohto Group, and the Shiseido Group are some major Japanese corporations that seem to generally have OBM products. I have a huge spreadsheet in progress that I plan on sharing whenever I think it’s ready, with specific products from these companies (and others) and some properties I wanted to compare.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nIf you’re *really* concerned about the accuracy of SPF/PA ratings, I guess the truly thorough approach would be to look at as many tests as possible. You could either stick with the sunscreens that consistently do well in third party testing (guilty until proven innocent) or avoid those that consistently do poorly (innocent until proven guilty).\n\nThe problem with this approach is that it just isn’t realistic, especially considering how frequently Japanese sunscreens are reformulated. A test result from last year might not be applicable for a product that was reformulated this year. You would have to make sure where the product tested was manufactured and what year it was released, and then there are the potential issues with storage conditions and different batches, etc. Also, “real” testing is expensive, and it’s not all that likely that there would be multiple credible third party tests following official protocols performed on the same formulation.\n\nAs Professor Tong says in the *South China Morning Post* article, we should probably accept that no single test is going to be an absolutely definitive one. Personally, with regard to what I’m already using, if it’s keeping my sun allergy symptoms from showing up, that’s good enough for me—but I guess you could say that I have the advantage (?) of my face being a hypersensitive UV meter of sorts. As for any products I might try in the future, I’m going to keep trusting the ratings as they are claimed unless there’s a scandal specifically involving that product. We *are* already taking a kind of leap of faith in trusting that the product is otherwise safe to use and that the ingredient list is correct and so on. And regardless of any tests results, even good ones, I would make sure to apply plenty, to reapply, and to avoid relying on sunscreen alone, especially if I’m going to be outside for an extended amount of time.",

I’ve been living in Japan for over 10 years, and am under the impression that the general consensus among Japanese consumers is that you use either Anessa or Allie if you don’t want to tan/burn, Anessa being top-level protection and Allie coming in second while also being easier on your skin. (This seems to specifically be based on Anessa’s [flagship milk](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/anessa-perfect-uv-sunscreen-skincare-milk-a-2020/)^(E) and Allie’s gel products, even though Anessa also has gels and Allie also has a milk.)\n\nThis doesn’t necessarily mean they’re absolutely the best sunscreens in the entire Japanese market, of course—the products discussed on this sub represent just a small fraction of all the sunscreens available in Japan—nor do I know how they would really compare with European sunscreens (which I’ve never used, aside from a couple of Asia/Australia-specific LRP products), but it does suggest that they must at least be among the best that are commonly available in drugstores nationwide.\n\nAllie sunscreens seem to do well in those completely unscientific experiment memes where people apply a ton of different sunscreens on their backs and lay out in the sun:\n\n|**Video/Article**|**Sunscreens and UV source**|**Conclusion**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Sunameri for Kakaku.com, [人気の日焼け止め10種を徹底比較！ 日サロで肌を焼いて効果を確かめてみた](https://kakakumag.com/houseware/?id=11834), January 14, 2019|10 sunscreens including Allie Extra UV Gel (2018 formula);

I religiously used the Biore sunscreen in high school but I still got a little tan at the end of summer, so I moved \"up\" to Allie sunscreen once I graduated and I haven't looked back since. I always got a little worried about these reports coming out about my beloved Allie sunscreen, but I feel confident about it now. I went to the sunny beaches Australia, Okinawa, Thailand, and Hawaii with my Allie sunscreen and I've never gotten a bad tan! Granted, I was wearing sunglasses, a hat, and occasionally a sun umbrella but I think that proves your final thoughts - apply plenty and reapply, reapply, reapply!",

I personally would go for the Be Plain when it's available because it has a simplified formula without the unnecessary plant extracts and flower oils. I think the Be Plain one would be better for oily skin than the Round Lab one. Both of the Hyggee sunscreens look promising, but I'm gravitating towards the Vegan Sun Cream because it is a chemical sunscreen and I have a tan complexion, I don't want to risk a white cast. However, the Real Sun Cream does have an interesting ingredient list and whipped texture (as I can see on Yesstyle)  and I will be looking out for reviews to see whether it leaves a white cast or not and make my decision accordingly. What I love about the Hyggee sunscreens is that they are fragrance/essential oil free, but they still contain alcohol. I prefer alcohol because it allows the sunscreen to set better and be less tacky. If you have oily skin, I would think that one of the Hyggee sunscreens would work better for you because I have a Kolmar sunscreen (Isntree Watery Sun Gel) that is similar to the new Round Lab and Be Plain sunscreens and I definitely wouldn't recommend it for oily skin as it is way too shiny.\n\nEdit: I just noticed that the Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream has beet root extract, which made me think of the Krave Beet Shield. Get this, the Beet Shield was also made in Cosmax, same as this new Hyggee one. So I did some digging and found out that the Beet Shield has the SAME exact 5 filters as this new Hyggee sunscreens in the same order. The rest of ingredients are not too similar though, so I do not think they are the same exact sunscreen, as opposed to how I feel about the Be Plain and Round Lab sunscreens, which I do think are almost identical. I do think this Vegan Sun Cream is inspired by the Beet Shield, with maybe an improved formula, since the Beet Shield did not pass SPF tests. So if you are looking for a replacement of the Krave Beauty Beet Shield but with verified SPF protection, get the new Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream!",

Anyway, Biore claims that these products stay on evenly in severely hot and humid weather. This gets me very excited as I live in a very hot and humid area (75% - 85% and 30°C to 37°C during day time) so I would like to test this ~~or these~~ as soon as I get my hands on them. Will be sold from 9th February 2019 in-store with limited availability on Japanese online stores at an earlier date priced at [1944 JPY RRP](https://www.amazon.co.jp/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?__mk_ja_JP=カタカナ&url=search-alias%3Dbeauty&field-keywords=ビオレ+UV+アスリズム+スキンプロテクト). ~~internal cries and gasp~~ but to be fair it has more grammes. \n\n**Ingredients**:\n\n~~Again, hasn't been released but mentioned:~~\n\n* ~~Hyaluronic Acid, Royal Jelly extract, and Butelyne Glycol (moisturising ingredients).~~\n* ~~White floral scent (made from natural fragrances), Citrus, Musky Wood.~~\n\nEssence: \n\nWater, ethanol, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, ethylhexyl triazone, isopropyl palmitate, (lauryl methacrylate / sodium methacrylate) cross-polymer, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate (Uvinul A Plus), hydrogenated polyisobutene, sodium acrylates copolymer, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine (Tinosorb S), dextrin palmitate, BG, (acrylates / C10-30 alkyl acrylate) crosspolymer, alkyl benzoate (C12-15), glycerin, propanediol, potassium hydroxide, glyceryl behenate, hydroxyethylcellulose, (vinyl dimethicone / methicone silsesquioxane) crosspolymer,  pullulan,  cetyl alcohol , sorbitan distearate, stearoyl glutamic acid, arginine, EDTA-2Na,BHT, royal jelly extract, sodium hyaluronic acid, phenoxyethanol, fragrance.\n\nMilk: \n\nCyclopentasiloxane, zinc oxide, ethanol, water, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, (lauryl methacrylate / sodium methacrylate) cross-polymer, dimethicone, hydrogenated polyisobutene, isopropyl palmitate, talc, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate (Uvinul A Plus), titanium oxide, alkyl (C30-45) dimethylsilyl polypropylsilsesquioxane, polymethylsilsesquioxane, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine (Tinosorb S), Butelyne Glycol, PEG-12 dimethicone, triethoxycaprilsilane, PEG-3 dimethicone, Aluminium hydroxide, stearic acid, methicone, BHT, royal jelly extract, sodium hyaluronate, phenoxyethanol, fragrance.\n\n**So, what are their claims?**\n\n* **Unique durable \"Tough Boost\" technology:**\n   * Supposedly stays on skin even during hot and humid conditions of 40°C and 75% humidity even when skin perspires or sweats.\n   * Super waterproof which lasts 80 minutes through water resistance tests but easily cleansed.\n   * Usable as a makeup base (so...white cast? primer?)\n* **Two versions**:\n   * Water-based essence (70 g): fresh and moist feeling that leaves the skin with a smooth sensation.\n   * Oil-based milk (65 ml): silky touch that glides on the skin with a light-weight sensation, no stickiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ii2mnvhve8621.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=3215d1e3ed7e8e9b5eabc5a3b78bcdbe9f3553f6\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that Biore UV SaraSara Line (so, Perfect Milk, Bright Milk, Face Milk and Spray) is repackaged but no reformulation. Only the cardboard packagings seem to change to my eyes.\n\n[Here if you want to see the complete list of Biore UV lines (in Japanese).](https://www.kao.co.jp/bioreuv/itemcheck/) On the table there are star ratings. The first one is its suitability for children and the second is how well it interacts with makeup (whether makeup slip or not).",

It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

No white cast whatsoever :)|Has a significant sheen. Doesn't like to \"sink in\" on the face; remains spreadable and moves around. Doesn't rub in evenly; leaves white streaks on the face that are literally impossible to 100% blend out (also [these tiny white specks](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ff5f815faede7ce5649a190212000a4a/tumblr_pnuvm7CC2x1vnh3sio1_540.jpg)).

Shine leans more dewy than oily. Despite the shine this is neither moisturizing nor drying.|Still has a white cast (though it fades very slightly) and looks shinier than the shaka. On the face it looks quite ridiculous and I always find the need to powder over it to hide the cast and shine. The shine is not \"dewy\", it's definitely oily. I would not say this is wearable for any skin tones darker than NC30 without a colored foundation/powder on top.

In both cases I was sufficiently protected; no burns or tans, no deepening of PIH (and I tan/get PIH very easily -- most US and Asian formulations aren't protective enough for me). For me this works just as well as the old formulation, if not better.\n\n\\--\n\nOverall, I was pleasantly surprised by this reformulation. Not only is it more cosmetically elegant in terms of both shine and white cast, but it has a slightly higher PPD and doesn't contain octocrylene, which was one of the ingredients I didn't quite like in the old formula. \n\nI will continue to purchase this sunscreen and look forward to seeing how it holds up in higher (summer) UV indices.",

I’d add in a bit more hydration under your eyes (you can use eye creams but a thicker moisturiser works well), allow plenty of time for your moisturiser to sink in, and trial without primer. If that doesn’t work then I’d try a different foundation that isn’t silicone based. I used to have REALLY oily skin and found that they slid around and separated on me too much.

It is unlikely that gold provides any notable benefits.**\n\n**The retail price of $100 is not justified by any ingredients or similar product retail prices.**\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\nThis is going to be long, but with everything going around about this moisturizer, I thought it was important to do some actual research on this product and its claims. There are a few things I want to clear up before I start:\n\n\\- This is not a post to start drama or to say bad things about Boxycharm OR Faccia Skin. This is simply research on the claims of the product and whether or not there is evidence that these claims are true. I intend to make NO speculations about this and only present the facts as I can find them (and cite them). If I do make any speculations, please call me out for it and I will remove them.\n\n\\- I am not going to tell you whether or not to use this product. This is just the information I think you should have to make an educated decision for yourself.\n\n\\- I have no stake in this product and hope that makes me as unbiased as possible. I don’t receive premium, and I don’t intend to buy. None of what I say here is based on my experience with the product OR any reviews of the product. \n\nFinally, the intention of this is to investigate these claims based on being an “average consumer.” I know that the actual average consumer does not actually do this much research. What I mean by this is that all this information comes from available online databases and resources, and the first couple pages of Google. I’m not doing a deep dive into any Instagram pages or people’s private lives to find this information. I intend for all of it to be easily verifiable by anyone who wants to find it.\n\nI will investigate 4 things about this product: cruelty free claims, safety of ingredients, benefit claims, and retail value.\n\n**Cruelty Free Claims:**\n\nAccording to [Cruelty Free Kitty](https://www.crueltyfreekitty.com/cruelty-free-101/cruelty-free-bunny-logo/) there are no laws to regulate when a company claims to be cruelty free. However, there are three organizations that have standards to verify a company’s cruelty-free status, and then allow them to use their logo to indicate to consumers that the product has met that set of standards. \n\nFaccia skin uses the PETA “Beauty without Bunnies” logo on their packaging, which means they claim to meet PETA’s standards as a cruelty-free company/product. Also according to Cruelty Free Kitty, if a company uses the logo but does not appear on PETA’s list of approved companies, you CANNOT verify that the product is cruelty-free.\n\nFaccia Skin DOES NOT appear on PETA’s list of approved companies, despite using the logo. According to PETA, in order to use the logo, a company must first be verified as Cruelty-Free by PETA, and THEN is able to pay a one-time $100 licensing fee to use the logos on their products ([PETA](https://www.peta.org/about-peta/learn-about-peta/info-businesses/beauty-without-bunnies-program/)). That means that if Faccia Skin is using the logo, they should already be on the list despite being a new company. The FAQ also suggests that this list is updated frequently so consumers are always up to date with additions, deletions, and other changes. [PETA FAQ can be found here.](https://features.peta.org/cruelty-free-company-search/index.aspx)\n\n**TL;DR – Faccia Skin’s cruelty-free status cannot be verified.**\n\nNote here: Other research on this sub has suggested that this company is owned by the same owner as DLS cosmetics, which is both PETA and Leaping Bunny certified. They may be licensing the logo legally, but from what I can tell, does not verify the cruelty-free status of this brand specifically. \n\n**Safety of Ingredients:**\n\nThis is the list of ingredients for this moisturizer on Faccia’s website:\n\nWATER, GLYCERIN, GOLD, HYDROLYZED SERICIN, CARBOMER, BETAINE, TAURINE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, TRIETHANOLAMINE, NIACINAMIDE, BUTANEDIOL, POLYSORBITULE-20, PALMITOYL OLIGOPEPTIDE, PALMITOYL TETRAPEPTIDE-7, ACETYL TETRAPEPTIDE-5, ACETYL HEXAPEPTIDE-8, EDTA-2NA, HYDROLYZED PEARL, FUCUS VESICULOSUS EXTRACT, SODIUM POLYACRYLATE, PEG-40, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, METHYLPARABEN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, DIAZOLIDINYL UREA, IODOPROPYNYL BUTYLCARBAMATE, PARFUM, CI19140\n\nVia SkinCarisma, 8 products on this list have an EWG Health Rating of “Moderate” or “High” risk.\n\nModerate risk:\n\nGold – SkinCarisma identifies this as a “cosmetic colorant” with no benefits\n\nTriethanolamine – This has a comodogenic rating of (2). Incidecoder says that this ingredient is generally safe, but can form carcinogens if it is included in a product with nitra-/nitro- type ingredients. I don’t see any of those ingredients in this list.\n\nMethylparaben – This is a paraben (obviously). There is nothing directly unsafe about using this ingredient. There was a 2006 study that found that skin cells treated with MP had more harmful exposure to sunlight than non-MP treated skin cells. This study was done in a lab and not on actual human skin, so there’s no direct link to this being harmful. When in doubt, wear sunscreen\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea – A preservative, This ingredient is controversial because it belongs to a family of ingredients that may break down into formaldehyde when added to a formula. A 1990 study found that it is safe in concentrations of <0.5%. The evidence on this is unclear, and since we don’t know what the concentration of this ingredient is, I can’t say definitively if it is safe or not. Use your best judgement.\n\nIodopropynyl Butylcarbamate – Also a preservative. This is safe in concentrations of less than 0.1%, and has an extremely low rate of skin irritation. Since we don’t know what the concentration of this ingredient is, I can’t say definitively if it is safe or not. Use your best judgement.\n\nHigh Risk:\n\nButane – Incidecoder brings this up as Butanediol, which is a solvent to help products absorb faster. Its safety has not yet been questioned. It’s sometimes used as a food additive. HOWEVER the ingredients list does actually say Butane and not Butanediol which is used as a propellant. It’s still safe but it doesn’t make sense for an ingredient that is not aerosolized.\n\nFragrance – The problem with this ingredient is that “fragrance” is a general term that can be made up of an average of 30-50 chemicals that aren’t required to be disclosed. A lot of products use this term and are still safe, but because all the ingredients are not disclosed, we can’t say for sure. Use your best judgement.\n\nOther:\n\nPolysorbate 20 – listed as a fungal acne trigger, but is an emulsifier and is safe.\n\nYou can find all this information at incidecoder.com and skincarisma.com\n\n**TL;DR : Basic judgement says that this product is safe to use, unless you are sensitive to fragrances or other ingredients on this list, react to comedogenic products, or have fungal acne.**\n\n**Benefit Claims:**\n\nOn Faccia Skin’s website, they make the following claims about this product:\n\nHydrate skin – We can expect this result based on moisturizing ingredients (glycerin, betaine, sodium hyaluronate, niacinamide, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, PEG-40, Propylene Glycol)\n\nAnti-aging – SkinCarisma lists Niacinamide as the only anti-aging ingredient.\n\nStrengthen skin – SkinCarisma lists Sodium Hyaluronate as an ingredient to promote would healing. Incidecoder also suggests that there are peptides in the ingredients which act as “cell-communicating” agents. Peptides are fairly common in other products that claim strengthening benefits.\n\nEnhance skin “radiance” – We can expect this based on the ingredient Niacinamide as well as moisturizing ingredients. Skincarisma lists Niacinamide as a “brightening” ingredient.\n\nReduce damaging environmental factors – This may be aided by Sodium Hyaluronate as a “wound-healing” ingredient.\n\nIt’s important to note that neither of these ingredient databases list gold as an ingredient with any skin benefits. Here’s some research on the benefits (or not) of gold for the skin from what I believe to be trustworthy sources:\n\n[https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/sensitizing/gold.html](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/sensitizing/gold.html)\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/fashion/27skinWEB.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/fashion/27skinWEB.html)\n\n**TL;DR – We can expect for this product to perform as it claims based on its ingredients. It is unlikely that gold provides any notable benefits.**\n\n**Retail Price:**\n\nI did a quick search of “best 24k gold moisturizers” to compare retail prices for other notable products. It’s hard for me to definitively test the “retail price” claim unless there was a very similar product out there that I can find. So I’ll have to base this on comparisons as well as knowledge of the ingredients themselves. I don’t know the exact volume of the cream in mL so we are going to assume for now that 50g = 1.6 fl oz someone can get me the actual volume I will change this. So $100 for 1.6 oz is $62.5/oz\n\n[Orogold](https://www.orogoldcosmetics.com/shop/orogold-cosmetics/white-gold/24k-deep-moisturizer/) 24K deep moisturizer: $55/oz \n\n[Physicians Formula](https://www.physiciansformula.com/physicians-formula-24-karat-gold-collagen-moisturizer.html) 24k Gold Collagen Moisturizer: $12.5/oz \n\n[Chantecaille](https://www.neimanmarcus.com/p/chantecaille-nano-gold-energizing-cream-1-7-oz-prod50660039?childItemId=NMC0BE1_) Nano Gold Energizing Face cream: $247/oz \n\n[Farsali](https://www.sephora.com/product/rose-gold-elixir-P417139) Rose Gold Elixer (24k infused) - $54/oz \n\n[Peter Thomas Roth](https://www.sephora.com/product/24k-gold-mask-pure-luxury-lift-firm-mask-P392607) 24k Gold Mask - $17/oz \n\n[Nuface](https://www.ulta.com/gel-primer-24k-gold-complex-brighten?productId=xlsImpprod13521083) Gel Primer 24k Gold Complex - $19.5/oz \n\n[Ahava](https://www.ulta.com/24k-gold-mineral-mud-mask?productId=pimprod2004002) 24K Gold Mineral Mud Mask - $34/oz \n\nThe Faccia cream has a price/oz most similar to the Orogold and the Farsali products, and is much cheaper than the Chantecaille cream which is a luxury brand sold at Neiman Marcus. Comparing the Chantecaille incredients list to the Faccia cream, they are very different. The luxury cream has a huge list of various plant oils, extracts and perfumes. That doesn’t make it better, but it does have more ingredients. The Faccia base of water and Glycerin is similar to other water based moisturizers like Neutrogena Hydroboost, Simple, and even Tatcha Water Cream (although all 3 of those contain dimethicone and variants). Tatcha contains some more ingredients like plant extracts. It’s difficult to compare the ingredients lists of the Farsali and Orogold because the textures of the products are so different. However, the Farsali oil ONLY contains 24k gold, vitamin E, and plant oils as the ingredients, and is still cheaper than the Faccia moisturizer. Additionally, the Orogold lists Gold as one of the last few ingredients.\n\nThere doesn’t appear to be anything in the ingredients list other than gold that would justify such a high retail price. Even other notable brands sold at Ulta and Sephora with gold in them do not reach that retail price, which suggests that the gold alone would not be enough to justify such a high retail price. In fact, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate and Methylparaben are all described as “cheap” ingredients on Incidecoder. One of the other star ingredients, niacinamide, is in a lot of products, and I can’t find anything that would indicate it is expensive. You can buy a niacinamide 10% suspension from The Ordinary for less than $6/oz.\n\n**TL;DR: The retail price of $100 is not justified by any ingredients or similar product retail prices.**\n\nMy conclusion: There is nothing wrong with this product at face value since It is safe for most people to use. If cruelty-free products are important to you, I would not use this product until the company’s cruelty free status is verified. As far as retail value goes, there isn’t any reason for you to repurchase at the retail price, unless you love this stuff and you can afford it. For other people, a basic silicone-free gel moisturizer with niacinamide should give you similar results for a lower price point. You can make your own decision about whether you should use it, but now you are educated on what it is, and you hopefully have a better idea of what you’re putting on your body.",

I have used expensive face creams like Elizabeth Arden Prevage line and see benefits for the cost for that particular brand.  However, I agree that a good moisturizer doesn’t have to cost very much.  Follow the process of cleansing, toning, serum, exfoliating, moisturizer...the massaging of the skin in itself will show benefits!  I can’t afford Prevage since a career change, and I am happier using trial size luxury products now.  The luxury is a gimmick too for the most part!

    "body": "Hi! Panibagong sunscreen na naman ang irereview ko ngayon. Itong Ecran De Luxe Silicone Sunscreen Gel na ito ay pino-promote nung brand owner bilang isang mineral sunscreen. Pero mineral ba talaga? Alamin natin yan sa review na ito. \n\nBilang panimula, binili ko itong sunscreen na ito sa Tiktok, sa halagang 574 pesos. Mas mahal ito sa ibang local sunscreens na naglipana ngayon sa Tiktok. Malalaman nyo kung bakit kapag tumungo na tayo sa ingredient list nitong sunscreen na ito. \n\nSimulan ko muna sa user experience. Kung ikaw ay gumagamit ng makeup primer, lalo na yung silicone-based, yun ang unang mong maiisip kapag ginamit mo tong product na ito. Sa skin feel pa lang, ramdam dito yung silicone elastomer na ginamit, na madalas ding ginagamit sa mga silicone-based na makeup primers. Kulay dilaw yung sunscreen at may kalakasan yung floral powdery fragrance. Kung nakaka experience ka ng adverse reaction sa fragrance,  gamit ka na lang ng ibang sunscreen. May tatlong oras din ang itinagal nung fragrance nitong sunscreen sa mukha ko bago mawala yung amoy. Sa kabilang banda, wala naman akong na-experience na white cast habang inaapply ko ito sa mukha ko. Nagustuhan ko yung lapat nito sa balat ko, since matte ang finish nito at hindi nangintab ang mukha ko sa sunscreen na to. \n\nNgayon tumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list. Eto ang ingredients ng sunscreen na ito:\n\nEthylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Avobenzone, Zinc Oxide, Belsil EG2 (Cyclopentasiloxane and Dimethicone), Belsil EG5 (Cyclopentasiloxane and Dimethicone), Perfume\n\nSuriin natin ang mga UV Filters na ginamit:\n\n* Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (OMC) : UVB Filter\n\n* Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (DHHB; Uvinul A Plus; Parasol DHHB) : UVA Filter\n\n* Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (BEMT; Tinosorb S; Parsol Shield) : UVA/UVB Filter\n\n* Ethylhexyl Triazine (EHT; Uvinul T-150; Parsol EHT) : UVB Filter\n\n* Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane (Avobenzone): UVA Filter\n\n* Zinc Oxide: UVA/UVB Filter\n\nSa UV Filter pa lang, natuwa na sana ako dito, kasi halos puro new generation UV filter ang ginamit, a first for a local sunscreen. Balanse ang mix ng UVA and UVB filters. Kung ganyan nga ang UV filters na ginamit, hindi malayong pumalo ng SPF 50 or higher ito e. \n\nMaliban sa mga UV filters na ginamit, andito din ang pet peeve ko sa mga local cosmetic products: ang hindi maayos at compliant na ingredient list. Una na dito e yung Avobenzone. Ang correct INCI name nyan ay Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane. Next, hindi nilalagay ang trade name ng ingredient na ginamit sa product. INCI Name ang inilalagay. So yung Belsil EG2 at Belsil EG5 ay hindi dapat nakasulat jan, kundi yung INCI name ng ingredients na yan. \n\nAt tutal nasa Belsil EG2 at Belsil EG5 tayo, mali yung mga nasa parenthesis na katabi nyang dalawang trade names na yan. Ang INCI name ng Belsil EG2 at Belsil EG5 ay Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer. And yes, iisa ang INCI Name nyang dalawang yan, pero magkaibang grade, meaning magkaiba ang performance nyang 2 ingredient na iyan. Nabanggit ko kanina na parang silicone-based makeup primer yung skin feel nitong sunscreen na ito. Dahil yan sa Belsil EG2 at Belsil EG5 na silicone elastomer. Yan yung nagbibigay ng silky, pero non-greasy na skin feel, at matte finish. \n\nAng isa ko pang napansin sa ingredient list ng product na ito, bakit ang pinaka unang ingredient ay Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate? Tandaan na ang maximum allowed % ng  OMC, DHHB, at BEMT ay 10% lang. Imbes na yang tatlong UV filter ang nasa unahan ng IL, dapat yung ingredient na nagsisilbing solvent  o diluent ang nasa pinakaunahan dapat. Na sa tingin ko e yung Belsil EG2 at Belsil EG5.Tingin ko talaga mali ang arrangement ng mga ingredients na ito sa ingredient list e. \n\nTumungo naman tayo sa product claims nitong sunscreen na ito:\n\n* SPF 30 PA++++\n\n* Non greasy No white cast\n\n* Non-comedogenic matte finish\n\n* Water resistant\n\n* Broad spectrum ultra protection\n\nSa claim nito na SPF 30 PA++++, may pinakita sa product listing nito sa Tiktok nung signed na SPF test report, na tumutugma sa claim na ito. Makikita din sa report na ito na may Critical wavelength ito na 376.07 nm. Para makapagclaim ng broad spectrum, kinakailangan na magkaroon ang isang sunscreen ng critical wavelength na 370 nm o higit pa. Dahil higit sa 370 nm ang critical wavelength ng sunscreen na ito kaya ito nakapag claim ng broad spectrum protection. \n\nSa claim naman nito na non greasy at no white cast, wala akong issue dito, since wala akong naramdaman na greasiness at wala ding white cast nung ginamit ko ito. \n\nSa claim na non-comedogenic, sana na nag-conduct ng in-vivo comedogenicity test sa tao itong brand para sana mapangatawanan nila itong claim na ito. Same sa claim nito na water resistant, dapat nag-conduct ang brand ng water resistance test para may substantiation sila para sa claim na ito, at para malaman na din kung up to ilang minutes ito water resistant (40 o 80 mins.). Sa claim na matte finish, yes matte ang finish nito base sa kinalabasan ng balat ko pagkatapos mag-apply nito. \n\nNgayon, may isa pang claim itong sunscreen na ito na hindi mababasa sa product label. Base sa mga nakita ko sa Tiktok, naka-position itong sunscreen na ito as a mineral sunscreen. Gumawa pa nga ng Tiktok video ang brand owner tungkol dito dahil may isang user na nagtanong kung bakit kine-claim ng brand na mineral sunscreen ito gayong may kahalo itong chemical UV filters (naka pin ito sa kanyang account). Maari n'yo itong panuorin dito:\n\nhttps://vt.tiktok.com/ZSrTMFqCD/\n\nNapanuod mo na ang video? Tara himayin natin yung mga binanggit ng brand owner\nsa video. \n\nReason #1: \n\nSabi ng R&D team na nagdevelop ng sunscreen na ito for the brand owner, predominantly na mineral sunscreen daw ito. Naglagay lang daw sila ng minute proportions ng chemical UV filters to make the formulation stable. Sa klima daw kasi sa Pilipinas, mahirap daw magkaroon ng stable na gel sunscreen kagaya nitong product na ito. At dahil sa FDA guidelines, kaya nila isinulat sa IL yung mga chemical UV filters, kahit na close to zero lang daw yung ginamit nila. \n\nIsang malaking kalokohan itong tugon na ito nung R&D sa brand owner. Kung close to zero ang ginamit na chemical UV filter, anong ginagawa nung tatlong chemical UV filter (OMC, DHHB, BEMT) sa pinakaunahan ng IL? Ibig sabihin ba nito, since close to zero ang ginamit na chemical UV filters, in increasing order ang ginawa nyong paglilista ng ingredient list? Taliwas yata ito sa ASEAN Cosmetic Labeling Guideline na sinusunod dito sa Pilipinas ng mga cosmetic manufacturers at traders na IN DECREASING ORDER  ang paglilista ng ingredients sa IL.\n\nIkalawa,, kesehodang inilagay ang mga chemical UV filters na yan para i-stabilize ang formulation, magfa-function pa din yan as UV filters. Kapag tinamaan yang mga yan ng UV rays, kesehodang 10% o 0.1% ang inilagay jan, mag-aabsorb pa din yan ng UV rays. \n\nAt ikatlo, kung talagang close to zero yang mga ginamit na chemical UV filters sa product na yan, bakit madilaw yung sunscreen? Sa lahat ng ingredients nitong sunscreen, ang madilaw lang jan yung BEMT. Ang BEMT ay nag-eexist as yellow powder, tulad ng nakikita nyo sa pic sa itaas. Kapag ginamit itong UV filter na ito sa significant levels, nagiging madilaw yung finished product. Sa dilaw ng sunscreen na ito, malabong near zero ang usage rate ng UV filter na ito. \n\nReason #2:\n\nMineral sunscreen daw itong product na ito kasi gumamit daw ito ng Advanced Encapsulation Technology para daw mapigil ang absorption ng chemical UV filters sa ating balat para hindi daw magwork as UV filters ung mga chemical UV filters. Na pinapanatili daw ng Advanced Encapsulation Technology yung sunscreen sa ibabaw lamang ng balat. \n\nIsa na namang malaking kalokohan ito. Kesehodang naka encapsulate ang chemical UV filters o hindi, mag-aabsorb at mag-aabsorb yan ng UV, dahil yan ang idinidikta ng chemistry ng mga chemical compounds na iyan. And yes, yang mga new generation UV filters, dahil sa kanilang malaking molecular weight, hindi talaga yan mag absorb sa balat, dahil mas mataas ang molecular weight, mas mahaba ang penetration sa balat. \n\nReason #3:\n\nAng main UV filter daw na ginamit sa product na ito ay Zinc Oxide. Ito daw yung nagba-block nung UVA at UVB rays sa product na ito. Itong Zinc Oxide daw ang pinakanagtatrabaho sa product na ito para protektahan ang balat laban sa UVA at UVB. \n\nKung Zinc Oxide ang main UV filter ng sunscreen na ito, bakit hindi nito yung nasa pinakaunahan? Bakit nasa bandang gitna lang? E kung sinasabi na lang nila na HYBRID SUNSCREEN itong product na ito, e di mas ok pa sana. Wala namang masama kung hybrid sunscreen ito, kasi totoo naman. Pag pinagsama ang mineral at chemical UV filters sa isang sunscreen, antemano Hybrid Sunscreen talaga yan. Wag na kasing ipilit na mineral, wala namang masama kung hindi mineral sunscreen yang product nyo e. \n\nFinal Words:\n\nMaganda sana itong sunscreen na ito e. Kauna unahang silicone gel na sunscreen. Ang gaganda pa ng UV filters na ginamit, karamihan new generation pa. Maganda din ang performance during use, hindi greasy, walang white cast, medyo matapang lang ang fragrance. \n\nPero as usual, may red flags ang product na ito. Yung mga sablay sa ingredient list. Formulated in the USA daw, pero di marunong gumawa ng IL na compliant. Yung pag-claim ng water resistant at non-comedogenic, kahit hindi naman nag-conduct ng test. \n\nPero yung claim na mineral sunscreen daw kahit kita naman sa ingredient list na hindi, ang pinakamalaking red flag. Lalong lalo na yung mga binanggit na reasons dun sa video nung brand owner. May pagbanggit banggit pa ng advanced encapsulation technology, as if naman may bilang yan sa usapan kung mineral sunscreen ba yung product o hindi. \n\nAyun lang. Tulad ng lagi kong sinasabi, maging mapanuri sa mga binibili at ginagamit nyong produkto. Maraming salamat sa pagbabasa.",

    "body": "So for several months now, I have been wearing what I thought was a healthy amount of sunscreen everyday. I knew it was less than 1/4 tsp (what seems to be the recommended amount), but it seemed like a thick layer. However earlier today, I went through the trouble of measuring 1/4 tsp, to see how off I was, and of course 1/4 tsp was wayyyyyyyy more than I was using. I was probably using around 1/8 tsp. To me, 1/4 tsp seemed really excessive, so I decided to do the maths. I mean who even decided 1/4 tsp was the correct amount for a sunscreen dose of 2 mg/cm^2 for EVERY sunscreen and EVERY face??\n\nTo be conservative, the area I am computing is an ellipse, with one axis value being the top of my forehead to my chin, and the other axis value being my hairline by my ear, across my nose, to my other ear.\n\n* forehead-to-chin: 20 cm\n* ear-to-ear: 23 cm\n* area = pi * (20/2) * (23/2) = 362 cm^2\n\nThis value is actually larger than the actual surface area of your face. If I wanted to be really exact, I would subtract the area of my eyes, mouth, and cutouts which would allow the ellipse to contour my face (think of sheet mask cutouts), but add a bit of area to account for the nose and other small protrusions. All in all, it is obvious that an ellipse with these axes has an area at least as large as your facial surface area.\n\nThe recommended dose of sunscreen is 2 mg/cm^2. It is kind of hard to estimate the density of sunscreen, especially because each sunscreen will have a different density! But I will try to give a conservatively low estimate, using the sunscreen I am currently using, Loreal Sublime Sun SPF 50+. This sunscreen is just okay btw, heavy fragrance, greasy at first, but doesn't break me out at least. Wouldn't repurchase. Anyway, the first ingredient is water, density 1 g/cm^3. The next three ingredients, dimethicone (.965 g/cm^3), isododecane (.74 g/cm^3), and styrene (.909 g/cm^3), all have lower densities. The next three, propanediol (1.06 g/cm^3), glycerin (1.26 g/cm^3), and silica (2.65 g/cm^3) all have higher densities. I figure the rest of the ingredients don't have much of an impact. There is no way to know the exact proportions, so I will estimate the density to be at the lowest .92 g/cm^3 = 4.5 g/tsp.\n\nSo finally we can compute sunscreen amount needed from the following: \n\n* area = 362 cm^2\n* density = 4.5 g/tsp\n* dose = 2 mg/cm^2 \n* area * dose / density =  amount\n* (362 cm^2 * .002 g/cm^2) / (4.5 g/tsp) = .16 tsp\n\nBased on my conservative calculation, I should use .16 tsp for my face to get the labelled SPF protection, much less than the 1/4 tsp recommended here all the time. Maybe I have a small face, maybe my estimation is way off somewhere, although I did my best to estimate as conservatively as possible, but honestly this calculation has made me more confident in my suspicion that 1/4 tsp for my face is excessive. Maybe skincare companies advertise this number so people use more product, or to 100% guarantee that every face gets the advertised SPF, as people may not apply sunscreen uniformly, have large faces, etc? Thoughts?\n\n***DISCLAIMER: I am not a chemist or dermatologist, I am just a girl who likes facts and skincare***\n\nEDIT: Wow this blew up a lot more than I expected! I am definitely not telling you to use less than 1/4 tsp of sunscreen, I just think its important to know where the estimate came from. I think the 1/4 tsp estimate exists because its always better to use more sunscreen than not enough, especially considering the way SPF degrades (e.g. applying 1 mg/cm^2 results in much less than half SPF). I, personally, will not try to use 1/4 tsp anymore. I also think it is foolish to say things like \"using 1/8 tsp will definitely result in SPF 5\". There are many factors that influence the SPF you get, its just important to remember the 1/4 tsp is simply an estimate. Happy sunscreening :)",

Lets say you only spread 80% of the average on some spots, this would make the 0.25 of a teaspoon closer to 0.2 of a teaspoon on some areas. Then some people have a bit larger faces, so I'm sure this 0.16 that you need can become 0.2 for some people.\n\nIn general however, there is research in vivo which shows that the SPF scales roughly with the amount applied. This is opposed to the opinion that sunscreen gets divided by some root depending on how much less you use, which IMO is wrong. If you apply half, you get roughly half the SPF. If you apply 50% more, you get 50% more SPF.\n\nSo if you use an SPF 50 PPD 20 sunscreen and you apply only 60% of the standard 2.0mg/cm² you don't have to freak out. You will get about SPF 30 and PPD 12. If you apply 1/4th of a tablespoon you will actually in most cases have a higher SPF and PPD than advertised, if your face isn't gigantic.",

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

I sure hope people are buying it so it doesn't get discontinued. I got it for maybe 6000 KRW for the 50 ml tube and it's such a nice moisturizing vehicle with Tinosorb S and Uvinul A Plus. So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

    "body": "#[THREAD FOR TIPS/TRICKS/PEOPLE TO HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS](https://redd.it/qoa6k6)\n\n#What is Pour Painting?\n\nPour Painting is when you put stuff in a cup, and then you dump it out! For a quick look at the different methods of fluid acrylic painting, check out [this imgur album](http://imgur.com/a/Z0QB1).\n\nYou can find a glossary of terms related to pour painting [here, on acrylicpouring.com](http://acrylicpouring.com/acrylic-pouring-terms-for-beginners/)\n\n#Getting Started\n\nWant to get started on a budget? Artist Rick Cheadle can help you get started pour painting [for under $5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XELImr94bzQ), and [for under $10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq-CjBC_XRI).  **tl;dw** - Dollar stores carry craft paint, flow extender alternatives, and silicone oil. You can do larger paintings with $10 than you can with $5. \n\nIf you want to invest a bit, and turn this into a hobby or even a profession, keep reading!\n\n##Basic Supplies\n\nThe exact brands and supplies a fluid acrylics artist will use depend entirely on personal preference. Here are the **basics** that every artist should have, with a few extras that can enhance your experience. \n\n* **Acrylic craft paints** - *Note: acrylic paints come in several varieties (High-Flow, heavy body, craft, etc.) Craft acrylics are generally the most affordable and easiest to use for acrylic pouring.*\n\n* **Popsicle sticks** - *Gotta have something to stir your paint with! They're also very useful as a cheap spreading tool or to help dab paint onto empty areas*\n\n* **Canvas/MDF board** - *You'll need a surface for your art! Canvas and mdf boards are common surface materials that fluid acrylic artists will use.*\n\n* **Fluid Extender** - *Acrylic paints need to be thinned for this style of painting (excluding High-Flow acrylics). Fluid extenders thin acrylic paints without destroying the bonding ability, so that your paint doesn't crack when it dries. Liquitex Pouring Medium, Floetrol, GAC 800 and PVA Glue are reliable fluid extenders.*\n\n* **Dimethicone (Silicone)** – *While not strictly required, silicone virtually guarantees your paintings will develop those desirable 'cell' shapes. Dimethicone is a skin-safe non-evaporating silicone lubricant.*\n\n* **Cups** - *Paint goes in these*\n\n##Other Supplies#\n\nIf you want to get a little fancy, you can also invest in these materials to enhance your pouring experience:\n\n* **Butane torch** - *If silicone has been added to your acrylics, you can quickly move a lit butane torch an inch or two away from the surface of the painting to release trapped air bubbles and encourage micro 'cell' formation in your paint.*\n\n* **Varnish** - *This is the final step to complete your painting. Varnish seals and protects your paint, so that no paint gets rubbed away and nothing can stain the paint underneath the layer of varnish.*\n\n* **Gloves** - *Pour painting is seriously messy. Gloves aren't necessary, but you might appreciate the easier cleanup!*\n\n* **Paper towels/rags** - *Great for cleanup!*\n\n* **Freezer Paper** - *Freezer paper has a plastic-coated side that acrylic paints can easily be pulled off of. This is a cheap surface protection that won't stick to your paint. You can protect your workspace with any non-porous material though.*\n\n* **Squeeze bottles/droppers** - *These allow you to maintain a greater control on the volume and direction of your pouring mediums, whether it be paint on canvas, silicone in paint, fluid extender in paint, etc.*\n\n* **Trays** - *Sure, you can simply set your paintings on top of cups while they dry, but having a tray or two handy means you can safely move your wet surface if you need to.*\n\n#Instructions\n\nThere are dozens of ways to get your paint onto your canvas! Here are some general instructions on the process. \n\n1. Cover your work surface. If it's not covered, it's probably gonna get paint on it. \n\n2. Put paint in separate containers (1 container = 1 paint color). Don't mix colors at this step; you want your paint to stay as separate as possible throughout the process.\n\n3. Add fluid extender to your paint and stir. The amount you need will depend on the medium, so check online to see what others use. Generally, you want your acrylics to have the same consistency as pancake batter or honey.  \n\n4. Add silicone to each paint container. The more you stir silicone, the smaller the cells will be in your finished painting. \n\n5. Now it's time to think about how you want to get the paint on the canvas. The [Visual Introduction to Acrylic Pouring Techniques](http://imgur.com/a/Z0QB1) has all the info you need!\n\n6. Once the paint dries completely, you'll need to remove the dimethicone from your canvas. Depending on the paint you've used, you can clean off the silicone with flour and a medium-stiff brush, patting with a soft cloth, or even gently cleaning with soap and water! Just be very gentle so you don't ruin your lovely new artwork!\n\n7. Your canvas is now dry and silicone-free! It's time to varnish. [Annemarie Ridderhof on YouTube demonstrates proper varnishing technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGNnX-7N_94), and you can read more about this step [here on art-is-fun.com](https://www.art-is-fun.com/how-to-varnish-an-acrylic-painting/).\n\n#Cleanup\n\nDo not dispose of paint and other materials down the drain, as the flow extenders are designed to keep paints in tact even with excess water and they can gum up your drains (plus it's not good to wash chemicals down the drains). Here are a couple reliable cleanup options: \n\n* Wait for the paint to dry. If you protected your work space with a plastic or rubber coating (e.g. freezer paper or a silicone place mat) you'll be able to peel the dried acrylic 'skins' off and recycle them or just toss them out! \n\n* If you've protected your work space with a disposable covering, you can carefully throw that away in the trash. Be aware of how much wet paint is on the disposable surface, so that you don't end up pouring all over your desk or floors! \n\n* Note: If you need to wash off brushes, spatulas, or wash a small amount of paint off, consider using a paper towel soaked in water or a paint-removing product like acetone/nail polish remover. It will effectively clean your tools and you can toss the dirty rag out, rather than risk damaging your plumbing. \n\n#Thanks for reading!\n\nHopefully this has been of help to you. Feel free to post your questions and art so that others can grow with us all together! \n\n* [Subreddit features](https://www.reddit.com/r/PourPainting/comments/7hztwp/new_features_and_other_announcements/)",

        "body": "So I found this with the influx of people and was enthralled. I'm gonna do a group pour painting party with some friends where we all try it out and while I have watched tons of videos would love some clarification on a few things:\n\n1. Paint consistency/glue/water - it feels like every artist does something different here, some use glue, some dont, others mix glue in...i get the consistency is super important but is that the only reason for glue? Just a bit confused here\n\n2. Amount - for a generic 12×12 canvas, how much paint should go in the cup? Is there a standard amount? I want to try a double flip cup when we do our thing and dont want to accidentally use waaaaay too much. \n\n3. Order of colors in the cup - I haven't found a good explanation for this yet, most people start with white and layer lots of white in (For cell creation I think?) But nobody talks about why they put the colors in the order they did. If I want more of, say, red when using 3 colors is amount most important or do you have to put it in a specific order? How neccessary is white? If I want a darker painting can I skip it and still get decent cell formation?\n\nThanks in advance for assistance and I am excited to actually get to do this soon:)",

Mineral don't offer better protection than chemical ones cause again, it depends on the ingredients used on them that offer protection not if they are chemical or mineral.\n\nYou mentioned a research form cancer council which is a australian brand. Australia is very very strict on their sunscreens and mostly have chemical sunscreens.\n\n8:24 you are wrong, this isn't a 100% mineral based sunscreen I can see tinosorb-M which is a hybrid filter which is chemical and mineral.\n\nIt also has butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane which is also called avobenzone which you said is only in chemical sunscreens 3:02 and is unstable with mineral sunscreen filters as mentioned on inci decoder (I don't think I can paste a link but search it) \n\n8:47 I looked up the article you mentioned and understood thta you did not read it at all! The article is about Injectable silicones that are used for surgeries like cosmetic ones like hip and breast enlargement. NOT SUNSCREENS!\n\n10:43 it contains dimethicone which is a silicone and you said silicone is \"harmful\" 3:02. So you are spreading misinformation but not even agreeing with yourself?\n\n12:15 You say it has effectivel protection while a revievw that YOU show says it has less protection and doesn't prevent tannning. And ofc it won't it's PA++ which is low\n\nPlease research about the ingredients.\n\n13:04 you say companies like Neutrogena and Minimalist don't offer protection just cause they are chemical based? Neutrogena is Widely found, economical and provides one of the bets protection. Aromamajic has spf 30 and less ( bare min someone in Indian heta should wear spf 30) and pa++ in 1 product and others not mentioned on the box (as seen in the video). Dot and key and aqualogica may not be the best but minimalist and Neutrogena have much better protection than aromamajic. They both have atleast spf50 and pa+++ with products also with pa++++ (which is the highest). DONT SPREAD MISINFORMATION\n\nYour homemade Sunscreen, the protection im highly unsure about. Even if the ingredients are used in sunscreens they are tested in a lab to work and thry work with all the other ingredients to provide protection. You homemade doesn't work like that! Also Zinc may oxidize immediately in open air but it only forms a small layer thats nanometer thick. So its basically zinc only and that layer of ZnO provied very very less protection. Less than makeup.\n\nTo prove this you said u did the banana peel test but you never showed how long it was or anything in fact u just cut thr clip from u applying to saying it works. That has 0 value\n\nFruits dont provide sun protection!!! Nothing that you eat does they are just gimmick. Sun protection can only be obtained from above the skin.",

Giving room to stir, I'd say it's probably 4-4 1/2 oz total of paint and medium mixed. I only use 3-4 drops for a cup that size. \n\n\nHow much you stir the oil in can determine the size of the cells. I can't really tell you exactly why, but the more you stir, the smaller your cells get. My best guess is when you stir more, you are wrapping smaller bits of the oil around ALL of the paint vs when you barely mix and the oil is only touching certain parts of the mixture. \n\n\nI'm by no means an expert,  but in the [experiments ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkTrJ_7B6gSI9tnRyppyx6Gi607dzHHbn) I've been running, I'm using about 2 oz of paint+medium with 2 drops of each activator I test.

    "body": "Long post ahead. I've tried to jot every basic thing that I've learnt. I've a used a para or two from a post by Aayu (her dad owns reddit btw) because I thought she phrased it good. I've included about things that I personally had experience with for this to be authentic but the word is \"mostly\" tho. So I hope this helps you. If you think I've misinformed anything, comment it down below.\n\nGetting started in Skincare can be overwhelming, what ingredients do what, what all are safe, what all are soothing, in what order should they be layered, at what frequency are they supposed to be used. Basically, there are too many questions, too much stuff to learn, and too little experience. So, I’ll tell you all about the things I’ve learned during the last 10+ months and if you can avoid the mistakes I’ve done, this article would have served its purpose and can rest in peace.\n\nA little disclaimer: while I’d like to think of myself as a person that does quite decent research no matter what the subject, I’d like you to take my advice with a pinch of salt. Do your own research thoroughly before you add a product into your routine.\n\r\nSo, since this is a dummies guide I’ll try and help you make a routine for yourself. I’ll add my advice at the end, based on experience and I hope this would be your greater take away as the rest info can be found anywhere online. And by no means do I mean you guys are dummies btw.\n\r\nFirstly, let’s address why skincare? As much as we’d like our life to be a perfect bubble, we know that it isn’t the case. Skincare can help every single type of skin. Your skin breaks out? Sure, we can do something about it, you get dry patches on your skin? Sure, we can manage that too, you have no problem with skin whatsoever? We can help your skin be that way till your friends are all old and wrinkly. The idea of skincare is just to provide what it needs for it to remain in a zen state by keeping it happy.\n\r\nYour skin can just do fine with as basic a routine as Cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen. Rest all is needed for that extra push if you will. Skin, as fascinating and self-sufficient a thing it is, sometimes needs help to function properly.\r\nLet’s tackle this baffling thing that skincare is by focusing on one product at a time.\n\r\nI loved this paragraph that has been put together by AsainBeauty on Reddit.\n\r\n>Understanding what works for you and making informed purchases are a bit of a chicken-and-egg conundrum seeing as you won’t know your skin until you start using a routine, and you won’t know what to purchase until you know your skin! That being said, there are a lot of products out there that work for the majority of people and maybe safe initial purchases, based on your skin type and skin concerns. There may be a perfect product out there for you, but it may take some time to find it as you will have to figure out what specific ingredients your skin likes, which ones it can’t deal with, and which ones are just meh.\n\r\n##***Cleanser***\r\nWe all know that our face similar to our body needs washing too. So, whenever you’re choosing a cleanser make sure it is as gentle as it can be. It shouldn’t be over stripping no matter what. If you have a squeaky clean face after you wash your face and you feel like “ oh my face seems to be pretty clean now, in your face dirt and bacteria ha!, I won’t let you become a zit on my face today” then you’re in trouble.\r\nAs we know our skin, being an intelligent thing that it is, normally produces oil for preserving itself. But when your face is over cleaned, if that’s a word, your skin rings the emergency alarm and asks for more oil production. So now you might feel like your face is greasy all day long. If you’re a dry skin person then guess what you’re in for more trouble. So, it’s important to choose something that doesn’t strip away your natural oil. I’d advise staying away from the whole anti-acne facewash lines we have, as none of them actually benefit you. Your facewashe should have a pH between 4.5 to 7. pH of products is important for maintaining skin barrier integrity, your skin has an acid mantle (protective barrier on the surface of skin composed of sweat, skin oils, and dead skin cells) that gives it its pH value. This mantle is a thin layer on your skin that protects you from bacteria, virus, fungi making it soft and supple, disrupting this layer can cause effects like inflammation, dermatitis, dry and dehydrated skin. Pollution, pathogens, cleansers, soaps and even water might disrupt your mantle, so it’s important for your cleanser to have a low pH so that it doesn’t make your skin squeaky clean. I know I just complicated the shit out for something like a cleanser, but don’t worry you’ll find a ton of recommendations for cleansers in that pH range.\n\r\nAnd 60 seconds should be the max time you should spend washing your face.\n\r\nYour typical face cleansers are actually used as a second cleanser. There is actually an oil-based cleanser that people use to remove the dirt, make-up, pollution, sunscreen at the end of the day. You can’t actually use oil for this purpose as there’s a risk of it remaining on the skin, even after the second cleanse, and therefore clogging your pores. Oil Cleansers or micellar water or cleansing balms are the better choices for first cleansing as they have emulsifiers that breakdown the oil and therefore helping you remove dirt and makeup along with oil. You might actually be fine without incorporating the first cleanser but many people often report that it actually made a difference, helping them.\r\nYou can skip cleansers in the morning and it might actually benefit you, remember how we talked about stripping your face of Its natural oils.\n\r\nSome loved and affordable products: Cetaphil Gentle cleanser, Simple refreshing Facewash.\n\r\n##***Moisturizer***\r\nThis is just more of a trial and error sort of thing. Just choosing a moisturizer with non-comedogenic ingredients (pore-clogging ingredients) would be fine. Oily skin people can like gel textured moisturizers, dry skinned people can benefit from something thick. Typically, the thicker the product, the more moisturizing it is. If you’re oily I’d advise you to stay away from all-natural moisturizers as they usually have too many oils in them and they might clog your pores and you might end up with closed comedones (or clogged pores). There are three things in moisturizers emollients, occlusives, humectants. Emollients provide your skin with required moisturization helping your lipid barrier (your skin has lipids and ceramides and all kinds of stuff) therefore keeping it healthy, Oils, shea butter, ceramides are examples of emollients you can find. Humectants bring moisture to your skin from air thus preventing your skin from getting dry, Glycerin and hyaluronic acid are two main used Humectants. Occlusives prevent water loss from your skin, oils, silicones, dimethicone, mineral oils are examples of occlusives you can usually find in products. These three in a moisturizer can help your skin restore its skin barrier therefore keeping it healthy and happy while minimizing the possibility for irritation.\r\nThings to consider when evaluating how well your moisturizer works:\r\n•\tDoes it leave your skin feeling bouncy and supple? Happy and healthy, not dry and tight, is what a good moisturizer is aiming for.\r\n•\tHow long does that moisturized feeling last? If it only lasts an hour or two, you may want to find a different moisturizer! Perhaps try a thicker moisturizer, like a cream or a balm.\r\nIf your moisturizer is gentle enough, doesn’t break you out, and does what it’s supposed to do, that’s awesome! Go ahead and enjoy it as part of your skincare routine :). If it turns out that your product irritates your skin, gives you acne, or doesn’t do what it should, it might be time to try a different one!\n\r\n##***Sunscreen***\r\nIt’s the most important step period. Whatever you might be doing to your skin, if you aren’t using sunscreen it would all be a waste.\n\r\nSunscreen has the following benefits:\r\n•\tReduces the risk of skin cancer\r\n•\tPrevents hyperpigmentation\r\n•\tReduces signs of aging\r\n•\tProtects against signs of photodamage (fine lines, etc.)\r\n•\tPrevents burns (dark-skinned people aren’t affected much)\n\r\nThings to remember before buying sunscreen:\r\n1. The more the SPF the better it is.\r\n2. It should be waterproof\r\n3. It shouldn’t break you out obviously\r\n4. I’d advise you to stay away from the whole natural line again.\r\n5. If you have dark skin, avoid sunscreens with high percentages of physical filters (zinc oxide and titanium dioxide) as they’ll lend a white cast to your skin. Chemical sunscreens are your best bet.\r\n6. If you have sensitive skin, you may prefer to look for an all physical sunscreen or a physical/chemical combination sunscreen — chemical filters (Oxybenzone, Avobenzone, typically organic ingredients) may cause stinging and irritation for some people.\n7. The higher the Pa+++ rating the better protection you get.\n\r\nKorean Sunscreens (from CosRx and Purito perhaps) are great, they tend to be moisturizing while providing an adequate amount of sun protection\n\r\nThis is it for people that usually have healthy skin or normal skin, from here on you can make your skin better but you’d have to be careful with giving your skin that extra push for dealing with aging, pigmentation, scarring, etc. I’m all up for it, if I can better myself in any way possible, and achieving great things always involves a tad bit of risk as you’d be treading in unfamiliar territory. You can minimalize the risk by studying more about it and all things worth having require effort now, don’t they? I’m just making it sound dramatic because I messed up and I don’t want you to mess up.\n\r\nAfter following a basic routine for a few months and building a healthy skin barrier, you can start adding actives to your routine that benefit you and up your skincare game a notch. But do not enter the actives zone unless you’ve found a good Cleanser, moisturizer, and Sunscreen routine. After nailing your basic routine wait a month or two before introducing a new product and introduce a single product at a time. Be patient skincare takes time to show any results.\n\r\n##*Let’s talk actives now.*\n\r\n***AHAs:*** Alpha hydroxy acids or it is called, are exfoliating agents that work on surface-level helping you clear out tiny bumps on your skin (CCs). AHAs brighten your skin too helping with hyperpigmentation as they work on the surface level. Even though using acids on your skin sounds terrifying, don’t worry much they are well-researched ingredients and do wonders to your skin. Glycolic acid, Lactic acid (Milder), Mandelic acid (Milder) are commonly found ingredients.\n\r\n***BHAs:*** BHAs are oil-soluble ingredients so they work at the pore level. The soak up the oil clogging the pore that was about to become a pimple. These help people with acne a lot. Salicylic acid, betaine salicylate (Milder) are commonly found ingredients.\n\r\n***PHAs:*** PHAs are really mild ingredients and can be very well treated by people with sensitive skin.\r\nAll these ingredients are exfoliating ingredients that are naturally derived (from almonds, sugarcane, beets, etc;) and can be found in various formulations and products like toners, essence, moisturizers, sometimes cleansers (but these make very less difference as they don’t sit on your face longer). Start with the smallest percentage you can find and start introducing it once a week. No matter what the product says, don’t start anything with the recommended usage. Start bringing it into your routine by using it once a week for a month or so and then increase it to twice a week. You can really irritate your skin if you aren’t careful enough. Be patient, they’ll help you.\n\r\n***Over exfoliation:*** This is a thing and if you happen to do this, that is exfoliate more than you are supposed to, your skin is going to freak the F out. You’ll damage your skin barrier, deal with more breakouts, your skin will remain red for long periods of time so don’t overuse a product that you have never used before. (I’ve had to deal with this btw)\n\r\n***Niacinamide:*** This is an active form of vitamin B3 that helps with pigmentation, sebum production and therefore reducing the size of your pores. This ingredient is really well tolerated by everyone and often is referred to as a holy grail ingredient.\n\r\nNow the I haven’t had experience with ingredients like vitamin C, Retinoids, Azelaic acid, and others yet and so I can’t speak from personal experience but research them thoroughly if you’d want t get into them. They can make your situation worse if you don’t use them carefully. Since I’m a dummy too I’d want to stay away from them for now.\n\r\n***Purging:*** Also learn about purging. Whenever you’re introducing any actives your skin becomes worse before it gets better (worse as in you’ll deal with more than you usually do, so it changes from person to person). Purging is only possible if you are using products with active exfoliants, such as AHAs, BHAs, scrubs, peels, or retinoids. Why? Because exfoliation causes your skin to push the blockages inside of it out to the surface. Therefore, you can’t really “purge” from using a new moisturizer or new sunscreen. If you feel like you are “purging” after using a new moisturizer (or new product without any actives), you are probably just breaking out from the product. This usually lasts for a few weeks. Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UD2eRiflNI) to know more.\r\n\r\nAlso, here’s a [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/expanding_your_routine) on adding products I found recently that might help you.\n\r\n##***Skin Concerns***\r\nFirst knowing what skin type you have, helps a lot. Go through this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vic-EMOivpA) and then you can understand what might help your skin.\r\n\r\nLet’s get through skin concerns now and let’s begin with the most common issue “Acne”.\n\r\nOily skin people usually have to deal with acne compared to dry skin people. The frustrating thing about acne is there isn’t a single thing you can point out to be the potential cause. There are literally a ton of factors that can trigger acne. So, first, let’s understand why you breakout.\r\nOur skin is made up of pores right and these pores usually have hair follicles, and there are sebaceous glands in these pores that produce oil to nourish your skin and the follicle. But we being humans we shed skin cells quite often and this is called skin cell turnover (about 50% of the dust around you comprises of dead skin cells). Sometimes when too much oil is produced or too many dead skin cells are shed our pores usually make a cocktail of oil and dead skin cells blocking our pores and these are clogged pores. There’s this bacteria called p.acne that enters this cocktail sometimes to party, and when our body detects this invasion it sends white blood cells to fight them off and it becomes this pus-filled pimple. Lack of sleep, stress, hormones, food, etc. can also trigger acne from inside messing up the oil production and skin cell turnover.\n\r\n###***Regulating Sebum Production:***\r\n1. Look out for ingredients like Niacinamide, green tea.\r\n2. Moisturize your skin so your skin doesn’t have to.\r\n3. Use a cleanser that isn’t over stripping.\r\n4. Include facial oils to lock in the moisture, it really can be a game-changer. Look out for oils with high linoleic acid like Rosehip oil or squalene as they are light on the skin. (oils high in oleic acid can help dry skin by providing sufficient nourishment as they tend to be rich).\n\r\n###***Managing dead skin:***\r\n***Exfoliants:*** Exfoliation is the way to help our skin with managing its skin cell turnover. You might be familiar with scrubs we usually find in the market. Scrubs are labeled under physical exfoliation. Even though people have been using physical exfoliation for a long time, it is actually proven to be not skin-friendly. The grains in scrubs usually cause micro-tears in your skin and might aggravate aging. Also, avoid scrubs if you have breakouts on your face, or maybe just avoid the region you have the breakout. If it’s cut open it might lead to further inflammation, pigmentation and makes you more susceptible to have another breakout. If you are choosing physical exfoliation make sure the grains are as tiny as possible. I actually find chemical exfoliators beneficial and safe. About which I’ve added in the Actives section.\r\n***Pigmentation:***\r\nThere’ two types of Pigmentation. One is PIE the other is PIH. PIE is the red spot you usually have after the pimple situation. It is usually red as vessels below the skin are damaged. If you further irritate your skin or expose it to sunlight your skin triggers melanocytes to produce more melanin to save keratinocytes, therefore resulting in PIH. This is the dark spot that you see after the pimple situation.\r\nPigmentation takes months to heal so your best bet is to prevent it from happening. So, what can you do to prevent it? Firstly, stop picking at your pimples. It just irritates your skin and more irritation equals more damage which equals more recovery time. Don’t go under sunlight if you don’t have sunscreen on. It is generally advised to wear sunscreen even though you are indoors. If you don’t wear sunscreen with enough SPF, there’s no point in doing any sort of treatment for those spots. It would all just be a moo point. So, wear sunscreen kids.\n\r\nFor reduction of pigmentation, you can add niacinamide, AHAs, Vitamin C, azelaic acid to your routine. But sunscreen first.\n\r\n###***Dry skinned beauties:*** \nDry skinned people are usually more susceptible to aging so, it’s really important to hydrate and moisturize your skin. You can add ingredients like Hyaluronic acid, glycerin, and choose moisturizers that are usually thick in consistency. Also, add toners and essences for hydration. You can also lookup slugging online. Follow Charlotte Palermino on Instagram for advice.\n\r\n#***Advice from experience***\r\nI had to learn these things the hard way as I f’d up way too much and I literally gambled with my skin, which I strongly advise you against btw. I was just an idiot honestly, hope you take away these things.\n\r\n1. Asian beauty over everything: This is just a personal preference actually as they usually tend to be really really mild and beginner-friendly.\n\r\n2. Keep your skin happy. Do not irritate it no matter what. If you find that something is irritating your skin dump it no matter how much you’ve paid for it or just use it on your body. Also, keep your routine really simple. The more products you add the more you are susceptible to irritation and the less you’ll know what might have caused it.\n\r\n3. Don’t underestimate the damage products can do. Introduce any sort of product with caution, always stay on the back foot. Introduce anything in small amounts. You don’t need a ton of ingredients and products to have healthy skin, keep it simple, and only introduce products according to needs.\n\r\n4. Always always always start with the least potent product you can find, to help your skin get used to it.\n\r\n5. No essential oils. Essential oils do more bad than good usually. They might trigger serious irritation, speed up aging. No tea tree oil topical application and all, trust me on this. There were way better ingredients out there that you can experiment with.\n\r\n6. No fragrance can be the way to go if you can find it. Usually, companies don’t disclose the ingredients they’ve used for fragrance and so some ingredient present in there might trigger irritation.\n\r\n7. If you find a red spot you see before the pimple pops up, it usually means something irritated your skin and now it is Inflamed. Spot treating it with pure aloe vera gel helps a ton. You can try wow 99% aloe gel (the only product I trust enough from wow btw).\n\r\n8. STOP TOUCHING YOUR FACE.\n\r\n9. Pimple popping isn’t worth the shit you have to deal with later at all.\n\r\n10. Give your product some time. Sometimes it might not be the product that irritated your skin so don’t jump on that trigger quick.\n\r\n11. No product is going to change your skin overnight, there is no miracle product out there. So, stop being impatient and using it more than you can handle. There is nothing called overnight transformation. No face mask will resolve all your issues. Rome was not built in a day. Skincare is an everyday habit, consistency is a must. Sometimes breakouts/purging can cause you a lot of anxiety. This can make you go overboard and cause more harm than good. Please be patient with your skin and trust the process.\n\r\n12. Don’t be too harsh on yourself, dealing with acne can be hard and takes a toll on our mental health. Just remember it doesn’t define you and you can do something about it.\n\r\n13. With great power comes great responsibility. The ingredients you find people mentioning online that made a difference for them can be really good but if you don’t use them carefully, you might have to deal with more.\n\r\n14. Skincare is a marathon, not a race. Remember that the efforts you’re putting in will benefit you in long term.\n\r\n15. Start reading the ingredients list, you’ll eventually know why there is a specific ingredient in there with time. Use https://incidecoder.com/ to read the ingredient label before purchasing a product.\n\r\n16. Only move to the next product if you’re sure that the current one you’re using doesn’t irritate you.\n\r\n17. Listen to your skin, not to reviews not to YouTubers. Monitor & observe your skin closely. If some advice is producing negative results even after consistent efforts, no matter how many people claim the advice is working for them, drop it, and vice versa. Learn to observe what causes your skin to react positively/negatively. People are paid to make reviews online if you have a channel on YouTube or they sed products free of cost for them to review (barter) so don’t take reviews too seriously unless you trust the source. (primarily wow and mama earth).\n\r\n18. NO DIY. Some natural things that are safe to put on your face are honey, aloe vera, tomato masks now and then for brightening(it has lactic acid in it), and you can spot treat pimples with a mixture of turmeric and milk. Don’t overdo any of these either.\n\r\n19. Sleep early ( I can’t seem to do this but it literally changes your skin game), stay hydrated, change pillow covers often, wash your towels, so basically make sure everything that comes into contact with your skin is clean.\n\r\n20. We are all different. Our skin is not the same. Our environment is not the same. Our genes are not the same. What may be too much for me maybe too little for you and, vice-versa. Please patch-test before you try any new product.\n\r\n21. Skincare YouTubers and Instagrammers: Beauty Within, Liah Yoo, James Welsh, Cassandra Bankson, Hyram, Lab muffin, Samapti Banerjee, Charlotte Palermino, Gothamista, these are some people that I follow.\n\r\nEnjoy the process, enjoy taking time for yourself. Happy skincare people.\n\r\nCredits: Reddit: r/skincareaddicts, r/Asianbeauty, r/indianskincareaddicts.\n\nEdit: Adding a previous post of mine\n\nSkincare is a journey, so here's some things that help improve your skin quite a bit.\n\n**1. Sleep:**  Sleep is such an affecting factor when I look back. When I was in college I used to sleep at around 4-5 am (just being a normal millennial I guess) and my skin was bad most of the time, there were several other factors that contributed to it too but sleep was definitely one. I realised this recently when I had been in a motorcycle accident and had to have surgery. After the surgery I used to sleep at around 12-1 am and during the initial stages of my recovery and my skin rarely if ever broke out. So yeah even though it's hard to put your phone down missing out on watching those food videos and all just remind yourself you need to have better at any cost.\n\n**2. Pillow covers and Bed sheets:** If you've ever heard any Youtuber talk about this trust them it's true. When I had the accident I told you about I broke my collarbone, So I couldn't turn around when I'm asleep so my face was never in contact with the bed during the night and as a result my face was clear. I was able to pin this down when I started recovering. I  could sleep on my right side (collarbone is broken on the left side) after a while and in a few days my face started to break out on my right side. It was weird kind of, no spot on my left side but a few pimples on my right. So yes Bed sheets and pillow covers do matter. I don't use a pillow but I don't change the bedsheet regularly being the lazy 21 yr old I am, So I try sleeping on my back most of the time. But this isn't effective all the time, so sheets do matter.\n\n**3. Water:** Come on now what problem do you have with drinking water, just drink plenty of water everyday and stay hydrated. You have literally nothing to lose and everything to gain so just drink your damn water.\n\n**4. Digestion and Bowel movement:** Include more fibre into your diet for better digestion. Have a big glass of warm  water after you wake up empty stomach, it really helps. A healthy gut results in healthy skin.\n\n**5. Diet:** Stay away from sugar, unhealthy fats, Dairy products. Include healthy fats that are rich in omega 3 like walnuts, egg yolks, flax and chia seeds, and sea food if you're a non vegetarian. My skin quality was always poor , I get strech marks even with the slightest change in my body, so I started adding omega 3 religiously although I don't know if it's made any difference.\n\n( Maintain moderation in diet and you'll be fine)\n\n**6. Don't touch your face:** It's so hard not to do this but this might be a game changer. No matter how much you want to touch the pimple that's gonna pop out in a day or two refrain from doing it. If you have to touch because it's itching or for some other reason wash your hands properly before hand. I've become too conscious of this recently, I use my right index finger for whenever I need to touch my face. So I avoid touching anything with this finger and it kind of seperates itself on it's own whenever I'm using my hands. Wash your hands at all costs before touching your face.\n\n**7. Keep your hair clean:** This way you can reduce the acne around your hair line.\n\n**8. Don't irritate your skin:** Learning to listen to your skin a great skill imo. I never understand if the product is bad or it's just purging and I end up irritating my skin most of the time. I don't understand when my skin is agitated , might be because I don't observe enough, but don't over use anything and stress your skin, any product takes a bit time to show any result. Skin care is a marathon kind of thing, results won't appear instantly so embrace this journey and keep learning :-)\n**9. Your facial oil is good:** It's just produced to retain the moisture on your face. Don't strip it away to get a squeaky clean feeling after you wash your face, this'll just result in more oil production and as a result P. acne gets more feed. \n\n**10. Use a Clean Towel:** It's comes in contact with your face so there's no need to stress on how important it is for your towels to be clean. Or if you have the patience just air dry your face.\n\n>*So focus on getting your basics right because if you don't get these right no amount of skin care products can help.*",

    "body": "&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gux8n5hflyr51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c7af1b4ff98cd5de0b5161c9386a1abcd4227f67\n\nI recently had a horrible allergic reaction to what had been my longtime holy grail lip product and have spent the past month trying out a ton of different ointments in an effort to find *anything* to sooth my lips as I healed. In my search, I kept hoping to find a comparison of the various ointments and petroleum jellies to no avail. So I thought I'd create one myself. Note that while I do talk about how these work on the skin, my main focus was how they perform as lip balms on *very* sensitized lips. I’m hoping this helps someone else!\n\n**Aquaphor Healing Ointment:** This is the healing ointment that actually started this whole debacle. I’ve been a user of Aquaphor for *years* and have always adored it for my lips. It’s very soothing and has just the right balance between tackiness and slip – I never feel like it’s going to slide off my lips, but it doesn’t glue my lips shut either. The texture is really great. I don’t like it as much for my skin because it’s a bit too sticky, but as a lip balm it *would have* been my holy grail had I not suddenly developed a lanolin allergy. So, if you’re sensitive to lanolin (and it turns out I am now very, very sensitive), this is a very bad choice.\n\n**Cerave Healing Ointment:** This healing ointment is billed as hypoallergenic (and is definitely lanolin-free). It is very smooth and is packed with goodies like hyaluronic acid and ceramides, using petrolatum and dimethicone as its main occlusives. It sinks it almost immediately, which makes it lovely on the skin (I really like using this as an occlusive layer on my face at night and on my hands when they’re extra dry). However, I don’t like it for the lips for precisely that reason. It’s just too thin and slippery once it heats up to body temperature and seems to either slide off or absorb too quickly, so I’m constantly reapplying.\n\n**Vanicream Moisturizing Ointment (formerly Vaniply)**: Unlike all the other petroleum-based ointments on this list, this ointment is silicon-based (no petroleum in sight). The consistency of this one is really interesting – I’ve never tried a lip product that feels like this. It definitely stays put on your lips, but it’s not sticky, waxy, or slippery (I think those are the only textures I’d encountered in a lip product before this). It’s got almost a bit of friction when you rub your lips together. I do think it’s a nice consistency for normal, healed lips, but not so much for my damaged lips which really needed babying. As for a skin ointment, it’s lovely and light and absorbs quickly, but doesn’t have any of the added goodies that Cerave does.\n\n**Vaseline Original Lip Treatment:** At a certain point in my allergic reaction fiasco, I became increasingly wary of ointments with longer ingredient lists, even if they were recommended by my dermatologist and listed as hypoallergenic. So, I turned to 100% petroleum jelly, an ingredient that *very* few people react to. Vaseline claims to have a triple-filtration process and it truly has no scent at all (something I’ve learned is not to take for granted in a petroleum product). As an aside about packaging, this was the only product I couldn’t find in tube form (which I greatly prefer because I find them more sanitary and easy to work with). So instead of the plain old “Vaseline Original,” I bought the lip treatment in the tiny tub because I wasn’t sure if I was going to like it. The only difference is that the lip treatment contains a dye that is generally considered non-irritating. I was certain this was going to be the perfect, no-frills product for me, but alas. This stuff is *so* sticky. Maybe that’s not a problem if your lips are healthy and functioning, but with my damaged lips, this stuff felt like it was literally pulling a layer of skin off any time I opened by mouth. It was simply too painful to use. I wouldn’t use it on my skin either, since I prefer occlusives that sink in a bit on my skin. This is just way too thick and sticky.\n\n**CVS Petroleum Jelly**: My disappointment with Vaseline led me to generic brands of 100% petroleum jelly, which I’d heard often have more slip and less stickiness. First up was CVS’s version. This stuff is really slippery. And, ugh, it really smells and tastes like petroleum (and because it’s so slippery, it does end up in your mouth). As it turns out, petroleum jelly is a mixture of ingredients that doesn’t need to be specified on label, so the ratios in the formulas can really vary. And the filtration process varies too, which you can really tell with a product like this.\n\n**Walgreens Petroleum Jelly**: Another generic 100% petroleum jelly product. This one didn’t have as bad a smell as the CVS product, but it definitely still has one. It’s equally as slippery (seriously, no stickiness to this stuff at all). It provided me a bit of relief for a couple days simply because it wasn’t as painful as Vaseline or as smelly as the CVS version, but the fact that it had a smell/taste at all was pretty unpleasant.\n\n**Curad Petroleum Jelly:** And here it is! My holy grail of petroleum jellies. This one is a medical-grade petroleum jelly that’s often used in hospitals for post-surgical care for babies (most of the reviews on Amazon were about how this performs as a post-circumcision ointment). This stuff really feels pure. It has zero scent, zero taste, and is completely clear (every other 100% petroleum jelly product I’ve tried is slightly yellowish). It’s got a lovely consistency that is somewhat like Aquaphor’s blend of tackiness and slip (seriously, that’s what I’d been searching for this whole time!) It’s great for lips because it stays on there, but still allows enough slip to move your mouth like a normal human being, and even though it’s just petroleum jelly (which is just an occlusive and doesn’t, by itself, have any added healing properties), it feels so soothing on the lips. It’s great for skin too because it rubs in nicely without leaving a sticky mess behind. I think if my skin is feeling normal, I’ll opt for Cerave for a skin ointment because of all the extra goodies, but for a bare-bones option when things are very sensitive, this is absolutely a product I will never go without.\n\nAnd there it is! I hope this list helps someone else who's confronted with all the healing ointments out there and could use a comparison!",

I know this is a really old post, but I'm hoping that you can reply :)\nI saw on one of your comments that this was actually not a lanolin allergy but some immunity issue that you had and that it eventually went away on its own.\nI think I'm going through something similar, although I can recognize that this all started with a product that I used. But after removing it from my routine, I was still reacting and after trying a hundred different products in my whole routine (even stuff that didn't directly touch my lips) I wasn't able to cure this.\nI already did a bunch of allergy tests, and nothing came as positive. \nWell, I'm now thinking that honestly it can't be anything that I'm using, I have tried everything already and this might be something related to my immune system... \nI have some questions for you if you could help. Did antihistamines help any of your symptoms? Because for me, they do nothing on my condition. That's why I always assumed that this was some kind of contact allergy. But to WHAT??? I don't know of anything else that I can remove or replace for something milder. What helps me is immunosupressants like Elidel and steroids (but I don't use those). \nHow did you make yours disappear? Do you think it was just time? You can't relate your improvements with anything that you changed on your routine or some product that you stopped using? \nThank you so much in advance and sorry for the big comment :)",

These changes could possibly result in a more lightweight, less emollient feel overall. \n\n\n☀️ How It Feels on Skin:\n\nI applied the 2023 version on the left side of my face and the 2025 on the right, using the full recommended amount. At first, they felt and looked nearly identical. Both sides look dewy. But once they set, I noticed the 2023 side felt a bit more emollient to the touch. As someone with oily skin, that side started to feel a little greasy, while the 2025 reformulation feels just a bit less emollient. \n\n\n☀️ Final Thoughts:\n\nThey smell the same and feel very similar overall, but that very slight difference in feel makes me prefer the 2025 version. However, this still is not my top Biore face sunscreen (airy hold is still my number 1). ",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

        "body": "My Mom had subtype 3, with thickened skin. She had it really badly her whole life. I have some rosacea but have done my best to try to not wind up like her.  Sadly, I gave up on facial sunscreen a number of times because they irritated me or made my eyes swell shut. I currently use Dermologica which is really spendy and I am not sure it's coverage is that great, but it's the only thing I can use on my whole face so far.\n\n\nTwo things than help me a lot were cutting out black pepper and using more foundation. Environmental irritants wreck me, it seems. I used to wear moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, power, liquid, more powder and then setting spray. Very heavy coverage, but I realized that pretty much sealing my cheeks off from the world made them finally calm down, or maybe it was something in the primer. I kept at it for a long time, but now use lighter coverage. My cheeks are red, but not nearly as bad. Between that and two laser treatments I think of my problem as under control, but can't go out barefaced. And since age is a trigger I could be unknowingly doomed to the burning sensation and painful cysts Mom had, but try to live like that isn't lurking around the corner. \n\n\n\nI've never been able to use anything anti-aging, so the ideal that a retinol might actually help me is very intriguing. All my current doc will prescribe me is metrolotion, which never helped in the slightest. I might go talk to a derm at my own cost and see if that or rhofade might be good for me.",

    "body": "Edit: title should be fatty alcohols not fatty acids but autocorrect thinks for me and sees me type acids a lot so naturally I must’ve meant acids. SIGH. \n\n**WARNING: LONG BUT I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE IT WORTH.**\n\nHey all!\n\nSoooo, years ago, I was a big advocate for the [idea that some people cannot use fatty alcohols](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1y3ql7/simple_tip_for_those_of_us_who_cant_use_fatty/). This was due to my experiences with CeraVe Cream, CeraVe Lotion, Cetaphil Cream, and Cetaphil Lotion, primarily. More, I was using Ziana (.025% tretinoin + clindamycin), which I have a strong suspicion in retrospect was the cause of a form of folliculitis for me (perhaps chemical folliculitis -- there are several types of folliculitis but in this case, acne that is not \"acne,\" but rather born of continuous irritation of the hair follicles). Of course, like *everyone* going through acne, I blamed every skin product I was using except the prescription active that was *designed* to make my acne better. After all, a doctor gave it to me, and a doctor wouldn't give me something that would make me \"sicker.\" \n\nUnfortunately, it turns out that by the time I started to figure this out, it was all way too late. To this day, I have light pitted scarring in places from an 8 month moderate-to-severe zit explosion on my face that never ceased. It has taught me a lot and pressed me to learn a lot about how skin *actually* functions. I was told the entire time I was breaking out that it was just \"purging,\" only to realize what a misnomer \"purging\" kind of is -- implying the skin is holding onto infections waiting to churn out of it's layers rather than comedones -- open or closed -- that are visible, as well as microcomedones that are the beginning of an acne spot but invisible to the naked eye. At the time, purging to me implied that there were acne spots in the deeper layers of my skin waiting to come out. \n\nSo in the process of me flailing, I felt like this class of ingredients that are otherwise harmless were my bane: fatty alcohols. These are stearyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, and cetyl alcohol. After all, they turned up in *everything* that was breaking me out, including the cleansers, so surely it had to be them, right? \n\nFor example, at one point, I was using Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser + CeraVe Cream. What do these products have in common?\n\n**Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser**\n&amp;gt; Water, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, **Stearyl Alcohol**, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben.\n\n**CeraVe Cream**\n&amp;gt;Purified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20 And **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauryl Lactylate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n\n---\n\nSo being the ingredient hound I am, I connected the dots to \"must be fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives.\" After all, everything else I used had had these ingredients too.\n\n**CeraVe Lotion**\n&amp;gt; Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceteareth-20 and** Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\n**Cetaphil Cream**\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Petrolatum, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, PEG-30 Stearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Propylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n**Cetaphil Lotion** *note - I believe this used to have macadamia nut oil in it when I used it and has since been reformulated. \n\n&amp;gt; Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ceteareth-20, **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Dimethicone, Sodium Levulinate, Sodium Anisate,Caprylyl Glycol, Benzyl Alcohol, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Citric Acid, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer\n\nHappy, I thought, \"This must be it! I solved it!\" So I cut out fatty alcohol products (which, as I am sure many of you know, is a *massive* pain in the ass) and [tried to facilitate others in doing the same](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1ufvym/megalisting_products_without_cetylcetearylstearyl/). In fact, I feel like I was the primary champion of \"it might be fatty alcohols!\" back when this sub was only 25k people, and being as we were all learning from eachother and trusted eachother, many people trusted me in that assumption. After all, I had the proof (supposedly) to back it up.\n\nSo I used the lightest products, such as EltaMD PM (which is a wonderful product, don't get me wrong!). Unfortunately, my skin was parched *all of the time.* It was just sick. It kept breaking out for years after, bottle after bottle of EltaMD PM. Life happened, I was removed from the mod group for inactivity, and I just kept on with it - disappearing from this sub for a long-ass time.\n\nAnd then I started thinking... *what did I use before my skin started down this road?*\n\nBefore I knew jack-all about skin, I used Olay pretty religiously. Olay Regenerist, in the pot, with the fragrance. Yep. This stuff:\n\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Isohexadecane, Niacinamide, Isopropyl Isostearate, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Nylon-12, Dimethicone, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Sodium Peg-7 Olive Oil Carboxylate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ceratonia Siliqua (Carob) Fruit Extract, ** Stearyl Alcohol**, Polyethylene, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Benzyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Dimethiconol, Polyacrylamide, Fragrance, Peg-100 Stearate, Propylparaben, Cetearyl Glucoside, **Cetearyl Alcohol,** C13-14 Isoparaffin, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, C12-13 Pareth-3, Laureth-7, Sodium Hydroxide, Mica.\n\n*\"[Wait a fucking minute](https://media.giphy.com/media/iAYupOdWXQy5a4nVGk/giphy.gif),\"* she thought. \"That shit has cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol and coconut derivatives all the shit I am avoiding. How the fuck did my face not explode then?\"\n\nSo I did something insane: I tried a cream with fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives that was being recommended on this sub at the time (lol). Some of you may recognize this:\n\n**Cheryl Lee MD Ceramide+**\n&amp;gt;Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Coconut), Petrolatum, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Polyglyceryl -10 Pentastearate, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Isostearyl Isostearate, Cetyl Alcohol, 1,3 Propanediol (from Corn), C10-30 Cholesterol/Lanosterol Esters, Ceramide 3, Phytosphingosine, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Niacinamide, Glycyrrhetinic Acid (Licorice Root), 1,2 -Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Gluconolactone.\n\nAnd you want to know something?\n\n90% of my acne healed in a week. 90% of the acne that had been causing me scars and *ruining my fucking life for years* healed in a fucking **week**. I looked back at all the ingredients for all the products that I had avoided and all the ones I had just been able to use fine as a teenager and by fucking god, what did I miss? **Ceteareth-fucking-20** (sans the cleansers -- I still don't know why my skin hated Cetaphil Gentle, but it turns out that it has broken out with every creamy, non-sudsy cleanser ever, so I've resigned myself to using gentle SLES cleansers for life).\n\nI felt like such a massive asshole. \n\nSo that brings me to now, when I decided on a train on a vacation in NYC to start a skin blog. I had spent those years researching my ass off about skin not to even see what a massive fuckup I had made. I had been able to help my BF bring his eczema 80% into control with bleach bath washes and solve my mom's chronically dry skin and my friend's weird case of eczema on his ring finger, but not my own skin. \n\nI came back to this sub after ~5 fucking years (4 of them AFK) and I still see a lot of people avoiding *all fatty alcohols*. I'm making this post to tell you that it might not be all fatty alcohols. It may be cet-20, like me, or it may be those fatty alcohols in combination with other ingredients (combinations of some ingredients can change molecular sizes, some manufacturers use different sources or molecular sized products, like larger or smaller hyaluronic acid, for example). There's so much complexity with skincare, skin, and ingredients that it usually isn't *one whole class of ingredients*. In short: **your mileage may vary**. This is why spot testing is important, one product isn't for everyone, and while ingredient labels are important for weeding out culprits, you also need to do a bit of research on how ingredients work with others to change how they interact on the skin. \n\nSince then, I've spot tested many of the products I flat-out ruled out and 1. it turns out everything with cet-20 does explode my face, 2. it turns out macadamia nut oil also explodes my face (in the cet lotion), and 3. turns out I can use 50% of the things I thought I couldn't (like jojoba oil!).\n\nI'm so happy that many of you have found this sub educational, but **please** consider what you've used in the past (skincare for face, makeup, EVERYTHING) and don't neglect those products when cross-identifying culprits. It changed my life and it might change yours.\n\nSome takeaways, with bullet points because I love bullet points:\n\n* Don't rule out entire classes of ingredients. Skin is super individual and it may be one stupid ingredient.\n* Don't take all of your skincare advice from the Internet, and if you do, try to diversify. Reddit, acne.org, MakeupAlley, medical journals -- get in there and become your own advocate.\n* Sometimes, skin is just an asshole and you won't be able to figure out what it hates. Example: My skin has issues with CeraVe healing ointment and foaming wash, despite them lacking cet-20. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n* Sometimes, what is considered \"good\" or \"best\" for skin isn't good or best for your skin. Example for me: creamy cleansers. They're definitely recommended *everywhere* for *every* skin condition, esp rosacea (which I have), but my skin fucking loathes them all. No idea why, and that's okay.\n* Just because an ingredient is \"good\" for skin doesn't mean it is good for your skin. Example: Me and high % niacinamide = zits. Me and low % niacinamide = k.\n* Just because it's a prescription doesn't mean it can't fuck you up, fam. I thought prescription = good, no problems here, won't cause issues. I have literal scars to prove me wrong. Instead of assuming all is well, **TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR IF SHIT IS UP AND IF YOUR DOCTOR IS LIKE HEY SHIT IS FINE BUT YOU STILL THINK SHIT IS FUCKED, GO TO ANOTHER DOCTOR**. I wish I had done this. Instead, my doc kept urging me to use it every single night. Went to a new doc and he was like, \"Oh no, your skin is very sensitive, that is wayyyy too harsh.\" Listen to your gut.\n* Almost alll skin rules are more like guidelines (except the baking soda, lemon juice, harsh harsh scrubs stuff - that's all still true since they can all throw your skin very out of whack). Example: I do better with light physical exfoliation once a week than AHA any day.\n\nThanks, and I'm sorry for being such a massive, incorrect asshole. I'm doing my best to correct my errors now (and hopefully go to esthetics school though BF is pushing me to do dermatology).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n",

There needs to be someone on the medical side who can vouch for us not being complete loons about our skin. \n\nYes I have to agree with the sentiment of your post.... over the last few years my skin has been freaking out over every little thing. Too hot, too cold, aha, bha, B3, HA, phenoxyethanol the list goes on. \n\nFor 7months I used Tretinoin 0.025% and built up slowly (I thought), the purge happened. Traumatic. Then just unhappy skin.... but it is gold standard for my issues right? My face said no. \n\nAfter becoming ill last year, severely for 6+ months, all skincare and Tret use went down the drain. Just SS once a day, used as moisturiser. Rarely even washed my face in the evening I was too exhausted. \n\nWhat this did, apart from giving me Cc's and what have you. Was a chance for my skin to repair my moisture barrier on my face. Since medication has helped with the symptoms of my illness,  I have been able to use 1 product in my routine with phenoxyethanol as the main preservative, without it giving me painful pustles and nodules everywhere I experienced before. \n\nI have realised that the rash of whiteheads where ever I use a product with HA in and determined was the HA also happens with high levels of BG. So now planning to test a large molecular weight HA serum to see if I have the same issue without the BG. PG is fine... Propanidol is great. \n\nB3 🤔 causes flushing in my skin. And I'm not really interested in trying again.... \n\nBHA, again let me try again at some point. But method of application might be the issue here. \n\nSo vitamin c seemed out of the lexicon for my skin. I now have a silicone based C vit lined up to trial. \n\nFragerance/ essential oils can still mess me up doh. \n\nMoral of this story for me? Concentrate on keeping healthy skin barrier. The rest comes after.... so cleanse (favourite step), treat (calming, hydrating, emollient and then the acne/PIH target), protect. This approach has been working for me so far.",

Things never seem to work the way they're supposed to, and people seem to exclusively rely on anecdotes and personal experiences when giving their recommendations, often repeating things they read in a beauty mag or blog where the main goal is often to sell hair product or push dogma.\n\nSo I've done some digging, to learn a little bit about the real chemistry and science behind your hair care products, to dispel some myths and get to the truth of what's going on with your hair.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387693/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4458934/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19467087\n\n#What is hair?\n\n>*Hair is an integrated system with a peculiar chemical and physical behavior. It is a complex structure of several morphological components that act as a unit. The hair shaft of mammals is divided into three main regions: Cuticle, cortex and medulla. The medulla is present in corser hair like grey hair, thick hair and beard hair, and it is absent in fine hair of children. There is more medulla in the coarser hair of Asians than Caucasians. The medulla may be involved in the splitting of hairs since it provides an area of weakness as a pathway for the propagation of cracks along the axis of the fiber.*\n\n>*The cuticle is a chemically resistant region and consists of flap overlapping scales (keratinocytes) like shingles on the roof. The shape and orientation of the cuticle cells are responsible for the differential friction effect in hair. The cuticle is generally formed by 6–8 scales thick for Asians, slightly less in Caucasians and even less in African hair. A thinner cuticle layer makes African hair more prone to breakage.*\n\n[Image](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1083/7638/files/Hair-Anatomy-e1421050694589.png?v=1505924657)\n\n\n#Why do we shampoo? Is it necessary?\n\nOver time, your hair will develop a build up of dirt and other pollutants (eg: campfire smoke, minerals from hard water) as well as sebum, sweat and dead/peeled skin.\n\nPrior to the 1930's we simply used bar soap to wash our hair. The issue with this is that it would often leave a residue/soap scum on the scalp and hair, which is uncomfortable and aesthetically unpleasing. Shampoo was the answer.\n\nIn recent years, you may have heard that you don't need to shampoo, and that it causes your hair to produce more oils. This is untrue- there is no evidence to support the claim that using shampoo stimulates production of sebum on the scalp, including shampoos that contain sulfates and silicons.\n\nMost proponents of no-poo substitute shampoo with an alternative such as ACV or a specially formulated conditioner that effectively serves the same purpose.\n\n#How does shampoo work?\n\nThe main active ingredient in shampoo is a type of molecule called a surfacant. This is typically a sulfate, with the most common being Sodium Laureth Sulfate and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. You may have heard that all sulfates do is \"create suds\" and damage your hair, this is incorrect.\n\n>*Residues are nonsoluble fats (sebum) that do not dissolve with water. In order to be removed from the hair shaft, surfactants present a hydrophobic molecular portion, and another hydrophilic. The former will chemically bond with the fat, while the latter will bond with the water. The surfactants are generally composed of a chain of fatty hydrocarbons (tail) and a polar head. The polar extremity is capable of giving this portion of the molecule hydrophilic traits that allow it to dissolve in water and wash away the residues.* \n\nWhat this basically means is that one end of the surfacant will attract water, and the other will repel it and attract sebum, allowing it to be washed out of the hair along with the shampoo.\n\nSurfacants can be classified into four groups: Anionic, cationic, amphoteric and nonionic.\n\n[Here's a classifications chart of common surfacants.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387693/bin/IJT-7-2-g001.jpg) \n\n* **Anionic detergents:** Among the most popular surfactants, they are named for their negatively charged hydrophilic polar group. Derived from fatty alcohols, they are very good at removing sebum from the scalp and hair. However, the excessively cleaned hair is harsh, rough, dull with frizz and prone to tangling. Among them, different classes of detergents are available with certain selective properties.\n 1. **Lauryl sulfates:** Popular primary cleansers, they work well in both hard and soft water, produce rich foam, and are easily rinsed. They are excellent cleansers, commonly used in shampoos for oily hair. As the hair becomes harsh and rough, careful selection of a secondary detergent and possible use of a conditioning agent is always required as part of the shampoo formulation. Examples of this class include: Sodium lauryl sulfate, triethanolamine lauryl sulfate, and ammonium lauryl sulfate\n 2. **Laureth sulfates:** These are another class of excellent detergents with good cleansing ability and foaming property which are useful for normal-to-dry hair. Examples of this chemical class are: Sodium laureth sulfate, triethanolamine laureth sulfate, and ammonium laureth sulfate\n 3. **Sarcosines:** They are generally secondary detergents, as they do not remove sebum well from the hair to justify as primary cleansers. They are listed as the second or third on ingredient list of detergents. Excellent conditioners are used in conditioning shampoos and dry hair shampoos. Examples are: Lauryl sarcosine and sodium lauryl sarcosinate\n 4. **Sulfosuccinates:** These are strong detergents commonly used as a secondary surfactant in oily hair shampoos. Examples are disodium oleaminesulfosuccinate and sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate.\n\n* **Cationic Detergents:** In contrast to anionic detergents they have a positively charged polar group. They are poor cleansers and do not lather well and are not compatible with anionic detergents, limiting their utility. However, they are excellent at imparting softness and manageability to chemically damaged hair and so are primarily used as daily shampoo for damaged hair such as in case of permanently dyed or chemically bleached hair. Examples are: Long-chain amino esters, ammonioesters, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride.\n\n* **Amphoteric Detergents:** Having both positively and negatively charged polar group, they behave differently at lower pH (as cationic detergent) and at higher pH (as anionic detergent). Subgroups include the betaines, sultaines, and imidazolinium derivatives. They are used in baby shampoo and for those with fine and damaged hair because they don’t cause stinging in the eyes in children, foam well and leave hair in manageable state. Examples are: Cocamidopropyl betaine and sodium lauraminopropionate.\n\n* **Nonionic Detergents:** They have no polar group and are among the mildest of all cleansers and aid to improve the antistatic qualities of a shampoo. They can be combined with ionic detergent as a secondary cleanser. Examples are: Polyoxyethylene fatty alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol esters and alkanolamides.\n\nAll shampoos contain some variation or combination of these substances to wash your hair. Some sulfate-free shampoos may contain none, but this means that they are basically not effectively cleansing your hair. (most sulfate free shampoos will simply use a surfacant that doesn't contain the word \"sulfate\", though)\n\nHigh end shampoos from salons contain these same ingredients, with the main difference being perhaps nicer smells and a much stronger concentration that requires dilution in water before use.\n\n#####How often should I shampoo?\n\nYou probably do not need to shampoo every day, and you do not need to go weeks without shampooing. Shampoo your hair when it is oily or dirty. Experiment with different shampoos and take a look at the active chemicals that are doing the heavy lifting. \n\n#The benefit of conditioner\n\nModern shampoos are extremely effective. Unfortunately, heavily cleansed hair is not desirable to most, as it is harsh, hard to manage, prone to tangling, and looks dull.\n\nThe solution to this is a conditioner, which are sometimes included in the shampoo itself. \n\nA conditioner is any substance which is intended to enhance feel, appearance, fullness, lubricity, shine, and general manageability of hair. \n\n>*Conditioner molecules contain cationic surfactant which gives a positive electric charge to the conditioner. The negative charge of the hair is attracted to the positively charged conditioner molecules, which results in conditioner getting deposited on the hair, especially on areas where there is degree of weathering. This is true for damaged hair as they are even more negatively charged. Thus, conditioners reduce the static electricity. They also flatten the cuticle scales over the hair shaft, reducing the friction between hair fibers, increasing the reflectance of light which improves shine and color. The smooth feel resulting from conditioner use gives easier combing and detangling in both wet and dry conditions. Conditioners temporarily seal split ends and mend trichoptilosis.*\n\nConditioners will contain a wide variety of ingredients:\n\n* **Cationic surfactants:** Cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, behentrimonium or propyltrimonium, stearamidopropyl dimethylamine. They are considered the backbone of a conditioner\nPolymers: Mono and polypeptides like hydrolyzed proteins (amino acids), polypeptides derived from collagen and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)\n\n* **Bodying agents and thickeners:** Fatty alcohols (e.g. cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol), waxes (e.g. carnauba wax and paraffin wax), or gums (e.g. guar gum) and salt (sodium chloride)\n\n* **Emollients/oily compounds:** These include natural or synthetic oils, but also esters and waxes. Natural oils used in conditioners are, for example, jojoba oil, olive oil, or grape seed oil. The most frequently used synthetic oils are silicone (e.g. dimethicone, dimethiconol, amodimethicone and cyclomethicone) which are even superior to natural oils in terms of film formation, shine and luster. Asian countries have large hair diameters, therefore a higher concentration of silicone is used as compared to that for Caucasian hair (3-5% vs 0.5%)[1]\n\n* **Auxiliary emulsifiers:** Ethoxylated fatty alcohols (e.g. polysorbate-80 or ceteareth-20) which are non-ionic agents seem to be particularly effective at providing emulsion stability if it cannot be acheived by catiionic agents alone in a conditioner.\n\nThe big bogeyman you may notice is silicons. It is not bad for your hair, and not all silicons are equal. If you use a good shampoo with a good surfacant, build-up is not a concern and you likely don't need to worry too much about this. The backlash against silicons cropped up when people decided to eschew sulfates in their shampoo. Many people quickly realized that without proper cleansing, some silicons would build up in the hair over time.\n\nLike all things related to hair care, the key is balance. A fairly comprehensive resource for different types of silicons and how they behave is [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/) on /r/HairCareScience*, keep this in mind when deciding on which hair product to purchase for your hair.\n\n*while /r/HairCareScience has some good information on it and the moderators know their stuff, be wary of basically every comment from the users, as most of them are simply giving others anecdotal advice and spreading bogeymen.\n\n#How to wash and condition your hair.\n\nThe way you apply these products to your hair is undervalued, and doing it properly may have more benefit than you might suspect.\n\nShampoo should be applied starting from the front and working your way to the back. Applying it directly to the top of the head will create friction and cause tangling. \n\nOnce the shampoo has been rinsed from your hair, it's recommended to gently towel dry your hair before applying the conditioner. Conditioner should be applied on the length of the hair, avoiding the scalp.\n\nLeaving conditioner in your hair is not necessary, once the product has been spread over the surface of your hair it has done its job and may be rinsed out completely.\n\nAfterwards the hair may be gently towel dried. \n\n(If your hair is curly, there may be extra steps such as applying a leave-in product while hair is still wet. Using such products on straight thin hair may result in it looking oily and dull.)\n\n#TL;DR?\n\n* Wash your hair when it's dirty/oily. \n\n* There is no evidence to support the claim that sulfates stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more oil than normal.\n\n* Sulfates are not bad for your hair, but may cause it to look dry and become hard to manage. \n\n* Use conditioner or use a less effective surfacant to combat the above problem.\n\n* Silicons are not bad for your hair, most good shampoos will prevent any build up from happening.\n\n* The key to good hair care is not going \"no poo\" or \"sulfate/silicon free\", it's finding the right balance of chemicals to wash your hair and keep it looking good. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I believe your statement to be true that sulfates themselves wont stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more oil. However, washing your hair too often will substantially raise the rate at which your scalp produces oil and thus the rate at which your hair gets greasy. There are two main reasons for this. The first reason is that when you wash your hair and scalp, you'll also inevitably stimulate the skin in that area, creating friction which results in more blood flow that will make the sebaceous glands \"work better\". The second reason is that by washing your hair you'll also remove the oil from your scalp. Leaving your skin in a dry condition. Dry skin will make your sebaceous glands work overtime to fix exactly that problem, as their main function is to lubricate and waterproof your skin. \n\nTldr: Don't wash your hair too often, it will get your hair greasy fast. It can also cause dandruff in the long term by overstimulating the sebaceous glands.\n\nSource: Studied hairdressing and am a barber.",

    "body": "Not sure if Inspire is the right tag here :)\n\nAfter watching Too Much Tash’s videos on cost per use of different makeup products, I decided to stick to one set of products for a week. I have an analytical balance that can detect thousandths of a gram (I teach chem) that I keep for home purposes so I used that.\n\nI kept my makeup look as close to the same as possible each day which allowed for a nice average use of grams per day. I was cognizant of not purposefully over or underusing products compared to my normal routine. I removed any caps that didn’t have wands before weighing, to cut down on opportunities for error (cap gets dirty then I clean it, or drop it on the floor and crack it, etc.) \n\nEach day, I weighed the items after use and recorded the value. Today I averaged them out to get a price per use. \n\nLastly, a note on liquid products - these are listed in mL or fl oz, not grams. I looked at their ingredient lists and estimated their density based on the first couple listed ingredients which were water and dimethicone, as being just under the density of water to convert to grams. These are the least accurate results so take with a grain of salt. The “total uses” are also assuming 100% of the product is possible to be used which is very unlikely given some gets on the wand, coats the packaging, etc.\n\n- Colourpop Pretty Fresh Primer, $12.00, 0.409 g per use, 71 uses, $0.17/use\n- CT Beautiful Skin foundation, 29 g, $49.00, 0.232 g per use, 129 uses, $0.38/use\n- Kosas Air Brow, 3.7 g, $25.00, 0.009 g per use, 411 uses, $0.06/use\n- Colourpop gel eyeliner, 0.2 g, $8.00, 0.008 g, 25 uses, $0.32/use\n- Buxom plumping lip gloss, 4.25 g, $25.0, 0.045 g per use, 94 uses, $0.26/use\n- Tower 28 BeachPlease blush, 4.5 g, $20.00, 0.010 g per use, 450 uses, $0.04/use\n- Hourglass Ambient Blush, 4.2 g, $48.00, 0.009 g per use, 467 uses, $0.10/use\n- Dust+Cream baked bronzer, 6.5 g, $12.55, 0.009 g per use, 722 uses, $0.02/use\n- NYX Proof It eye primer, 7 g, $8.00, 0.026 g per use, 270 uses, $0.03\n- Lancôme Hypnose Drama mascara, 6.24 g, $32, 0.019 g per use, 328 uses*, $0.35/use (by the time this expires in 3 months, I’ll be able to use 1.71 g or 90 uses, hence the higher price per use) \n- Danessa Myricks Twin Flames shadow, 2.27 g, $26.00, 0.019 g per use, 119 uses, $0.22/use\n\nSo if I paid full price and applied my lip gloss 4x per day, my daily face makeup would be *$2.73/day* not including skincare or perfume. \n\nHowever, I did buy the Buxom gloss (-$0.24), CP primer (-$0.10), and Lancôme mascara (-$0.17) on sale, so my actual price is $2.22/day.\n\nI definitely learned that:\n- Don’t buy expensive eyeliner, the amount of product to price ratio isn’t worth it.\n- Every mascara I have has so much product that it’ll always go off before I finish it. Buy travel size; the price per might be higher overall it saves money.\n- Powder blushes and bronzers are a good deal since one gets so many use out of them, but cream products go off faster than I use them up and I should take into account that I may not even get through all of a product before it expires when weighing the price of an item! \n- It’s around $800 per year *just* to do this face. It doesn’t include eyeshadow palettes, brushes, and having multiple colors of anything. Scary! That has pushed me towards sticking with drugstore for 90% of makeup from here on out; there are just too many good ones to justify $32 mascara when my drugstore favorite is $4. ",

    "body": "**TRETINOIN ADVICE**\n\nSome tips from my personal experience with Tretinoin Microsphere. \n\n1. Introduce Tretinoin during winter. (Tretinoin takes the top layer off, which protects us from the sun)\n1. Climatise your skin with retinol before you start on Tretinoin.\n1. Use a mild cleanser, wash your face gently. \n1. Avoid wash cloth, facial scrubs, astringents or any product that will irritate the skin eg actives like LAA, AHA, BHA.\n1. Do not apply immediately after washing your face. Wait 20minutes \n1. The face must be cleansed and completely dry in order for Tretinoin to work properly.  Having water on the surface of your face will prevent it from settling properly.\n1. You may mix Tretinoin with other skin serums if you are experiencing sensitivity.\n1. Start low (eg 0.025) to ensure your skin can adapt to its effects. Building your tolerance will create better results. Before you go to the next level, make sure you use up at least 1 whole tube and have no more redness/peeling before you get a stronger dosage.\n1. Try to use the Tretinoin every night even if you need to dilute it. Using it daily helps you to acclimate better and faster to it. If i stop for a week, it takes me a couple of weeks to get acclimatised to Tretinoin again.\n1. Apply a pea size of Tretinoin to your forehead , cheeks, nose & chin. You may want to avoid applying to sensitive areas like the corners of your mouth, eyes and nose. \n1. No need to use more than pea sized, Dr Frances Prenna Jones teaches how to use a \"chickpea\" size on this [video](https://youtu.be/RMHG3K5x_WE), fast forward to 16:23. She says \"MORE is not MORE\" lol\n1. Begin by applying every other night. After 2 weeks, if there is no redness or irritation, increase application to every night. If you develop redness or irritation, continue at every other night or decrease to twice weekly.\n1. After applying tretinoin, practise wait time of 20min-1 hour before applying your other serums/moisturisers for maximum benefits from Tretinoin.  \n1. When reintroducing Tretinoin into your routine after a long break or perhaps for the Tretinoin virgins, use your AHA/BHA in the day and Tretinoin at night. If you use both together, it may be too irritating for the skin.\n1. Gel is more potent than cream version. [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pigmentation/comments/5acyqx/tretinoin_retinol_retina_differin_adapalene/d9o4wyy/)\n1. Tretinoin / Retinol  could give you a red, rosy hue to the skin as Retinoic acid increases capillary aborisation in the dermis. You may want to get a colour correcting primer to use before you apply your foundation. It could either be green/yellow based.\n1. Apply Tretinoin in the night only. No exceptions. Do not use in the day. Tretinoin is light sensitive.\n1. Tretinoin / Retinol will increase your photosensitivity, sunscreen is mandatory. Do not start Tretinoin if you do not intend to use sunscreen.\n1. Please use a mineral based sunscreen and wear a broad rim hat. Mineral based sunscreen will better block the sun harmful rays and are less likely to irritate the skin unlike sunscreen chemicals. Lack of sun protection can lead to easily burned skin.\n1. Less is more with Tretinoin.\n1. Continued use is key, as it takes some time to take effect.\n1. Ensure you hydrate hydrate hydrate.\n - Basically you just pile it on your moisturiser. I was using multiple serums and multiple creams and finished off with an occlusive every night... while your skin is adjusting to Tretinoin, the acid mantle may be broken and you'll suffer from TEWL big time...\n - In the day... get a mist.. and topup... good over makeup/sunscreen. Perhaps you can use a silcone primer as a kind of occlusive to prevent TEWL. Make sure you topup your sunscreen as Tretinoin makes you uber sun sensitive!\n1. Finish the routine with an occlusive if necessary.\n\n\n* DO NOT USE if pregnant or if you are planning for a baby (applies to females only).\n\n***\n\n[Transepidermal Water Loss \\(TEWL\\)](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-32109-2_32) \n\n\n***\n\n**MOISTURE UP - best advice for tretinoin users**\n\nWith moisturisers.. make sure you use all 3 types. This youtube video can explain a lil http://youtu.be/QdNPiW4ZULk \n\n* Occlusives - you want only 1 layer, this is used LAST\n* Emollients -  creams, ointments, lotions and gels. \n* Humectants - as many layers as possible, water based.\n\nYMMV of course.\n\n***\n\nBasically i divide it into 3 categories since the above 3 categories can sometimes overlap\n\n* Water based\n* Non Water based including oils and butters\n* Occlusive\n\n**Tips**\n\n* You want lots and lots of water based moisturisers that are skin identical, water-binding, humectants.\n* Limit the oil based ingredients to 1 not too oily.\n* Unlimited from the water based category. \n* Use the Occlusive last and a thin layer will suffice.\n \n***\n\n#**Ingredients to look out for include:**\n\n**Water based**\n\nMy personal fave are Sodium Hyaluronate and Sodium PCA (similar to Hyaluronic Acid)\nWater binding agents / NMF Natural moisturising factors\n\n* Hyaluronic Acid (HA)\n* Centella asiatica (Gotu Kola)\n* Ceramides\n* DMAE Dimethylaminoethanol / DMAE Bitartrate\n* Genistein\n* Beta Glucan\n* Glycerin\n* Ceramides\n* Lecithin\n* Polysaccharides\n* Hyaluronic Acid\n* Sodim Hyaluronate\n* Sodium PCA\n* Collagen\n* Elastin\n* Proteins\n* Amino Acid\n* Cholesterol\n* Glucose\n* Sucrose\n* Fructose\n* Glycogen\n* Phospholipids\n* Glycosphingolipids\n* Glycosaminoglycan\n* Allantoin helps to improve the water content of the epidermis\n* Panthenol Vitamin B5\n\n***\n\n**Oil based:**\n\nAdd a facial oil but no more than 1 as you don't want to get too oily\n\n* i noticed a lot of people using rosehip oil. I don't think it is a good option as rosehip contains betacarotene and perhaps trace amounts of trans-retinoic acid. If you are using Tretinoin, you don't need any more vitamin A. * Perhaps choose a different facial oil that is more suitable for your skin type. \n * Plenty of Oleic acid for dry skin types and \n * Lots of Linoleic Acid for oily/acne prone skin as the skin is deficient in that Omega 6 fatty acid.\n* Check out [Gothamista's guide to facial oils](https://youtu.be/R1TZwTDlzw4)\n\n\n\n***\n\n**Occlusives**\n\nVaseline has the highest occlusive factor but i prefer the more natural versions instead of petroleum based alternatives.\n\n* Natural versions\n * Squalane / Squalene\n * Lecithin\n * Cocoa butter, Mango and Shea butter: Careful only Shea butter is non comedogenic\n * Coconut oil - comedogenic rating 4\n * Beeswax is a wonderful occlusive ingredient, especially for dry, chapped lip\n * Lanolin -It is a wax not fat secreted by sebaceous glands of wool-bearing animals. Used for its protective and barrier properties.\n\n* Petroleum by products\n * Mineral Oil\n * Isoparaffin\n * Polybutene\n * Synthetic petrol chemical derived ingredients (they give a long term occlusion of the skin,  prevents the skin from recognising the need to repair itself)\n * Silicone\n * Methicone \n * Dimethicone\n * Cyclohexasiloxane\n * many other silicone derivatives (most ending with \"cone\")\n\n\n***\n\n**Skin Soothing ingredients**\n\nWhen you start peeling, this will help the skin reduce inflammation and heal.\n\n* Manuka Honey\n* Gotu Kola / Centella asiatica/ Madecassoside/ Madecassic acid\n* Allantoin\n* Calendula\n* Bisabolol / Camomile\n* Cucumber\n* Aloe Vera\n* Licorice Root\n* Oatmeal\n* Beta-Glucan\n* Zinc oxide (used in baby diaper rash creams too)\n* Snail \n\n***\n\n**Healing ingredients to include**\n\nUse this to accelerate healing from the \"Tret face\"\n\n* Copper peptides\n* EGF/ DNA repair\n\n*** \n\nRetinoids research\n\n* [Retinoids in the treatment of skin aging: an overview of clinical efficacy and safety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2699641/) by Siddharth Mukherjee et al.

        "body": "Just my two cents but,\nApplying tretinoin in the day is a waste of tretinoin and will just make your skin unnecessarily dry and flaky. Because it degrades in the presence of sunlight, if you leave the house at all it will be rendered ineffective (your sunscreen can only protect you so much).  If you want to use tretinoin more aggressively you should probably try to get a larger dose. \n(Speaking as someone whose GP prescribed tretinoin twice daily, all it will do is cause your skin to peel off as if you got a sunburn. Makes it impossible for products to absorb and looks terrible.)",

The first couple of days, my face was red (looks like a mild sunburn), so I took 1 night off of both Retin A and BHA/AHA, then continued the next day. Since then, I haven't experienced anymore irritation except for a bit of flaking around the nose area. \n\nI also seem to do things completely different from everyone else. I put it on pretty much right after I wash my face because I WANT it to get absorbed and not just wash off somehow on the pillow as I sleep or whatever. I also put it right under my eyes/nose area too, because wrinkles in that area. I also don't put anything on my face before or after I apply my Retin A, since I saw somewhere that recommends tret be right next to the skin to be more effective. \n\nI think Retin-A is so effective that I could get away with using it less frequently and being persistent about using it.

When I switch over to my SLS shampoo boom my hair gets back to normal and stops falling out so much. Also for some reason “dimethicone” doesn’t agree with my scalp even in conjunction with sulfates but any other silicone is fine.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/qIng5NZ) is my hair 3 days no wash WITH sulfates, and [here](http://imgur.com/a/wfDTtiK) 3 days no wash sulfate free!\n\nI gave up today and went and used a sulfate shampoo because my scalp started getting itchy and I have been losing so much hair the last week or two. I usually only wash my hair once a week with sulfates, and it's fine but I couldn't get my hair clean without them (Hask Argan Oil shampoo+conditioner).\n\nWhich is a shame really, because I admit my hair has been softer and much easier to brush but that might just be because of all the oil and residue build up. I double shampoo, and have been thoroughly rinsing but it's just not working for me. I even left the shampoo on my hair for an extra minute last time but that made my scalp all itchy and dry, but my hair stayed oily. I don't use silicones so it's not a build up, I don't know what's happening there.\n\nAlso I'm noticing in these photos my hair grows lopsided..",

And yet everyone is jumping onto the bandwagon and believing all sorts of pseudoscience, like gluten-free being able to cure autism, prevent cancer, and save your soul. Or that gluten-free anything will immediately improve it. Anything and everything else will destroy your health. And of course companies, who are out to sell their products, will cater to this and all of a sudden everything at the grocery store (included bottled water) is gluten-free. That fact is that gluten-free can in fact be less healthy, because you're cutting out an entire food group filled with whole grains, fibre, plant-based protein, and other beneficial macro and micro nutrients. Moreover, you're more likely to consume more processed foods with additives to improve the taste of gluten-free foods or that are designed to mimic gluten-containing ones. Not to mention gluten-free products are expensive, as they're viewed as more premium and therefore command a higher price tag.\n\nNow...replace the word gluten with sulfates and read it again. I understand that sulfate-free works for certain people with very dry/damaged hair and who use zero or extremely limited products, who don't need to feel squeaky clean, and who are willing to put an extra 15 mins in the shower vigorously scrubbing and scrubbing and scrubbing and then scrubbing some more. But the fact is that sulfates are extremely effective at keeping your hair free of buildup and restore movement and bounce. Just because a product isn't stripping doesn't mean it's a good product. Tons of the highest end products all contain some form of sulfate. More attention needs to be paid to the formulation, not isolating one ingredient out and demonizing it and piling all of your hair woes onto any products that contain it.",

    "body": "Panibagong sunscreen naman ang irereview ko. Ito ay yung SunProfessional Sunscreen with Orgasol Caresse ng Brilliant Skin Essentials. Yung white ang binili ko, since hindi ako gumagamit ng tinted sunscreens for personal use. Na-curious ako sa sunscreen na ito kasi ito yung first time kong makakita ng product kung saan hindi active ingredient ang main focus. Perfect chance din ito para magkaroon ako ng idea sa performance ng Orgasol Caresse na raw material, na di ko na kinakailangang i-source out yung mismong material at ipadala sa lab. For context, ang Orgasol Caresse kasi ay isang spheroidal powder na may oil-absorption capacity at nakakapagbigay ng powdery finish, lalo na sa mga products kagaya ng sunscreen (more on this later sa ingredients portion). Naubos ko na itong nabili ko, kaya naisipan ko na ding gawan ito ng review. \n\nUnang kapansin-pansin sa product na ito ay yung primary packaging nitong bote na hugis itlog. Infairness sa brand, pina IPO pa nila ito, at nakita ko mismo sa IG nung brand owner yung specs at design ng boteng ito. Magandang to laban sa counterfeiting, since laganap to ngayon both sa local at international brands. Maganda din ang pagkakaprint ng text sa bote, hindi nag-i-smudge kahit basa ang kamay ng tubig, pawis, or nung mismong product. \n\nNgayon naman, sa actual use. Itong sunscreen na ito ay isang opaque white na gel cream, na hindi ganoon kadaling mag-break down when in contact sa daliri o kamay. For context, may mga nasubukan na akong sunscreen na upon contact sa skin e nag-be-break na agad yung emulsion. Ito kadalasan yung sinasabi nung mga users na nagiging matubig or runny yung sunscreen kapag ginagamit nila. Scented itong sunscreen ba ito, pero hindi ganoon kalakas (for me) na tipong nakakasura. Sakto lang para ma-mask yung odor ng base formula. \n\nMadaling i-blend itong sunscreen na ito sa balat, and sa ilang saglit lang e nagseset na ito kaagad. Wala akong white cast na na-observe dito nung ginagamit ko. Aside sa blendability at absence ng white cast, may na-appreciate ako dito sa product na ito. May cooling effect sa balat, sakto sa mainit na panahon natin. Yung cooling effect nito ay hindi ganun katindi to the point na may stinging, subtle cooling effect lang. Kapag natuyo at nagset na sa balat itong sunscreen, dun ko naramdaman yung effect ng Orgasol Caresse na powdery feel nung hinaplos ko yung face ko. Matte ang naging finish nito sa akin, so in my opinion, ok to sa mga oily to combination skin na users. Wala din akong na-observe na pilling sa duration ng paggamit ko nitong sunscreen. Wala din akong naramdaman na stinging o hapdi sa balat nung ginagamit ko ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo sa ingredients. Ito ang ingredient list:\n\nWater, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, Butylene Glycol, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Nylon-6/12, Polyacrylamide, C13-15 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7, Titanium Dioxide, Dimethicone, Green Tea (Camellia Sinensis) Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Cucumber (Cucumis Sativus) Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sunflower (Helianthus Annuus) Seed Oil, Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Leaf Extract, Fragrance, Menthyl Lactate, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA\n\nMay apat na UV filters itong sunscreen na ito:\n\nEthylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (UVB) \nButyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane (UVA) \nOctocrylene (UVB) \nTitanium Dioxide (UVB) \n\nMay slight concern lang ako sa titanium dioxide na ginamit. Sunscreen-grade na titanium dioxide is usually coated with either aluminum hydroxide or silica. Mahalaga ang coating na yan for titanium dioxide dahil pinipigil ng mga coating na ito ang formation ng reactive oxygen species (ROS) kapag tinamaan ng UV ang Titanium Dioxide. Kahit coating yan, dapat isama pa din yan sa ingredient list. \nFor more information sa function ng aluminum hydroxide, pakitingnan na lang sa link below:\nhttps://incidecoder.com/ingredients/aluminum-hydroxide\nPara naman sa silica,  please see link below:\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925838810020128\n\nOk naman ang preservative system, since Phenoxyethanol at Ethylhexylglycerin ang ginamit, common preservative system na ginagamit ng mga brands na averse sa parabens. \n\nTingnan naman natin yung Nylon-6/12. Yan yung INCI name ng Orgasol Caresse. Yan ung nagbibigay nung mga skinfeel benefit at oil-control dito sa sunscreen na ito. Comparable itong ingredient na ito sa Silica at sa Polymethylsilsesquioxane (PMSQ), na kapareho nitong nagbibigay ng powdery after feel at oil-control benefit. \n\nAnother noteworthy na ingredient sa sunscreen na ito ay yung Menthyl Lactate. Ito yung nagbibigay sa sunscreen na ito ng subtle cooling effect sa skin during use. Related ito sa Menthol, ang kadalasang ginagamit na ingredient for cooling benefit. \n\nAng next comment ko sa ingredients nitong product na ito ay para sa mga cosmetic chemist at regulatory personnel na in-charge sa paggawa at pag-check ng IL. Sa product na ito, hindi na-take into consideration yung % composition nung mga raw materials na existing as blends or premixes. For example, sa UV filter, ang ginamit na raw material dito is SUNCAT MTA, isang raw material premix. Ang composition nitong raw material blend na ito ay yung first 6 ingredients na makikita nyo sa IL nitong product na ito. Kung ite-take into account yung % ng each component ng SUNCAT MTA, hindi dapat magkakatabi yung anim na yan, meron jan na dapat nasa ibabang part ng IL. This is the same din sa emulsifier system at preservative system na ginamit dito, hindi advisable na magkakatabi yan, since premix yung ginamit. Ngayon, bakit ko ito pinuna? Dahil pinapadali nito ang paggaya sa product nyo ng mga competitors nyo. So para dun sa brand, kung ayaw nyo magaya kaagad ng iba yung product nyo, please consider taking into account yung % composition nung mga mixture ingredients nyo para mapwesto ng maayos sa IL. \n\nPunta naman tayo sa product claims. Simple at straight forward ng claims nitong product na ito, base sa label. \n1. With Orgasol Caresse\n2. Broad Spectrum SPF 50 PA++++ UVA-UVB Protection\n\nClaim #1, napatunayan na natin yan sa ingredient list, Orgasol Caresse = Nylon-6/12.\n\nClaim #2, hindi ko alam kung nai-post na ba ng brand owner sa kanyang soc med yung SPF Test report. Yung brand owner na makakasagot nito. \n\nMay isang bagay lang akong napansin sa box nito. Hindi nakalagay yung mandatory warning statement, according sa ASEAN Sunscreen Labeling Guideline:\nDo not stay too long in the sun, even while using a sunscreen product. \nDapat lang talaga na ilagay ito sa label ng mga sunscreen product dahil madalas na nakakalimutan ng mga consumer na hindi advisable na magbabad sa ilalim ng sikat ng araw kahit pa na naka sunscreen. Once na mahulas yang sunscreen na gamit mo, masusunog at masusunog ang balat mo jan. \n\nFinal words regarding this sunscreen:\nAside dun sa mga comments ko regarding sa improvement ng ingredient list, absence ng mandatory warning statement, pati na sa non-inclusion ng ginamit na coating agents para sa titanium dioxide sa IL, ok naman itong sunscreen na ito overall. Good aesthetics, good formula, straight forward product claims na wala ng kuskos balungos. \n\nAyun lang, maraming salamat sa pagbabasa ng review na ito. \n",

    "body": "I don't purchase makeup and skincare too frequently, maybe a lipstick here and there, and a restock on products I need, like moisturizer, but for the most part, my spending is limited. Here is what I have purchased (plus a few holiday gifts!) since about September of 2019.\n\nGeneral information about my skin type/preferences!\n\n* I have dry combination skin leaning more dry, but I live in a humid environment\n* I've got some acne scars and hyperpigmentation\n* I breakout occasionally, but mostly its just hormonal spots here and there\n* I'm extremely fair, always a #01 or #21 with neutral undertones, sometimes leaning more yellow sometimes leaning more cool its an odd mix\n* I'd say my makeup style/the way I wear these products is a fusion of asian beauty and french makeup trends! I spent my formative years in Asia and Europe, and they have influenced my style the most, despite my status as an American\n\n**Makeup** \n\n3CE Mood For Blossom Palette- 5/5 stars\n\nThis was undoubtedly one of my favorite holiday gifts, and has been my favorite springy palette. Admittedly, I already knew I loved 3CE's formula (I have the overtake palette), and consider pink a neutral, so this has been one of my favorite palettes. It's long lasting, the colors are gorgeous, the shimmers lovely, and the mattes easy to blend. You can create a full beat look, or a soft glam one, and while it is not the most versatile palette, basically all the looks will be a light pinky peachy glam, it's still a go to for me. \n\n3CE Slim Velvet Lipstick in #cotton up- 4/5 stars\n\nI'd only dabbled in 3CE's eyeshadows, so I bought this as a birthday present to myself off of yesstyle. I bought the color off the recommendation of youtuber Hana Lee! She featured it in her spring to summer lip colors video, and that sums it up! Its a bright corally lipstick that looks great patted on the lips, on me I don't love it at it's full intensity, but that has to due not with the lipstick, but with my own coloring. I think it's a little expensive for what it is, but I like it just as well. Due to my own preferences, I tend to like glossy lips more, so I like to wear this with a clear gloss layered over it. \n\nThe Saem single eyeshadow in Miso Ramen- 3/5 stars\n\nLook, I bought this because it looks like a little ramen. It's a boring, single eyeshadow. It's not transformative, it's a basic goldy shimmer. I have green eyes, so it looks very nice on me, and I do find it makes my eyes pop. But I have to say, I'm not overall impressed with the formula, its okay, just wish it packed a little extra punch. That being said, its a great option for travel, and maybe another color would have that wow factor I was looking for \n\nRomand Zero Velvet Tint in #02 Joyful- 5/5 stars\n\nI bought this also as a birthday gift to myself, and saw it as an easy way to wear red as an \"everyday\" colour. That's exactly what it is. It's pretty long lasting, the red is not too overpowering, and the price really can't be beat. I love the packaging, it's a nice soft touch plastic if that makes sense? It is not too red, which is a problem I think lots of fair skinned people face with reds. If its SO blue toned and bright, it makes me look even paler and brings out blotchiness in my skin tone. This hits that right balance for me\n\nThe Saem Cover Pefection Pot Concealer in 01- 3.5/5 stars\n\nI purchased this as a replacement for my beloved Canmake mixing concealer. Now I really do think this is a good pot concealer, it's creamy, thick, and capable of pinpoint concealing my blemishes away. The reason I'm deducting points is because the shade match is awful. I have to use this under my foundation if I want to use it, because it's just simply too dark for my skin, but I can make it work if I put it under my foundation and blend well. It's the lightest colour, so if you are pale as paper like me, this is not a good option. \n\nEtude House Drawing Eyebrow Slim in Dark Brown- 4.5/5 stars\n\nI purchased this as a replacement of my Colourpop brow product. I don't believe in paying a lot for brow pencils, as I tend to go through them in about 6 months. This is a great brow product for me personally, but I understand why it may not work for everyone. I have very thick brows, so I only use this to lightly fill in spots that are a tad sparse. I use this in conjunction with the Glossier Boy Brow, and it does the job wonderfully. It's not too pigmented where if I go hard, I'm going to have to brush them out for eternity. It's precise enough to fake some brow hairs, and the colour match is PERFECT. I wish the spoolie was a little better, but other than that, it's a fantastic brow product!\n\nVDL Lumilayer Primer- 5/5 stars!\n\nI wish I could give this more stars, it is my HG primer and I love it to death. I don't like pore filling primers, I find the dimethicone-y texture uncomfortable. I prefer to hydrate with my wide array of face oils and moisturizers over a primer. I purely want it to give some extra glow to my face, without making me look like the tin man. This does exactly that. It fakes glass skin SO well. The packaging is gorgeous, and the price is not bad compared to some other high end primers.\n\nTouch in Sol Glass Skin Primer- 4/5 stars\n\nThis is a really great hydrating/glowy primer. I received it in a boxycharm, and was so pleased to see that touch in sol was a featured brand! They are most famous for the no poreblem primer, but as I'm not a fan of porefilling primers, I was excited to try this out. It really does fake glass skin, that's for sure. The texture is thick, not unlike a rich moisturizer, and it is heavily scented. When I wear this, I do have to wait for it to sink in a bit, because I do my morning skincare before makeup, and when I wear this it's like putting another moisturizer on top of my already extensive skincare routine. Personally, I prefer the VDL one, but it was still fun to try, and I think it's an excellent product.\n\n**Skincare**\n\nEtude House Soon Jung Barrier Intensive Cream- 4.5/5 stars\n\nSo I've been using the Innisfree Green Tea Seed Cream almost exclusively since 2017. Unfortunately, it was out of stock on yesstyle, so I grabbed this instead. I have to say, I'm pleasantly surprised! It's a very nice, no frills moisturizer. It's hydrating, without being too thick, the packaging is easy to travel with, and it actually gives me a similar feeling to the Drunk Elephant poly peptide moisturizer. Is it better for me than my innisfree one, no, not to me. That one is just my holy grail, it's the perfect thickness, I love the scent, and I do miss it. But! If you are maybe allergic to scents or just want something cheaper, this is a great option. This whole line from Etude house seems to be very nice, and I would be very interested in picking up the toner (after I work through some more of my own). I was very pleasantly surprised, considering I hadn't had the greatest experience with Etude House's skincare before. \n\nDr Jart Ceramidin Cream- 5/5 stars\n\nI really do love this moisturizer. It is the only one I've had come so close to dethroning my innisfree HG. I actually got this for a STEAL at my local TJ Maxx in a set with some other Dr Jart Products. This moisturizer is very moisturizing, but didn't break me out, made my skin also feel similar to more expensive Drunk Elephant and Tatcha products. The texture is almost balmy, and it made my skin feel so good after. This is rather pricey, so I think that if I didn't get it for literally 7 dollars, I would be more skeptical. But hey if you have the cash! Go for it!\n\nDr Jart Tiger Grass Cicapair Colour Correcting Treatment- 5/5 stars\n\nI also got this for a steal at TJ Maxx, and it's amazing. On good skin days/no makeup days, I just wear this because it cancels out ALL of my redness beautifully. It's pretty hydrating too, and if I mix in a few drops of facial oil, that's really all I need. If you have super dry skin, just mix in a little oil or wear a LIGHT layer of moisturizer underneath. If you're oily, I think this could work for you too. The texture is unlike any other product I've ever used. It's thick, and a little hard to spread, but not in an unpleasant way. If you have lots of redness, I really do recommend this, but only if you can foot the bill. I'm glad I got it for way cheaper, because I never would have bought it otherwise.\n\nThe Creme Shop Clear Skin Hydrocolloid Dark Spot Acne patches- 3/5 stars\n\nThese are okay, I again got them from TJ maxx. They do the job okay? Not the most effective at draining, but at least they are very cute little blue stars. They did bring a smile to my face. I prefer the cosrx or nexcare ones, but for 3 bucks, not bad, and at least they keep the pimples from getting worse. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBONUS!\n\nApieu roll on fragrance in Peach- 5/5 stars\n\nI totally understand why people don't purchase scents online but I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!  It's so light and fresh, it smells pretty much like the Bath and Body Works Pretty as a Peach body spray, but a touch less sweet. I love throwing this in my bag and using it in conjunction with that body spray. Such a light, pretty sweet scent that I feel matches my vibe very well.",

Most products that claim to mend split ends don’t have these two ingredients. Also, both ingredients are required for the mending to work and withstand other stresses like combing. \n\n#Here’s the study done on these two ingredients showing the semi permanent mending effects: \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/6111412_Semi-permanent_split_end_mending_with_a_polyelectrolyte_complex\n\n##Brief explanation:\n\nThe cationic, anti static ingredient **polyquaternium-28** is attracted to the anionic ingredient **PVM/MA copolymer**. The idea is that damage and split ends are anionic so the polyquaternium-28 is attracted to them and will bind them together until it is washed out. In the study, these two ingredients were shown to bind together split ends and also withstood the stress of combing.\n\n#Here are some products I FINALLY found that have these two ingredients:\n\n#[Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum 4 oz ($20)](https://www.frendsbeauty.com/kim-kimble-healed-ends-serum-4oz.html)\n\nIngredients: \n\nWater (Aqua), **Polyquaternium-28**, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Arctium Majus Root (Burdock) Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail Extract, Malva Sylvestris (Mallow) Flower Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Saccharum Officinaru (Sugarcane) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Lactic Acid, Ethylhexyglycerin, Betaine, Hexylene Glycol, **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Dimethicone PEG-8 Meadowfoamate, Hexapeptide-11, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nThis one has **polyquaternium-28** as the 2nd ingredient, then some oils, a bunch of extracts, then the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 17th ingredient. Phenoxyethanol as the preservative is fine here since it is being used on the ends, not on the scalp.\n\n#[Color Proof SuperRich Split Ends Mender 3.4 oz ($11)](https://www.beautyplussalon.com/color-proof-superrich-split-ends-mender)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Glycerin, **Polyquaternium-28**, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum, Fragrance (Parfum), **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxypropyl Cyclodextrin, Polysorbate 80, Caprylyl Glycol, Linalool, Citric Acid, Limonene, Sorbitan Oleate, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Citronellol, Citral, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Quaternium-95, Propanediol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Extract, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Hydrolyzed Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Lentinus Edodes Extract, Tocopherol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Benzoate, BHT, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate.\n\nThis ingredients list is interesting, **polyquaternium-28** as the 3rd ingredient is awesome, but the 4th, 5th, and 6th ingredients are two preservatives and a fragrance. That’s fine, as xanthan gum is also a thickener. Then the 7th ingredient is the **PVM/MA copolymer**. Then there’s a bunch of emollients and extracts and another preservative that is annoying to see in products. \n\n##This one contains Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, a **formaldehyde releasing preservative**. This is fine, as the formaldehyde is how it preserves the product, but it is always good to be aware of these things, so you don’t let the bottle sit for a very long time, as this ingredient **releases formaldehyde slowly over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[White Sands The Cure 24/7 Serum 3.38 oz ($20)](https://sleekshop.com/products/white-sands-the-cure-24-7-serum.html?sku=whs09-3-38-oz)\n\nIngredients:\n\nDeionized Water, **Polyaualerium-28**, **PVMMA Copolymer**, Xanthan Gum, Caprylic/Capric Acid, Triglyceride, Cyrribidium Grandilorioum Flower, Propylene Glycol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate, Fragrance.\n\nThis one has a much more simple ingredients list! **Polyquaternium-28** is the second ingredient and the **PVM/MA** copolymer is the third ingredient. Then there is xanthan gum to thicken and preserve. \n\n##However, again, at the end of this list we have **formaldehyde releasing preservatives**: **Diazolidinyl Urea and Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate.** Again, this is fine, but good to be aware of so you don’t let the bottle sit for a year, as these preservatives **slowly release formaldehyde over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[OGX Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream 6 oz ($9)](https://www.ulta.com/p/locking-coconut-curls-air-dry-cream-pimprod2005306)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater (Aqua), Tapioca Starch, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Polyquaternium-37, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Polyquaternium-28**, **PVM/VA Copolymer**, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Lecithin, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nHere we have tapioca starch to reduce any heavy oily feel. Then some emollients and oils. Then **polyquaternium-28** as the 7th ingredient and the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 8th ingredient. Then there’s some more emollients and then the preservative and a fragrance. Phenoxyethanol is a fine because this is for use on the end of the hair, not the scalp. \n\nSo there you have it. You can semi-permanently mend your split ends. It took a LONG time for me to find products that actually had the *combitnation* of BOTH of these ingredients. \n#So if anyone else finds more products that contain polyquaternium-28 and PVM/MA copolymer, please share here!\n\nAlso, for those that can’t tell, the links are imbedded in the title of the product. So, for example, you can click on the title Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum at the top of the post and it will take you to the website. The links are imbedded in every title",

    "body": "Bought this Neat 3B Face Saver gel from Chemist Warehouse in desperation to stop my foundation separating on my nose and revealing my permanent Rudolph nose, which it did magnificently.\n\nI recommend applying it like a spot primer **after** you have finished with other skincare as following the package directions to put it on before other face products caused everything else to pill.\n\nI only noticed the \"Primer Qualities\" label after I'd applied it, never even saw it on the box or tube before that!\n\nI wouldn't recommend putting it all over your face because the active ingredient is Aluminium Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex Gly 17.5% which is obviously going to block sweat glands. Apply sparingly and only where it's needed. The ingredients are why I found it better to put on my serums and moisturisers first, to create some sort of a barrier.\n\nThe other ingredients are:\n* Water\n* Propylene glycol\n* Cyclopentasiloxane\n* Cyclotetrasiloxane\n* PEG/PPG-18/18\n* Dimethicone\n* Fragrance\n\nIt was about $18 for a 50 g tube which I thought was very reasonable for something to be used in such little amounts at a time and not every day.",

In my opinion, many of these shadows are exactly the same. Others would look identical on my eyes even with very slight differences in intensity or reflect.\n\nI didn’t label each swatch meticulously. My intention here is that it doesn’t matter too much which brand you choose - you’re getting the same product. If two colors across the palettes look similar, they probably are. \n\nMy goal is to show that if you’re interested in this dimethicone-filled, duochrome shimmer shadow type, you have some choices in the market. Shout-out to my friend  u/LegallyBlackBeauty who compared notes last night on early comparisons for this topic.\n\nAdept Cosmetics introduced me to this specific formula - a ‘squishy’ and easily manipulated, wet formula duochrome with strong base pigmentation and bright, shimmery reflect. Launched as their ACI line, Adept released two palettes and four additional singles to spotlight this formula. I own them all and have enjoyed working with their variety of colors.\n\nSeeing positive feedback for the It’s Bel Cosmetics Break the Rules palette, I pre-ordered it without realizing it is a full 9-pan palette of the same formulas. (I often miss out on these details. I try not to watch reviews of products I plan to purchase, so my impressions aren’t influenced.)\n\nI did the same thing with Alien Cosmetics Lore, a color story that really appealed to me. This is not my first purchase from Alien, but Lore was the first time I discovered this formula in their palettes.\n\nFinally, I purchased the Indi Beat Platinum Hits palette, explicitly because I thought it might dupe the Adept shadows & I was interested to see. I also wondered if Platinum Hits offered any new colors in this formula.\n\nNow we’re here.\n\nSome colors are not duped across the palettes - the color stories offer variation, so you have options based on your preferences.\n\nI’m curious if anyone has other brands that offer this precise formula of dimethicone-infused duochromes. The Roen quads are a different formula, and the LA Girl 16-pan square palette metallics are not quite as soft. If I’m forgetting any brands, please let me know!",

    "body": "Companies sometimes share the percentage retinol they use, but it's good to realize this is sometimes not the percentage of the pure retinol, but of a mixture.\n\nPhrases like \"1% coated retinol\" , \"a 1% retinol complex serum\" or we use \"0.5% slow release retinol\" are indicications they could be referring to a mixture/complex. Percentages like 2.5% or 3% are very unlikely pure retinol. There are also products that mention retinol in the product name, while the products doesn't contain retinol, but a derivative like Retinyl Palmitate.\n\nCompanies may list everything below 1% in random order, so often they try to get that 1% line high up on the ingredient list, and then list the actives first to make it look more potent. You could try to spot that 1% line, it can be helpful to determine wether the % is referring to a mixture or to the actual pure retinol. You can also look for ingredients on the inci list that are used in these standard retinol mixtures, commonly used coated/mixture forms can for example be found here:\n\n[https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1)\n\nSome ingredients that are commonly used at or below 1%:  Phenoxyethanol, Parabens, Levulinic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, EDTA's, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Carbomer,  Hyaluronic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Ubiquinone, Peptides, Retinoids, Ceramides, Fragrance, most plant extracts in powder form etc.\n\n\n\n**First example, M. Asam Retinol 1% Intense:**\n\n* Claim: 1% retinol in encapsulated form\n* Indications it's not 1%: Retinyl Palmitate is usually used below 0.3%. Polyurethane Crosspolymer-1 and Glycine Soja Oil are part of RetiCap PF, most likely this serum contains 0.08% Retinol.\n* Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, **Retinyl Palmitate, Retinol,** Panthenol, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, **Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil**, Tocopherol, Lauroyl Lysine, Dipentaerythrityl Pentaisononanoate, Carbomer, Polyglyceryl- 10 Laurate, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, **Polyurethane Crosspolymer- 1,** Caprylyl Glycol, Bht, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Second example, Inkey List Retinol Serum:**\n\n* Claim: 1% stable retinol and 0.5% granactive retinoid\n* Indications it's not 1%: Tocopherol, Carbomer in general are not used above 1%. Caprylyl Glycol in combination with other preservatives is in general not used above 1%, this means there's less than 1% Dimethyl Isosorbide (part of) Granactive Retinoid, which contains 10% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, so 0.05% in this formula. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (and) Sodium Ascorbate (and) Tocopherol (and) retinol is called RetiSTAR. This contains 5% Retinol, so at 1%, there's 0.05% retinol in this formula. So 1.5% total retinoid, no not really, more likely it's 0.1% max.\n* Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Caprylyl Glycol,** Phospholipids, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Squalane, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Extract, **Carbomer**, Sodium Ascorbate, **Tocopherol,** Polysorbate 60, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycolipids, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol,** Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Third example,**[Dr Brandt 2% Retinol serum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26OFz0DakQc&t=0m13s)**:**\n\n* claim 2% Retinol Complex\n* Why it's not 2%: Tocopherol and Phenoxyethanol are not used above 1%. Could be  \"Retinol C50 by Amcol\" or \"Iuvenesens® B-15\". So most likely 0.3% at most. Think about how the fancy packaging and marketing makes you think this is really worth $70. With all the fragrance ingredients lie Limonene, Grapefruit Oil and Lavender Oil it's best to skip this product.\n* Water, Glycerine, Dicaprylylcarbonaat, Isoamyl Lauraat, Cyclopentasiloxaan, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Boter, Shea Butter Cetyl Esters, Triheptanoin, **Tocoferol, Phenoxyethanol,** Behenyl Alcohol, Methylpropaandiol, Glycerylstearaatcitraat, Polysorbaat 20, Natriumacrylaten Copolymeer, **Retinol,** Glycerylstearaat , Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Limonene, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, etc...\n\n**Fourth example, Sunday Riley A+ High Dose 6.5% Retinoid :**\n\n* Claim: 5% retinoid ester, 1% liposomal-encapsulated retinol, 0.5% blue-green algea\n* Probably the 5% refers to Granactive Retinoid, you can't use 50% of this, so that means there's 0.5% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Which seems correct since the 1% line is around Diheptyl Succinate, and Dimethyl Isosorbide is the 3th ingredient. The Retinol is less than 1%, it's liposomal encapsulated, so this could be \"Iuvenesens® B-15\" as well, probably this means there's about 0.2% Retinol at most. So instead of the claimed 6.5% Retinoid, for $85 you are actually getting 0.2% retinol, 0.5% HPR with no indepedant studies on it's anti aging properties, and some unproven plant extract.\n* Water/Eau/Agua, Propanediol, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Triheptanoin, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Hexyldecanol, Disiloxane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Diheptyl Succinate, Propylene Carbonate, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate**, PPG-24-Glycereth-24, Phenyl Trimethicone, **Retinol, Ubiquinone (CoQ10),** Honey Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Algae Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Opuntia Ficus-indica Fruit Extract, Bisabolol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Phospholipids**, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Lecithin, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, 4-t- Butylcyclohexanol, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Helianthus Annuss (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitol, Cetylhydroxyproline Palmitamide, Polysilicone-11, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Polysorbate, Hydroxyphenyl Propamidobenzoic Acid, Stearic Acid, Brassica Campestris Sterols, PVP, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Alcohol, Potassium Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, **Tocopherol**\n\n**Fifth example: Indeed labs Retinol Reface:**\n\n* Claim 1% retinoid fluid, 1% retinol time release complex encapsulated, 3% retinol like peptides\n* Looking at the position of Dimethyl Isosorbide, there's most likely 1% Granactive Retinoid, so 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Retinol is under the 1% line, I'm not completely sure which form is used but could be Retinol 10S, so this means 0.1% final concentration. Xanthan Gum in normal viscosity products is usually something like 0.2%. Peptides at 3%, this mixture contains 100ppm and 50ppm, so 0.0003% and 0.00015% respectively. So instead of thinking to get 5% pure actives, you are getting something like 0.2%.\n* Water, Dimethicone, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Cetearyl Glucoside, Peg-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, **Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol**, Sodium Acrylate/sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, **Xanthan Gum**, Glycine **Soja (Soybean) Oil, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,** Polysorbate 80, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, **Retinol**, **Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Acacia Senegal Gum, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Tocopherol\n\n**Cerave Skin Renewing Retinol Serum**\n\n* Claim: encapsulated Retinol\n* They don't mention any percentage, but it is below 1%. They could have used ROVISOME Retinol Moist,  Water (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Alcohol (and) **Retinol** (and) Polysorbate 20 (and) Potassium Phosphate. This contains 3% retinol, most likely used at 1-2%, there's 0.03-0.06% actual retinol. So if that is correct I think this is more a beginners retinol.\n* Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, **Polysorbate 20**, Peg-40 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, **Potassium Phosphate,** **Ceramide Np**, Ceramide Ap, Ceramide Eop, Carbomer, Niacinamide, Isoceteth-10, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Triethanolamine**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cichorium Intybus Root Extract / Chicory Root Extract, **Lecithin**, **Retinol,** Silica, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, **Alcohol,** Hydroxyacetophenone, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, **Pentylene Glycol,** Xanthan Gum, Phytosphingosine, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter / Shea Butter, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**The Ordinary Granactive 2% Emulsion**\n\n* uses [InuMax Advanced Retinol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/la/PersonalCare/Detail/2163/637871/InuMax-Advanced-Retinol)\n\nAnd to add one more thing besides the vague percentage marketing, remember that Retinol is very, very unstable. It's very difficult to formulate with pure retinol. So it's understandable companies work with premixed complexes. Though even with these complexes as a consumers you can't be 100% sure it stays stable during the whole shelf life. Some products use dropper bottles or tubes that allow air in formula, and products may have been stored for months in warehouses and stores. It can be fine, but as a consumer it's difficult to know for sure. Remember that for PAO and shelf life stability, tests are done to measure things like bacterial/yeast growth, shifting, pH fluctuations. Doing a stability assay to determine the degradation of specific actives in a formula is **not** a mandatory part of that. PAO and shelf life are thus not a 100% guarantee the actual actives remain stable and effective. If you want something OTC, adapalene is much more stable and you don't have to worry wether you are getting the right percentage, it's a standardized proven formula. It doesn't bind to all receptors and is mainly proven for it's anti acne benefits, but the results for it's anti-aging benefits are promising. Other option could be a Retinaldehyde or a Retinol product that is formulated by a larger well known company, is in airless packaging, and which you store in a fridge at home. \n\n\"It can be difficult to discern the concentrations of OTC retinol and retinaldehyde in a given product as there is no labeling requirement in the  USA to list these concentrations. In general, irritation is a biomarker of efficacy, and formulations that do not produce irriation are unlikely to have significant effects. In addition it is advisable to steer patients toward larger, well-established cosmetics companies with a good reputation. Brandname products from companies that have rigorous quality control and regulations are preferred over products from small manufacturers. Because retinol is a fairly unstable compound and requires proper packaging and storage conditions to maintain efficiency, there can be great variability among preparations.[Cutaneous Photoaging, Watson,  Griffiths, 2019](https://books.google.nl/books?id=6reqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=adapalene+photo+aging&source=bl&ots=AkWsbaI5qq&sig=ACfU3U1l2wWZkLfx3P1VHkbLM_ZyfdoopQ&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjahICuw_znAhXDzaQKHS13DLI4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=adapalene%20photo%20aging&f=false)\" --> to add one thing to this, some studies also indicate that when retinol degrades it becomes more irritating to skin, so irritation is not always a good marker.\n\n\nPersonally I think if you want to be sure, go for prescription tretinoin, that is proven and effective, and often more affordable than retinol as well. Otherwise some options below. \n\n* UK: Dermatica - \"otc\" tretinoin\n\n* US: Curology - \"otc\" tretinoin or Adapalene\n\n* [Paula's Choice 1% Retinol Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice.com/clinical-1pct-retinol-treatment/801.html) - $58/30mL\n\n* [Avene RetrinAl 0.1% Retinaldehyde](https://www.aveneusa.com/retrinal-intensive-cream) - $70/30mL\n\n* [Geek&Gorgeous 0.05% Retinaldehyde](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/a-game-5) $13.50/30mL",

    "body": "This is vaseline from the future. \n\nActually, I'm going to start this review there. This product is *mostly* vaseline and mineral oil, similar to Aquaphor but without the lanolin, which is an acne trigger for many. It's essential function is being a heavy occlusive designed to keep skin uncomfortably moist for a long period of time, maintaining prime conditions for skin to heal fast. However, it also contains some of the CeraVe standard ingredients which are known to be effective and safe, including Hyaluronic Acid and Ceramides. This excuses the medium-high price tag to some degree while there seems to be nothing in Aquaphor which merits its price. \n\nFor me this product is so effective and fills a major gap in my routine. I am prone to some breakouts from fatty alcohols and especially from ceteareth-20. I have found that avoiding fatty alcohols entirely in my routine has made my reduction in acne go from 60% to 95%, so it's definitely productive for me to avoid them. This, as many people are well aware, makes finding a moisturizer fairly difficult, as it seems many without fatty alcohols just happen to be loaded with other ingredients that are even more serious triggers. \n\nIt claims it has a \"non-greasy feel\" on the package. This is a huge piece of baloney, up there with \"non-comedogenic\" in terms of the biggest packaging lies. This shit is like smearing grease paste from grease town all over your face. It's primarily petrolatum and mineral oil so you probably know what I'm talking about and what to expect. **But** if you use a very thin layer or as a spot treatment, it is almost a comfortable daily wear. It comes in a very small size that's great for on the go which I have been using for small spots. This has been a game changer for me and picking, because the spots are never dry enough to pick at and if they do start to dry up it's just a touch of this stuff and I'm good to go. \n\nIt's ideal as an overnight mask, plastered on generously. I wake up every morning dewy and bright in a way that vaseline doesn't quite do alone. It also works quite well for its intended purpose of healing chapped areas of skin and protecting skin. \n\nFor as much as this sub idolizes CeraVe, I was suprised at how infrequently this product is mentioned. It makes a great alternative to their fatty alcohol rich formulations with all the good ingredients that made them popular in this sub in the first place. \n\nTLDR: \n\nDay wearability: 5/10\n\nNight wearability: 9/10\n\nIngredients: 9/10 (watch for the dimethicone) \n\nSlug Factor: 10/10\n",

    "body": "So I’ve been doing the 3 skin/7 skin method a bunch, since I had a whole pile of samples and decants of toners lying around. I made a spreadsheet to take notes on the skin-feel and some initial results of each product I attempted to 3 skin with, and now that I'm done with the first \"batch\" of products, thought I would share it here.\n\n(For those who aren’t familiar, here are some [recent](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/5rknkh/7_skin_method_review/) &middot; [threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/5de3yd/anyone_try_the_7_skin_method/) discussing the 3 skin/7 skin method.)\n\nPlease note that my main focus was on texture/consistency and short-term results. Some of these I tried for no more than a few days+nights before moving on; others I used for weeks. I didn’t consider if there were any benefits longer than 24 hours because I don’t need the hydration to last beyond the next time I do my routine. That being said, my face is *significantly* more hydrated since I started doing this, despite having been unprecedentedly dry all winter up until now. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nProduct | Notable Ingredients^1 | Notes on Application | Boost in Hydration? | Other Benefits? | Rating^2\n:-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--: \n*Goodal Waterest First Essence* | Lotus; Saccharomyces; Niacinamide; Alcohol Denat; | Texture somewhere between water and Gokujyun. Nicely slippery/silky when applying. Sinks in at avg speed and leaves skin immediately hydrated. Leaves skin slightly tacky but no film. Fragranced. | Yes | None noticed | ★★☆\n*Nooni Seed Essence Toner* | Olive Oil; silicones; | Fairly strong fragrance. Feels very nice to apply - it's viscous and has a nice slip so no tugging of the skin, and not sticky (possibly due to oils in the ingredients?). It isn't greasy, but I can definitely feel the relative weight of the oil on my face, especially compared to everything else here. | Yes; I could replace routine with multi layers of this product alone. | Emollient; helped add oil content to dry winter skin. Good balance of hydration and moisture. | ★★★\n*Etude House Honey Cera Toner* | Ceramides; Honey, Royal Jelly; Hyaluronic Acid; Dimethicone; Pigments; | Watery/milky consistency. Leaves skin feeling shell-like, smoothed over; but no film. Strong scent. | Immediate hydration only. | Subsequent steps occasionally seemed more difficult to penetrate skin - possibly due to ceramides or silicones? | ☆☆☆\n*Secret Key FTE Rose Edition* | Galactomyces; Niacinamide; Rosa Centifolia Flower Water; | Texture basically like water. No slip, no friction, no stickiness. Occasionally causes slight tingle (could it be due to ferments?). | Not really. | Helps subsequent products absorb (makes sense as this is a main function of FTEs). Cheap! | ★★☆\n*Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum* | lots of plant extracts; Licorice root; Alcohol; | Great texture balance - \"drops\" hold together almost like a gel on the hand, but melts into skin upon pressure like water. Causes a little bit of \"friction\" if I touch my skin and only becomes tacky after several layers. Could layer this one endlessly and not have skin feel weighted down. No film. Hangbang scent. | Immediate hydration only. | Calming/soothing. | ★☆☆\n*Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion* | Hyaluronic Acid; | Very silky smooth feeling upon initial application. Also starts feeling sticky quickly (stickiness does go away with a few minutes' wait time between layers and is overall less sticky than Kiku HM Lotion). Skin feels extremely hydrated (more so than any other product in spreadsheet). Timing is important: best to layer when skin is a little damp. | Yes, more than any other product in this spreadsheet. | Skin appears plumper as a result of intense hydration. | ★★☆\n*Kikumasamune Sake Skin High Moist Lotion* | Ferments; Ceramides; Arbutin; Fragrance; | Strong fragrance. Sinks in quickly and skin feels immediately hydrated, but remains very sticky to the touch. Less sticky when applied in layers of lesser quantity (obviously) and also less sticky if applied over wet face. | Yes, could probably replace routine, but too sticky to use that way. | Skin brightening and evened skin tone, noticeable immediately after application and also next day. | ★★☆\n*Belif Bergamot Toner* | plant extracts; Beta Glucan; Alcohol Denat; Silicones; | Probably my favorite consistency and feel upon application - watery but with a slight slip so applying multiple layers doesn't cause skin tugging. | Immediate hydration only. | Skin feels softer to the touch immediately. | ★☆☆\n*Xaivita Aloe Vera 87% Wrinkle Toner* | Aloe; Centella Asiatica; Fragrance; | Fairly strong fragrance (smells light/cooling, like a fake \"cucumber\" scent or similar). Immediate cooling sensation. Skin feels immediately and significantly cooler to the touch. No stickiness with additional layers. | Yes. Product is not particularly hydrating with only 1 layer. | Cooling and soothing. | ★★★\n*Missha FTE Intensive* | Saccharomyces; Bifida Ferment Lysate; Niacinamide; | Watery, thin, and somehow has slip without being at all viscous. Very easy to pat in without stickiness or tugging at skin. Occasionally causes slight tingle (could it be due to ferments?). | A little - main hydration benefit is boost in ability to suck in subsequent layers. | Glow-m-g! Immediate boost in glow is so visible. Also helps absorption of following products (is FTE after all), ie. 3 layers of HL Gokujyun became non-sticky as fast as just 1 layer does normally. Can definitely feel benefits of products used throughout the next day. | ★★★\n*Neogence Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Lotion* | Hyaluronic Acid; seaweed extract; | Extremely bland; no scent, not much texture apart from watery, sinks into skin quickly, no film. Basically like patting water in. Overall comparable to Belif toner, but without the slight slip. | Not really. Several layers of this is about as hydrating as 1 layer of Hada Labo. | Claims to be pH balancing. | ★☆☆\n\n\n^1 The column for ingredients is (obviously) not comprehensive. I only picked out things that stood out to me as beneficial or potentially detrimental to the texture/overall experience.\n\n^2 Star system: 1 star for good skin-feel during application, 1 star for hydration boost, 1 star for other benefits; ± 1 star where price makes a difference. This is rating specifically the 3 skin usage of each product, not my feelings on the product as a whole.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOverall, my personal takeaways are that 3 skin is a GREAT option *iff* it meets all three of the following:\n\n1. Aids in absorption of other products - If all it does is hydrate, I might as well layer my other serums/essences. (Exception: something that gives ultra super extra hydration like HL Gokujyun can be worth layering, as I can’t reach that hydration level otherwise.) This helps boost efficacy of my serums.\n\n2. Absorbs well itself - If I have to wait ages and experience that hair-in-lip-gloss level of stickiness *all over my face*, then the user experience is just not worth it.\n\n3. The product comes in a large enough quantity/the unit price is low enough to be financially viable. Layering Sulwhasoo was great but so not worth the money. Plus I've seen some opinions that this method is just a big gimmick. I suppose it might be, if you see it as yet another thing you have to spend money on. But imo it's actually the antithesis of a gimmick since I'm amping up the usage and effects of products I already have in large quantities.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nETA: here's a [Google Sheets link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eVk9rc_WsMnrnBOyS6sCAS60AdVEceVuhph5-E509Ho/) if you can't view the whole table on mobile.\n\nETA2: \\*cries\\* there's actually only 11 products here.",

    "body": "I’m about to drop a lot of information here, but please read! I learned a lot about how to properly use sulfates and silicones, so I want to share!! \n\nSo here’s what I’ve learned from Sarah Tran, who has thigh length hair. \n\nEdit: People have brought up genetics. Of course genetics is a huge factor in hair length, but the point of this post is to maintain *healthy* hair, so that it will grow with minimal breakage and split ends. I bring up her length because it is *healthy* as well as long. \n\nAlso note: silicones and sulfates won’t directly contribute to hair growth, but will make your hair stronger and less likely to break and fall out, indirectly resulting in longer fuller hair\n\nFirst off, silicones and sulfates are NOT bad. In fact, if she didn’t use silicones, she couldn’t protect her hair and have such long hair without split ends. The way most people USE silicones is bad though. \n\nThink about it like this: If you have a pair of high heels that are comfortable and you love them, but your friend asks you to go jogging, the shoes are not the problem, the *use* is.\n\nSilicones do the following: \n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair which makes it easier to detangle \n\n-Provides UV protection\n\n-Seals in moisture to prevent dryness\n\n-Makes hair look shiny\n\n-Reduces frizz and adds definition to curls\n\n-Softens and smooths cuticle\n\nSilicones do all these amazing things!!!! However, there are 4 types: airy, friendly (easy to wash out), resilient, and NO GO silicones\n\n*\n#Airy silicones: \nThese evaporate out of the hair after 10 minutes to a few hours. These do not have any negative effect on hair:\n\n-Cyclomethicone \n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n*\n#Friendly silicones:\nThese wash out of the hair with sulfate free shampoos:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate) \n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n*\n#Resilient Silicones:\nThese do NOT build up on the strand, but are non soluble and *require a sulfate* to remove:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone -Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n*\n#NO GO Silicones:\nThese require multiple washes with sulfate shampoo to remove.

BEST USED FOR REMOVING RESILIENT SILICONES:\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate \n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n*\n#SULFATES that remove silicones:\nThese strong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones.

        "body": "Hi! Guys please do your research and don't trust everything you hear. Having thigh length hair is a great achievement but it doesn't make someone a science expert, so posting this on a science sub is so misleading. \n\nI'm seeing some red flags. First off, no scientific sources. Second, commonly demonized ingredients in the push for \"clean\" beauty are again demonized here without proper given cause. And third, there are a few things that stuck out to me as glaringly false from what research I've done. Lastly, fourth, the phrasing at all of \"no go silicones\" and just the incorrect categorization of silicones that assigns them value (better to look at the truer category names: volatile, amine-modified, etc.)\n\nMost ingredients on that \"blacklist\" have little or absolutely no evidence of being bad. \n\nAnd the thing that strikes me as absolutely false is the list of cationic surfactabts as static causing, when most research and literature says the exact opposite - that they're anti static ingredients. Give me a minute and I'll add a few sources for the anti-static claim for cationic surfactants.\n\n> The widely used cationic surfactant docosyltrimethylammonium chloride was overall well performing, especially when it came to reduction of friction force and reduction of flyaway hair during combing. It was superior to the other cationic surfactant tested regarding reduction of frizz. This study suggests that the silicones and protein derivatives showed less promising results regarding the overall manageability. Preliminary data has implications that the efficiency of anti-frizz is correlated with cationic charge and high hydrophobicity of the conditioning agent. \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DYduaceeTnvMJ \n\n> Behentrimonium chloride and Cetrimonium chloride are known to be very effective hair conditioners with detangling, anti-frizz, and anti-static  \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3D0FbAuscGO8AJ",

No product will ever make my shoulder blade-length hair thigh-length, and have it be healthy (as much as I would love that).

Because with a brief look earlier I saw the Palmitamide MEA in it and thought it's one of the ceramides (the names are so similar haha!). However, today I saw incidecoder mentioning it as just a viscosity controlling ingredient (and I usually find them quite accurate), but more things came up where I saw something from mdedge [here](https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/74188_main.pdf) stating \"Palmitamide MEA (PEA) is an important component of MimyX nonsteroidal cream, Dr. Smith said. PEA is an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties\" but this doctor has a consulting agreement with Stiefel Labs, which manufactures Physiogel. Also came across this [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/) but it's testing a synthetic ceramide PC-104 in combination with other things like Palmitamide MEA, grapeseed extract etc. Plus, I remember reading an AMA from kindofstephen where he said \" I think most cosmetic companies would attribute patents as a marketing cost. Most novel patents I've seen in the cosmetic industry are to deal with delivery vehicles (like an airless soft container, etc)\". My takeaway is things can be patented even if they're not doing too much, because to consumers it seems like it's doing a lot? And now idk if this ingredient/Physiogel is any good as a ceramide cream or it's just a good plain heavy moisturiser.\n\nEdit: Realised this ingredient is present in Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume, along with SK-Influx, where it's described as \"Atoderm Intensive Baume quickly stops itching and reduces the urge to scratch thanks to its anti-itching dermatological active ingredient PEA\"\n\nMy understanding is Physiogel doesn't have any ceramides or cholesterol/phytosterols (looks like Zeroid uses phytosterols in place of cholesterol?), but has PEA as a fatty acid (skin similar ingredient), so it must be a good moisturiser but not an ideal-ratio ceramide moisturiser.",

I wrote this months ago; just have a courage to post it now lol.\n\nEverything I wrote is based from my experience, knowledge from fellow redditors on r/AsianBeauty, r/SkincareAddiction, and A LOT of research. Always remember - **YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)** - what worked for others might not work for you and vice-versa. There's no universal treatment in acne or other skin concerns. Skincare is a process of trial and error. Take this post with a grain of salt. \n\nAlso, this is a lengthy post so if you don't have any patience to read this wall of text, shoo! (Ay ang hard haha). Seriously, this post is mostly composed of studies, anecdotes, and other references to support my claims. AYAW NATIN NG FAKE NEWS 'DI BA? \n\nFor clarification, I'm far from that Korean, dewy skin. I have suffered from acne vulgaris for years, but I'm confident that my face improved a lot. But this post wouldn't focus with my acne journey. I want this to be a general skincare guide. There may be some personal thoughts here and there but that would be it. \n\nLastly, I apologize if along the way I may have bent the rules of grammar. I'm just accustomed to explaining things in English. I might repeatedly edit this post if I could bring myself to thoroughly proofread this.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhile I know and appreciate that dermatologists know what products or practices are best for us especially our skin, I'm one of those enthusiasts who believe that it is much better if you know your OWN skin. For example, over my skincare journey I found out that my skin can't handle SLS but I can tolerate SLES, products with malunggay/ben oil break me out, etc. And these are findings a dermatologist can't just provide to me.\n\nYou'll probably get fed up with my skincare one liner - YMMV (Your Mileage May vary) - but this is crucial concept to be familiarized with. Everyone's skin is different. In a simple context - we have different sensitivity to cosmetic ingredients. YMMV but the components of our skin are all the same, just varies on how much you have vs how much they have.\n\nLet me provide you with some science. I'll try to explain this simply (as the saying goes, know and befriend your enemy), tho of course jargon can't be avoided. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**A LITTLE SCIENCE ON HOW OUR SKIN WORKS**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOur skin is composed of three layers - dermis, hypodermis, and epidermis. The most important of the three is the **epidermis** - the outer layer of the skin. Epidermis consists of 15-20 layers of cells which is mostly 95% of **keratinocytes**. They create proteins, with *Keratin* being the most major protein. They are made in the basal (deepest) layer of the epidermis - *Stratum basale/stratum germinativum*. Keratinoctyes present here undergo division and differentiation, half of it will remain in this basal layer, while the other half will further go upward into the upper layers until they reached the outermost layer of the epidermis - the **stratum corneum (SC)**. Keratinocytes in the SC are now keratinized or cornified, this is why they are also called Corneocytes. These keratinocytes in the SC or **corneocytes** are now dead skin cells, which regularly slough away (also called desquamation) and again replaced by Keratinocytes from the deeper layers. They are tightly bound together, forming the SC barrier (sometimes called epidermal barrier, moisture barrier), which plays an important role for a healthy skin.^[1,2]\n\nThis entire process of keratinization takes up to 4 weeks or approximately 28 days. \n\nOther cells present in the epidermis are:^[1,3]\n\n- Melanocytes - they protect our skin from harmful uv rays through their pigment called *melanin*. This pigment is black in nature, that's why when our skin is excessively exposed to sun, such cells produce more melanin. More melanin = darker spot. Heh! Don't blame melanocytes; blame yourself for not applying sunscreen. :P\n- Langerhans’ Cells - they uptake the antigens in our skin and carry them to the nearest lymph node. Specialized in fighting germs.\n- Merkel Cells - enables us to sense pressure because of their sensory function. \n\n&nbsp; \n\nNotice how I focused with the Epidermis 'cause this is where skin diseases usually arise. I hope I haven't lost you yet. Skin actually involves complicated processes; the one I mentioned above is just a simplified version.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGoing back to stratum corneum (SC). SC is the most superficial layer of epidermis. It is also called 'horny layer' because *stratum corneum* is a latin term which literally translates to horny layer. \n\nAnd now the SC barrier. SC barrier is usually described through the *Bricks and Mortar* model. Construction of SC barrier resembles a wall in which layered *corneocytes* stand for *bricks*. Desmosomes keep them intact. Intercellular lipids are the cement which stand for *mortar*.^[2,4]\n\n[Visualization](http://www.ajicjournal.org/cms/attachment/2006299184/2028507809/gr3.jpg)\n \nThese bricks main job is the SC's hydration. This is because of the presence of **natural moisturizing factors** (NMFs). NMFs provide moisture retention because of its humectant property. Humectant bonds with water molecules to increase water content in the skin. Some \ncompounds also have the ability to attract moisture from the environment. NMFs are comprised of amino acids, carboxylic pyrrolidone acid, lactic acid, urea, glucose, and mineral ions.^[5-7]\n\nThe mortar, intercellular lipids, are mostly **ceramides** or sphingolipids (50%), remaining would be 25% of **cholesterol**, and 15% of **free fatty acids**. Together, they strengthen the permeability barrier, warding off external irritants; help in water retention and flux.^[8]\n\n\nAlso notice how important hydration (i.e. water content) in our epidermis, specifically in stratum corneum. \n\nHold on, I'm not trying to sound r/imverysmart here. I assure you such information are significant in skincare. As we delve in further, you'll understand why.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo how do you measure skin barrier function? It is through **transepidermal water loss (TEWL)** and water content of the stratum corneum, and **skin surface pH**. TEWL and water content are evidently inversely proportional - increased TEWL lowers water content; decreased TEWL more water content. TEWL is the total amount of water vapor loss through skin when there is no sweat gland activity. TEWL is measured by ServoMed Evaporimeter (VERY EXPENSIVE!).^[9-12]\n\nImpaired barrier function has been known to lead in skin conditions and diseases such as xerosis (dryness), rosacea, atopic dermatitis (eczema), and acne vulgaris.^[10,13-15] It has been observed that patients with acne vulgaris have low amount of ceramides due to the diminished water barrier content, measured by TEWL. AV patients have higher sebum production and greater TEWL.^[16]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Oh, okay. Eh 'di ikaw na maraming alam, OP. Bakit hindi mo na lang kami diretsuhin sa acne treatments?!*\n\nAba aba, easyhan mo lang. This is one of my pet peeves. We want to have a healthy skin but we don't really educate ourselves with how our skin works, how  a specific product works - how it really impacts our skin. We just slather a random product on our skin and just hope for the best. Well, that 'best' doesn't come easily. We tend to follow unsolicited advice from people who are blessed with good genes and have a healthy skin to begin with. \n\nAnd if ever there's someone here, reading, who has a clear skin to die for, please stop giving UNSOLICITED advice. You're just bringing more attention to the person that they have problematic skin. Of course they know it, but rubbing it to them that they need to treat it isn't actually helpful at all.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n'Kay, going back. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet me state my side why when someone asks advice from me, I don't advise them to see dermatologist ASAP. Emphasis on ASAP. I don't want to sound like I'm discouraging people to visit dermatologist. \n\n*Insert situation where a patient went to dermatologist because of acne vulgaris*\n\nA dermatologist would surely prescribe acne treatments. These can be topical or oral antibiotics;  oral Vitamin A derivative like Accutane; topical Vitamin A derivatives (also known as retinoids) like Tretinoin, Epiduo, Differin (Adapelene); benzoyl peroxide; salycilic acid; azelaic acid; and many more. ~~(YOU SEE, THERE ARE MANY TREATMENTS AVAILABLE AND YET WE STILL SUFFER FROM AV)~~. They would also insist you to use their products or prescribe OTC products, having a basic routine to support a treatment they chose for you.\n\nBy then, the patient already have a simple routine of cleanser, (toner), moisturizer, (and sunscreen) + maybe a topical treatment like Epiduo. The dermatologist advised the patient to use all of these consistently. \n\nProblems? MANY. First, there's no guarantee that the basic routine of cleanser, moisturizer, etc will work for your skin. Why? You can be sensitive to certain ingredient/s present on them, thus leading to *acne cosmetica* (breakouts from cosmetic products). Second, how the hell will you know if it's the cleanser, the toner, or the moisturizer that's causing the problem if you introduced them all at once? Third, treatments like Epiduo encourage faster skin cells turnover rate which can lead to *purging* (surfacing clogged pores A.K.A. it's gonna get worse before it gets better), how will you know if those added acne are due to purging and not acne cosmetica?\n\n\nFourth, these treatments can compromise our skin barrier. Benzoyl peroxide (BP) can cause irritant dermatitis and can result to TEWL.^[17] Topical retinoids can also cause dermatitis. In fact, there's a term called retinoid dermatitis - erythema (redness), scaling (dryness), and desquamation. ^[18] In short, no matter how powerful these treatments are, they can also worsen your skin concerns.\n\n\nQuoting:\n\n> In addition, certain medications used to treat AV can cause alterations in SC integrity and function, either via the active ingredient, the vehicle, or both, which can result in signs and symptoms of cutaneous irritation. . Providing specific skin care recommendations, including product selection and proper use, is an important part of the management of AV and may adjunctively augment the efficacy of topical medications in reducing acne lesions.^[19]\n\nYes, the patient's derma is right in providing a skin care products to help a treatment. But he's wrong for suggesting to use them all at once.\n\nWe have to keep in mind that a problematic skin has an impaired barrier function present to different conditions as what stated above.^[10,13-15] So damaging the skin barrier further would just worsen everything. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**SO what do you need to do, then? BABY your skin! Moisturize it. Strengthen your SC barrier.** \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut how? By having a dedicated skincare routine! This is what I like with r/AsianBeauty. ABers focus on strengthening their skin barrier rather than treating any skin conditions right away. Try posting once on their daily help thread. \"Hi! I'm new to skincare and I need suggestions to treat my acne.\" They wouldn't say \"Hello! Acids like chemical exfoliants are effective on treating acne, try...\" Their answers would probably be, \"What's your current routine? I suggest having a basic routine first before proceeding with powerful treatments.\"\n\nBecause it makes sense! Having a dedicated skincare routine without treatment is as powerful as focusing on treatment itself.^[20,21]\n\nFun fact: Even a proper skincare routine has been known to be effective in aiding the skin barrier function of infants.^[22,23] ~~I can now foresee what would be the first product I would buy for my son/daughter - a moisturizer! Haha, kidding.~~ \n\nBelieve me, when I started having a routine of cleanser + moisturizer + sunscreen every day, the number of my acne reduced significantly. But of course I reached the plateau where I needed to incorporate treatments on my routine, because having a solid routine + a powerful treatment would lead you far!^[24-26]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA simple skincare routine shall compose of a gentle cleanser, a moisturizer, a broad-spectrum sunscreen.\n\nBefore we go further to skincare routine let me just provide additional notes to consider.\n\n**YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)**, duh. I know I mentioned this numerous times and will still do. It is important to instill this concept. You shouldn't be surprised that a certain, popular product didn't work for you. Or a product in which some told you to stay away from, worked for you. That's one of the mysteries of this world, Babe. ~~When they said we are created in God's image and likeness, they meant different gods~~. \n\nWe have different sensitivities to ingredients present in a specific product. \n\n>\"People can even be allergic to commonly used products. It’s not that ingredients in these are unsafe – it’s the way the body reacts to them can differ from person to person.\"\nDr Chris Flower, Director-General of CTPA and a Chartered Biologist & Toxicologist^[27]\n\nWhen a product says *hypoallergenic* doesn't guarantee one won't have reaction to it. After all, *hypo* means *less than* so just lesser chance of allergic reaction. \n\nSame goes with *non-comedogenic* (won't clog your pores). This is just one of those marketing strategies to make you buy that product. Okay, I might have gone overboard. That is still a useful guideline 'cause they could mean that the manufacturers tested their products and consider them good fit for people with oily, acne-prone skin. Don't get so worked up with this when you buy products tho. *\"Okay, this one doesn't say non-comedogenic so I might get acne here*\". No, not that mindset. Remember what I said? YMMV. You won't know until you test it out yourself.\n\n[FDA has a list of common claims and labels used in cosmetics](https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/Labeling/default.htm). \n\nThese are:\n\n- \"Alcohol Free\"\n- “Cosmeceutical”\n- \"Cruelty Free\"/\"Not Tested on Animals\"\n- Hypoallergenic\n- Organic\n\nAs you can see, non-comedogenic is not recognized by FDA.\n\nOne reason is the comedogenicity of some ingredients were tested on rabbit ears. NOT ON HUMANS. \n\n[Related reading](https://www.prettycat.uk/single-post/2017/09/12/Comedogenicity-testing--The-Rabbit-Ear-Test)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFrom time to time, I'm gonna use cosdna.com as a reference to products' ingredients. It's a helpful site for identifying if a specific ingredient is highly comedogenic or an irritant. It does sound contradicting to my previous statement but even [CosDNA said that](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/help/ingredients_qna.php)\n\n> Our data source include[sic] international experts, institutions and publications. If any the three column is blank, this meas[sic] there is no data (not indicate[sic] [whether] the ingredient is safe or unsafe). We want to remind our user, the effect of cosmetics depends on concentration, quality, process and mutual influence of ingredients. The skin condition of each person are[sic] different (even constantly changing).\n\nNevertheless, it still a good site to track ingredients of a particular product. If for example two products broke you out or gave you adverse reactions, you can look and compare the ingredients present on these products, and pinpoint what could be the culprit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThat being said, **Don't hesitate to stop using a product that is not working for you.** If it's making things worse, that just means it's not meant for you. \n\n*Ahh maybe this product is just drawing these pimples out.* No, that is *skin purging* and purging, only happens when you're using exfoliants (BHA, AHA,etc), acids, and/or vitamin A topical derivatives which increase skin's cells turnover rate like retinoids. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**SKINCARE IS GENDER-NEUTRAL**\n\nThis is intended specifically to men. Taking care of your skin doesn't make you less masculine. Using at least three facial products won't hurt your manliness. Please stop that ongoing machismo. \n\nThose products labeled *for men* are just marketing bullshits. \n\nI'm not saying that there's no skin difference between men and women. In fact, males have been reported to have larger pore size and higher sebum production.^[28] Even the skin's pH (which will be tackled later) of females are lower compared to males.^[29] Males also have greater skin thickness than females.^[30]. Males also experience more intense pigmentation after sun exposure and retain it for a longer time than females.^[31]. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet's have an example.\n\n*Nivea for men deep cleansing face wash*\n\n[Ingredients](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_e1ce27538.html)\n\n> Aqua, **Cocamidopropyl Betaine**, **Sodium myreth sulfate**, **Decyl Glucoside**, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, **Alcohol Denat**, PEG-90 GLYCERYL ISOSTEARATE, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, Sodium Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyquaternium-10, Laureth-2, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Benzophenone-4, Parfum\n\nIngredients in bold are surfactants and an alcohol. What I have observed from cleansers that are marketed for men is its supposedly \"deep cleansing\" characteristic. This can be seen from these surfactants. I included alcohol because aside from these sulfates, this is also the culprit why it feel like such products *really cleanses* your face. When in reality, it just leaves your face squeaky clean and DRY. \n\nWhat I also observed is the presence of Benzophenone-4, why the hell would you put a sunscreen ingredient in a facial wash?? \n\nNow, knowing that men's skin has larger pores and tends to be more oily, do these ingredients really help with a male skin? Does science view surfactants as ingredients for men? \n\nDon't get me started with the other one - *Sikreto ng mga Gwapo*. ~~Sikreto pero binunyag, h'wag ako~~. Okay, I'm not saying avoid this product and the like. If it works for you, then okay. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnother example:\n\n*Pond's Men Energy Charge All-in-One Moisturizer*\n\nWow what's with these \"men\" products that use \"Energy\" \"Fresh\" \"Sport\", \"Cool\"? To make them more *masculine*? lol\n\n[Ingredients](https://www.ponds.com/ph/men/products/collection/energy-charge/moisturizer.html)\n\n> Water, Dimethicone, Alcohol Denat, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Caprylic/Capri Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Perfume, DMDM Hydantoin, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Propylene Glycol, Stearic Acid, BHT, Menthol, Sodium PCA, Triethanolamine, Niacinamide, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract\n\nAnother thing I observed is that these manufacturers of supposedly \"for men\" products might be inclined to the idea that men prefer putting products that absorb easily, almost feel like nothing has been applied to the skin, have a cooling effect. \n\nThese are evident with *Alcohol Denat* high up in the ingredients list. Alcohol, an astringent, makes the product absorb easily and can be irritating to some. The presence of Menthol, which is another astringent, is just for added fragrance and cooling sensation. And how can these be beneficial to male's skin? \n\nIt's not that this particular moisturizer is not beneficial. Key ingredients such as *Niacinamide* - for skin brightening and sebum regulation, *Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract* - for anti aging and photoaged skin, are also present. The thing is these ingredients are way below the list. Perfume even listed ahead of them, in which sensitive skin peeps should be wary of. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nOkay let me stop criticizing these products. The takeaway is - skincare is not sexist! The *for men* label is just a marketing ploy, tricking you into thinking that their products are specially formulated for men. \n\n\n---\n\n\n### A skincare routine that doesn't compromise our SC barrier\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**ON CLEANSERS / FACIAL WASHES**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you're going to visit r/AsianBeauty you might stumbled with the pH level of the cleanser they are using. Apparently, pH level is significant in choosing a cleanser to have a healthy skin barrier. \n\n**The pH (Potential of Hydrogen / Power of Hydrogen)** is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of an aqueous solution.\n\n[For reference](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1fChGF6M8a4/Vxcq2iOIf_I/AAAAAAAAEv8/tqT54xF5wMcwSVVaqHBe8YROCx7wP6EVgCLcB/s1600/640px-216_pH_Scale-01.jpg]). The pH scale ranges from 0-14. The pH of distilled water is 7, this is neutral. Any solution with a pH below 7 is an acid and any solution with a pH above 7 is an alkali (or base).\n\nThe skin itself does not really have a pH. When they talk about the pH of the skin, they are referring to the pH of a very thin, naturally secreted, moist layer caused by normal secretions from sweat glands (sudoriferous glands), sebaceous glands (which secrete an oily substance called sebum), and the breakdown of fatty acids on the skin by good bacteria that live on our skin. Together these secretions create the **Acid Mantle**.\n\nYes, remember that I mentioned that skin's pH surface is one of the measures of skin barrier function?^[12] Well, it's gonna be relevant here!\n\nSkin's surface pH is said to be ranging from 4 to 6. Some papers say anywhere from 4 to 7 pH level. Having an average of 4.7, 5.5.^[32,33] The consensus is that our skin's pH is acidic to slightly/mildly acidic. This pH level helps maintain the strength and cohesiveness of the skin.^[34]\n\nWhy is it important to maintain this level of acidity tho? The formation of barrier lipids is observed to be delayed when the pH level is 7.4 or alkaline in nature.^[35] Hope you still remember the SC barrier's mortar.^[8] Lipid formation and metabolism require an acidic pH; alterations contribute to the SC barrier's integrity which may lead to different skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (Eczema), irritant contact dermatitis, ichthyosis, acne vulgaris, and Candida albicans infection.^[36]\n\nAlso, maintaining the skin's acidity doesn't disrupt the bacterial flora's (good bacteria) colonization, present on our skin. Whereas, reaching an alkaline pH promotes the dispersal of these bacteria.^[37] One example is the growth of  Propionibacterium acnes (P Acnes), a commensal bacterium found naturally on our skin, which is also one of the causes of acne vulgaris. P Acnes grow much better in an acidic environment, reaching alkaline pH can increase the number of P Acnes.^[38] Aside from these, alkaline pH skin can show severe irritation to ingredients such as sodium lauryl sulfate (a harsh detergent that we will talk about later).^[39]\n\nIt has also been observed that patients with acne vulgaris tend to have a higher skin pH in comparison to those who a normal skin. Majority of acne occurences are related to high skin pH. Further increase of this pH mirrors a state of SC instability.^[40]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nWhat increases our skin's pH? There are certain factors for that. Endogenous factors include: Skin moisture, sweat, sebum, anatomic site, genetic predisposition, race, age, atopic skin disease. Exogenous factors include: Soaps, detergents, cosmetic products, occlusive dressings, skin irritants, and topical antibiotics.^[41] We'll focus on the latter, with cleansers being the most significant. \n\nThe use of high pH cleansers can disrupt the acid mantle by increasing its acidic pH.^[37,40] A study showed that using an acidic cleanser reduced the number of acne and caused little irritation to acne-prone patients, as oppose to the group who used a soap bar (with a relatively high pH) - number of acne increased.^[42] \n\nIdeally, cleansers should have a pH of around 5.5.^[43] Avoid using soap bars, not only because almost all of them are alkaline (high pH)^[44] , they are also harsh and bring greatest changes to the barrier. Opt for liquid facial cleansers instead.^[45] \n\nEver wondered why some of feminine washes are formulated with acidic pH? (i.e. pH Care). ;)\n\nHow about the recently hyped Aztec Healing Clay Mask? Why is it combined with Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV)? Aztec's main ingredient is calcium bentonite clay which has a whooping pH level of 8 to 9.7! ACV has a pH level 3 to 5 - a perfect pH-neutralizer to bring down the bentonite clay's pH to an optimum skin pH level. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**You might want to avoid cleansers with SLS**\n\nProbably the most common surfuctant is *sodium lauryl sulfate* (SLS) also known as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). It is one of the cheap foaming agents commonly found on soaps, shampoos, toothpaste, etc. It is responsible for the foam or the rich lather you notice when you use such products.^[46]\n\nSurfuctants can penetrate into skin and compromise SC barrier function.^[47] SLS, among other surfuctants, can increase the SC's TEWL and can cause inflammation.^[48,49] Ceramides, one of the skin's lipids^[8], has been observed to decrease when skin is in contact with SLS.^[50] \n\nIt is also listed by [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/ebc959348.html), having a comedogenic rating of 5. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo TL;DR just choose a cleanser that is low pH and doesn't contain SLS then? NOT REALLY but IDEALLY yes. What I meant is there's a reason why some have nice skin despite using cleansers with high pH.  It's just that if you can avoid the drawbacks, then why not? But then again YMMV.\n\nBUT if semantics aside, what you really need to consider is to make sure you're using a **GENTLE** cleanser. Your skin shouldn't feel tight after cleansing. Not drying. Not that \"squeaky clean\" feeling as what others coin.  Just because you're oily, you're gonna tolerate that. No. Remember that I mentioned that sebum is one of the components of acid mantle? That squeaky clean feeling is removing this fatty layer which is important part of skin's natural protection, and stripping natural oils instead of excess oils.\n\nAvoid overwashing, too. Cleanse for a maximum of two times only. Some even like to just splash plain water in the morning. I know it's tempting to wash your face, especially for oily skin, but that's just a temporary fix. After a few minutes, you'll notice that oils will start to build up again. You might even get *acne detergicans* from overwashing. If it bothers you that much, I recommend having an oil face blotter instead which only removes excess oils. [Like this one from Clean & Clear](https://www.cleanandclear.com/blotting-papers/clean-clear-oil-absorbing-sheets)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm gonna list some IDEAL facial washes you can choose from. If I missed other ones, especially LOCAL cleansers or easily available, please do comment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Human Heart Nature] Facial Washes**\n\n[Months ago, I asked Human Heart Nature through their page the pH levels of their various cleansers](https://imgur.com/a/DPcKZ). They were pretty responsive. Listing them down.\n\n- [Nourishing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/nourishing-facial-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.50 to 5.2\n- [Hydrating Creamy Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/hydrating-creamy-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.0 to 6.0\n- [Balancing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/balancing-facial-wash.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 6.0\n- [Acne Defense Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/acne-defense-facial-wash-100ml.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 5.0\n\nPersonally,I prefer the Nourishing Facial Wash. It does what a cleanser should do - gentle cleansing. You might ask why not the Acne Defense Facial Wash since I have oily acne-prone skin type? My understanding is cleanser should only cleanse not treat your acne with acne-fighting ingredients. It's because cleanser is not meant to stay on our skin for a few minutes, thus such ingredients would not really contribute to acne. But if it works for some, go! If you want to try these facial washes, each of these has a small variant for a cheap price. Perfect for testing before committing to full sized bottles. \n\nKeep in mind that the surfuctants on these cleansers are not strong and little to no emulsifier present, thus you *might* not notice a rich foam or lather but that doesn't mean it's not doing it's job. Don't use a huge blob just to force a lather. These are also not fragrance-free. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Celeteque Dermoscience] Hydration Facial Wash](https://www.unilab.com.ph/products/celeteque-dermoscience-hydration-facial-wash/)**\n\nQuoting the product's description:\n> It has mild cleansing agents and a special combination of moisturizers that gently yet effectively clean without drying your skin.\n\nAnd according to one redditor who used digital pH meter to test the pH level of different cleansers, this one has a pH of 5.5! [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/63jk7a/psa_ph_levels_of_various_cleansers/)\n\nHas SLES - a milder version of SLS. I do like this one tho even my mom and my lil sis. Fragrance-free.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Sebamed] Facial Cleansers**\n\nHas two variants: \n\n- [for oily and combination skin](http://www.sebamed.com/products/product-page/?tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bproduct%5D=124&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Baction%5D=show&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bcontroller%5D=Product&cHash=33d05c27ea2ee6871e84e36fdd0a39e4)\n> Soap-free facial cleanser with the pH value of 5.5 of healthy skin to remove excess sebum and aid the skin achieving lipid balance of oily and combination skin\n\n- [for normal to dry skin](http://www.sebamed.com/products/product-page/?tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bproduct%5D=125&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Baction%5D=show&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bcontroller%5D=Product&cHash=62e9f9649f6166184bb8da0635908ac3)\n> Soap-free facial cleanser with the pH value of 5.5 of healthy skin to support and maintain the moisture and lipid balance of normal to dry skin\n\nThe cleansers look promising. I haven't tried them out tho.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Belo Essentials] Facial Washes](http://beloessentials.ph/product)**\n\n- *Pore Minimizing Facial Wash*\n\n> For smooth and radiant complexion, start with Belo Essentials Pore Minimizing Face Wash that tightens pores and whitens your skin in just 7 days! This soap-free, gentle cleanser contains Glutathione, Kojic Acid, and Gigawhite to whiten and skin vitamins to moisturize, revitalizing your skin with a radiant glow. Expertly formulated for oily skin.\n\nIt has a pH level of 5.3.\n\n- *Skin Hydrating Facial Wash*\n\n> Your first step to whiter skin, Belo Essentials Skin Hydrating Face Wash deeply cleanses without over-drying and whitens your skin in just 7 days! This soap-free, nourishing cleanser is infused with Glutathione, Kojic Acid, and Gigawhite to whiten and skin vitamins to moisturize, revealing clearer and whiter skin. Expertly formulated for normal to dry skin.\n\nIt has a pH level of 5.4.\n\nPersonal thoughts: The \"whitens your skin in just 7 days\" seems bogus. You can't just \"whiten\" your skin for that span. And expecting that from a cleanser? Nah. Anyway, if you're looking for a cleanser that's no-frills, these are not for you. They have tons of ingredients present.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**[[Safeguard] Derma Sense Facial Cleanser Sensitive Variant](http://www.sampleroom.ph/safeguard-derma-sense-gently-cleanses-facial-cleanser-acne-prone-skin)**\n\n> gently cleanses easily irritable skin with its mild, unscented formula. It removes dirt, impurities and excess oil, while maintaining your skin's natural layer. Dermatologically tested, DERMA SENSE brings professional care right to you\n\nAlso pH-balanced. I freaking want to try this one because it's well loved by fellow redditors here, but it's always out of stock! Yes, if a product is labeled for sensitive skin, I always prefer it because of their clean ingredients list (no fragrance, additives,etc), so less chance of breaking me out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Himalaya] Purifying Neem Face Wash](http://www.himalayaherbals.com/products/skincare/Purifying-Neem-Face-Wash.htm)**\n\n> Specially formulated to give you clear, problem free skin, a soap-free, daily use face wash gel that cleanses your skin by removing excess oil and impurities without over-drying. Neem, well-known for its purifying and antibacterial properties, kills problem-causing bacteria. Combined with Turmeric, it helps control acne and pimples leaving your skin soft, clear, refreshed and problem-free.\n\nAccording to some redditors it has a pH level of 5.5.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Cetaphil] Gentle Skin Cleanser](https://www.cetaphil.com/gentle-skin-cleanser)**\n\n> a mild, non-irritating formulation that soothes skin as it cleans. In fact, it's gentle enough for a baby's delicate skin. Designed specifically to work for all skin types, it is a simple, yet highly effective way to care for your skin.\n\nThis one has SLS. But my best friend uses this one and she really likes it! She said it's like putting a lotion on her face. Unfortunately, this broke me out. I can't handle SLS. It is also popular on r/AB and r/SCA. \n\n[Ingredients](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_7019242376.html)\n\nIf you can tolerate SLS, this is a perfect cleanser for you. Very short ingredients list. But I've read somewhere this has a pH of around 6.7. Not alkaline so it's kinda good nevertheless.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**ON MOISTURIZERS**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is probably the most vital part of skincare. Moisturizers can help with our SC barrier function if proper ingredients are used. From TEWL reduction, skin lipids' restoration, and other skin rejuvenation benefits.^[51]\n\nAll skin types need moisturizer. Yes, that is contrary to the popular belief that oily skin doesn't need moisturizer. You just need to find a moisturizer that will suit your needs. I presume you already know what your skin type is. If still not, I suggest reading this **[informative post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4kufkk/skin_basics_181_skin_types_setting_standards/)** \n\n**Skin types** vary in different measures but the most common would be: Normal (please step out, jk), Oily, Dry, Combination, and Sensitive. ([Paula's Choice recognizes that everyone has sensitive skin](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/basic-skin-care-tips/what-is-my-skin-type.html)).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere are different types/components/classes/properties of moisturizers. These are humectants, emolients, occlusives, and constituents of natural moisturizing factor/essential proteins.^[52,53] \n\n**Humectants**, as mentioned earlier,^[6] attract water from two sources - from the dermis into the epidermis and in humid conditions from the environment. In short, they are responsible for hydration! However, humectants are a double-edged sword. They increase TEWL too by enhancing water absorption from the dermis into the epidermis where it is easily lost to the environment.^[53] In simplest words, because humectans increased the water content, the skin now have enough water so the rest just evaporates! For this reason, humectants are best combined with occlusives.\n\n**[Some ingredients that act as a humectant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4885180/table/T3/)**:^[54,55]\n\n- *Glycerol/Glycerin*\n\nThis is the most common humectant. In fact, it is the second most frequently used cosmetic ingredient, next to water, documented through the FDA’s Voluntary Cosmetic Reporting Program.^[56] Glycerin is a skin-replenishing and restoring ingredient, meaning it is a substance found naturally in skin, helping to establish normal balance and hydration.^[57] \n\n- *Hyaluronic Acid (HA) or hyaluronan/Sodium Hyaluronate*\n\nThey are not actually the same. Sodium Hyaluronate is derived from Hyaluronic Acid but they still function the same.^[58] It is also present on our body and most abundant in our skin, which accounts for 50% of our body’s total HA level.^[59,60] It can hold 1000 times its water weight!^[61] This makes it a superstar ingredient in skin's hydration and even in skin aging.^[62-64]\n\n- *Propylene Glycol(PG) and Butylene Glycol (BG)*\n\nI've been seeing these ingredients mostly from sheet masks, which is pretty logical. PG and BG, not only a humectant, but can also act as an enhancer. They help active ingredients penetrate the skin.^[65,66] So from a few minutes a sheet mask stayed from your face, the ingredients present penetrated better on your skin; thus faster result (i.e. brightening). There are also studies concerning that PG is skin-sentisizing (can cause adverse reactions from repeated exposure).^[67-69] But the consensus seemed to be PG is safe to use in cosmetics.^[65] If anything, PG should be used in low concentrations^[69] just like other humectants.^[55]\n\n- *Panthenol (Vitamin B5)*\n\nPanthenol, in long-term use, significantly improved the moisture level and decreased TEWL of the skin.^[70,71] It is incredibly useful in wound healing, too.^[72]\n\n- *Urea*\n\n*Insert biased praises in this ingredient.* I just recently discovered this ingredient and I'm already in love. Urea? EWW. Don't worry it's a different urea when used in cosmetics. We are talking about hydroxyethyl urea. As you've read earlier, Urea is one of the natural moisturizing factors present in our skin.^[7]\n\nApparently, Urea is a well-known ingredient in treating xerosis (dry skin).^[73-75] As it turns out, it can also be beneficial to other skin types! Who said only dry skin needs that hydration?\nUrea, like other humectants, can increase the hydration and water-binding capacity of the horny layer.^[76,77] It reduces TEWL and the irritant reactions when skin is exposed to SLS.^[78,79] \n\nThis sexy ingredient has also been observed to have a keratolytic property!^[80,81] **Keratolytic** means the agent that assists keratolysis - \"the softening and shedding of the horny outer layer of the skin\".^[82] In other words, it helps with the desquamation of keratinocytes in the SC or corneocytes; or in more simpler term: *exfoliation*. Fear not, it gently exfoliates compare to active chemical exfoliants. The fun doesn't stop as Urea can also enhance the penetration of other topical ingredients.^[81,83,84]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Occlusives** sit on the skin, creating a physical barrier, blocking the TEWL in the SC. This is the reason why humectants are paired with occlusives. The former draws water onto the skin, while the latter traps this water. The most popular occlusive ingredient is **petrolatum** or petroleum jelly. At a minimum concentration of 5%, it can reduce TEWL by more than 98%!^^[54] \n\nBut you all know how greasy a petroleum jelly is, right? Petroleum Jelly (Vaseline), was previously labeled as highly comedogenic after testing on rabbit's ear. But this has been busted by a study that tested it on acne-prone patients. They concluded that greasiness doesn't equate with comedogenicity! \"The admonition for acne patients to seek \"oil-free\" skin care products has no scientific merit with regard to comedogenicity.\"^^[85] If a product is making you oily because of its nature, doesn't make it highly comedogenic.  But of course -.  There was also an issue that occlusives futher impair barrier function but it has been proven that occlusives, like petrolatum, even accelerated barrier recovery.^[86] I can attest to that. Petroleum jelly really helped when I overexfoliated my skin.\n\nBecause of aesthetic reasons, lighter occlusives came into picture like **lanolin, mineral oil**, and **silicones** which only reduce TEWL by 20–30%.^[54]\n\nJust look at how our fellow redditors are fond of occlusives A.K.A. **S L U G  L I F E**\n\n[I didn't choose the Slug life, the Slug life chose me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/73t814/humor_i_didnt_choose_the_slug_life_the_slug_life/.)\n\n[To all the slugs out there, you win](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/7xe07s/personal_to_all_the_slugs_out_there_you_win/)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Emolients** fill the gap between the layered corneocytes, smoothing the skin. This is the sticky feeling you notice on your moisturizer. \n\n\n---\n\n**[References used:](https://docdro.id/0zJ9xzb.)**\n\nEdit: I have to divide this into parts cause of characters restriction.",

They don't always appear as \"ceramide \\_\\_\", there are other names for them, such as:\n\nHydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, Myristoyl/​Palmitoyl Oxostearamide/​Arachamide MEA, Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide, Hydroxypalmitoyl Sphinganine, [Safflower Oil/​Palm Oil Aminopropanediol Esters](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/safflower-oil-palm-oil-aminopropanediol-esters), etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo today I wanted to make a list of products that are easily overlooked when searching for ceramide skincare, because many people are only looking for the word \"ceramide\".

    "body": "I'm in my 40s. Here's what I'm noticing. Keep in mind that I don't (didn't until MUA) wear makeup very often and had like, one of each of the basics for years. But when I found MUA and began wearing makeup and thinking about it again, I quickly realized that a lot of the advice is great for teens and 20s (and maybe 30s too, gulp) but isn't quite working for me anymore! So here's my old lady experiences with makeup:\n\n1. Matte foundations. I haven't had a lot of experience trying different foundations yet, but I'm finding I rock a dewy look much better than a matte look, when in my 20s I totally leaned the opposite.\n\n1. Drier skin. I had acne FOREVER. Forever! I had oily skin. I figured I'd always have oily skin. Not so much anymore! Oh, of course I still get zits (not as bad, thank goodness), but now my skin has normalized and this winter, I've actually seen dryness. I don't need oil-control *anything* anymore.\n\n1. Eyeshadow. When I first tried on some eyeshadow after not using any for a long time, I couldn't figure out why it looked so crappy. My technique, while newbie, didn't eff it up completely. Technically it should have looked fine. Then I realized. The powder eyeshadow made my eyelids CREPEY. MY NAME IS CLOUDGIRL AND I HAVE CREPEY EYELIDS. I'm finding that non-powder shadows are working way better. \n\n4. Sparkles/shimmer. Matte eyeshadows are definitely pwning shimmer or sparkly ones. I'm finding I don't want random sparkles on my face anymore -- there's some in my (one and only) blush. Now I want Tarte cheek stain. Or Nyx cream blush. Until I get one of those, no blush for me.\n\n1. Application issues. Not totally an age thing, because I've had bad eyes my whole life, but...I have a terrible time seeing my own damn face when I'm putting on makeup. You see, last year I got these, whaddya call them...BIFUCKINGFOCALS. It's hard to try out complicated eye looks! I have to check every stage of makeup by putting on glasses to make sure I am not doing clown face!\n\n1. Potholes. \"Pore fillers\" my ass. The dimethicone, it does nothing.\n\n1. Lips. I don't like the way mattes look on my lips anymore. Plus, mattes seem to seep into those little upper lip crevices now and I can't be arsed to line them or whatever keeps lip product in place. Honestly, I'm mainly using colored glosses now and liking them. It's like by getting older, my makeup is reverting to the Bonne Bell years.\n\n1. Hair. I have a couple of moles that for 40 years served as beauty marks. Now they are wiry hair machines and I'm tired of tweezing them. I'm also seeing some fine hairs around my upper lip.\n\n1. Wrinkles. I'm lucky in that my oily skin has kept them pretty minimal so far. I have 2 crow's feet lines on each eye corner. I think they're distinguished. They just better never ever change.\n\n**TL;DR: My personal middle age makeup angle:** Dewy skin, lip gloss good. Matte eyeshadow good. Cream products > powder products. Potholes,  presbyopia, and new hairs suck. Wrinkles neutral but I'm fine with what I have and don't need any more, thanks.",

        "body": "Great thread!  Like you I am in my 40's and kind of didn't really wear much makeup.  I had like 1 duo, 1 triad and 1 quad of Revlon eye shadow (all in brown), brown eyeliner, one blush and loose powder topped off with one mascara.  In my teens and 20's I wore much more but life got in the way over the years.\n\nAge does really hit hard when I look in the mirror now.   I used to love cat eyes in my younger years now I can't make them work no matter what.   I think my lids are becoming part of my chin and my jowls are joining up with me elbows\n\n I love sparkle but now have to tone it down with mattes which I never ever wore before or my wrinkled eyes look very tragic indeed.   I might have to try non powder shadows but I am deathly afraid of creme because it always meant oily skin and break outs for me.\n\nI am also dealing with dry skin, where did that come from.  I used to be oil city.  I am taking better care of my skin now but I haven't figured out how to change up my routine with my foundations yet or dare even delve into dewy finishes which I so love the look of.\n\nThankfully my wrinkles are more around my eyes, guess it means I laugh and smile much in life.  \n\nAnd I so hear you about seeing!  The 20x mirror is actually scary to look in yet I have to in order to actually see what I am doing half the time.  I am getting lasik done next month and it will be the first time since I was 7 I won't have to wear glasses.  Quite excited about that.\n\nOn the positive side, I do feel and look younger wearing makeup.  Just a couple of weeks ago I had a young stock boy about fall over when my 24 year old daughter called me mom.  He couldn't believe it.  I also have more money to spend on better makeup, which opened a whole new world for me.\n\nI would love to see more of us older women represented in places like this and on youtube.  It's hard to not feel bad when you see a lovely dewy young face on a screen and try to make the look work for you and still feel age appropriate.",

        "body": "I'm 41 and have been a MUA since my teens so I've messed around with makeup a lot and for a long time.  \n\n1. I never liked or looked good in a matte foundation so that hasn't changed but I do notice I need to prime and use a setting spray for stuff to stay on my face.  Not sure if it's an age thing though.  So dewy and locked into place is the way to go for me.\n\n2. Matte shadows are nice (I always use them in the crease) but I find I need some subtle shimmer to brighten my eyes.  Glitter is too much and crazy metallics, although lovely, just seem to age me, but a nice satiny shimmer really perks up my eyes.  I prefer cream formulas but powders from brands like UD usually work pretty well - again with primer, always with the primer.\n\n3. As with the eye shadows, a little shine on the lips helps.  I love glosses, but I can wear a semi-matte far more easily than a matte these days.  If I must wear matte, I need to line well and use a brush to really make it work and lock it in place.  Oh, and I need to put on some lip balm and let it sit a while, wipe most of it off, and THEN apply the liner and matte color to make it look better.\n\n4.  Highlight is my friend.  But again, no crazy metallicy, glittery things.  Glowy ones that make my skin reflect light and look younger.\n\n5.  I never did my eyebrows when younger but now I MUST.  Just filling them in takes years off my appearance.  \n\n6.  Blush.  I require it to not look as though I am a corpse.  I miss my natural high color that I never had to think about.  Plus side?  New obsession with blushes.\n\n \nThat's all I can think of right now.",

Various products.  \n  \n**Opaque concealers.** I have to have highly pigmented concealers now or else the creasing gets out of control as I layer it on to cover the worsening dark circles. When I put concealer on, I have to be careful about making sure it is all properly set with powder in all those little lines. Again, using Bobbi Brown's corrector/concealer here but seriously considering shelling out for Cle de Peau so that I can use less product.  \n  \n**Reverse lip liners.** Didn't need them 10 years ago, but now I do in order to keep the lipstick from feathering into the canyons crossing the borders of my lip. Urban Decay Glide On Lip Pencil in Ozone.  \n  \n**Long Wear Everything.** If it's not formulated to stick to my face for at least 8 hours, I don't bother. I'm too busy to re-apply and don't have spare minutes to be constantly checking my make-up status. Various products.  \n  \n**Liquid Liner is nearly a lost cause.** The crepey, crinkly eyelids will wick liquid liner into the wrinkles, ruining that beautiful crisp line. My best results come after using cream eyeshadows as spackle in the crinkles before laying down liquid eyeliner. Currently, L'Oreal Telescopic waterproof eyeliner because the felt tip has such a fine point that I can maneuver around eyelid crinkles when I need to.   \n  \n**Cream eyeshadows work better than some eye primers.** A white or skin colored cream eyeshadow works better on me than Tarte's or Benefit's eyeshadow primers. Those made my eye skin texture look worse and did nothing to help get feathering liquid eyeliners under control. Cream shadows, on the other hand, not only give a base color for eyeshadows to hold on to, but spackle in the eyelid crinkles (as described above).  Bobbi Brown long wear cream shadow in Bone or Shore.  \n  \n**Heavy-duty moisturizers.** Mature skin needs to drink deep, deeper than ever. Super extra SPF too. Various Aveeno and Lush products.  \n  \n**Exfoliation is still very important.** Whether it's to stave off milia or sand down the pores, exfoliation is still a critical step. The Body Shop Honey Oat Mask 3-in-1 scrub mask or The Body Shop Aloe Gentle Exfoliator.",

I use the Korres Wild Rose Sleeping Facial at night, along with Shiseido moisturizer around my eyes.  I use Olay moisturizer during the day, and I've also been using a vitamin C serum to fade my dark spots.  It's working, though, of course, slowly.  :(\n\nAnd I SOOO feel you on the bifocals.

Have occasionally had Botox and wish I could afford it on a regular basis.  Have had lactic acid and glycolic acid peels - they did nothing.  Had a chemical peel and my whole face peeled and was a lot softer, but should have them every 4 months or so.  Also use Retin-A every night the 0.1%, which is the strongest.  My skin is still a bit on the oily side - so no wrinkles.  Part of that is genetics.  My mother lived to be 91 and didn't have wrinkles, sagged a bit of course.  \n\nAs for makeup the biggest change is eye makeup - my lids droop so much and my right eye droops more than my left so that makes my symmetry loving self crazy.  Used to always wear winged eyeshadow but now the wings get lost in the crease.  However last year I started wearing Urban Decay's Potion Primer for my eyes and my eyemakeup  will stay on all day long.  I've also started wearing Primer under my foundation.

I don't have a lot of wrinkles yet (or maybe they don't bother me), but the large pores and peach fuzz are problematic now that I need more foundation/coverage. I used to only need a tinted moisturizer or could get away with nothing at all. Now I'm on the hunt for the perfect foundation. Just picked up Tarte's 12 hour a couple of days ago. The verdict is still out.\n\nI still prefer matte eyeshadow for day, but don't shy away from shimmer. I have never been into glitter and it would just be ridiculous on me now. I've been liking Ole Henriksen's skincare line for a while, but don't know that it's evening out my skintone at all, just keeping things hydrated and soft. \n\nI've always loved makeup and seem to horde it, but realized in the last few months that I haven't been wearing much of anything for the past year, so I'm reviving my routine and trying out some new things -- highlighting/contouring among them.",

I wore makeup regularly as a teenager (even sold Mary Kay when I was 18) but stopped wearing as much as i headed into my twenties. Prior to my desire to get back into makeup, the last new makeup I had gotten was one of those giant drugstore pallettes that come out around the holidays, and drugstore mascara. I love concealer and mascara. Recently I've upped my game a little; I have a cc cream, a concealer, and I recently invested in some higher priced (ok, \"invested\" actually means \"got for free in a giftbag from work\") mascara (lorac) and picked up a liquid liner (wet and wild) so I can get my wing on. I usually only use 1-2 colors on my lids, and the only blush I have is this super hyper pigmented stuff from Hot Topic. It is VERY bright pink, but in extremely small amounts is passable. I also have a nice red lipstick. Next i am looking into getting bronzer and highlighter for contouring, branching out into other lipsticks and eye pallettes. Oh, and I need a good translucent powder and brushes...so much more lol! But you guys have really inspired me, and I thank you for that.",

    "body": "Third in my series aimed at compiling recommendations offered from members of the AB community for addressing common skin concerns. If you missed it, the previous installations of the series can be found here: \n\n1.\t[ROSACEA, REDNESS, and IRRITATION]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4v2uii/best_products_for_common_skin_concerns_series/)\n\n2.\t[OILY SKIN and ACNE]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4vidxl/best_products_for_common_skin_concerns_series/)\n\n\nProducts, tips, or advice that come up frequently will be listed in **bold.** I have grouped everything that's toner -> ampoule since the lines can get kind of blurry in those categories, and oil-based and foaming cleansers are also grouped. I have included Western products in order to be inclusive of the advice found on this subreddit. I have tried to place those items lower on the list in each category to give prominence to Asian items, given the nature of this sub.\n\n\nPlease feel free to add to the comments - if you see your HG for dry skin isn't listed, tell me! I would love for this to be a working document that is edited as needed, so we can also consider converting into a similar format as it exists over on r/SkinCareAddiction\n\n**PLEASE NOTE**: What follows is a compilation of the advice given on this subreddit to address conditions associated with dry, over-exfoiated skin, and other symptoms associated with a damaged or impaired moisture barrier. It is not a substitute for medical advice or the advice of a dermatologist, nor are they indicative of my own preferences or what I would personally advise. Before trying any new product, it behooves you to check ingredient lists, take note of personal or individual sensitivities, patch test, and introduce only one new product at a time\n\nIF YOUR SKIN IS BROKEN, CRACKED, FISSURED, BLEEDING, OR ASSOCIATED WITH SWELLING, EXQUISITE TENDERNESS, FEVER, PUSTULES, OR PUS, PLEASE LEAVE THE INTERNET AND SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION FROM A HUMAN BEING. IN PERSON.\n\n**For those of you experiencing dryness and sensitivity as a result of prescrpiption topicals,** its important to communicate your skins response with your healthcare provider. You may need to be scaling back your dosage, frequency, or both, or may need to consider alternate treatments. Please do not rely on Dr. Internet for addressing issues with a prescription. \n\n**Another Note:** You’ll notice some overlap between this and previous lists in this series, especially the rosacea/redness post. Lines do get blurry, but I tried to focus my sources/threads as much as possible. These lists are compiled with the newbie/beginner in mind, and due to their “crowd-sourced” nature, will lean towards inclusion of more popular, “mainstream” products. As always, these compilations are starting points for discussion, and the most fun part for me is including feedback as it rolls in, so **please, share what has worked for you.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Cleansers, Cream Cleansers*\n\n* Banila Co Clean It Zero in Purity\n\n* Botanic Farm Grain Ferment Cleansing Sherbet \n\n* Clinique Take the Day Off Cleansing Balm\n\n* Skin Food Rice Water Bright Cleansing Oil \n\n* Illi Total Aging Care Oil Cleanser\n\n* DHC Cleansing Oil\n\n* XeraCalm A.D Lipid-Replenishing Cleansing Oil \n\n* History of Whoo Gongjinhyang Cream Cleanser\n\n* L'Oreal RevitaLift Radiant Smoothing Cream Cleanser\n\n* Mandom Bifesta Cleansing Lotion\n\n* Missha Super Aqua Fresh Cleansing Milk\n\n* Andalou Naturals Probiotic Cleansing Milk\n\n* Skinfood Green Tea Cleansing Milk\n\n* **Hada Labo Tokyo Hydrating Facial Cleanser**\n\n* **Cerave Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n* Papa Recipe White Flower Enzyme Powder Cleanser\n\n* **COSRX Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser**\n\n* Innisfree Jeju Bija Anti-trouble Cleansing Gel\n\n* Tosowoong Enzyme Powder Wash – some have found this too harsh, for others, its the only thing their skin tolerates.

Think sleeping packs and thick creams.  Petrolatum (Vaseline) is the gold standard, but a good rule of thumb is to go as heavy and occlusive as your skin can handle without clogging pores. \n\n* Many facial oils are not occlusives. Read more about oils and occlusion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3v6yb8/psa_for_your_winter_dryness_most_oils_arent/)\n\n* What occlusive you eventually choose is largely individualized. Some rely on petrolatum-based balms, for others this results in bad breakouts. As always, patch test and add only one new product at a time. \n\n* What works for your skin can rapidly shift depending on climate, season, and region. Pay attention to signs of how your skin is responding to these various factors so you can adjust your routine accordingly. Be ready to change things up\n\n* You might be here because you’ve over exfoliated. You can generally tell this because 1) you just upped your acids, and 2) your skin is newly very sensitive to even mild products. You can read more here on [how to tell if you’ve damaged your moisture barrier.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/33xhax/what_are_the_signs_to_look_out_for_for/) Learn your lesson and when you restart, GO SLOWLY. Many people with lots of acids in their routine got there after sloooowly ramping up and allowing their skin to adjust. And consider [joining a support group ;)]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3tac9m/can_we_have_a_support_group_for_overexfoliators/)\n\n* If your dry skin is new and likely the result of new or increased actives in your routine (especially rein-A and other retinols, BHA, andor AHA) BACK OFF THE ACTIVES until your moisture barrier heals. DO NOT TRY TO “POWER THROUGH.” Scale back on your routine to the bare essentials, focusing on mild products, hydration, and occlusive creams. \n\n* Consider your cleanser. Tightness, dryness, and sensitivity that seems to be resistant to all the layers of hydration and creams may be the result of a cleanser your skin hates. Many with dry skin recommended avoiding foaming cleansers and using a cleansing milk as their second cleanser. Also consider cutting back to once-a-day cleansing, or simply rinsing your face with water. \n\n* Another recommendation was to save washing the face for evening\n\n* Consider eliminating anything that foams. \n\n* Please consider seeing a dermatologist if you can. Topical steroids may be something to consider if your skin is really suffering. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSources:\n\n[Help with Dry Skin and Double Cleansing]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4ca5e2/help_with_dry_skin_and_double_cleansing/)\n\n[Looking for a Gentle, low pH Second Cleanser for Dry Skin!]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4alfwn/looking_for_a_gentle_low_ph_second_cleanser_for/)\n\n[Cure for dry skin for retin a user- Vaseline]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/42zbt5/cure_for_dry_skin_for_retin_a_user_vaseline/)\n\n[Best toner and essence for normal-dry skin?]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/44bnvp/best_toner_and_essence_for_normaldry_skin/)\n\n\n[Looking for a moisturizing mist for winter and dry skin?]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/47ksng/looking_for_a_moisturizing_mist_for_winter_and/)\n\n[Dry skin product recommendations]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3e9yik/dry_skin_product_recommendations/)\n\n[What cushions do you recommend for my dry skin?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/45lue2/what_cushions_do_you_recommend_for_my_dry_skin/)\n\n[Sheet mask recommendation dry skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/38ekvx/sheet_mask_recommendation_dry_skin/)\n\n[Warning: Unpleasant Acne Pictures.

        "body": "Not sure if my skin passes for dry because I usually try to deal with the dryness as soon as it appears and keep it as normal as possible. \n\nThings I use and I have found that work for me: \n\n* Tony Moly Aquaporin Moisture Foam Cleanser - this is a really basic cleanser, it's not even low pH, but I find it very gentle. \n* Vivant Skincare Green Tea Antioxydant Cleanser - this one is the gentlest cleanser I've used, it's low pH but it's so pricey. I will probably replace with Sulwhasoo Snowise next. It's the only cleanser I've used that leaves my skin like I haven't washed it but clean (if you know what I mean... xD). \n\nMy favorite creams for my driest moments during winter are: \n\n* Sulwhasoo Essential Firming Cream - I order sample jars of this on eBay and it comes out very affordable. This is my favorite moisturizer for normal/dry skin. It simply leaves my skin super hydrated and glowing, even if I step all the other steps in my routine. \n* Mizon S-venom Wrinkle Tox Cream - this cream is amazing as an occlusive, I absolutely fell in love with it! It left my skin so amazingly soft and hydrated. \n* Yves Rocher Nutrive Végétal 24h Comfort Nourishing Cream - this is a recent fave, for the price of 12€ for two tubs of this, it's perfect. I really like this line by YR for normal/dry skin, for those of you interested in trying non AB EU skincare, I'd highly recommend them, they are super affordable as well. \n\nMy favorite sleeping pack is: \n\n* Sulwhasoo Overnight Vitalizing Mask - this mask is magic for dry skin and soon as I start using this after getting dry patches they disappear. And it also helps for brighter skin tone. \n\nFavorite facial oil: \n\n* Pure cold-pressed avocado oil - I used this before I started using the Sulwhasoo sleeping mask. A 250 ml costs around 4€ in the supermarket, so I'd highly recommend it to everyone with dry skin. \n\nToner I am using for a while: \n\n* Yves Rocher Nutrive Végétal Velvety Toner - this is a really great locally available toner for me and for the price of 8€ for two bottles, I'd call this a pretty amazing deal. \n\nI am really interested in adding new stuff to my stash. I'd like to get a new toner and at the moment I am really hesitating between the Kikumasamune and the Hadalabo Hyaluronic Acid one, I would love if someone could tell me how they performed for them. \n\nI'd also like to buy serums/essences because I am only using actives at the moment. I am interested in Mizon Hyaluronic Acid Amoule, Cosrx Snail Essence, Cosrx Galactomyces Essence, Scinic Snail AIO, Scinic Propolis Ampoule, basically the choice is hard here. \n\nI've used couple of different gel creams but I don't find they are that amazing for dry skin, just a good thing to layer as a moisturizer. Ones I've used are \n\n* Mizon Watervolume Aqua Gel Cream \n* Mizon Aloe 90 Soothing Gel\n* Mizon Snail Recovery Gel \n* 3W Clinic Snail Mucus Soothing Gel \n\nFavorite sunscreens: \n\n* Bioré UV Perfect Milk - this is really great for dry skin, I imagine it will be my go to sunscreen during winter. \n* Missha All Around Safe Block Waterproof Sun \n\n\nOther random things that worked out for me: \n\n* Layering several layers of moisturizers instead of using one heavy layer of a moisturizing cream. I don't know why exactly that works the way it works, it might have to do something with the skin absorbing the ingredients more easily that way. \n* Careful with actives! It took me 3 months to build a tolerance to be able to use vitamin C daily (and once per day only) so I learned it the hard way, my skin doesn't like too much actives. I only use AHA once/twice per week and my skin looks really great right now. \n\n\nSorry for the non AB suggestions!",

        "body": "Not AB, but Earth Science has a cream cleanser that I believe is fatty alcohol free and is around pH 5.5. I also plan to try out some non-foaming cleansing gels in order to check out what alternatives are out there for those with drier skin. First on my list is a kose cleansing gel, which I saw was described as weakly acidic. \n  \nAlso, I have dehydrated-prone and acne-prone skin that leans dry. Right now I'm using shea butter as a final step since no other facial oil has worked out for me, and it's going pretty well so far! I have the NOW Foods Shea butter tub. It can be a bit hard to spread, so I stuck a chopstick in and \"whipped\" it for a looser texture. However, it still tugs a bit when being applied to the skin. I found the best way to apply it is to take some of the whipped shea butter in my hand, warm it up and then apply it - either by spreading, or pressing my palms to my face.  \n  \nI've tried all sorts of sleeping packs and oils, but I'm finally waking up with skin that isn't dry or dehydrated. Vaseline also works decently, but shea butter seems to be the right mix of occlusive and emollient for my skin. Over the course of the night, some of it absorbs and I wake up with pretty good skin (much better than before, I can definitely say). I still might go back to playing around with vaseline during the winter months. We'll see how it goes.   \n  \nAnyway, the point of this tangent is that I recommend adding shea butter to the facial oil list haha. I know there's actually a shea oil, but I've never tried it and I believe the components of shea butter that are beneficial for dry skin are removed in the process of making shea oil. So it should be a bit lighter, if anyone is interested in a lighter take on shea butter.   \n  \nLastly, [this post about occlusives](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3v6yb8/psa_for_your_winter_dryness_most_oils_arent/) might be of interest to those with dry skin.   \n  \nETA: Wanted to clarify that I use lots of hydrating layers, but they mean nothing without a good occlusive.   \n  \nEdit: words",

(Occlusives are ingredients that lock in moisture, serving as a physical barrier between your skin and the outside world.)\n\nThe thing is, most plant oils aren't actually great occlusives! They're still often phenomenal ingredients at moisturizing, healing, and soothing, but they won't serve as occlusive agents. That means you can use them earlier in your routine, before creams (or even before sheet masks, to really push that oily goodness deep in your skin!). It also means if you want an occlusive layer, you should look for something with one or more of the following ingredients.\n\n**List of occlusive agents:**\n\n* Petrolatum (the most occlusive - 99% reduction in trans-epidermal water loss)\n\n* Fatty alcohols like cetyl and stearyl alcohol\n\n* Hydrocarbon oils like mineral oil, silicones (esp. dimethicone and cyclomethicone), and squalene\n\n* Wax esters like beeswax and lanolin\n\n* Vegetable waxes like candelilla, carnauba, and palm kernel\n\n* A few key oils, usually ones that are high in oleic acid and have a thicker, greasier feel: olive, rice bran, macadamia, castor, and soybean oil, plus shea butter\n\n* Cholesterol\n\n* Lecithin\n\nHappy occlusing!\n\n**EDIT**: based on [this chart](http://www.floratech.com/Uploads/pdfs/occlusivitychart.pdf) shared by /u/vanityrex, I've made some edits to the above list.\n\n**EDIT 2**: based on [this paper](http://www.probotanic.com/pdf_istrazivanja/ulje_jojobe/Primena%20biljnih%20ulja%20u%20kozmetici.pdf) linked from /u/surrealist_comb, I took jojoba oil off the list.",

I generally like to apply sheet masks after actives and let my skin suck up all that essence. Would the fact that occlusive agents are in the formula make any products  I apply after  masking not absorb as well? It seems that this *should* be the case, but I'm not for sure.",

I know I always appreciate finding affordable products with niacinamide so I thought I'd share, ulta has it for $9.99/1 oz.

There’s a lot of conversation about differences in the quality of ingredients, how they’re ‘delivered,’ and how they can affect someone’s hair. \n\nI’m a novice to a lot of hair-science, but what do these claims mean? What makes a ‘good quality ingredient’ good and a bad one bad? How can additional ‘nutrients’ in shampoos/conditioners benefit hair when these products usually stay on for a very short time? I assume much with conditioner is associated with detangling/shine/luster, but what about shampoo? I know that different surfactants clean with different levels of intensity, and silicones also polish in different ways, but what makes the dimethicone in a salon product different than the dimethicone in a dirt cheap drugstore product? How do more expensive products clean better, if that’s the case at all?\n\nIs it all just differences in ethics? Brand name? \n\nI apologize for the questions, but I’m still so confused. If there’s any papers or articles I could read about these things, please share them.",

        "body": "Nice questions! \nI have a degree in Chemistry, I’m 1 1/2 years into my career. I formulate shampoos, conditioners and a little with styling/conditioning products. I am considered new still and I’m learning the answers to your questions everyday at work. \nIf my company is paying top dollar for a raw material, it’s because that raw material was sourced ethically, has a dual function, and the components won’t break down as easily. The supplier (who sells the raw material) has a knowledgeable support team as well, they know EVERYTHING about that material - where it came from, how to use it, what it works best with. They can solve any issues I have working with it (why is it not melting, why is it separating after my batch is complete, why is it turning yellow, how can I make it thicker, etc...) a good raw material vendor will have it all and that’s what makes a “good” raw and costs $$$. \nCheap raws will break down, won’t perform as well, and most likely they are not coming from a good place (unsafe, no labor laws). They also will not come with good support and most likely are not ecofriendly anywhere in the process. \n\nHow they are delivered, that’s science. Think of baking a cake....you have to add an egg to your mix. You wouldn’t add a cooked scrambled egg, that’s poor “delivery” of the egg. Just as you wouldn’t add the egg after you’ve iced the cake. Wrong delivery. \nWhen raw materials are delivered correctly, they are added in the right order, at the right temperatures, at the right pH. \nCheap products have cheap manufacturing, they will cut corners to save money and ultimately produce a crappier product with a short shelf life. That’s a cheap, bargain product. \n\nDimethicone/silicones - this I believe is just polymer science. A polymer molecule is like a lego, a supplier can build that molecule however a brand wants (and that brand pays $$$$ for tailor made polymers). They can attach functional groups to the molecule in different ways (like legos) to perform differently. You can have a low viscosity dimethicone that might cost less than a high viscosity dimethicone....same ingredient name on the bottle, but has a totally different performance. \nMolecular weight also plays a part in how silicones perform/what they cost. Again, a lot of products have the same label name/inci, but how they’re made makes the performance/cost different.",

    "body": "I've used this source before, when talking about petroleum jelly, but it's great and straightforward about different types of moisturizers.  Source: Nolan, K. and Marmur, E. (2012), Moisturizers: Reality and the skin benefits. Dermatologic Therapy, 25: 229–233.\n\n\n\n Quoted from the text: \n\n\nThere are four main classes of moisturizers: occlusives, humectants, emollients, and rejuvenators.\n\n\n\n**Occlusives**\n\n\nOcclusives work by forming a hydrophobic layer on the surface of the skin providing an exogenous barrier to water loss. Because they prevent evaporation from the skin, they can be particularly effective when applied to already dampened skin. Occlusives are the most common type of moisturizers used in formulations [1].\n\n\n\nAlthough occlusives are not the most appealing of ingredients to consumers, due in part to their greasy feel, petrolatum, the prototypic occlusive, it is actually the most effective moisturizer and reduces transepidermal water loss by 99% [7]. Petrolatum is the most commonly used active agent in skin care products, after water [1]. Occlusives are well tolerated among individuals and are often used in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. A recent study [8] found that an over-the-counter (OTC) petroleum-based skin moisturizer (Aquaphor Healing Ointment, Beiersdorf, Wilton, CT) was as clinically effective in treating mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis as a more expensive ceramide containing prescription barrier cream. Petrolatum also can help restore the stratum corneum barrier by penetrating into its upper layers and initiating the production of intercellular lipids, including free sterols, sphingolipids, and free fatty acids [9]. Petrolatum is also able to reduce the appearance of fine lines caused by dehydration. Although principally an occlusive, petrolatum can also act as an emollient (discussed in more detail later) and fills the spaces between desquamating corneocytes making the skin smooth and soft.\n\n\n\nDimethicone is the second most common active agent in moisturizers today because like petrolatum, it is also is hypoallergenic, noncomedogenic, and nonacnegenic [10]. Dimethicone is among a family of silicones that comprise the basis of all oil-free moisturizers [1]. However, petrolatum is superior to dimethicone in decreasing fine facial lines of dehydration or for healing skin [9]. Dimethicone is permeable to water vapor and therefore if the skin barrier is compromised, dimethicone will not reduce transepidermal water loss. This however is beneficial in some foundations and sunscreens, in that it allows for the evaporation of perspiration, preventing the skin from feeling warm developing miliaria [1]. Like petrolatum, dimethicone can also act as an emollient.\n\n\n\n\n**Humectants**\n\n\n\nThis second major class of moisturizers are able to increase the water content of the skin by enhancing water absorption from the dermis into the epidermis. Some also think that humectants are able to hydrate the stratum corneum by absorbing water from the external environment [11]. In contrast to occlusives, humectants have several hydrophilic hydroxyl groups, and their hydroscopic properties allow them to attract and hold water molecules. Because of humectants’ ability to enhance water absorption upward from the dermis, these compounds can cause excessive water loss from the dermis through evaporation into the lower humidity environment. This occurs especially if the skin barrier is compromised. Because of this phenomenon, in formulations humectants are always combined with occlusives that prevent water loss. Humectants include hydroxy acids, propylene glycol, and urea.\n\n\n\nThe most common humectant used in moisturizers is glycerol or glycerin. This hydroscopic compound is the most effective humectant and can also activate transglutaminase activity in the stratum corneum, accelerating the maturation of corneocytes and reducing scaling in xerotic skin [11]. Glycerin also has some unique characteristics including its ability to produce moisturizing effects in the skin long after it is no longer present. Glycerin is able to produce this effect through modulating water channels in the skin, known as aquaporins [1]. The principal aquaporin in the epidermis is aquaporin-3. Interestingly, aquaporin-3 expression is increased in human skin diseases, with elevated transepidermal water loss [1]. Overall, when combined with occlusive agents, glycerin has the ability to produce significant moisturizing effects in the skin.\n\n\n\n**Emollients**\n\n\nThis class of moisturizer is used to improve the appearance and texture of skin by filling in the crevices between corneocytes. This contributes to increased softness and smoothness of the skin and improves its overall appearance. Some common emollients include essential fatty acids, which are found in various natural oils. These essential fatty acids like linoleic acid can be oxidized to eicosanoids, which are important signaling molecules involved in inflammatory pathways and the immune system. It is therefore thought that fatty acids may also influence skin physiology [11].\n\n\n\n**Rejuvenators**\n\n\n\nThis final class of moisturizers is intended to replenish essential proteins in this skin. Collagen, keratin, and elastin are skin proteins that are often found in rejuvenators. Because these proteins are relatively large, a considerable limitation to rejuvenators is their difficulty penetrating of the stratum corneum [12]. Although rejuvenators may not be able to successfully replenish proteins in the dermis, they can have a role similar to emollients and improve skin appearance by creating a film that aesthetically smoothes the skin and stretches out and fills in fine lines.\n\n\n\n**Ceramides**\n\n\n\nAlthough not a class of moisturizer, these lipid molecules have been used increasingly in recent years in the treatment of atopic skin and in cosmeceuticals. Ceramides are an essential component of normal stratum corneum and function to help maintain the integrity of the skin barrier. In 1990, it was found that the level of ceramides was greatlyreduced in the stratum corneum in patients with atopic dermatis. It was subsequently concluded that an insufficiency of ceramides in the stratum corneum is an important factor in atopic dry skin [5]. Subsequently, ceramides have been added to many moisturizes used in the treatment of both atopic and normal skin. Because ceramides are oil soluble, they can easily be incorporated into moisturizers; however, many products with ceramides, especially prescription formulations, can be prohibitively expensive [6]. Although ceramides have been shown to improve barrier function of damaged skin [3], recent studies have shown that inexpensive OTC nonceramide products can be just as effective in treating mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis [3].\n\n\n\n**EDIT** Note that these are not pre-made moisturizers, but rather moisturizing ingredients.

    "body": "I was listening to the [snailcast](http://www.thesnailcast.com) during a 2-hour drive this morning and it was brought up that an issue with identifying Japanese products is that their labels are usually all in Japanese (I admit this sounds really derpy of me to say, like *really, what did you expect, Korean xD?*). Alternatively, Korean products will typically have one or two identifying English words, if not an entire label in English. If you happen to come across a Japanese product, it's in a pump container, some kind of pinkish liquid, it's all in Japanese, and just your luck - there's zero English on the package. *What could it be?*\n\nHowever, the daunting task of trying to figure out what your Japanese product isn't as daunting as you might think. There actually is *English*.  It's just in Japanese (*sorry, another derpy sounding comment orz*).  Specifically, it's in [Katakana](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Table_katakana.svg/2000px-Table_katakana.svg.png) and the characters look like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Table_katakana.svg/2000px-Table_katakana.svg.png).  For the purposes of this guide, let's just say Katakana is a form of transliteration.\n\nFor example, let's take your two bottles of hair product.  Which one is the conditioner and which one is the shampoo? Most Japanese hair products will either say シャンプー *or* コンディショナー. If you look on the [chart](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Table_katakana.svg/2000px-Table_katakana.svg.png), that's literally 'shanpū' and 'kondishonā'. Sounds a lot like shampoo and conditioner! The character \"ー\" means to hold the sound out slightly longer. Katakana is literally on every Japanese comsetic/skincare product.  Japanese cosmetic sites use Katakana for brand names, product type, colors, scents, just about everything.  For example, Dolly Wink is ドーリーウインク, pronounced dōrī uinku.\n\nThere are 46 basic Katakana characters. If you spend an afternoon mastering them, you'll make shopping for Japanese products much easier (although you can always use Google translator, who am I kidding, it's the golden technology age xD).  You can readily differentiate Katakana (カタカナ) from Hiragana (かたかな) and Kanji (片仮名) -- that's Katakana written in the 3 different written texts.  Katakana differs from Kanji in that it is simpler, and has less strokes than most Kanji.  Katakana is also more 'boxy' than hiragana.\n\nFor those of you familiar with the Japanese language, you're probably already familiar with Katakana.  Hopefully this will provide some insight to everyone else.  One way to learn the katakana is to dividend them into sets.  If \"a, ka, sa, ta, na\" does not work for you, try \"ka, ki, ku, ke, ko\" instead.  Good luck!\n\nLastly, most people are familiar with [Rakuten](http://global.rakuten.com/en), but if you want to see what's really trending in Japan, you might want to consider [Cosme](http://www.cosme.com), Japan's leading cosmetic retailer/website, with tons of user reviews (albeit it's all in Japanese). They also have their [own shop](https://www.cosme.com/en), but I've never purchased from them.\n\nRunning Cosme through Google Translator is sometimes a pain because half the links don't work.  So, to see selling rankings on Cosme, click on \"売れ筋ランキングへ\".  If you want to see new cosmetics, click on \"新着コスメへ\" (copy paste and then search the page).\n\nHope this was helpful!\n\n************\n\nSome common words:\n\n** all-in-one / オールインワン / ōru in wan\n\n** aloe vera / アロエベラ / aroe bera\n\n** amino collagen / アミノ コラーゲン / amino korāgen\n\n** aqua / アクア / akua\n\n** arbutin / アルブチン / arubuchin\n\n** base / ベース / bēsu\n\n** base makeup / ベースメイク / bēsu meiku\n\n** basic/simple / シンプル / shinpuru (such as basic skincare)\n\n** BB cream / ＢＢクリーム / BB kurīmu\n\n** beauty / ビューティ / byūti\n\n** body / ボディ / bodi\n\n** body scrub / ボディスクラブ / bodi sukurabu\n\n** brand / ブランド / burando\n\n** breast / バスト / basuto\n\n** brush / ブラシ / burashi\n\n** care / ケア / kea\n\n** cleansing cream / クレンジングクリーム / kurenjingu kurīmu\n\n** cleansing gel / クレンジングジェル / kurenjingu jeru\n\n** cleansing milk / クレンジングミルク / kurenjingu miruku\n\n** cleansing oil / クレンジングオイル / kurenjingu oiru\n\n** cream / クリーム / kurīmu\n\n** cream eyeshadow / クリームアイシャドウ / kurīmu ai shadō\n\n** coenzyme Q10 / コエンザイムQ10 / koenzaimu Q10\n\n** concealer / コンシーラー / konshīrā\n\n** conditioner / コンディショナー / kondishonā\n\n** cool / クール / kuuru\n\n** cotton / コットン / kotton\n\n** deoderant / デオドラント / deodoranto\n\n** dimethicone / ジメチコン / jimechikon\n\n** Dolly Wink / ドーリーウインク / dōrī uinku\n\n** drink / ドリンク / dorinku\n\n** essence / エッセンス / essensu\n\n** essence or serum / Kanji: 美容液 (びようえき) / biyōeki\n\n** eye care / アイケア / ai kea\n\n** eye cream / アイクリーム / ai kurīmu\n\n** eye liner / アイライナー / ai rainā\n\n** eyeshadow / アイシャドウ / ai shadō\n\n** film / フィルム / firumu\n\n** foam / フォーム / fōmu\n\n** food / フード / fūdo\n\n** foot / フット / futto\n\n** foot care / フットケア / futto kea\n\n** foundation / ファンデーション / fandēshon\n\n** fragrance / フレグランス / fureguransu\n\n** glycerin / グリセリン / guriserin\n\n** gold / ゴールド / gōrudo\n\n** gommage / ゴマージュ / gomāju\n\n** goods / グッズ / guzzu\n\n** Hada Labo / ハダラボ / hada rabo (Kanji: 肌研）\n\n** hair / ヘア / hea\n\n** hair mask / ヘアマスク / hea masuku\n\n** hair pack / ヘアパック / hea pakku\n\n** hair styling / ヘアスタイリング / hea sutairingu\n\n** hand / ハンド / hando\n\n** hand cream / ハンドクリーム / hando kurīmu\n\n** hyaluronic (acid) / ヒアルロン酸 / hiaruron酸\n\n** ice / アイス / aisu\n\n** item / アイテム / aitemu\n\n** jojoba (oil) / ホホバ油 / hohoba-yu\n\n** kit / キット / kitto\n\n** lemon / レモン / remon\n\n** lemon extract / レモンエキス / remon ekisu\n\n** leg / レッグ / leggu\n\n** liner / ライナー / rainā\n\n** liquid / リキッド / rikiddo\n\n** lip / リップ / rippu\n\n** lip balm / リップクリーム / rippu kurīmu\n\n** lip care / リップケア / rippu kea\n\n** loose powder / ルースパウダー / rūsu paudā\n\n** lotion or emulsion / Kanji: 乳液 (にゅうえき) / nyūeki\n\n** makeup / メイク / meiku\n\n** mascara / マスカラ / masukara\n\n** mask / マスク / masuku\n\n** massage / マッサージ / massāji\n\n** milk / ミルク / miruku\n\n** oil / オイル / oiru\n\n** olive (oil) / オリーブ油 / orību-yu\n\n** oral / オーラル / oraru\n\n** pack / パック / pakku\n\n** paraban / パラベン / paraben\n\n** peeling / ピーリング / pīringu\n\n** phenoxyethanol / フェノキシエタノール/ fenokishietanōru\n\n** point makeup / ポイントメイク / pointo meiku\n\n** powder / パウダー / paudā\n\n** pressed powder / プレストパウダー / puresuto paudā\n\n** puff / パフ / pafu\n\n** remover / リムーバー / rimūbā\n\n** rinse / リンス / rinsu\n\n** rose hip (oil) / ローズヒップ油 / rōzu hippu-yu\n\n** soap / ソープ / sōpu\n\n** serum / セラム / seramu\n\n** set / セット / setto\n\n** shadow / シャドウ / shadō\n\n** shampoo / シャンプー / shanpū\n\n** shape / シェイプ / sheipu\n\n** size / サイズ / saizu\n\n** skincare / スキンケア / sukin kea\n\n** smooth / スムーズ / sumūzu\n\n** sponge / スポンジ / suponji\n\n** stick / スティック / sutikku\n\n** super / スーパー / sūpā\n\n** supplement / サプリメント / sapurimento\n\n** toner (moisturizing or hydrating) / Kanji: 化粧水 (けしょうすい) / keshōsui\n\n** treatment / トリートメント / torītomento\n\n** trial / トライアル / toraiaru\n\n** two-step / ツーステップ / tsū suteppu\n\n** vitamin / ビタミン / bitamin\n\n** wear / ウェア / wea\n\n** white / ホワイト / howaito\n\n** whitening / ホワイトニング / howaitoningu\n\n***** \n\nContributors:\n\n/u/DarlaDimpleAMA, /u/organiccatmilk, /u/TheHeianPrincess, /u/frivolouscentipede",

Newer shops now label conditioners as \"conditioners\", but many shops still refer to them as \"rinse\".\n\nAnother thing is that certain hair product companies will label their conditioners as \"treatment\". This is pretty common. If you see a lineup of hair products that doesn't have a conditioner, chances are the product labeled as \"treatment\" is actually the conditioner.",

    "body": "Silicones are the focus of many a haircare discussion. They smooth, soften, and shine the hair cuticle, protect from UV, humidity, and heat styling, and can temporarily repair damaged locks. But they may also be hard to remove and build up on certain people with certain routines, leaving an undesirable greasiness, limpness, and dry strands. \n\nSilicone behavior thus varies widely by type and can either be a pro or con for your haircare regimen. Here is a list of many kinds of silicones and specific information on what they do. They’re organized into subclasses that pertain to their wash-out and build-up capacities. Within these subclasses, they’re listed alphabetically along with more info on any noteworthy properties beyond conditioning.\n\n\n**Group 1: Evaporative**     \nAlso known as volatile molecules. These silicones will completely evaporate from your hair anywhere from 10 minutes to a few hours after application, so there’s no worry about build up or moisture lock out with these (but also no conditioning effect from these alone). For this reason they’re most used only as delivery systems for other ingredients, as they distribute into a thin, uniform film before evaporation. Additionally, unlike short-chain alcohols, these won’t carry off moisture. \n\n- Cyclomethicone and other cyclo-XXX-siloxane ingredients – note that these are not soluble in water, so won’t wash out easily if applied right before or in the shower. They will evaporate away afterwards, however, so it doesn’t matter and can actually help against hygral fatigue. They can also be beneficial for increased ease of combing when hair is wet after washing.    \n\n- Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane     \n- Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane     \n- Hexamethyldisiloxane      \n- Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane     \n\n**Group 2: Easy Wash Out**     \nThese silicones don’t evaporate, so they are useful as conditioning agents to get smoother and softer hair with less frizz. They also protect hair from UV radiation, heat styling, and humidity and spread out evenly. They do wash out with nonionic surfactants and co-washing, so again there’s not much concern about these. There are a few caveats to this, however. Larger molecules are more water resistant, especially in hot water, so may need a sulfate shampoo depending on the amount applied. They may also block out moisture from the hair if the user goes a very long time without washing with something besides water. \n\n- Any sort of PEG/PPG modified Methicone or Dimethicone (unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient) - hygroscopic, so may pull moisture out of hair in dry weather. Subtler conditioning effect. Irritation reduction, so good for sensitive skin/scalps.        \n- Diphenyl Dimethicone – high shine     \n- Dimethicone (unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient, then Group 3)     \n- Dimethiconol     \n- Disiloxane     \n- Dimethicone copolyol (unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient, then Group 3) – hygroscopic, so may pull moisture out of hair in dry weather. Subtler conditioning effect. Irritation reduction, so good for sensitive skin/scalps.\n- Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane     \n- Lauryl methicone copolyol     \n- Phenyltrimethicone – high shine     \n- Silica – increased body     \n- Silicone resin - increased body     \n- Silsequioxanes – increased body     \n- Siloxysilicates (e.g. Diisostearoyl Trimethylolpropane Siloxysilicate) – increased body          \n- Trisiloxane     \n\n**Group 3: Hard to Wash, But No Build Up**     \nTake care when using these silicones, as they don’t wash out easily – only a clarifying shampoo with anionic or zwitterionic surfactants will get the job done. Otherwise, hair may dry out over time. These silicones don’t build up though, as subsequent layers are repelled by the first, so there won’t be an increasing feeling of weight and greasiness (the exception to this is amine-funcationalized silicones in the presence of a cationic surfactant - if hair is in a product of this formulation for long enough, the silicone will continue to deposit until it is exhausted from the solution). One may choose to use this ingredient if they want the extreme conditioning benefits and plan on using clarifying shampoo on a weekly or biweekly basis. I personally would only recommend these as leave in conditioners to people with damaged hair who heat style and have already tried other conditioners, as these molecules have a greater affinity for the more negatively charged surface of damaged hair. This makes that one layer of product hard to remove, but very effective. Just remember that once on, neither water nor other product is getting underneath to the hair until you clarify (coconut oil for example will only sit on top and be greasy).\n\n- Aminopropyl Dimethicone (unless in the presence of a cationic surfactant - then Group 4)       \n- Amodimethicone – potential for irritation (unless in the presence of a cationic surfactant - then Group 4)      \n- Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone     \n- Dimethicone, Dimethicone PEG/PPG, or a -dimethylsiloxane in the presence of another cationic polymer ingredient such as anything ending with bromide or chloride and polyquaternium ingredients     \n- Dimethicone crosspolymer     \n- Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer     \n- Aminopropyltriethoxysilane   \n\n**Group 4: Hard to Wash, Builds Up**      \nThe most difficult silicone to work with. These ingredients are powerful conditioners, but will build up with repeated use, causing greasiness and weighing hair down (which negatively impacts natural texture). They’re also hard to get out – all need a clarifying shampoo, and some may even need multiple washes with one in order to remove completely. Without removal, moisture can be blocked out of the hair shaft, resulting in dry strands and potential breakage. We recommend that you avoid these ingredients altogether. \n\n- Behenoxy dimethicone     \n- Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone      \n- Cetyl dimethicone     \n- Cetearyl methicone  \n- Dimethiconol hydroxystearate         \n- Polysilicone-18 Cetyl Phosphate     \n- Propyl Dimethicone – increased body    \n- Stearoxy dimethicone     \n- Stearyl dimethicone         \n- Stearyl methicone      \n- Trimethylsiylamodimethicone – irritation potential     \n\n\nI'll add more to the list as I become aware of them.

My hair is pretty damaged and its really helped the condition. But after I use it, I then use the Joico K-pak shampoo as well (which has both sodium laureth sulfate and cocamidopropyl betaine in it) before going back to co-washing. Am I right in thinking those surfactants are more than enough to clear the amodimethicone out of my hair? Or do I need to get a stronger clarifying shampoo?",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

I recently wrote this... enormous monstrosity on rosacea and shared it over at /r/skincareaddiction, but also wanted to share it here since I have found lots of value in the discussions here as well as the science surrounding AB ingredients (such as snail mucin, propolis, etc.). \n\nIn the future, I plan to do a large post that combines both AB product recommendations and SCA recommendations (as well as mine) for rosacea, but I felt this would be it's own post that I would later connect to this one.\n\nThanks so much for being awesome.

    "body": "hi guys! it's been a year since the beginning of my skincare journey, so i think it's time to give back to these skincare communities which have taught me so much! here is an extensive list of **AB** (asian beauty) and **non-AB** products i've tried in the past year, ranging mostly from drug-store to mid-range products. i've arranged the list in the order of the **highest to lowest** ratings.\n\n**skin type:** early 20s, sensitive, acne-prone, combination (oily over forehead, dry everywhere else), Fitzpatrick IV/brown\n\n**skin concerns:** inflammatory acne, closed comedones, some PIH/PIE, a few freckles, anti-aging\n\n**skin irritants:** most plant extracts, most essential oils, any form of physical exfoliation\n\ndespite my sensitive skin type, i have gone through a number of products with artificial fragrances/EOs/strange plant extracts, because i didn't know what my skin triggers were back then. hopefully even my negative experiences will be of some help! :)\n\ncaveat: my experiences will likely differ from most of yours, since everyone reacts differently even to the same ingredient :D. do note that i have a rather finicky skin type that sadly disagrees with an overwhelming majority of products!\n\n# 1st-step cleansers\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) bioderma sensibio micellar water** ($14.90 for 16.7oz) is a no-frills micellar water that is extremely suitable for sensitive skin types. it has no fragrance, and also has an extremely short ingredients list which does not contain any comedogenic/irritating ingredients. because of this, it truly stands out from most other brands of micellar water! this has never once caused any breakouts for me. it is good at removing light makeup or non-waterresistant sunscreen. however, with heavier makeup/ water-resistant sunscreen, you'd need a lot more effort to rub (gently) them off. that irritates my skin, unfortunately. therefore, i'm currently only using this to quickly and gently remove non-water resistant sunscreen, and it causes no irritation this way, yay! for those of you with sensitive/dry skin types, using micellar water to remove light makeup/sunscreen may wind up being much gentler and less stripping than oil cleansers, as it is for me. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**muji sensitive cleansing oil** ($19.90 for 13.5oz) is a thick, non-stripping, unscented cleansing oil which is effective at removing sunscreen/makeup. it has no discernible scent to me. this rinses cleanly without leaving an oily film. while this did not cause any dryness, i experienced some irritation (redness, tingling) after a few uses. i am suspecting that something in the ingredients list (eg: ethylhexyl palmitate, which may be slightly irritating) did not agree with my skin. otherwise, the ingredients list is free of any other common skin irritants. i also did not enjoy the thick texture of the oil which was difficult to spread around my face. however, this is affordable and comes in a large pump bottle! i could see this working well for many other skin types. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**shu uemera anti/oxi+ pollutant and dullness clarifying cleansing oil** ($58 for 9.8oz) is also a thick, non-stripping, luxurious, gorgeous cleansing oil that is effective at removing makeup. it is of very similar texture to muji's sensitive cleansing oil. but this contains a number of skin irritants, and is also heavily fragranced; it has an earthy, herbal smell. after about 4-5 uses, my skin began to feel irritated-- unbearable tingling in my cheeks. this was very disappointing given its steep price point :-(. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# 2nd step cleansers\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) paula's choice optimal results hydrating cleanser** ($19 for 6.4 oz) is the only cleanser so far that ticks all my boxes! it is non-irritating, non-stripping, ph-balanced, and does not break me out. i'd gone through at least a dozen cleansers throughout my life, before i found this, my very first ride-or-die cleanser! every other cleanser in the past would either strip my skin too dry OR irritate my skin. i love that it has no artificial fragrance; it only has a mild, inoffensive soapy scent. it also has an ingredients list that's free of irritants. this cleanser has a cream-gel texture that does not foam up at all. if you're used to foaming cleansers like i was, i totally understand your apprehension. however, many of us would benefit from gentler cleansers like this one, and i'd highly recommend this cleanser to any skin type except those with particularly oily skin. this also comes in a pretty, blue bottle with a pump dispenser! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) fresh soy face cleanser** ($69 for 13.5oz) used to be a staple in my skincare routine till i discovered the cleanser above. yes, this contains rose water and other plant extracts, as well as rose oil, which are common skin irritants amongst folks with sensitive skin :(! apart from these irritating additives, however, it was perfect in my eyes. it has a heavenly cucumber scent. despite the alarming ingredients list, it caused no signs of irritation, also probably because i cleanse my face really quickly to minimise contact time with cleansers in general. it was non-stripping, rinsed off very easily and cleanly, and smelled great (like fresh cucumbers) to me. this is still the 2nd best cleanser i've tried to date despite the disappointing additives... and i've tried at least 20 different cleansers so far. go to sephora and take a whiff! if the scent is your cup of tea, and you're not at all sensitive to its ingredients, i'd still recommend this cleanser. **4/5, MRP**\n\n**krave matcha hemp cleanser** ($26 for 4 oz) is a gel cleanser that appeared perfect in every way till i used it. IMO, it was difficult to rinse off, and left an oily film on my face after washing. i know some people are fine with that, but that sensation of *something* left on my skin after cleansing my face unsettles me. it was also much more drying than fresh soy face cleanser, probably because it contains coco-betaine (which is a much harsher surfactant, as compared to the top surfactant in fresh soy face cleanser, coco-glucoside) at the top of its list. it was mildly irritating too if i took my time with it-- i was surprised when it made my skin tingle, since its ingredients list seemed so gentle! i expected this to smell like matcha but instead it smelled like soap... which is reasonable, since it has no artificial fragrance/EOs. i see that this could be a potential HG for many skin types. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**innisfree blueberry cleanser** (\\~$9 for 3.4 oz) is a creamy cleanser that produces a rich lather. it has a pungent citrus smell which i simply couldn't come to terms with. it's also slightly irritating, and definitely too stripping for me. i eventually gave it away to my bf, and it works really well for him! he uses a tiny bit each time, otherwise it'd be too stripping for his normal-dry skin type. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) qv gentle wash** (\\~$24 for 33.8 oz) is a no-frills, unscented, foaming, cream-gel cleanser. this was definitely too stripping to be used on my face, so i use this sparingly on my body instead. this cleanser has a faint soapy smell that's much more pleasant than vanicream's, and it's completely non-irritating. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) sebamed liquid face and body wash** ($13.5 for 6.8oz) is similarly a no-frills, unscented, foaming cleanser. it has a gel consistency and dried out my skin very badly. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) avene soapless foaming gel** is rather similar to the sebamed liquid face and body wash, in that they are both incredibly drying, no-frills sort of gel cleansers. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n**hada labo super hyaluronic acid foaming wash** ($9 for 5.4oz) is an unscented self-foaming cleanser. the foam is very soft and abundant! it also rinses off effortlessly and cleanly. it has a pleasant, mild soapy scent. unfortunately, it caused my skin to burn after a few uses, and i had to discontinue use. it was also definitely too stripping for my skin. i think i think this would make a great basic cleanser for most skin types, but my skin's just... *sighs.* **0.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) vanicream gentle facial cleanser** ($9 for 8 oz) is a no-frills, foaming, cream-gel cleanser. it is unscented and has one of the shortest ingredients lists. it left my skin squeaky clean within 1 wash despite using only a pea-sized amount of the cleanser. my cheeks were also blotchy afterwards, and i still haven't been able to identify what is the irritant within this short and innocuous-looking ingredients list! of all the basic drugstore cleansers, this had the least pleasant chemical scent to it. but i think this would make a great basic cleanser for most skin types. **0/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche-posay toleriane hydrating gentle cleanser/ toleriane caring wash** ($15 for 13.5oz) is a non-foaming, ultra-gentle cream-gel cleanser. this burned both my bf's and my faces on the first wash... achievement unlocked, i guess! but i could feel that this was definitely non-stripping. i still don't know what irritated my skin here, since it works so well for so many other people with sensitive skin. **0/5, WNRP**\n\n# toners\n\n**isntree green tea toner** ($20 for 6.7 oz) is a thin, watery toner with a rather strong herbal scent. this did nothing much for my skin. it wasn't effective at hydrating/soothing my skin, controlling sebum production or calming my breakouts, which some other reviewers seemed to experience with this toner. though this toner does not contain any artificial fragrance/EOs, it has a cloyingly sweet scent that i am not a fan of. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**klairs supple preparation unscented toner** ($22 for 6.1 oz) is a viscous, hydrating toner. this has a mild chemical scent to it which did not bother me at all. it did pack a punch of hydration but also broke me out after a week of use. i've since learnt that butylene glycol, which is 2nd in this ingredients list, is rather comedogenic for me. however, i really appreciated the inclusion of non-irritating and soothing ingredients! it would have been perfect if it didn't contain butylene glycol. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) kiehl's ultra facial toner** ($17 for 8.4 oz) is a milky, viscous, moisturising toner. this broke me out very quickly, possibly due to the squalane and quite a number of other comedogenic ingredients that are further down the ingredients list. this has no EOs/artificial fragrance, and has a neutral, inoffensive scent. i would recommend this only to normal-dry skin types which are not acne-prone. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n# serums\n\n🌟 **purito centella unscented serum** ($20 for 2oz) is my favourite serum thus far! this contains 49% centella asiatica (tiger grass), \\~3% niacinamide, asiaticoside/asiatic acid/madecassic acid, sodium hyaluronate, and peptides. the star ingredient here is the centella! this calms my skin down like no other product ever has. my cheeks are less red and painful. my acne heals a lot quicker while using this too. while this doesn't contain artificial fragrance, it has a light sweet scent that doesn't bother me. it also provides a nice layer of hydration. it is viscuous, takes a short while to absorb, dries down kind of tacky and leaves your skin looking dewier. overall, it's still a cosmetically elegant serum to me. i've repurchased this a few times and i plan to use this for a looooooong time! i'd highly recommend this serum to almost anyone. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) paula's choice 10% niacinamide booster** ($44 for 0.67 oz) is a great niacinamide serum. it's filled to the brim with great ingredients. this contains 10% niacinamide and stabilised derivatives of vitamin c (acetyl glucosamine, ascorbyl glucoside) which work together synergistically alongside niacinamide to effectively brighten your skin. it also has sodium hyaluronate, other soothing ingredients and antioxidants. it's a tiny bottle but it lasts half a year for me, because i mix this booster with purito's serum, so i use only 4 drops per day. it's watery and absorbs extremely quickly without leaving tackiness/shine. this has a light pleasant scent, but does not contain artificial fragrance. i'd highly recommend this to anyone who's looking for a gentle but immensely brightening niacinamide serum with a ton of other great ingredients. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) timeless hyaluronic acid + vitamin c serum** ($21 for 1 oz) is a minimalistic serum containing 5% MAP (magnesium ascorbyl phosphate). MAP is a gentle, stabilised derivative of vitamin c, that can help with skin brightening, and perhaps, prevent aging. my skin cannot tolerate daily use of L-ascorbic acid, hence i use this too. this also has 1% hyaluronic acid and 1.5% of matrixyl 3000. it is non-irritating and provides a nice layer of hydration despite being pretty thin. i definitely notice that my skin's duller and less plump when i go without this. this doesn't have a detectable scent. i love timeless, in general! it has a whole range of simple but effective serums that are suitable for even sensitive and acne-prone skin type. i highly recommend checking out their serums! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) timeless vitamin c + e ferulic acid serum** ($26 for 1oz) is a 20% unscented L-ascorbic acid serum. it has a very low pH of 2.4, so it's pretty irritating and drying :\\\\. this is really the only significant issue that i have with this product. i can only use this a maximum of 2 times per week, and even at this conservative frequency, i experience quite a bit of flaking. this has a bit of a sausage-like/metallic smell but it doesn't disturb me at all, personally. i absolutely loveeeee that this comes in an airless pump now. the ingredients list is as simple as it gets for an L-AA serum. it can easily last 6 months after opening as long as i keep it refrigerated! ensure that you order this from a reputable seller who orders fresh stocks or else your product may oxidise quickly. this is an affordable and effective L-AA serum. **4.5/5, RP**\n\n**purito centella green level buffet serum** ($20 for 2oz) is basically the scented version of purito centella unscented serum. this contains EOs so it has a stronger herbal scent. i've noticed that this is slightly irritating when my skin's very sensitive. i'd recommend the unscented version above if you're interested in this! but if you're a sucker for the scent of lavender oil, i think this would be great too, because i had really great results using this for months as well. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n# moisturisers\n\n🌟 **etude house soonjung 2x barrier intensive cream** ($18 for 2 oz) is a medium-weight, unscented, simple creamy moisturiser. of all the creamy moisturisers that i've come across, this has one of the simplest and least comedogenic ingredients lists. it has a faint shea butter smell. don't be fooled by the name, it's definitely not a thick, suffocating cream! it spreads easily like a dream, and hasn't broken me out at all! this is also very effective at moisturising my skin-- my dry spots improve significantly overnight whenever i slather this on. however, it does leave your skin feeling pretty tacky especially if you layer other hydrating products beneath this. again, tackiness doesn't bother me since i don't (and shouldn't) touch my face much at all. this cream leaves me looking dewy too. even when my skin was at its worst, this caused 0 irritation, and in fact, helped to reduce redness and minimise tingling. i feel a fresh, cooling burst of hydration whenever i slather this on. i'd highly recommend this to almost any skin type. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) avene skin recovery cream** ($35 for 1.7 oz) is one of the simplest, most basic, unscented, no-frills cream moisturisers on the market. it has a slightly heavy, thick texture, but still glides on quite smoothly. the ingredients list only has 11 ingredients! i know that i can always switch back to this moisturiser if somethings goes awry. it is non-irritating but also doesn't soothe my skin. i think it moisturises decently but etude house soon jung barrier cream is a more efficacious moisturiser, IMO. the soonjung one's spreads much more effortlessly too. i'd recommend this to those with extremely sensitive skin types/those who may have accidentally destroyed their skin barrier. **4/5, MRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) rocky mountain oils sacred skin facial moisturizer** ($50 for 1.7 oz) is a highly emollient, medium-weight, luxurious cream that is scented with frankincense EO. i was previously using this for half a year till i discovered a better replacement, aka etude house soonjung barrier cream. i adore the texture of this cream-- it's so emollient and rich, so it does require some warming up in your palms. while this worked beautifully as a moisturiser and caused me no issues such as irritation and breakouts, i wanted to move towards building a fragrance-free routine due to my pretty sensitive skin. perhaps the EO in this was not yet causing me issues, but in due time, it could potentially contribute to significant inflammation, then finally culminating in significant skin irritation. my risk threshold is pretty low now because i've come very close to ruining my skin barrier with products, so i've decided not to continue using this. regardless, i'd recommend this to anyone who'd like a medium-weight cream with an amazing frankincense scent. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n**cosrx oil-free ultra-moisturising lotion** ($24 for 3.4 oz) is a gel-cream moisturiser which features a high amount of birch sap. i used this for a week and it was a decent, unimpressive moisturiser. i experienced a bit of irritation (skin burning) with this, perhaps due to the citrus peel EO in this. it has a distinct sweet, fruity scent. because of its thin gel-cream consistency, and their intention to exclude many emollients/oils, this moisturiser wouldn't be adequate for my combination skin type in the long run. sadly, this contains butylene glycol and dimethicone at the top of the ingredients list, which are known acne triggers for me. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# eye moisturisers\n\n**laneige water bank eye gel** ($39 for 0.8 oz) is fragranced gel moisturiser. it didn't cause any issues for me, but also wasn't impressive in any way. this had a sharp floral scent. again, i could do without this in-your-face sort of fragrance. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n**laneige time freeze eye serum** ($52 for 0.7 oz) is a fragranced, thin, milky eye serum. i soldiered on despite the old-lady fragrance and then got milia after a few weeks of use... that isn't a surprise, in retrospect, because butylene glycol are dimethicone are at the top of the ingredients list. thankfully, i experienced no irritation with this. otherwise, this did moisturise pretty decently... but nothing different from other moisturisers that i've tried. it is expensive for the small amount, and i do think there are many other better eye/face moisturisers out there that contain far better ingredients at the same price point. i wouldn't recommend this to anyone simply because it is unimpressive. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# sunscreens\n\n🌟 **purito centella green level unscented sun spf 50 pa++++** ($18.90 for 2 oz) is an unscented, soothing, chemical sunscreen that is not water-resistant. this doesn't leave a white cast on my brown (Fitzpatrick IV) skin even though i slather on a liberal amount-- about 1/8-1/4 teaspoon each time. many unscented products may smell a little strange but this only really has an extremely light chemical scent that doesn't seem to bother anyone so far! this is very hydrating and moisturising, so it leaves my skin looking dewy. it contains 2% niacinamide, centella asiatica, madecassoside, asiaticoside, madecassic acid, and asiatic acid. this pretty much looks and feels like a moisturiser with spf! i suspect that this, alone, would be enough in the AM for pretty dry skin types too. i break out from all sunscreens, and i think this one contributes a little to my acne. however it really is the least comedogenic sunscreen that i've tried/seen! i'd highly recommend this to pretty much anyone without a very oily skin type! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**missha all-around safe block essence sun spf 45 pa +++** ($16 for 1.7 oz) is a fragranced, water-resistant sunscreen. i'm personally fine with its light floral scent. this has caused my no irritation, doesn't leave a white cast, and moisturises well! i could even skip my serums because this is THAT hydrating/moisturising. as a result, it does leave my skin looking quite dewy, but that's fine with me! unfortunately, it may have broken me out a little, but then again, all sunscreens, especially water-resistant ones, tend to have that effect on me. i'd highly recommend this to pretty much anyone without a very oily skin type who's looking for a water-resistant sunscreen! **4/5, RP**\n\n**purito centella green level safe sun spf 50 pa++++** ($18.90 for 2 oz) is a scented version of the sunscreen above. this contains EOs and smells extremely strongly of lavender. the other difference is that this doesn't contain madecassoside, asiaticoside, madecassic acid, and asiatic acid. this caused no irritation for my skin type too! while this worked really well for my skin too, i'd recommend the unscented version instead for the reasons stated previously. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) skinceuticals physical fusion uv defense spf 50** ($34 for 1.7oz) is a tinted, physical, water-resistant sunscreen. this left me looking like a very anguished ghost. it is advertised to be suitable for all skin types, but obviously, if you do apply an adequate amount, it leaves an unavoidable violaceous-beige cast on my brown (Fitzpatrick IV) skin... this was super disappointing! immediately upon application, i also experienced tingling on the more irritated areas of my face. i'd only recommend this to normal, fair (Fitzpatrick II-III) skin types... **0/5, WNRP**\n\n# wash-off face masks\n\n**(NON-AB) origins 10 minute drink up hydrating mask with apricot & glacier water** ($26 for 2.5oz) is a fragranced, creamy, ultra-moisturising wash-off mask. this caused closed comedones after 1 use (30min), though it was non-irritating. it smells strongly of fresh oranges. this would be awesome for drier skin types which are NOT at all acne-prone. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) fresh rose face mask** ($62 for 3.3oz) is a gel mask containing bits of rose petals. this was supposed to soothe my skin, but instead, this irritated my skin right away and caused tingling/redness. it also did not seem to hydrate my skin much at all. i wouldn't recommend this (or any products featuring a high concentration of rose) to sensitive skin types. **0.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**raw manuka honey:** i decided to spread a generous amount of pure manuka honey with decent UMF rating. immediately, my face stung and turned pink. moral of the story: always patch test!\n\n# sheet masks\n\n**klairs rich moist soothing tencel sheet mask** ($30 for 10 sheets) is an unscented, ultra-hydrating, simple sheet mask. the essence is quite viscous but doesn't leave my skin feeling too tacky. it has pretty much no scent to it. it contains a list of non-irritating ingredients, and some ultra-calming ingredients such as panthenol and centella. it also has ceramides. all in all, this is a great mask to fix your skin barrier! within one use, all of my dry patches were gone. unrestrained sheet masking (a few times per week, in my case) always breaks me out, as it did when i used this mask too. however a single use is fine. i also love that the material of the mask is pretty thin and soft. i'm deducting 0.5 point just because butylene glycol is a known acne trigger for me, and it's at the top of this ingredients list. **4.5/5, MRP**\n\n**twotsp ggulba mask** ($30 for 5 sheets) is a fragranced, incredibly moisturising sheet mask containing very thick essence. what sets this apart from many other sheet masks is that the essence in this is INCREDIBLY sticky, since it is enriched with honey. there's also niacinamide in here, near the top of the ingredients list. the material of the mask is pretty thin and soft! it has a cloyingly sweet scent which reminds me of a sweet dessert. this is absolutely nourishing. however, it contains a few potential skin irritants, such as a few plant extracts, including rose extract. otherwise, this did not break me out (as long as i realllyyyy space out my sheet masking) or irritate my skin. i won't be repurchasing due to the potentially irritating additives. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**mediheal teatree care solution essential mask** ($3 per sheet) is a fragranced mask featuring centella asiatica and tea tree extract. the essence isn't sticky. there's nothing really outstanding about this. it contains lavender EO. while it didn't break me out or irritate my skin, it also didn't soothe or hydrate my skin remarkably. i'm nitpicking here... but the material of the sheet mask is pretty thick! **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**papa recipe bombee honey mask** ($20 for 10 sheets) is a fragranced mask that reminds me of a lighter version of the ggulba mask. the essence is pretty sticky here due to its star ingredient, honey. my experience with this is largely similar to my experience with ggulba, except this is less moisturising. both have a similar artificial, cloyingly sweet scent. **2.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**dr jart+ cicapair calming mask** ($23 for 5 sheets) is a mask featuring centella asiatica. it is pretty similar in its scent to the mediheal tea tree mask, but the centella in here seems to be lower in concentration. the mask material is very soft and thin, and seemed to hug my face better. the essence is a pretty thin too. this contains no artificial fragrance/ EOs. however! it irritated my skin slightly-- it caused a bit of tingling. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n# lip balms/masks\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar baume ap+** ($20 for 13.5 oz) is a thick, unscented moisturising cream. it has a shea butter scent. it leaves a pretty tacky feeling and shiny appearance. of all the moisturisers that i've tried, this is the most moisturising! i apply a layer of this on my chapped lips, followed by a layer of laneige lip sleeping mask to seal the deal. when i wake up in the morning, my lips are all dandy again! this + laneige lip sleeping mask is my magical duo! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **laneige lip sleeping mask** ($20 for 0.7 oz) is a fragranced, extremely thick and emollient lip mask. there are a few flavours to choose from, and they all contain strong artificial fragrance. personally, i chose the berry flavour, and it really smells like a strawberry sweet, lol. i could do without the scent. aside from this, this is perfect. compared to other lip masks and balms that i've tried, this is the most hydrating and moisturising mask, by far. it comes with a cute little spatula too. **4.5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**klavuu nourishing care lip sleeping pack** ($15 for 0.7 oz) is a lightly fragranced lip mask. it feels much less oily and thick than laneige's. it also has a faint vanilla scent that's much more tolerable and lighter than the laneige's lip masks. sadly, it did a mediocre job at moisturising my lips. this doesn't come with a spatula :(. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n(**NON-AB) la roche posay cicaplast levres** ($12 for 0.25 oz) is a thick, unscented, simple lip balm. my lips were still very dry despite slathering this on generously. i appreciate the simplicity of this product, but it just didn't work for me. this had a waxy texture. i'd prefer a lighter lip balm than this, personally. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) supergoop! acai fusion lip balm spf 30** ($9.50 for 0.5 oz) is a thick, unscented spf lip balm. it has a waxy, thick texture, and would ball up and flake off my lips so badly. this is not at all cosmetically elegant and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone! **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# actives\n\n🌟 **differin gel** ($15 for 0.5 oz) is a form of acne treatment that contains 0.1% adapalene (a form of retinoid). since incorporating this regularly into my routine, i've noticed a lot less inflammatory acne (giant pimples) and smaller closed comedones too. it doesn't tingle on application but it definitely increases my sensitivity to other products in my routine and causes redness. it's too drying when i use it more than 4-5x per week. however, as long as i use it at a moderate frequency, and pay attention to how my skin's feeling and looking, i experience not many issues with this. i'd highly recommend this to those combating acne, because it's a relatively gentle topical acne treatment. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n# cleansing devices\n\n🌟  **muji unbleached cotton pads** ($3.9 for 80 pieces)are the softest cotton pads ever! it's so gentle on my face, so there's no chafing at all! i find that it's just the right amount of thickness. i never experience issues with loose fibers. i use this to gentlyyy remove my sunscreen with micellar water. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **klairs toner mate 2-in-1 cotton pad** ($6.50 for 120 pieces) are extremely thin, compact cotton pads. they're pricey for cotton pads but they absorb very little product, so it'd be economical to use this for expensive products (toners/essences). i find that this is rougher than the muji unbleached cotton pads, so i personally use this on my bacne instead, since my back's not sensitive like my face is. i think this serves really niche purposes, i.e. to reduce wastage of pricier products, and to lightly physically exfoliate. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) normal foreo luna 2** ($169) is a cleansing device that gently vibrates to exfoliate your skin. it was too abrasive and irritating for my sensitive skin type. i experienced tingling and redness even after one use. i kept at it (i couldn't believe that even this would irritate my skin) and those symptoms only got worse! interestingly, this works very well at reducing breakouts for my sister (does not have sensitive skin)  without causing irritation. compared to other cleansing devices on the market, foreo is probably one of the gentlest around. it's still a form of physical exfoliation, so it'd be safer to use it with some caution, aka space out your use when you first begin. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# body care\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) physiogel ai lotion** ($25 for 3.4) is a lightweight, unscented, simple moisturiser. what sets this apart from most other body lotions is that it is so lightweight. it's almost like a milky emulsion! and it surprisingly does a great job at moisturising my dry skin despite its lightweight consistency. i love that it absorbs very quickly without leaving much tackiness or shine. it is also pretty non-comedogenic compared to other body moisturisers, which is a big deal to me, because i actually am acne-prone all over my body. :( it has a light shea butter scent. i'd recommend this to anyone who's looking for a light, no-frills body moisturiser! **5/5, WRP**\n\n🌟 **cos de baha niacin toner** ($17.50 for 6.76 oz) is an unscented toner packed with brightening ingredients. this contains 5% niacinamide, 1% panthenol, hyaluronic acid and licorice root extract. i use this on the areas of my body (back, neck, upper arms) which are suffering from acne and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation/erythema. so far, it's caused no issues such as breakouts or irritation. i primarily chose this for the high concentration of niacinamide, to brighten my acne marks. it's pretty affordable too, so i can slather it on generously on my body. this would also make a good facial toner, but do note that it contains eucalyptus, which is a potential irritant. **5/5, WRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar fluide** is a lightweight, gel-cream moisturiser. it absorbs fully within minutes and leaves no tackiness/shine at all! this also contains 4% niacinamide. in general, LRP products contain no skin irritants in its products. if you're looking for a light body moisturiser, this is it! this make work very well as a facial moisturiser too. i personally prefer creamier moisturisers that are richer in emollients, so i may not repurchase. **4.5/5, MRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) the ordinary 7% glycolic acid toner** ($8.70 for 8oz) is a potent AHA toner. it has no artificial fragrance, but it has quite a number of plant extracts. whenever i slather it on my back, i feel as though i'm in a bed of roses. this is rather potent, or perhaps the rose water in this is irritating me, because i do experience some tingling occasionally. i would never use this on my face because this is definitely too irritating/strong. this makes a great body AHA since it's affordable compared to most other exfoliants. **4/5, WRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) sukin natural botanical body wash** ($17 for 33.8 oz) is a fragranced, non-stripping gel wash that is filled with plant extracts. it contains a number of EOs and artificial fragrances so its botanical scent is really strong. it's non-irritating to my skin, however. it doesn't dry out my skin unlike most body washes i've tried. a non-irritating version of this would be sukin's daily gentle face and body wash, if you're interested! **3.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar baume ap+** ($20 for 13.5 oz) has been described above under the lip section! while this is intensely moisturising and leaves my skin feeling the softest, it also causes body acne for me, because it contains a high amount of shea butter and dimethicone, which are acne triggers for me. this would be best for pretty dry skin types/extremely dry patches/winter! if you're not acne-prone and have very dry skin, you can also apply this on your face too :). **2/5, WNRP**\n\n# summary: my holy grails\n\n1. bioderma sensibio micellar water\n2. paula's choice optimal results hydrating cleanser\n3. purito centella unscented serum\n4. paula's choice 10% niacinamide booster\n5. timeless hyaluronic acid + vitamin c serum\n6. etude house soonjung 2x barrier intensive cream\n7. purito centella green level unscented sun spf 50 pa++++\n8. la roche posay lipikar baume ap+\n9. laneige lip sleeping mask\n10. differin gel\n11. muji unbleached cotton pads\n12. klairs toner mate 2-in-1 cotton pad\n13. physiogel ai lotion\n14. cos de baha niacin toner\n\nwhew, that was a real mouthful. i'll be back in a year's time, with a hopefully shorter list :). my fingers are crossed!

U didn't not include any toner in your routine? Is that something that u decided to rid of? \n\n3. I'll most likely try to avene's moisturizer, because the current one I'm using is \"fresh\" brand moisturizer which is expensive, and I think I damaged my skin barrier. I think I have similar face combination type as you, so would you say that moisturizer is actually not as important? I mean it is essential, but if u get one that fits your daily needs, then I don't have to keep trying new products, I jusy gotta keep it consistent...\n\nYour advise is much appreciated, thank u!!",

    "body": "I have **combination skin with an oily T-zone and dry acne prone cheeks laden with PIH**, an aftermath of 2020 and some wrong skincare choices. Since I am acne prone, I try to avoid perfume/fragrance, alcohol and essential oils in my products. \n\n*Processing img thx4k3izjnf61...*\n\nI have tried a bunch of sunscreens and these are the **best ones** I have settled on after a long 2 years of trial and error and time/money/effort invested. I have tried to include the swatches of all the four sunscreens and the white cast whereever it was possible (suncros) for the camera to capture. Lets begin.\n\nProduct Name: **Suncros Soft Matte Finish Gel, SPF 50, PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rave\n\nAvailability in India: Easily Available in India, offline and online.\n\nIngredient list: Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n\nSunscreen type: Physical / Mineral \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3zgtf9w6knf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0796b78286edcc7126df7421f34ae34c3ae1c7c8\n\nExperience & opinion: I have been using this sunscreen since almost one year. I used to use UV Doux before this for as long as I can remember, but had to stop using it as my skin got really sensitive and I had damaged my skin barrier. \n\nYou definitely cannot use the recommended two fingers of sunscreen with this one as it gets really heavy and suffocating. I tried layering it in small amounts (maybe just one fingertip at a time), let that settle and then apply another fingertip. I could only do two fingertips with this one. It did work for my extremely sensitive skin at that time and miraculously it was even calming and healing for my active acne and the PIH post acne was really minimal. The texture is in between a cream and a gel as can be seen in the picture. I totally understand why people detest it so much, the heavy suffocating feeling is a put off. I am not going to lie, it is heavy, feels like a suffocating layer on your face and is uncomfortable but you get used to the feeling once you see that its actually working for your extremely sensitive skin when nothing else does. You have to properly blend it in, take a minute or two to actually spread it on the skin. I have tried to photograph the white cast this one gives immediately post application. but once it settles in 30 minutes or so, the white cast is almost negligible and gives a primer finish (I am NC 43-45 for reference). I don't use makeup so I don't know how it would perform under makeup. The reapplication is difficult. I blot my face a lil before I apply this and again it takes a while to settle which is irritating if you are out and about. I could never reapply this more than once. It is sweat proof, tested it in peak of summer. This is the only zinc oxide based sunscreen that did not dry out my cheeks. \n\nAll said and done, I can't seem to make it work as my stand alone sunscreen as two fingertip amount is just not going to cut it when you are on all sorts of actives. Hence, since I have healed my skin barrier now and can use chemical sunscreens again, I use it over my cheeks (an area where my PIH is the worst) layered over my chemical sunscreen, after it completely dries. It's the perfect sweet spot for me and helps with PIH.\n\nRepurchase Status: Holy Grail (HG). Already repurchased twice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **Bello Photostable Emugel Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rave ❤\n\nAvailability in India: Easily available offline and online.\n\nIngredient list:\n\nKey Ingredients: Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol, Ethylhexyltriazone Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyltriazine, Diethyl amino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate.\n\nOther ingredients: Purified water, Dimethicone and Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicetyl phosphate, Ceteth-10 phosphate, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Myristyl Myristate, Octyldodecanol, Caprylic Triglyceride, Pentaerythirtyl distearate, Phenyl trimethicone, Vitamin E acetate, Carbomer copolymer, Disodium Edetate, Trolamine, Sodium polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Methyparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben, Isobutylparaben\n\nSunscreen type: Chemical\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dr24pvoaknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f726d323339bee404855990ab043e2a3b051acc2\n\nExperience & opinion: I have been using it everyday since approximately 4 months. The texture is creamy and you have to work it in for like 2 minutes into the skin. Immediately post-application, the sunscreen feels greasy to touch and looks oily but it gets absorbed into the skin in about 10 minutes and leaves a dewy finish which never goes away. I really like the dewy healthy glow it gives me. I can actually use 2 finger amount of sunscreen and it doesn't leave a white cast on my dark skin tone. If it gets into your eyes, it does sting. I can assume that dry skinned people would loooooove this in the winters. If you are combination or oily, I feel you can completely skip the moisturiser step when using this in summers. Would be perfect for inclusion in a minimal routine in the AM. On reapplication, it does leave a little bit of white cast on the sides of the face where we tend to have the peach-fuzz which will go away with a little bit of rubbing. Overall, this is the best budget sunscreen easily available in India which doesn't make us look like we have dressed up for a meme.\n\nRepurchase Status: HG, WRP. Already repurchased thrice. I will be trying out Photostable Gold SPF 55 in the summer, maybe it will replace this one. If not, I will always come back to this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **Biore UV Smooth Kids Milk Spf 50 PA++++**\n\nReview Type: Rave ❤\n\nAvailability in India: Availability is a serious issue. Used to get it from Dokodemo pre-pandemic. Haven't been able to source since.\n\nIngredient list: Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Glyceryl Behenate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Sorbitan Distearate, Sodium Acrylate/​Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Paraffin, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Ceresin, Isohexadecane, Arginine, Lauryl Methacrylate/​Sodium Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polysorbate 80, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Dextrin Palmitate, Agar, Petrolatum, Succinic Acid, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Methylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, BHT.\n\nSunscreen type: Chemical\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gjsnx8acknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e3e74e3ba70e6471b63c4d83bd3d41c2e876eab\n\nExperience & opinion: I had been using it everyday in dry summer days. Where I live is not very humid and that's why I think this one works so well for me. The texture is very aptly described as milk since it feels like a thick emulsion and spreads into nothingness into the skin. I can use the recommended amount of sunscreen with this one and it doesn't leave a white cast at all. It gets absorbed into the skin within 2 minutes and leaves behind a comfortable breathable layer of moisture on your skin. It does not dry down matte. It doesn't irritate my eyes. Its just so perfect for my combination skin even on my oily T-zone in peak summer days.  Reapplication is such a breeze. I have reapplied it in a taxi, in my office, before a meeting without any downtime. I just absolutely love everything about this sunscreen except that I think it has been discontinued and I am crying over the loss of my only true HG sunscreen. If anyone from Biore is reading this, please accept my plea and bring this back into production!!!!!\n\nRepurchase Status: HG forever. Although on the look out yet again for something that would match this one's status!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **The Blessing Tree Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50 PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rant\n\nAvailability in India: Available on Amazon.\n\nIngredient list: \n\nKey Ingredients: Octyl Methoxy Cinnamate, Oxybenzone, Titanium Dioxide, Octocrylene, Avobenzone, Zinc Oxide.\n\nOther ingredients: Aqua, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Diisopropyl Adipate, 1, 3, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Acrylates /​ C10-30 Alkyl Acrylare Cross Polymer, Propanediol, Diethylhexyl Sryngylidene Melonate, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Xylitylglucoside (and) Anhydroxylitol (and) Xylitol, Niacinamide, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexyl Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Perfume.  That was a task to type!!!!!\n\nSunscreen type: Hybrid\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/52ec0gwdknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8dd848f71d4a3939aa1b3ea6f13df4428170a9b\n\nExperience & opinion: I have had this for around 1 1/2 years now. But I never had the courage to put it on my face due to the infamous \"perfume\" in the inci list as I had a compromised barrier and could tolerate only physical sunscreens. All said and done, this has served well as an excellent body sunscreen which doesn't break the bank and provides me excellent protection. It is non-greasy unlike the other body sunscreens on the market. The white cast disappears within 5-10 minutes and you are good to get dressed and head out of the house. I apply it on all the exposed areas of my body - neck, upper shoulders, arms, hands (I don't feel guilty reapplying it even with the frequent hand washing as its relatively affordable + acts as a moisturiser for me) and feet. \n\nHowever for the sake of this review, I mustered all the courage I had to try it on the face but alas it did not suit me and caused me CC's by evening. It spreads well, leaves a white cast on skin which disappears in about 5-10 minutes, although the white residue along the hairline just doesn't disappear. I had to rub it excessively, almost rubbed it out to get it out of my peach fuzz! The finish on this sunscreen is not ultra matte and nor is it dewy to touch, its almost in between which is comfortable for combination and oily skin types. I was worried that this might get drying on my cheeks as the day progressed due to the zinc oxide content but it did not get dried at all. While I was typing the inci list, I realised it has Niacinamide in it!!! Yet another amazing ingredient to be present in this sunscreen. All in all, I would say if you don't have sensitive/sensitized skin and are okay with the \"O\" sunscreen filters, this is an excellent sunscreen.  \n\nRepurchase Status: Might repurchase for body. Not suitable for my face.\n\nThis review took me almost a month to write and photograph, but I am ultimately happy with the final write-up. I sincerely hope you enjoy reading this! I have tried to include everything based on the rules of this sub, but still if you have any questions, do hit me up.\n\nI will make another post of the sunscreens which didn't work for me and would include the likes of Cipla Rivela tint sunscreen, Hada Labo UV Perfect Gel, Skin Aqua UV Moisture Gel, Photostable Insta,  Aroma Magic Mineral Sunscreen and The Mom's Co. Mineral Based Sunscreen.",

All of these do not have fragrance. Both Isntree creams are great for daytime use (gel cream in the summer and moist cream in the winter). The Illiyoon Ato Lotion is for the body and even face if you prefer a little more occlusivity with a balanced moisture and has been a great all-arounder and extremely economical.

It is extremely hydrating, but  in the winter, it really lacks in the 'locking in water' department. I'd say this texture and performance is really similar to the cult-fave Belif Aqua Bomb and is a lot cheaper. It gives a burst of hydration with a hint of moisture, does not have any stickiness, and does not pill with sun protection layer. Has not caused any breakouts for me, but of course, avoid if you have a HA sensitivity or live in dry climate. People with pure oily skin will have more longevity in using this throughout the year. I probably will not repurchase because I love to try new products, but I have enjoyed using it and it practical price.

The texture here is more reminescent of Belif Moisturizing Bomb and is even more economical! This cream gives alot of moisture and balances a little bit of hydration and emollience. It takes in a bit more time to rub in and it is slightly sticky after application but that feeling goes away fast especailly when layering with sun protection. I have had zero breakouts using this cream and I recomend this for combination skin that gets drier in the winter. I have also used this at night, but I prefer a little more occlusiveness. It may be good for oily or combo skin at night if you prefer a lighter cream. I probably will not repurchase because I love to try new products, but I have also enjoyed using it and it practical price. Overall a great no-frills moisturizer and I look forward to try other products from Isntree.*\n\n***Illiyoon Ato Ceramide Lotion***\n\n* Store: Olive Young\n* Price: $37 (1+1 deal)\n* Size: 2x 528 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2f20551004.html) Purified Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Shea Butter, Cyclopentasiloxane, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Hydrogenated Poly (C6-14 Olefin), Clohexasiloxane, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Perilla Frutescens Sprout Extract, Magnolia Kobus Flower Extract, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA (Ceramide PC-104 32.75ppm), Mannitol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Caprylate, Dimethicone, Diisostearyl Malate, Lauric Acid, Myristic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Stearic Acid, Silica, Arachidyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Alcohol, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cholesterol, Palmitic Acid, Propanediol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Disodium EDTA\n* **Review:** *I have used this for a month on both my body and my face, and I think out of all of these this is my favorite. I think some may not like that it leaves thin film of occlusiveness, but for me that is a plus. Locking in moisture is critical for me. It truly excels as a body cream because it does not feel sticky. This lotion is filled with so much goodness such as ferments, ginseng (korean antiaging plant), shea butter, and a bit of ceramide. It melts in to your skin and moisturizes it well. In the winter, I also enjoy it as a both a day and night face cream too since it is more emmolient and occlusive than the Isntree HA Moist Cream. Out of all the purchases, this has been a must purchase forever for my body and has an added bonus that I can use it on my face when I want to mix up routine.* \n\n***Innisfree Ato Soothing Cream***\n\n* Store: Jolse \n* Price: $23 (sale)\n* Size: 150 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_bdc7551007.html) Purified Water, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Glycerin, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Panthenol, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, C14-22 Alcohols, Behenyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Bislauramide MEA, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Arachidyl Alcohol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Cholesterol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Glucoside, Tromethamine, Propanediol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Xanthan Gum, Sorbitan Isostearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium EDTA, Madecassoside, Glucose, Arachidic Acid, Myristic Acid, Acorus Calamus Extract, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Tocopherol.\n* **Review:** *I have also been using this cream for a month, and it is a very impressive barrier cream. It is buttery and harder to rub in, but this will 100% lock in your routine. Judging by its formulations and comparing to Innisfree Derma Formula Green Tea Probiotics Cream, I can guess that it is about 3% cermamide. This cream does not give much moisturzation, but if you are using a layering a routine it will seal all of the steps in, especially layering an emulsion before it. I feel like with this cream, it has an antiaging effect because my fine lines has redued probably due to its effectiveness as a barrier cream formulated with the ceramide and centella antioxidants! This one will be loved by those with dry, sensitive, or combo skin that loves a good barrier cream. I will probably repurchase, but I know there are other products to try in a similar catagory!*\n\nEdit: Added details addressing fragrance :)",

    "body": "A lot of other topics have been covered very well here on SCA, but I was asked where I thought there might be gaps in knowledge.\n\nRecently, there’s been a lot of interest in inorganic (mineral) sunscreens. As a result, I often see questions like:\n\n“Sunscreen A uses 20% zinc oxide but only has an SPF of 30, while Sunscreen B uses only 5% zinc oxide and 6% titanium dioxide, yet has an SPF of 50. Why?” \n\nAnswering this involves discussing different sunscreen technologies. I’ll try to be succinct, but bear with me.\n\n**TL;DR** \\- Mineral filters can vary in particle size, which will change the relationship between % used and resulting SPF. Companies are often somewhat deceptive about their use of nano-sized mineral particles. There are a number of SPF-boosting technologies that can be employed that generally work by dispersing sunscreen filters, absorbing UV themselves, making sunscreen filters more efficient, helping to create an even/protective film on skin, or providing antioxidant protection, or reducing redness.\n\n**Inorganic Sunscreen Filters - Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide**\n\nIn the past few years, there’s been a lot of interest in these two filters because of a number of reasons. Some users find that these filters are less likely to produce irritation or other negative effects than sunscreens with organic (“chemical”) filters. Others are concerned about the safety of organic filters. Yet others believe that these filters are better for the environment and coral reefs (not necessarily true). Whatever the reason, more people seem to be considering using mineral sunscreens, which has resulted in a number of questions. One of the main ones is, “why do percentages of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide not always seem to correlate with higher SPF and PPD/PA ratings?” To answer that question, we have to look at a few things.\n\n**Particle sizes**\n\nZinc oxide and titanium dioxide are a naturally white solid, and need to be micronized (ground up) into fine particles in order to be suspended in sunscreen products to ensure even coverage on the skin without excessive whiteness. Naturally, that means that you can micronize it to be coarser or finer, resulting in larger or smaller particle sizes. Changing the particle size of these filters seems to slightly change the spectra of UV radiation they are able to (mostly) absorb and (to a lesser degree) scatter. Generally, the smaller the particle size, the more efficient the UVB absorption becomes, but at the expense of UVA absorption. So this is the first variable that can affect final SPF and PPD/PA ratings. Hypothetically, two sunscreens could both have 10% zinc oxide, for example, but use different average particle sizes, with one resulting in SPF 8 and the other with SPF 15. Further complicating things is that a sunscreen can use two blends of the same mineral filter with different average particle sizes in order to balance out the UV absorption curves. \n\n**Deception around nano-particles**\n\nOne of the more dubious things that I see in the industry, particularly in the US, is companies saying that they do not use “nano particles”. There is no standard definition of “nano” in the US as there is in the EU or Australia, so many companies feel free to simply say “no, we don’t use nano particles” without mentioning the fact that by EU or Australian standards, they may well be. \n\nCompanies also sometimes justify saying they do not use “nano particles” because the particles are coated in a secondary ingredient (often to provide better performance by preventing clumping of particles or protecting skin from the free radicals that are released when UV radiation hits these particles). Although the average primary particle size (just the mineral) is less than 100 nm, the average *total* particle size, including the coating, is often larger than that, so they use this reasoning to tell consumers they are not using “nano particles”. \n\nBecause the EU is stricter about this, you’ll sometimes see US companies telling a US customer that their sunscreen is “non-nano” when the same product, when sold in the EU, is clearly labeled as “nano” in the ingredients list. It could possibly be the case that they are using a different average particle size for the two products, but there are definitely cases of straightforward deception as well.\n\nA secondary point, which is perhaps even more interesting, is that when you grind up zinc oxide and titanium dioxide into fine dust in order to micronize it, you are creating particles of VARIOUS sizes, with some portion of it almost always being less than 100 nm, aka “nano”. This is why “average” particle size is given, since the particles are of many different sizes. \n\nIn fact, because of this, the EU’s standard for labeling a sunscreen filter as “nano” or “non-nano” is relative, not absolute - less than 50% of the particles must have a diameter 100 nm or less. (Australia’s standard is more stringent, requiring either less than 10% of the particles have  diameter of 100nm or less, OR less than 10% of the particles “exhibiting unique properties”.) \n\nWhat this means it that even “non-nano”-labeled sunscreens in the EU (and Australia) likely contain particles that are less than 100nm. So good luck to consumers looking for mineral sunscreens but who want to completely avoid “nano particles”!\n\nI understand that companies feel pressured by consumer fears of “nano particles” and therefore resort to somewhat deceptive tactics, but that creates a vicious cycle of fear-mongering, paranoia, and misinformation that ends up helping no one. (By the way, I use sunscreens with micronized zinc, likely with particles less than 100 nm in diameter, and I do not have any intention of stopping. That is what works for my skin and I haven’t seen any research that strikes fear into my heart of “nano” zinc oxide, while I am quite concerned about the effects of unmitigated UV exposure. But this is my personal stance, not a prescription.)\n\n**SPF-Boosting Technologies**\n\nThere are a number of ways to boost the SPF of mineral sunscreen formulations. The first is to use ingredients that help further disperse the sunscreen filter particles. Ingredients such as butyloctyl salicylate, ethylhexyl methoxycrylene, undecylcrylene dimethicone, amongst others fall into this category. Depending on which ingredient is used at what concentration, SPF can be reportedly increased by 50% or more. \n\nMore rarely, there are SPF-boosters that actually have UV-absorbing ability of their own, though they’re not classified as sunscreen agents. Amongst these are methoxycinnamidopropyl hydroxysultaine and methoxycinnamidopropyl laurdimonium tosylate. (There is sometimes some overlap between this category and the one above - for example, some believe that butyloctyl salicylate may actually have some weak UV-absorption properties of its own, though this is not usually advertised by the manufacturers). Some other minerals, such as talc and iron oxides also absorb UV radiation to a degree, though they are not officially recognized as sunscreen agents.\n\nThe next is ingredients that interact with or affect the film of sunscreen that is left after application and drying of the product. Sunspheres, for example, are hollow spheres of styrene/acrylates copolymer. These spheres are distributed throughout the film of dried sunscreen on skin (along with the sunscreen filters). By refracting light, they increase the chances of UV radiation coming into contact with the filters in the sunscreen film, thereby increasing the efficiency of the sunscreen without increasing the % of sunscreen filters. It’s not a new technology, but it really is quite brilliant. Sunspheres can reportedly increase SPF 50% or more depending on the concentration used and in what formulation. Other film-forming agents, such as silicone resins (often used in rub-proof foundations), silicone acrylates, and various other polymers, help sunscreen set into an even, tenacious layer on skin, and can, depending on the material used and at what %, can increase SPF by 20% or more.\n\nIt’s useful to note that silicone-dominant emulsions, depending on how they are formulated, can also be quite effective at forming an even, tenacious layer of sunscreen on the skin upon drying that doesn’t slip around and cause streaky protection. These formulations are often helped by the use of ethanol (alcohol) to help the formula adhere to skin. This is in part why you see so many Asian milk-type sunscreens that heavily use cyclopentasiloxane (a volatile silicone oil) also include ethanol. Personally, I’ve noticed that Skin Aqua Super Moisture Milk SPF 50+, which many love because it feels comfortable on skin and does not have ethanol, slips around on my skin much more than some other Japanese milk SS’s that do include ethanol. This is in part what makes the Super Moisture Milk feel so comfortable on skin (like a face lotion, which don’t typically need to form an even, static film), but concerns me when I see zinc oxide particles collecting in folds and creating patchiness after a few hours of wear, since this probably also translates to uneven protection.\n\nThe last category is what I personally label as “miscellaneous” SPF boosters, and are usually antioxidant compounds or extracts that reduce skin redness. In the case of some antioxidants, there is some research that they can somewhat boost SPF through antioxidant ability (ascorbic acid and alpha tocopherol, for example) and/or acting as a weak absorber of UV radiation themselves (ferulic acid). However, some other boosters in this category seem merely to boost SPF ratings by suppressing skin redness, which I find to be a bit ethically dubious, since this theoretically is not actually lessening the free radical damage caused by UV radiation (at least to any meaningful degree).\n\nYou can imagine that, barring patent limitations (and there are many in this space), that a company could combine and employ any number of these strategies in one formula to maximize SPF. An example of that would be Skinceuticals’ Physical Fusion SPF 50, which has a relatively low % of sunscreen filters (about 6% titanium dioxide and 5% zinc oxide), yet a high SPF rating and a reported PPD of 21, due to the use of butyloctyl salicylate, sunspheres, talc, iron oxide and an antioxidant extract.\n\nI hope this useful in your quest to find a sunscreen that you're happy with, and good luck!",

My skin can only handle mineral filters, but it’s been so tough trying to find “the one” between all the different components... I.e. a sunscreen might be super cosmetically elegant but have a low percent of zinc making me wonder about its UVA protection vs a sunscreen might have a super high percentage of zinc but be super drying and mattifying on my already dehydrated skin. \n\nSo, to be clear, there’s really no way for me to gauge the level of UVA protection in US sunscreens without seeing if the company will divulge it?? I always thought that you need at least 15-20 percent zinc to get sufficient UVA protection in a physical sunscreen, but it’s been hard as heck to find one with that much zinc that I can stand wearing (and if I understand what you’re saying, the filter percentages don’t really tell you the full story of protection afforded in a sunscreen). But, I can’t really trust the label “broad spectrum” to mean I’m getting superior UVA protection right?\n\nI don’t want to bother you with helping me figure out my sunscreen of choice cause I know you got bombarded with that in the last post, but would love to know if you have any suggestions for figuring out the UVA protection of a sunscreen if a company won’t say. I’ve been worried about my 6 percent zinc, 5 percent titanium dioxide sunscreen, even though it says it offers good broad spectrum protection (that’s so general of a statement!)",

This is a topic I've been wondering about a bit but haven't really seen anything on it! I'm guessing this is how Australian Gold Botanicals markets their tinted sunscreen as SPF 50 and a somewhat high PA++++ rating, though I didn't recognize any of the boosters you mentioned on the ingredients list. \n\nSomething I've been wondering is that I see a lot of professionals (e.g. derms) claim that Zinc Oxide is an excellent UVA filter. However, previous absorbance spectra plots I've seen of Zinc Oxide always have pretty low absorbance, e.g. <1, though they are broad spectrum in the range of UV wavelength that they cover. I don't know much about sunscreen and UV science, but I would imagine you'd generally want at least 1 for the absorbance spectra for it to be of much use if you end up having prolonged UV exposure. I've certainly seen this for UVB filters.  The only time I've seen a high absorbance spectra for Zinc Oxide is from the Neutrogena data with their Sheer Zinc sunscreen, but it also has a much higher percentage (yes I know now that isn't everything! ;-)) of Zinc Oxide than I've ever seen in another mineral sunscreen. \n\nIn my mind, it doesn't seem that helpful if you have broad spectrum coverage that has low absorption - but maybe I'm way off the mark? \n\nAlso, just curious, but any idea why companies haven't yet formulated a mineral sunscreen like the Neutrogena one that is tinted so it has less of a cast? I feel like this would potentially be a pretty decent gap in the market but so far the main tinted ones I've seen are the Australian Gold Botanicals and the Elta MD Sport. I assume it must be pretty hard to get a tint and adequate UV protection? \n\nIf you have time to answer any of these questions, I'd be super grateful but regardless, you're AWESOME for sharing your knowledge on this stuff with us. I'm sure everyone here really appreciates it, :-).",

Luckily TJs has a great return policy so if I don't like it I can get my money back.\n\n\nFull ingredients list:\n\nWater (aqua), glycerin, saccharide isomerate, propanediol, ammonium acryloxyldimethyltaurate/VP copolymer, phenoxyethanol, polyamide-5, dimethicone, hydroxyacetophenone, polysilicone-11, squalane, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, laureth-12, ceteryl olivate, glyceryl stearate, ethylhexylglycerin, sorbitan olivate, sunflower seed oil, cetearyl alcohol, lactobacillus ferment, tocopherol, sodium stearoyl lactylate, sodium hyaluronate, milk thistle extract, birch leaf extract, beta-sitosterol, panthenol, squalene, coconut fruit extract, citric acid, green tea leaf extract, sodium citrate.\n\n\nIt doesn't have a fancy smell, in fact it kind of smells like a medicinal cream like tret or hydrocortisone, but the smell dissipates on application. It's a very light gel cream and it sinks in fast. It comes in a frosted plastic jar.\n\nI am patch testing it tonight so I will update when I get to know it a little better. I'm not great at analyzing the more chemically-sounding ingredients, but I can tell that it does silicones and does not have alcohol denat, which is good for me. I was drawn to the buzzword ingredients like squalane, aloe, lactobacillus ferment, hyaluronic acid, green tea, and other extracts. If anyone has any more knowledgeable insight based on the ingredients, I would love to hear it. \n",

    "body": "**Liquid Gold Review, or: How I learned overexfoliation is a bad thing**\n\n**TL;DR:** If your moisture barrier is damaged, this stuff will seriously change your life. Support an up-and-coming indie shop and repair your moisture barrier, all without breaking your wallet.\n\n**Background:** I recently upped my skincare game considerably through the infinite wisdom and patience of r/SkincareAddiction and r/AsianBeauty. I’ve always been both a science nerd (currently working myself through a Masters program to be a physician assistant) and a product junkie, and those two things have gloriously collided over the last few months to the benefit of my skin! The AB side bar has an excellent list of blogs, one of which I fell way down deep into is The Acid Queen. Alli, who runs the blog, is a seriously impressive DIY’er, which allowed me to get involved in her guinea pig pool for testing product formulations she was currently tinkering with. I’ve spent the last five weeks testing her moisture barrier repair moisturizer, Liquid Gold, and here are my thoughts! The formatting of these sections is shamelessly ripped from bloggers whose reviewing formats I admire: Fiddy Snails, Skin & Tonics, Fan-B, Snow, and of course, Her Majesty The Acid Queen Herself ;)\n\n**What it’s supposed to do:** Liquid Gold is a moisture barrier repair moisturizer/emulsion. (For more info on what a moisture barrier is, see Skin & Tonics excellent moisture barrier post linked in the sources.) Liquid Gold takes your thinned out, red, overexfoliated, stinging, weakened skin and makes it supple, bouncy, strong, and able to tolerate some serious heavy-lifting from acids and actives. It accomplishes all this with the magic of CERAMIDES *oooh ahhhh*\n\n**How to use it:** We’ve got two recommended options here. The first is a thin layer all over your face as the first occlusive step of…well, however many of those you have. The second is a thicker layer as a deeper moisturizing sleeping pack of sorts. I’ve been going with option 1, twice a day every day, AM and PM. Its consistency is slightly thicker than a serum, but not as thick as a gel cream or oily despite the ingredients list (more on that in a moment). It’s BRIGHT yellow-orange from the sea buckthorn, but spreads pretty easily and only leaves the tiiiiniest yellow cast after I’ve spread it in. However, my paleness makes Casper the ghost look like a tanning bed addict, so I imagine on most other skin tones it wouldn’t be visible at all. One of the things I love about this product is how quickly it dries down. I’m (gleefully) looking down the barrel at 15+ steps in my PM routine, so anywhere I don’t have to wait for dry time, I’m a happy camper. I don’t wear makeup often, but I’ve brought it out a number of days to see how Liquid Gold plays under makeup. I’m pleased to say it holds up just fine, without makeup settling into fine lines, caking, or otherwise disintegrating throughout the day.\n\n[**Here's some photos of it in action!**](http://imgur.com/a/knjp4)\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (Aqua), Propylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Niacinamide, Polyglyceryl-3 Methyglucose Distearate, Rosa Mosqueta (Rose) Hip Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Seed Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Fruit Oil, Panthenol, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Squalane (olive-derived), Cetyl Alcohol, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Ceramide NP, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA.\n\n**Notable Ingredients:** Oh, man…all of them?! This ingredients list is STRAIGHT FIRE if we are talking moisture barrier repair. Let’s break that down, shall we? I’m going to limit my highlights because otherwise I will literally never finish this review.\n\n**Ceramide Complex** (Ceramide NP, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP; Phytosphingosine; Cholesterol): The Beauty Brains, another fabulous “science of skincare” blog, has a great discussion of ceramides (see sources for link) and describes them so: “Ceramides form a kind of water-proofing barrier in the upper layers of skin. They’re not only critical for helping skin retain water but they also help repair the skin’s natural barrier and regulate cells. Ceramide production dwindles with age which can result in dry skin, wrinkles and even some types of dermatitis.” The other important thing to know about ceramides is that they are team players. Ceramides without fatty acids and cholesterol won’t get you very far. Specifically, ceramides penetrate best with a mixture of 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% fatty acids. So maybe you’ll find a product with ceramide floating around in the ingredient list, but good luck finding one with all three players…and if you do, cross your fingers they’re in the optimal ratio. Except that’s exactly what we have in Liquid Gold. Hell yes.\n\n**Niacinamide:** Why hello, my old friend! I’ll let the Queen herself explain the wonders for niacinamide: “One of the most studied skincare ingredients, niacinamide does everything: smooths fine lines and wrinkles, increases ceramide and fatty acid synthesis, regulates skin cell turnover, fades hyperpigmentation, evens skin tone, and has powerful anti-inflammatory properties.” Naturally then, it seems like niaciamide is in errything these days, but who knows how much is in there? Niacinamide is most effective at 3-5%, so unless the percentage is disclosed, we’re left stacking niacinmide products to reach that threshhold. Liquid Gold has 4%, which happens to be the same amount you’d get if this ingredient was included in a Curology prescription. Jackpot.\n\n**Sea Buckthorn:** Again, from The Beauty Brains: “[Sea buckthorn is] known for being rich in a number of bioactive compounds, including the following: vitamins A, B1, B2, C, D, K, and P; omega 3, 6, 7, and 9; 43 lipids, organic acids, amino acids, folic acids, tocopherols, flavonoids, phenols, terpenes, tannins, [and] 20 mineral elements.” Okay…but what does all that do for your skin? Well, we’ve got some studies that show all that goodness adds up to improved wound healing, protection from UV damage, and increased collagen production (see sources for link).\n\n**Rose Hip Oil:** High in oleic and linoleic acids, both of which are polyunsaturated fatty acids important for the integrity and regeneration of skin cell membranes. More moisture barrier magic going on here, my friends.\n\n**Okay, but seriously…**everything in this ingredients list is AMAZING. And rightly so, that’s the whole idea behind DIY in the first place: if you make it yourself, you know everything is there for a reason without any fluff or fillers.\n\n**How it worked:** And here’s where the other part of the title of this post comes into play. I have a long and glorious history of overexfolating my skin because…well, basically because that’s what I thought I was supposed to do. Physical exfoliants, all sorts of acids, inappropriately high strength retinoids…I would throw them all at my face at once every single day until literally my whole top layer of skin peeled off in sheets in the shower and I was shiny and red as a cherry. Even normally gentle products would sting like the devil, and I never questioned it because I honestly thought that’s how it was supposed to work. I’d fry the life out of my skin until I couldn’t handle it (so like 3-4 straight days of all this), then take a break for a week, maybe less, and then I’d start all over again. It was a roller coaster, let me tell you, and I did this for years. \n\nThen I found this post on FutureDerm that totally blew my mind about setting a schedule for building tolerance to retinoids (see sources for link). So I mapped out my schedule for all 24 weeks and promised myself I would be patient. I went without actives for over a month, then took another crack at one night with lower strength Tazorac, my drug of choice. Disappointingly, I still peeled like a snake for the next three days, despite babying my skin before and after the Tazorac. The next week, the same thing. I was beginning to doubt the wisdom of the retinoid tolerance schedule.\n\nEnter Liquid Gold.\n\nI got on Alli’s testing list and got a bottle in the mail soon after. I am not exaggerating when I say this is literally the most amazing shit I have ever put on my face in my life. Redness starting receding within days. A night with retinoids was no longer followed with peeling, pain, redness, or stinging — all of my hallmarks of a compromised moisture barrier. I tentatively and slowly moved through increasing the frequency of the retinoid. Once, twice, three times, four times a week, two interminable week periods per increase. So far, so good. I can feel fairly confident that Liquid Gold is the responsible party here since the rest of my non-actives routine stayed stable while I was tinkering with how to reintroduce them after my hiatus. Gradually, I added all my actives back in so that now, here’s what I’ve got going on my face: 1) Tazorac 0.05% gel 4x/week; 2) Curology 0.009% tretinoin, 9% azelaic acid, 1% clindamycin every night; 3) Paula’s Choice Resist 2% BHA morning and night; 4) Timeless 20% Vitamin C+E Ferulic Acid serum (AM only).\n\nEvery time I wash my face, I think today will be the day I finally overdo it and start feeling my barrier damaged again. BUT NO. My skin feels strong, bouncy, resilient, and looks glowing. My husband pokes me in the face, nods knowingly, and declares, “Chok chok.” He’s right. Now, I’ve been throw actives at my face like there’s no tomorrow and my face takes it like a champ. Eventually, I’m hoping to add in an AHA and up my Tazorac to 0.1%, but my schedule says I’m not allowed to do that for another few months. I’m glowing like the goddamn North Star thanks to all those actives, and I can keep coming back for more thanks to the almost surreal talents of Liquid Gold.\n\nI started to panic a bit the closer I got to the end of my bottle since this was a DIY formula since I absolutely had neither time time nor inclination to whip up a batch myself and didn’t know what I would do when I ran out. The day before I was about to email Alli and beg her to keep making me some forever in exchange for my first born child, SHE OPENED HER OWN SHOP ONLINE!!! This is the best news my skin has ever had. I immediately purchased a 60 mL glass pump bottle of Liquid Gold for $24 from Stratia, The Acid Queen’s shop website. After having such a fabulous experience with this, you better believe I threw Rewind, her DMAE serum, into my cart with a quickness. \n\n**Conclusion:** This shit is my life now. It let’s me go active-crazy without unduly compromising my moisture barrier and makes my skin feel stronger than it has in my entire life. It’s affordable, pleasant to use day and/or night, well-formulated, conscientiously packaged, and made in-house by a fellow skincare junkie on the other side of the country. I couldn’t be happier to love this product and have the opportunity to support her shop.\n\n[Stratia Skin, Liquid Gold, $24](https://www.stratiaskin.com/collections/skincare/products/liquid-gold)\n\n*Disclosure: I was asked to write a review of this product that was originally intended only for Alli to read for formulation feedback and my experience with the product. I only decided to write it for public consumption when I realized she was opening the shop and other people could get this product. I did not accept the product with an agreement to review it positively, nor have I received any monetary compensation for doing so. All opinions expressed above are my own.*\t\n\n**Sources**\n[The Beauty Brains: Is sea buckthorn oil good for skin?](http://thebeautybrains.com/2014/07/is-sea-buckthorn-oil-good-for-skin/)\n[The Beauty Brains: Is rose hip oil good for anti-aging?](http://thebeautybrains.com/2015/01/is-rose-hip-oil-good-for-anti-aging/)\n[The Beauty Brains: Are ceramides good anti-aging ingredients?](http://thebeautybrains.com/2015/04/are-ceramides-good-anti-aging-ingredients-episode-77/)\n[Stratia Skin: Liquid Gold](https://stratiaskin.com/products/liquid-gold)\n[Skin & Tonics: The Importance of Fatty Acids, pH & the Moisture Barrier: How I Eliminated my Acne & Decreased my Skin Sensitivity](http://skinandtonics.com/the-importance-of-fatty-acids-ph-moisture-barrier-how-i-eliminated-my-acne-decreased-my-skin-sensitivity/)\n[The Acid Queen: Fun with DIY: Beginners Recipe Shopping List](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/02/16/fun-with-diy-beginners-recipe-shopping-list/)\n[The Acid Queen: Fun with DIY: Moisture Barrier Serum](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2015/11/03/fun-with-diy-moisture-barrier-serum/)\n[FutureDerm: 11 Things You Never Knew about Retinol and Retinoids Until Now](https://www.futurederm.com/11-things-you-never-knew-about-retinol-and-retinoids-until-now/)",

        "body": "I'm loving this stuff right now too. I was lucky enough to be a tester so I've been using it for a little while and ordered a full size the second it was available. I just wanted to add some  impressions and my skin type.\n\nI have dry, sensitive, always-red skin with hormonal acne. I tested Liquid Gold on half my face for two weeks and it didn't cause any visible changes. No increase in acne, no miraculous redness reduction. I find it very minimally moisturizing. My skin still feels dry and tight after letting it sink in (which I agree happens quickly) and I have to follow it with a heavier moisturizer (or three.) There is just a tiny amount of stickiness and little to no slip after it dries/absorbs.\n\nI, too, have been trying to find a way to use actives without over-exfoliating. Daily use of a mild BHA and AHA has proven too harsh in the past, so I've been increasing in frequency very  slowly and now I'm up to every other day with no discomfort or peeling, even when combining BHA and AHA and using my stronger products.\n\nI'm really happy with Liquid Gold and see myself using it indefinitely. The price and ingredients speak for themselves, and the packaging is really nice too. One last thing I just thought of: I was showing it to my mom and she had an irritated spot on her hand from a cut or something, so I put this on that spot and she said it was amazingly soothing.",

    "body": "Garmi aaa gayi haiiii\\~ dhoop badh hui hai aur heatwaves pardhaar chuke hai 🥵🥵 obviously we need sunscreens! I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae](https://preview.redd.it/04x8cx1jvsy81.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db29ff28ad9fbcd3ff56a158d60e872ed63cb538)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\nand that's all from my side! I know its not much but then again kangaal haalaat mein kharidaari mushkil hai 💀. anyway, here's a list ss that I do want to try once this lot is finished:\n\n* sunscoop sunscreen serum (only if dermaco doesnt work lmao. really intrigued)\n* Face shop sunscreens (itne variants . ek try karne ka mann hai 😖)\n* beauty of joseon rice ss (stock mein aaja bhai 😫)\n* missha sun aqua gel and essence (bas aise hi lol)\n\nI've also tried the neutrogena ultra sheer, episoft , a few banana boat ones but way long ago so I don't clearly remember them to give the verdict on them. just if I haven't repurchased them, consider that they didn't work well for me.\n\nhope this was informational and you guys enjoyed! if you still have any other questions related to the product above, feel free to comment!",

    "body": "so I've been slowly dealing with dermatillomania- or, something like it. In a nutshell, it's when some kind of underlying issue, an anxiety, absentminded compulsion, or even something major like dysmorphia, prompts you to pick at your skin to the point of causing wounds. I'll spare you the TMI, but I've been able to get closer to conquering it than I've ever been since I began doing it, and what's helped most isn't what I thought it'd be.\n\nif you've ever dealt with it before, it isn't really the same as healing acne. Acne has a few surefire methods of treatment, things like tret or differin, I see pop up again and again. But what I was dealing with wasn't really acne, it was healing wounds I was inflicting on myself, and the treatments for acne weren't going to do that. It took me a long time to come to grips with this.\n\nI had issues with straight up vaseline-based things, they'd clog my skin and make me break out, and I started thinking that the moisture was what was doing it... so I began to try to \"dry\" my skin out, hoping the scabs flaking off was analogous to them healing. I'd slather benzoyl peroxide on my skin, completely destroying my moisture barrier, but at least I wouldn't get whiteheads or infections. My skin got so dry, it would literally crack like worker's hands, it was horrifying, but again, putting on more vaseline or anti-biotic ointments would just make it worse.\n\nI tried dozens of moisturizers: the low-quality tubs of dimethicone from drug stores, the extremely expensive imported high-end creams with oils and so on, obscure ingredients, nothing really helped- a lot made my skin bright red, a lot broke me out. some did nothing but sit on my skin like a film of glue, even though everyone in this sub swore by them(ie, anything snail related). Stuff that people in this sub called HGs did nothing at all. Granted I probably never gave them enough time, and that's on me.\n\nOut of desperation I'd search this sub for the moisturizer that everyone always mentioned most: the Beauty of Joseon Dynasty Cream, and I bought some on a whim after a particularly bad mental health day where I was scared I'd look like some sort of disease patient for the rest of my life. I went home, put some on, went to bed.... \n\n...and the literal overnight transformation was almost hard to believe. Redness, red healing scars, almost entirely gone. Anything open, the inflammation was gone. Whole patches of my skin and cheeks were just regular skin, no rash of red dots everywhere. After THREE DAYS of applying it every morning, the scabs on what still remained were slowly falling away and revealing totally smooth healed skin underneath. I had no idea this was possible, until now any sort of wound I'd caused had lingered and refused to heal for days, maybe a week or more, every time. My skin felt so smooth and not rough and sandpaper-y. I didn't even know it was possible without physical exfoliation.\n\nI realized the entire problem was that through all of this **I wasn't properly moisturizing my skin**. All the treatments, all the creams, all the oils, all the ointments, all the germ-killing foams to avoid infection, it meant absolutely nothing because my skin was not properly moisturized, and that was the final tipping point.\n\na few weeks have gone by now and it's almost surreal to look at myself in a mirror, there's a few scars- I'm looking into treating those- but I'm not the frightening creep with the skin of someone addicted to substances, I'm just... a normal, every day person. with normal skin, a normal face, just normal. I don't see anything scary or distractingly obvious anymore. I just look... normal.\n\nIt's been probably a decade or more that I've dealt with this compulsive issue and it's the first time I feel like I've seen my own face in that time. I forgot what I looked like, because all I could ever focus on were all the lingering wounds everywhere. And now that I know that having a normal face is possible, it's like all the fear I had is gone. I don't know if I'm ready to post my photo on the internet yet and I didn't take a \"before\" picture, but I just wanted to tell anyone else out there that if NOTHING ELSE works, maybe the absolute most basic thing is the problem, and maybe to try this particular one out.\n\n...anyway, tldr: using this moisturizer helped heal my skin in mere days to the point where I felt enough hope to power through any compulsion to mess with it and I feel like a regular person again. I have no idea what ingredient was different- maybe the rice water- but I'm a for-life fan now. I guess I just wish it came in bigger containers :P",

I try layering milk toner and hydrating serums and Dr. G clear soothing cream (for the inflamed spots) and it seems to work. But I still feel the cream is not hydrating enough. I need something more moisturising and longer-lasting. I see there is coconut oil in BOJ, so I hesitate to try it. However, after seeing your comment, I think I have to give it a try.

    "body": "Edits: Tried to fix some formatting issues. \n\n—\n\nHi everyone! \n\n[In my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/?st=JIATDG0T&sh=d905c745), I talked at length about the skin condition of rosacea -- what it is, the subtypes, what the causes are, the foundations in treatment (cleansing and moisturizing), as well as treatments and beneficial ingredients. This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

    "body": "**Personal info:** 28F. Skin type: dry, sensitive, acne-prone, rosacea. Sensitive to niacinamide. Skin tone: pale af. Climate: hot and humid (SC, USA).\n\n**Product info:** Japanese, SPF 50+ PA+++, free of alcohol, fragrance, essential oils, and niacinamide. Truly a milky texture. Combination sunscreen (meaning both mineral and chemical filters).\n\n**Ingredient list:** Cyclopentasiloxane, Water, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, BG, Diethylhexyl Succinate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Hydrated Silica, Lauryl PEG-9 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Lauroyl Lysine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogen Dimethicone, Triethoxysilylethyl Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Hexyl Dimethicone, Methylparaben, EDTA-2Na, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Arginine, Bis-Ethylhexyl Hydroxydimethoxy Benzylmalonate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Acrylates Copolymer, CI 73360, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Talc, Ethanol, Iron Oxides, Tin Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Tocopherol, Mica \n\n**My experience with it:** This is the best SPF I've ever tried! I've tried quite a few in my search of the perfect SPF, and nothing has been able to beat this. No white cast on me. I've never experienced pilling or any sort of irritation from it. It wears beautifully under makeup. Easy to blend as it is a truly milky texture. This is truly fragrance free - smells like nothing to me. Natural finish on me but I've read some people have a matte finish with it. I have used this since January of this year (2023). \n\n**Potential con:** I've read some people anecdotally notice getting sun with this product. I haven't noticed this, but I honestly avoid the sun as much as possible. I'd love to hear from those who experience this!\n\n**A true con:** the wimpy size of the bottle. 40 mL is so small! Alas, I'll continue to repurchase. The price is affordable for me (\\~$11 a bottle).\n\n**Another SPF I also love:** Canmake Mermaid Skin UV Gel SPF 50+ PA++++.",

There are a few serious YouTuber’s (one who is a derm in Houston) who breaks the ingredients down during her vids and is sensitive to those with sensitivities (ex- niacinmide). Her name is Dr.Dray. I recommend giving a listen. She also covers many Asian products both chemical, mineral & hybrid. She also puts links( to sites and stores and is not compensated).

    "body": "I just want to preface this post by saying that I like Jaclyn Hill. I bought Champagne Pop when it first came out because 1) I wanted to support Jaclyn and 2) it looked like a beautiful highlighter in a color I don’t have. I thought the highlighter was going to be limited edition….it ended up being permanent and I felt silly to have woken up at a strange hour to order it. I don’t regret purchasing it because its my most used highlighter in my collection. \n\n\nRecently, I saw a review on the eyeshadow palette that is part of this new collection that JH did with Becca. This youtuber (Rita B) was disappointed with the disparity in formula between JH eye palette and other Becca palettes. \n\n\nIt seems as if Becca used cheaper ingredients and a standard formula to mass produce these palettes cheaper and quicker. They cut corners to make more money. So I got curious as to whether the formula for the highlighter was the same or different in the palette vs the single. Lo and behold – it’s DIFFERENT. In the JH face palette, MICA is the first ingredient, whereas in the single TALC is the first ingredient. This leads me to believe that Becca put more fillers in the Champagne pop in the face palette to save production costs. TALC is an additional ingredient in the blush Rose Spritz whereas its not in the regular blush formula. I’m disappointed to be honest. Ingredients are listed below for your reference. \n\n\nChampagne Pop – Permanent collection \nTalc, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Isostearyl Alcohol, Petrolatum, Silica, Boron Nitride, Nylon-12, HDI/Trimethylol Hexyllactone Crosspolymer, Dimethicone, Paraffin, Microcrystalline Wax (Cera Microcristallina), Polyethylene, Magnesium Stearate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Potassium Sorbate, Calcium Sodium Borosilicate, Calcium Aluminum Borosilicate, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Polyethylene Terephthalate, Acrylates Copolymer, Tin Oxide, Tetrasodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin.

For instance, while regular MAC brushes are handmade and typically use higher end fibres (real and synthetic), their holiday brush sets are always machine made and low quality fibres. Many companies use cheaper quality ingredients in palettes as the price is quite low for a large number of shades which is more of a pain in the ass to manufacture. A change in ingredients doesn't necessarily automatically equate to a lesser quality, but it's always a good idea to be wary of limited products. I always advise waiting out the first batch if you can, and then read reviews from people you trust or swatch it yourself if you can get the chance. Yes, it's not as exciting and sometimes brands market it in such a way that \"it might be your only chance\" - but it'll save you $$.",

They were at his house for 5 days in a row and he treated them with the normal lice shampoo twice.  When I picked them up and got them back to my house I discovered live lice on their heads and immediately treated them with super lice treatment.  It’s dimethicone based, which is more effective.  After treatment, I combed my little boy’s hair and was pulling out dozens and dozens of dead ones- and decided to just shave his head.  He was happy for me to do it, thank goodness.  His dad wasn’t pleased at all- but he will get over it.  He thought I overreacted, but I sent him a photo of a pile of dead lice and he didn’t say another word.\n\nMy little girl was less infested, but still dealing with them.\n\nPlease keep your fingers crossed for me that it’s over.  I never want to see another louse again.  🤣\n\nBut seriously, if your kids come home from school scratching and you find lice- just skip the regular stuff and go straight to the dimethicone treatment!",

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F18 (umar badh gayi but dimaag nahi 💀)**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , acne (pustules, fungal and cystic) pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae ](https://preview.redd.it/fnjipguox9ma1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d880ff6b482ade3f03237375ef02cdd64fb4e3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( .

I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl  Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise!

I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a  fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\n* **The Derma Co.** **1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum** \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\]\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 30 ml (bought from amazon)\n\n**For skin type** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid. fragrance free. really watery and leaves a dewy-shiny finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredient list** : Purified Water, Glycerin, Avena Strigosa Seed Extract, Lecithin, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Silica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Decyl Glucoside, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7 & Disodium EDTA.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was....okay-ish? idk but I was really excited for this since their HA sun gel is one of my HGs. This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less 😖 if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would  get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation.

I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop 😭. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :(  but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nupdate : this ones a hard no for me. is it calming? yes. but the whitecast is too much. and when i sweat it literally looks like I'm secreting milk from my skin  (~~nipple)😭😭~~\n\n**rating** : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/​PPG-10/​1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is 🔥🔥🔥. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool 🤤 only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure! in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty 😖 I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao 😌 so you can guess I go out a lot heheh. I feel like this one is getting over sooner than others in my ss ki theli 😫 but either way, if you find a good deal on it, blindly add this to your cart and order it. you wont be dissappointed!\n\nrating : 5/5 and WRP on reduced mrp only.\n\n* **Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun : Rice + Probiotics (SPF50+ PA++++)**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1530 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1200 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : dry, sensitive, acne prone and combination\n\n**texture and appearance** : creamy white lotion (ya nasty-). unscented ( ha, ha , aur socho ashleel cheeze 🤡)\n\n**ingredients list :**   Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Water, Glycerin, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Behenyl Alcohol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Sodium Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Water, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/​VP Copolymer, Polyisobutene, Silica, Caprylyl/​Capryl Glucoside, Sorbitan Oleate, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Bifida Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacillus Ferment,Streptococcus Thermophilus Ferment\n\n**filters :**\n\n* uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nthis deserves all the hype it gets on the net. my current and forever HG sunscreen (unless they change formulation). seriously this ticks all the boxes . no whitecast? check. great filters? check. doesn't make you face look like you rub pan grease on it? check. it absorbs so well and is more moisturizing than some of the moisturizers out there. obviously, wished we would get more quantity for the price paid but itna criticise karne ke baad bhi, brands toh behre hai 😔and on reapplication, doesnt feel like im doing the 100 layers challenge lol. plus , I don't feel regret when applying it these days, cuz no fear of sunscreen melting during winters (#rajailife) . *taareef karu kya uski, jisneee tujhe banayaaaa✨\\~*\n\n**rating :** 5/5 and forever HG\n\n* **Benton Mineral Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 15g (haalat kharab biros). got it at 30% on beauty barn\n\n**For skin types** : normal and sensitive skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : a white stick. that's it. kind of a really thick lotion like texture. unscented and smol. mineral sunstick.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Coco-caprylate/caprate, sunflower seed wax, propylene glycol dicaprylate, H-di/trimethylol hexyllactone cross polymer, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, titanium dioxide, dicaprylyl carbonate, Synthetic fluorphlogopite, vinyl dimethicone, microcrystalline wax, aluminum stearate, polyhydroxystearic acid, purslane extract, centella extract, sodium hyaluronate, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, sodium Acetylated hyaluronate, caprylic/capric triglyceride, polyglyceryl-4diisostearate/polyhydroxystearate/sebacate, silica, alumina, pentylene glycol, allantoin, panthenol, Glycerin, Madecassic Acid, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Xylyl Glucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Glucose, Glyceryl Caprylate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Stearic Acid, Tocopherol, Purified Water, 1, 2-hexanediol, ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**filters** :\n\n* titanium dioxide\n\nthis one came around the same time as the tocobo sunstick on beauty barn so being the ✨phisool kharchi wala baccha✨, I bought both of them. unfortunately , this one was a big letdown. how tf can a sunstick leave a whitecast? this one is a great example. first off, it requires a lot of pressing and dragging across the face to dispense , so not fond of that, especially when I have active acne. secondly, it legit looks like someone rubbed fair and lovely mixed with water on my face 💀. its not waterproof, expensive for the quantity you get and gives a disappointing finish and result. I'm not particularly sure about protection against sun on this one but oh well. also piddu si stick hai so kind of cute but lootne wala hai lmao\n\n**rating** : 2/5 and WNRP\n\n* **Tocobo** **Cotton Soft Airy Sun Stick SPF50 Pa++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1550 for 20g (bought at 1100 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily, combination, acne prone skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale blue long cylinderical like stick. has a really pleasant and soft floral fragrance . leaves a matte fininsh and doesnt feel greasy on apllication. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list :**  Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Niacinamide, Tromethamine, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Pentylene Glycol, Polysilicone-15, Vigna Radiata Seed Extract, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Extract, Sophora Flavescens Root Extract, Rheum Palmatum Root/Stalk Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Oenothera Biennis (evening primrose) Flower Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Seed Oil, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Fragrance\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* titanium dioxide (physical filter)\n\nprobably the only sun stick that comes even close to the isntree sun stick. this gives such a good matte finish without any greasy feel . plus has cute floral smell to it that doesn't transfer to your skin or anything. and damn what a bang for a buck. probably the closest dupe for the isntree one. the only con is that it kind of pills after the 3rd application and rubs of oily after a while. if you are a person who touches their face every once in a while (like my dumbass), you might find it a bit uncomfortable. that being said, most of the times I just blot the grease away after 3-4hrs of application and apply another layer afterwards. sun protection wise, it does a good job! my forehead is the area that is the most prone to getting tan and it looked quite even toned after 3 weeks of consecutive use. one of my most favorite sticks (😏)\n\n**rating** : 4.5/5 and lets seeee\n\n* **Neutrogena beach defense sun stick water + sun protection SPF 50+**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs 1260 for 42 g (got it at Rs. 900 from amazon)\n\n**for skin types** : honestly, none lmao. I used it as a body stick most of the time with how oily this was. but can be used by anyone ig\n\n**texture and appearance** : whitish yellow stick. has a fruity kind of smell. really oily and greasy on first application that doesn't absorb or goes away after a while.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Polyethylene, Isohexadecane, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Ozokerite, Paraffin, Synthetic Beeswax, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Neopentyl Glycol Diisostearate, Dimethicone, Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Fragrance, BHT\n\n**filters** :\n\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n\noof this was an impulse purchase that I regretted later on. mind you, this is a great sunstick for your body but definitely not for your face . not to mention its waterproof . but the tapti garmi really just melts everything in its way and this is no exception. bhai itna chip chipa lagta hai i dont even feel like putting this on just because of the MoIsT feeling it gives. unless you're going to a pool or beach (as it suggests duh) , if you're okay with feeling like [that peanut butter baby](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.ie%2Flife%2Ffamily%2Fthis-peanut-butter-baby-is-sure-to-brighten-up-your-day-31499579.html&psig=AOvVaw0Qc7SXcD436wP5Ywrn_yJv&ust=1678212392776000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCIDzt77yx_0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) , then you can give it a try. it  does provide a good amount of product for the price and is a solid waterproof one fosho. but nahi jhela jata for some reason 😣😣😫\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\nme after buying and trying all of these to find my HG\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zzjpjrbly9ma1.gif\n\nbut it was fun doing this in a span of a few years and I finally got one that fits all my boxes . the BOJ one is seriously godsent for me ✨✨~~lets just ignore that it makes my wallet cry every time I buy it .~~ But id rather spend more on stuff that works than just hit and trials lmao. also I've gone past my obsession on using sun sticks as a whole since they require quite a lot of pressing while applying and the application just irritates my acne a lot 😫 imma finish the ones I have but I have no intentions on buying anymore from any brands (even though the minimalist and earth rhythm ones look good 🤡)more reviews to come! ill be doing one on stuff my dad will be bringing from the U.S in the next few weeks so do let me know if you'd like a follow up on those too! (~~why do i treat my posts like a sitcom😭).~~  and as always, any other questions, comments are always welcomed and so are dms!\n\nbyeeee 💖💖",

I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n   \n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte      Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable      UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB      filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV      filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB      mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change",

    "body": "Just a little about my skin type and areas of concern. I am 40 years old with skin that is very, very dry especially on my cheeks and forehead.  I also have red patches on  my cheeks and my chin that vary in intensity depending on what’s going on with my skin.  When my skin is happy the redness is so faint that I barely need makeup, when my skin is pissed I look and feel like I have a sunburn.  My skin is VERY fussy, but a random kind of fussy that makes me very nervous about trying out tons of new products since I never know what is going to set my skin off.  It will react to an ingredient in some instances but not others, for instance it loves the Klairs scented toner but will react really poorly to other products with citrus oils.  I try to stay away from most alcohol, dimethicone and anything with heavy artificial fragrance since those seem to be the consistent things that make my skin most unhappy.  My skin is quick to let me know when it doesn’t like something and reactions range from small, itchy breakouts to full on blood red/burning reactions.  Thankfully it’s also quick to forgive and recover as long as I immediately stop whatever the offending product is.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nDespite all of this, I decided to take a chance on Gothamista’s Box of Holiday Skincare Wishes since the products seemed like they would suit my skin, plus it was such a good deal!  I also splurged on several items from Soko Glam plus one ill-fated Amazon purchase, so I thought I’d give little mini reviews!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**I'm From Rice Toner**\n\nObservations:  This toner is watery in texture and milky in color with zero fragrance.  You have to shake it up a little before using since there is separation.  It sinks in quickly and doesn’t leave any stickiness.  The bottle is a fairly generous amount, and even though I’ve used it almost daily in both my morning and evening routines, there is still plenty of product left. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nVerdict:  I immediately fell in love with this toner!  I noticed brightening effects within a week, and it also seemed to make a huge difference in the redness of my cheeks/chin.  When I use 2-3 layers of this, my skin feels calm and beautifully hydrated.  I also love that there is no scent to it!  Will definitely repurchase.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n**Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF50+ PA++++** \n\n\nObservations:  The texture of this was surprisingly pleasant, almost like a lightweight day moisturizer as opposed to a sunscreen.  There is a very faint scent to it, kind of a citrus type thing, but doesn’t smell like alcohol or that typical “sunscreen” smell.  There is zero white cast, and I have found that this manages to be moisturizing while also being cosmetically elegant.  I didn’t observe any pilling or greasiness while using this.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nVerdict:  I need to use it a few more times before I can really come to a will/will not repurchase decision, but it seems to be good so far with no breakouts, irritation or clogging!  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n**I’m From Honey Mask** \n\n\nObservations:  This mask has a gorgeous scent, almost like caramel but without being sickly sweet!  The texture is thick and easily spreadable (a little goes a long way), while also managing to stay in place and not be drippy or runny.  It doesn’t ever dry down, so it’s very comfortable to wear even for an hour or longer.  It rinses off easily, especially if you do it in the shower.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nVerdict:  I was nervous about this mask since I’ve had issues with honey products in the past, but this mask is so comforting and a pleasure to use.  I like to put it on when I first wake up (after washing my face) and leave it on for an hour or so while I drink my coffee and get ready for work.  I leave it on for my whole shower to keep my skin from drying out from the hot water, and then rinse it off right towards the end.  My skin is always soft, intensely hydrated and glowing afterwards with no irritation, redness or breakouts.  Will absolutely repurchase if I run out before the winter is over.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n**Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream** \n\nObservations:  This is the 1st time I’ve gotten the 60ml tube as opposed to the 30 ml jar.  The tube is SO much easier to use and I find myself reaching for it a little more than when I purchased it before in jar form.  It’s fragrance free with a texture that seems to be about half gel, half cream.  I find that it seems to sit on top of my skin rather than sinking in.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nVerdict:  This is the second time I’ve purchased Klairs calming cream during my AB journey.  I can’t say that I am super blown away by it, I’d love to use it as a day cream but it’s not hydrating enough for me.  In fact, it also seems to dry out my cheeks a bit.  It is decent to have around as a spot treatment for my cheeks and chin when they are very flushed, but I think I’ve finally determined that the Soon Jung Cica Balm might perform better for me as a calming aid.  Probably wouldn’t go out of my way to repurchase unless it's part of a gift set.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n**I’m From Vitamin Tree Mask** \n\n\nObservations:  This is a truly interesting mask.  The texture is a very thick paste and isn’t quite as easy to spread/apply as the I’m From Honey.  You have to be more generous with application due to the thick texture, since it has a tendency to skip over areas during the spreading process.  It does have a very natural, earthy smell that I didn’t mind, but may bother some people, kind of like a cross between cut grass and vegetable soup.  You need a little bit more elbow grease to wash this one off, and I found that little bits ended up in my eye.  I highly recommend washing it off in the shower.  You have to store this mask in the fridge, so it’s a little less convenient to use unless you do your routine close to the kitchen or have a skincare fridge.  While it doesn’t dry down completely it does dry out a little bit, but not an uncomfortable amount to where you can't move your face.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nVerdict:  I’ve only used this mask 4 times so I don’t know that I’ve had enough time to form a full opinion about it, but will say that it doesn’t irritate my skin or cause any issues.  My skin did feel smoother after using it, but I don’t know that I noticed any major brightening afterwards.   Probably won’t repurchase.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n**Benton Cacao Moist and Mild Toner**\n\n\nObservations:  This is a very light, watery toner with zero fragrance (sorry to disappoint you chocolate lovers!).  It is easily layerable and I’ve found it to be very gentle.  It plays nicely with other toners when used in the 7 skin method.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nVerdict:  If you are a fan of the Soon Jung toner, then you will likely like the Benton as well.  While this is gentle, hydrating and my skin liked it, I probably won’t repurchase simply because Soon Jung is a better value for the same performance.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n**Neogen Rose Cleansing Water**\n\n\nObservations:   It’s very generous bottle for the price point, and my first bottle lasted me at least 4 months.  While I typically try to stay away from scented products where I can, it’s hard to resist this one since it smells like fresh roses.  The scent is pretty strong so if you’re not into that, you won’t like this.  There are real rose petals in the bottom of the bottle, which is fun when the bottle is full and annoying when the bottle is nearing the end and you’re trying to get the product to come out but they clog it up!  It does a really nice job of sweeping away makeup without being irritating.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nVerdict:  This is actually my second bottle of this cleansing water, but I really love it!  I am unable to use oil cleaners, so this is part of my nightly 2 step cleansing routine.  I start with the Neogen Cica Cleansing Foam, then use the cleansing water to catch any rogue makeup.  In my experience it’s very gentle and doesn’t irritate my skin at all.  Will repurchase.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n**The Plant Base Time Stop Collagen Ampoule**\n\n\nObservations:  Very thick, amber colored ampoule that is fragrance free.  I absolutely love the dropper packaging it comes in, and it always dispenses the perfect amount of product.  The texture almost comes across as a light facial oil without being greasy, and it sinks easily into the skin.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nVerdict:  This ampoule kicks the ass of the Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair serum both in performance and price point.  I was shocked at how much of an immediate difference this made in my skin when I started using it.  I’m a month in now and the fine lines near my eyes have definitely plumped out, as have the lines near my mouth/forehead and my skin is GLOWING.  Will definitely repurchase!\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n**Soon Jung Cica Balm -Panthensoside 5**\n\nObservations:  Thick, creamy texture with zero fragrance.  Melts nicely into the skin and spreads easily.  Performs decently under makeup if you give it enough time to dry down a little, but I prefer using it at night.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nVerdict:  I’ve found this balm to be a nice tool in my skincare kit for spot treating my skin when it’s irritated, and for me it performs a little better than the Klairs Calming Cream, and at a better price point.  I definitely notice improvements in redness and texture after using.  Probably will repurchase, although this current tube should last me awhile.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n**Soon Jung Sleeping Pack-Panthensoside 5**\n\n\nObservations:  The texture is thick but silky without having that gross oily silicone feeling that I can’t stand.  It spreads easily, and if you give it a couple of minutes before laying down, it does seem to sink in and cause less pillow transfer.  No fragrance.  It has a weird twist cap that makes getting the product out a bit difficult, but at least you won’t over apply I guess?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nVerdict:  I had given up on the idea that I would ever be able to use a sleeping pack until I found the Soon Jung.  Most packs seem to be loaded with dimethicone, which my skin hates, and/or are loaded with fragrance and other stuff that majorly pisses off my skin.  This pack is an absolute dream to use and I fully credit it for being the thing that turned my skin around this winter since I wasn’t waking up with dried out skin, so it had a fighting chance of starting the day off right.  It feels like a hug for your face when you put it on at night, and I wake up with the softest, calmest skin.  I even like to use it on my lips after I apply toner and lip balm to them, and my lips have never felt better.  I was worried this may clog my pores, but I’ve gone a month now without any issues.  I’ve only skipped using it a couple of nights and immediately paid the price the next day when my skin felt dried out by lunchtime.  After a week I ordered a second tube to keep in my Smaug skincare stash since I don’t want to be without it this winter! Will repurchase forever!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n**The Plant Base Waterfall Moist Balanced Hyaluronic Acid 100**\n\n\nObservations:  Ampoule is fragrance free and has a thick, clear gel texture that spreads easily on the skin.  If you apply it towards the end of your routine, it's very sticky and will pill up, but I had success applying it first thing.  Just like the Time Stop ampoule, it comes in a really neat dropper packaging that easily dispenses the right amount of product.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nVerdict:  At first I was so disappointed in this ampoule that I was close to giving up on it.  It was causing my other skincare and makeup to pill up when I would attempt to apply it like a typical ampoule towards the end of my routine.  I finally figured out the secret to using it, which was to take a pea sized amount and gently press it onto my still wet face as soon as I stepped out of the shower in the morning.  Total game changer!  This makes my face feel so calm and hydrated, and stops that instantly tight feeling that usually happens when I get out of the shower.  It works beautifully when used with the 7 skin method.  Will repurchase!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n**Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Sheet Mask**\n\n\nObservations:  Mask comes in two pieces and is heavily fragranced with tea tree.  The essence in the mask is clear and slightly thick.  The fit of the mask worked decently for my face, and the texture of the mask itself was fairly comfortable.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nVerdict:  I don’t know what is supposed to be calming about this sheet mask, because not only is it a complete pain in the ass to get out of the package and unfold, but it smells like turpentine.  It also made my face feel like it was on fire after I took the mask off.  When I woke up the next morning, my skin looked irritated and I had a pimple on my cheek.  Will not repurchase.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n**Klairs Freshly Juiced Vitamin E Mask**\n\n\nObservations:  Interesting texture!  It starts out almost as a jello type texture, but immediately melts into the skin when you start rubbing it in.  It smelled heavily of lemon oil, in fact I may have said “Oh God, this smells like Pledge” when I opened the jar.  If you have sensitive or reactive skin, this is not the product for you.   \n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n\n\n\nVerdict:  Have you ever opened a skincare product and known immediately you shouldn’t have put it on your face, but did it anyway?  There were so many glowing reviews online, plus my skin loves the Klairs toner, that I figured it would be fine.  But dear readers, it was not fine.  Not only did this cause a slight burning sensation, but I woke up with two big pimples and redness on my cheeks and chin the next day.  I gave it to a friend who absolutely loves it, so at least it didn’t go to waste!  It’s a shame, I really loved the texture and it also made my skin feel hydrated, just irritated.  Will not repurchase.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n**Benton Cacao Moist and Mild Cream**\n\n\nObservations:  Before I get into my observations, I must note that I got this from Amazon.  I don’t think it was a fake, but I wonder given that it smelled heavily of alcohol, which is not something that is noted in any reviews of this cream I’ve seen online.  I’d be interested to hear from other people who use/like this cream if that’s typical or not.  The texture was fine, just like any other typical lighter weight cream, and it spread easily on the face and sank in nicely.  There was a cooling bordering on burning sensation that I didn’t like AT ALL after application.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nVerdict:  This was my biggest disappointment, especially since I was looking for a good basic day cream.  My skin absolutely HATED it, which was surprising given that it likes the toner in this line and also loves the Steam Cream.  I tried to use it for a week, and started getting redness in my cheeks and bumps/breakouts where I normally don’t get them.  My skin also looked greasy by the end of the day, which is hilarious given that my skin is normally so dry that I often use facial oils during the day under my makeup just to keep hydrated, and even that doesn’t make me look oily.  As soon as I stopped using it, my skin texture became smooth again and the breakouts/bumps are starting to heal, so it was definitely the cream.  Will not repurchase.\n\n",

My skin doesn’t like coconut oil, especially not too high up on the ingredients list, and I also tend to stay away from products with seaweed, algae or carrageenan, after breaking up from Hanskin’s hylauronic essence. \n\n\nOne day I will try it.

And on blackfriday I repurchased it again for the third time but in the 60ml version. To be honest I kinda regret my third purchase because the cream is alright for the day although I get dry patches, but it is nowhere near enough for as a hydrating moisturizer to help the skin barrier recover.\nGotta say it is good for inflammation tho!

Lo and behold, never broken out like that or that badly again ever after this one use. \n\nSo strange though as some people seem to rave about that mask quite a bit.

The I'm From Honey mask is perfect for alleviating dryness in the winter or sunburn in the summer! I'm not so sure about the Vitamin Tree mask; I don't really find much of a difference after using it. The Rice Toner though has been very softening and I only need to use a few drops to make my skin feel hydrated.\n\nI avoid silicones in my skincare as well unless it's in a well researched product (CeraVe, LRP, Avene, etc.).

    "body": "Hello Everyone!\n\nI wanted to share a few short reviews of some AB Hair products. I don't see a lot of hair talk on here, so thought I would add some reviews. I would love to see other people's reviews on hair products. :)\n\n[Deep Conditioner, Shampoo Brush, Scalp Essence, and Styling Wax](https://preview.redd.it/jxsbjdmqg7811.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8fa1e18447c09eb79feb82246301255d9da84e7b)\n\n**My Hair Background**\n\nHair texture: Wavy, Fine\n\nHair Type: *Dry*\n\nHair Health: *I am starting to get gray hair. I got my first one not too long ago. Split Ends are taking over my hair. I used a temporary color over 6 months ago that has washed out. My hair was virgin before the temporary color, but I don't know if I can still call it virgin since the color wash.*\n\nScalp Concerns: *Extra dry and sensitive, psoriasis.*\n\n**Too Cool For School Egg Remedy Hair Pack**\n\n[Too Cool for School Egg Remedy Hair Pack](https://preview.redd.it/igz4eiczg7811.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8aa9cee3e449a134de056a38e76ba904e542f03f)\n\nI bought this for the protein. It was $10.99 on Amazon.  It is a deep conditioner treatment meant to be used 1-2 times a week. It is for repairing hair. It not recommended for normal hair, or protein sensitive hair.\n\nScent: *Sweet like milk and honey*\n\nTexture: *Thick and creamy*\n\nCurly Girl Method Approved?: *No*\n\nSilicone Free?: *Nope, contains* *Dimethicone, Amodimethicone, and Cyclopentasiloxane*\n\nAlcohol Free? : *No, contains Isopropyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, and Stearyl Alcohol*\n\nAfter one use, my hair is softer and feels smoother. After using it, I put my hair in a microfiber hair cap to air dry. My hair dried straight, instead of wavy. My hair looked more shiny and healthier than before. If you are looking to keep your natural hair texture, I don't recommend this product.\n\nSee full Curly Girl Method Ingredient Breakdown [here](https://isitcg.herokuapp.com/Home/Results/9TayIxixVkeoUwqp7FYTgw).\n\n**Shampoo Brush**\n\n[Shampoo Brush](https://preview.redd.it/ny21b01hl7811.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dd0af98c4e7cf87aa0286fa46ad5ad045b6c42de)\n\nI bought this, because I do a lot of co-washes. I wanted to still be able to scrub my scalp clean, even though I don't use shampoo daily. I picked it up at Daiso for $1.50.\n\nThe bristles are made out of a rubber. It doesn't snag my hair, and I am able to brush through without issues. The handle is comfortable. It looks questionable, but for brushing your scalp it is perfect.\n\nMy scalp feels great when I use it. Using it feels like a little scalp massage. I have been using it for a few weeks now. I have noticed that my scalp doesn't feel as \"tight\" anymore. I really think it is helping, and I am glad I purchased it. I love using it, and will continue to use it.\n\n**Edit:** I forgot to mention that the shampoo brush is easier on my arthritic hands. It gives my scrubbing a little more power and doesn't hurt so much. \n\n**A'PIEU Healthy Scalp Doctor Tonic**\n\n[Hair Essence](https://preview.redd.it/1553s3nrm7811.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3eef80ce12cd882561d123de6c0b13fdbc61d116)\n\nI bought this for my dry scalp. I got it from Jolse for less than $10.\n\nI have been using it for a few months. It is used to treat over-oiled, itchy, dry scalp, and hair loss prevention. It contains Salicylic Acid, Peppermint, Rosemary, Menthol, and Allantoin. It is meant to be used after drying hair every other day. The bottle has a misting cap on it . You mist it directly to your scalp and massage throughout.\n\nOnce applied, it instantly feels cool, probably from the menthol. It does help keep the build up down, and my scalp doesn't have as much dander fallout.\n\nI think this would be better for oily skin. I won't be repurchasing, because I feel like I can find a better product suited for myself. I will use it up, and then try a mist from Innisfree.\n\nI was not able to find the full list of ingredients in English.\n\n**TONYMOLY Make HD Hair Wax - Super Hard Matte**\n\n[Tonymoly make HD Hair Wax - Super Hard Matte](https://preview.redd.it/n5i87lbxq7811.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1dceca026f002ac0b7f8e0c10a3433cfd1462733)\n\nI bought this for my husband. He has short fine black hair. He has some thinning and grays. His scalp is oily, and he has dandruff. I purchased this from Jolse for less than $5.\n\nHe does not care for it, but he says it isn't so bad that he will throw it away without finishing it. It doesn't hold as long as it suggests. It holds hair for about four hours. It dries matte. It doesn't leave a white cast, or white flakes. The color of the product is slightly gray. It has a strong scent of talcum. I will not be repurchasing this one, because the hold wasn't strong enough.",

Normal is the operative word here because ain't nobody washing their face like actors in a commercial,that's clearly abnormal.\n\n🐳 **What works** : This was recommended by my dermat after a bout of eczema 2 years back and I absolutely swear by it. It's gentle,glides like a dream and doesn't make you feel taut. My ideal cleanser traits  basically match my romantic relationship requirements oof.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't**  : You can't rely solely on this to remove every last trace of makeup. Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n🐳 **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\n🐳 **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ✨ *manifestion* ✨ and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured. [I brought mine from this one.](https://instagram.com/_vivanka_chennai?igshid=5brie36vc4w2)\n\n\n\n🔵 **TONER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **DermaFique All Important Toner** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260\n\n🐳 **Application** : I got this transferred into a mist spray bottle because I quite enjoy the feeling of being spring irrigated. So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\n🐳 **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\n🔵 **SERUM** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (⚠️ensure the dropper doesn't touch your face⚠️) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n🐳 **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\n🐳 **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\n🔵 **MOISTURIZER** 🔵\n\n🔹**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice; Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\n🐳 **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\n🔹 **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\n🐳 **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔵 **SUNSCREEN** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\n🐳 **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\n🐳 **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\n🐳 **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you! Rest your eyes for a bit,it did endure quite a bit of a strain with this one :P",

It was a recommendation from a Thai friend, apparently it’s super popular in SE Asia. It’s manufactured by the same parent company and has a similar ingredient list with Bifida Lystate as the 2nd ingredient. \nThe only con for me is that it has alcohol in it. But if you’re ok with it then it’s a super good serum for like 1/4 the cost of ANR.",

    "body": "I'm back with another review of a product I don't see too often around here! In case you missed the previous reviews, here are [Tosowoong Apricot Seed Cleansing Oil] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/7u2j65/review_tosowoong_apricot_seed_cleansing_oil/) and [Benton Honest TT Mist] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/7trt3u/review_benton_honest_tt_mist/). As always, questions and criticism about the reviews are welcome!\n\n**Missha Near Skin Total Ceramide Cream**\n\nIf you know me, then you know that finding a good moisturizer has been the bane of my existence. I've tried Nivea Soft, Cosrx Honey Ceramide Full Moisture Cream, Holika Holika Skin & Good Cera Super Cream, and FAB Ultra Repair Cream, all within the past few months, and none of them have felt right for my dry, acne-prone, and sometimes dehydrated skin. Nivea Soft changes its ingredients depending on the country, and with the amount I move, I don't want to patch test every time I buy a new tub. Holika Holika was good, but a bit sticky, and I'm wary of the botanical extracts in the reformulation. Cosrx was too greasy, while FAB was too dry. It's a veritable Goldilocks and the Three Bears situation but with moisturizers instead of porridge. \n\nEnter my \"just right\" moisturizer: Missha Near Skin Total Ceramide Cream. This is the first moisturizer I'm actually happy enough with to repurchase, and that says a lot about what a great product it is. \n\n**Packaging:** I'm a sucker for Glossier's minimalist white and millennial pink vibe. So it's no surprise that I love the packaging of the two Missha products currently on my shelf. The Total Ceramide Cream comes in a 50ml white metal tube with a small plastic screw-on cap and black text. It would probably look starkly medical if it weren't for the pink bands near the end of the tube that make it vaguely minimalist chic. Do I purposefully nestle this product between my Milky Jelly Cleanser and my pink and white Missha sunscreen? Absolutely. \n\nAesthetics aside, the tube is actually one of my least favorite things about the cream. While it's a nice size, and I appreciate the fact that it's not plastic, it's like a tube of toothpaste in that it flattens out the more you use. I still have about half a tube left to go, but I expect it'll be difficult to get every last drop of moisturizer out. I also have read some reviews where people's tubes ripped open when they got bent. I have a trip coming up in two weeks, and will be interested in seeing how it fares in my carry-on.\n\n**Ingredients:** A cosDNA analysis of this product shows it to be relatively clean. The three acne triggers that pop up are Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, and hydrogenated vegetable oil, which rate 1, 2, and 3 respectively. As for good things, the cream contains three different types of ceramides: Ceramide 3, Ceramide 9, and Ceramide AP, as well as shea butter and meadowfoam seed oil, all of which are towards the top or middle of the ingredients list. So as long as you have no sensitivities with any of the ingredients, this should be a pretty good moisturizer for anyone with dry skin or who is trying to repair their moisture barrier. \n\nOne really interesting thing about the Total Ceramide Cream is that is contains Maltobionic Acid, a PHA. PHAs are chemical exfoliants that are supposedly as effective as AHAs, but without the sensitizing effects, due to their larger molecular structure ([Source](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/exfoliant/polyhydroxy-acid.html)). So theoretically, this cream should have some brightening properties, just like an AHA. I was definitely worried trying this out, because even though PHAs are gentle, the idea of putting any kind of chemical exfoliant into a product marketed for people with compromised moisture barriers made me wary.\n\nHere is the full ingredients list as printed on the side of the box: \n\nWater, Glycerin, Caprylic ICapric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Olivate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Sorbitan Olivate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Ceramide NP, Phytosteryl/octyldodecyl Lauroyl Glutamate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Phytosphingosine, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide AP, Carbomer, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Maltobionic Acid, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Tromethamine, Lecithin, Trideceth-10, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium EDTA, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n**Price:** $14 on Jolse, which works out to about 28 cents per milliliter, making this the second least expensive moisturizer I've tried thus far. \n\n**Use and Performance:** The texture of the Total Ceramide Cream is unlike any moisturizer I've used before. It's closest to the pudding-like texture of the Holika Holika Skin & Good Cera Super Cream, but it's slightly stiffer, and a little less sticky. Its appearance is also a bit translucent--not as opaque as a typical cream, but nowhere near as transparent as a typical gel. \n\nI actually had a really difficult time with this moisturizer the first few days, and thought it was going to be a repeat of my Cosrx debacle all over again, where the moisturizer just sat in a greasy layer on top of my face refusing to sink in. I immediately started frantically googling PHAs and dry skin, because I react pretty badly to glycolic acid, and was worried that the maltobionic acid was the culprit keeping my skin from absorbing the moisture. In the end, I decided to stick with it and give the Total Ceramide Cream a slightly longer trial run before calling it quits.\n\n I'm very happy I pushed through though, because on the fourth day, my face finally stopped looking greasy as the cream sunk in and made my skin soft and moisturized. I think the difference is that I let my last hydrating layer dry down a bit more than usual before applying a facial oil or Stratia Liquid Gold followed by the cream. It might have also been just a weird weather-related fluke, but I haven't had any problems since then. This product leaves me thoroughly moisturized, and it's very rare that I need to reapply it throughout the day, which I've had to do with other moisturizers (I'm looking at you, FAB). My skin definitely looks brighter, but I'm skeptical about chalking that up to the maltobionic acid when I've recently seen some really great progress on my acne and PIE with Finacea. So maybe it's the cream, maybe it's the azaleic acid. Either way, I'm just happy the PHA in the cream isn't getting in the way of its moisturizing abilities. \n\nIn terms of texture, there's no sticky residue left on my face, making it appropriate for daytime use. It leaves a dewy finish, which is perfect because I rarely wear complexion makeup but still like a slightly luminous effect. And speaking of foundation, the few times I've used makeup over the Total Ceramide Cream, I've had no issues with pilling. \n\nThere are a few drawbacks: we recently had a cold snap in the UK, and I found that I had to reapply this moisturizer a bit more than I might have with Nivea or Holika Holika. I've also noticed that if I go too heavy on the azaleic acid, it's not quite enough to help with the dryness either. So it's definitely not for extra dry days, but works well for my skin's usual level of dryness. I've also found it very easy to use too much of this product. I'm used to having to apply large amounts of moisturizer on my face to keep the dryness at bay. However, a little bit of this product goes a long way, and I went through like a third of the tube in only two weeks because I didn't realize I could get away with using less. \n\n**Final Thoughts:** Missha Near Skin Total Ceramide Cream is the first moisturizer that I will happily repurchase (rather than begrudgingly repurchasing Nivea Soft *again* because I can't find anything I actually like). My skin feels happy and moisturized using this product, and I love the way it makes my skin look dewy and fresh. \n\nThis is probably not the right moisturizer for you if your skin is very dehydrated or you're dealing with some exceptional dryness. It's also probably not going to be a good option for people with oily skin, given the dewy finish. However, if you have dry to normal skin and are looking to add some ceramides or a PHA to your routine at a relatively modest price point, then I highly recommend Missha Near Skin Total Ceramide Cream. \n\n**My Rating: 4.5/5**",

    "body": "So I always thought that ferments were a \"Asian skin care\" thing. But ever since getting some high end Western skin care as gifts, I noticed that many of them actually have a lot of fermented/yeasty ingredients in them.\n\nBut I can't find much on the \\~science\\~ or evidence behind why ferments can be good for your skin. But I also wonder, since ferments aren't really a thing that majority of consumers in the Western market are looking out for (like fragrance, rose water, coconut water, rosehip oil, fruit/veggie extracts that have label/experience appeal, but aren't necessarily good for skin), why would these huge companies bother putting ferments in their expensive skin care if they didn't have evidence that they do SOMETHING?\n\nI especially am curious because AB/Korean beauty are sometimes looked down upon as just being trendy and not using ingredients that are scientifically proven to be truly beneficial for skin.\n\nDo you think ferments are legit?

Fermenting antioxidant rich ingredients such as ginseng, green tea etc. breaks down the antioxidants/complex molecules that are beneficial to our skin into smaller molecules, which allows it to be absorbed into the skin easily. Not only that, yeast/bacteria ferments produce additional metabolites (AHAs, peptides) that provide additional benefits such as whitening, hydration, skin repair, you name it!\n\nEdit: forgot to put my favorite fermented product!! I love the Manyo Factory Galactomyces Niacin Special treatment. :) \n\n2nd Edit: here are the links to some scientific literature articles on fermented cosmetics which were found through PubMed! You do need access to the database if you want to read them in its entirety, but you can get some brief information on the topic just through the abstract.\n\nFermenting red ginseng enhances its safety and efficacy as a novel skin care anti-aging ingredient: in vitro and animal study.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23126662\n \nEvaluation of tyrosinase inhibitory and antioxidant activities of Angelica dahurica root extracts for four different probiotic bacteria fermentations.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254340\n\nSkin resistance to UVB-induced oxidative stress and hyperpigmentation by the topical use of Lactobacillus helveticus NS8-fermented milk supernatant.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28598022\n\nBifidobacterium-fermented soy milk extract stimulates hyaluronic acid production in human skin cells and hairless mouse skin.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12637786",

I'm not happy that Korea is and has been for years, swamped in pollution from the winds carrying it over. There is a lot of microdust and even people with resilient skin reported getting redness & severe irritation from the pollution. Everyone has to wear these giant masks, sometimes special ones, and limit their exposure to the world outside of their homes.*\n\n*So there has been a lot of push for soothing, calming products and \"clean\" ingredients. A lot more focus on repairing the skin barrier. So I'm excited about those, but not the fact that people have to suffer.*\n\n*I'll be bolding some of the soothing, repairing and/or skin-identical ingredients in the ingredient lists. I don't know every good ingredient, but I will bold the ones that I do know of. Some other beneficial ingredients as well.*\n\n*\\*Also got random pictures of the textures of the creams and the users who posted it.*\n\n*If you're interested in barrier repairing/replenishing as I am, here are some good quotes from Susan, from Swift Crafty Monkey blog:*\n\n>**Natural moisturizing factor (NMF)** is found within the corneocytes, and makes up 20% to 30% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum. It **consists of amino acids (40%), sodium PCA (12%), lactate (12%), urea (7%), ions (18.5%), sugars (like glycerol – 8.5%)**, and a few other things. These are water soluble [humectants](https://swiftcraftymonkey.blog/better-crafting-through-chemistry/) (meaning they draw water out of the atmosphere to our skin) that have a huge impact on the biochemical and mechanical properties of our skin. Having an adequate NMF level in our skin can prevent or reduce skin tightness, cracking, scaling, and flaking. It improves our skin’s plasticity (thanks to the interactions of the amino acids with keratin) and helps maintain skin’s barrier properties.  \n>  \n>**Filaggrin** is a really important protein found in our skin! ...When we are in more arid climates, the filaggrin breakdown increases to produce more NMF. More NMF is a good thing!  \n>  \n>The contents of the NMF do more than act as humectants. The lactate and potassium can affect the pH and stiffness of the stratum corneum. The lactic acid stimulates ceramide biosynthesis and improves barrier function. The [hyaluronic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan) (HA – picture to the left) maintains hydration and structural integrity of our skin. It also interacts with intercellular lipids and regulates the mechanical properties of the stratum corneum.  \n>  \n>\\[The strateum corneum lipids\\] make up about 15% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum, and contain about **40% to 50% ceramides, 20% to 25% cholesterol, 15% to 25% fatty acids** (those with C16 to C30 chain lengths, with C24 to C28 being the most common), and **5% to 10% cholesterol sulfate**.  \n>  \n>Oils with **linoleic or gamma-linoleic acid** are always welcomed by our skin (like sunflower, sesame seed, borage, evening primrose, rice bran, and others), especially in the winter.\n\n**Squalane, beeswax, lecithin, lanolin** are also good skin replenishing ingredients. Shea butter is very soothing and moisturizing, as well as having a lot of antioxidants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TOP CREAMS**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. \\[Dr. G\\] Red Blemish Clear Soothing Cream - 4.22/5 (9,894 Reviews)**\n\n70ml/36,000 KRW - $31.29\n\nWater (Aqua/Eau), **Glycerin**, Butylene Glycol, C 13-16 Isoparaffin, **Niacinamide**, C 12-14 Isoparaffin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Pentylene Glycol, Vinyl Dimethicone, Caprylyl Methicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Panthenol**, Acrylates/C 10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Tromethamine, **Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate,** Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, **Beta-Glucan, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside,** Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Epigallocatechin Gallate, **Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid.**\n\n*This line from this brand is extremely well-known and popular in Korea.

    "body": "I have been LOVING the eczema lotion from Dermasil, but in a recent post about it, a few comments said they preferred other formulas. I guess I had fomo because today I bought the original dry skin treatment and the diabetics variety. \n\nI have been messing around with them this afternoon doing various tests, and what I am prepared to say isn't very profound but it might help someone else who is feeling fomo, SO....\n\n1. They're all good lotions.\n\n2. In order from what thickest to thinnest, they go Eczema, Diabetics', Dry Skin. In fact, it was during my comparisons that I had a realization. The two latter lotions have what I would consider a normal lotion viscosity, while the eczema lotion is more like a body butter. It's a lot thicker.\n\n3. As far as absorption goes, the eczema lotion was the clear winner. It almost disappears into the skin leaving the lightest of protective coatings (a feeling that I like). The other two eventually absorb but it takes longer for my skin to feel dry. The Dry Skin formula leaves the skin feeling completely bare, so if you want NO trace of lotion on it might be what you're looking for. The Diabetics' was in between.\n\n4. Smell. As far as I can tell, Diabetics' and Dry Skin have no scent at all. The eczema lotion isn't fragranced, but it does have the slightest bit of what I consider a weird smell. I like it though. Ha ha! And it doesn't linger at all.\n\n5. Long term use... I have no idea because I only used them for about *checks watch* 10 minutes. 🙈\n\n6. Only the Dry Skin formula lists dimethicone as an active ingredient at 1%. I don't know if that means the other two have less dimethicone in them (it's an ingredient in all three). \n\nAll in all, the eczema lotion is still my top favorite. The other two seem fine, and maybe some people would prefer a more liquid lotion! ",

Easy to spread texture for a natural, hydrated, shine-free finish leaving no white cast.\n\n*Fragrance free • Non-comedogenic • 50ml*  \nPrice- $499  \n \n\n**Ingredients**\n\n**Uvinul A Plus**\n\nThis Modern filter excels in protecting your skin from free radical and skin damage. Its Photostable nature provides continuous defence against the sun, while its excellent safety profile makes it perfect for all skin types, including the most sensitive. In the formula it not only promises potent UVA protection but also enhances the formula for broad-spectrum protection.\n\n**Tinosorb M**\n\nTinosorb M is an UV filter that revolutionises sun protection with its broad-spectrum coverage against both UVA and UVB rays, also provides even protection into visible (blue) light, Its dual-action mechanism not only absorbs but also scatters sunlight, offering unparalleled defence against the sun's harmful effects. Renowned for its photostability, it ensures long-lasting protection, maintaining its efficacy even under direct sunlight.\n\n**Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate**\n\nIt stands out as a UVB filter that effectively shields your skin from the sun rays. It's popular for its ability to prevent sunburn and protect against UV-induced damage. This UV filter is prized for its lightweight feel making daily application enjoyable without the greasiness.\n\nWater/Aqua, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Dimethicone, Ethoxydiglycol, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Diisopropyl Adipate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Isododecane, Pentylene Glycol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Acrylates/Polytrimethylsiloxymethacrylate Copolymer, Decyl Glucoside, Triethanolamine, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Propylene Glycol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Xanthan Gum  \n\n\n**Review**  \nSkin Type: Combination (Oily in T-zone), acne-prone, currently a bit dry due to acne medication  \nWeather: Pleasant, not hot enough to test sweat resistance  \nAge 25-30  \nTexture: Super watery in texture, close to the new Neutrogena Dry-Touch sunscreen.  \nApplication: for my skin, it blended easily, like a dream.  \nWhite Cast: My face is slightly darker than NC42 and most sunscreens leave a white cast including Minimalist SPF50. This left no white cast at all, I was pleasantly surprised.  \nWent out in the sun for an hour, no stinging/burning/tanning observed but that is too soon to judge.\n\nOverall: After application, it forms a slightly tight film which gives a glow to the face. I had slight barrier damage on my chin, it did not sting when I applied the sunscreen there but pilled after a while only in that area. I usually get sweaty on my nose post sunscreen application but that did not happen, it might be due to the pleasant weather. My skin feels slightly stretchy right now and lightly oily on my forehead  \nAM Routine today: Simple Moisturizing face wash-->.Cosrx propolis synergy toner-->Cosrx Vitamin C 23%-->Simple hydrating light moisturizer-->wait 5 minutes then sunscreen\n\n  \n**TL;DR**: I think I will repurchase this, it has great lab and human testing results, the texture and application seems great for summers for my skin and this is the first sunscreen which truly has no white cast for me. The last sunscreen to do this was Aqualogica which tanned me. (I don't mind tanning but it proved that it did not protect my skin). \n\nObviously YMMV but I hope this works for you. Feel free to ask any questions.",

I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!\n\nIngredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1.** \\[**BEPLAIN\\] Cicaful Ampoule - 4.34/5 (3,174 Reviews)**\n\n30ml/29,000 KRW\n\nCentella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyglycerin-3, Pentylene Glycol, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Sodium Hyalutonate, Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacilius/Rice Ferment, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Xantham Gum, 1,2 Hexanediol, Ethyhexylglycerin.\n\n*The few reviews I have read for this say that it absorbs fast, is pretty soothing, and some people state that it really helped their acne. The expectation seems to be that it's supposedly very good for acne prone skin. There are pictures of someone with pretty bad acne showing before and after pictures of their acne going away. (Korean skin care is more geared toward CALMING & SOOTHING acne than to go to war with it with drying treatments and whatnot. I guess because a large component of acne is inflammation?)* \n\n*Some people said it doesn't seem to do anything for them, sensitive types seems to like it a lot, that it absorbs quickly. They like that it's unfragranced. Some VERY oily types said they feel like their skin is a little bit more oilier when they use it and that it doesn't absorb well for them. It may be really popular due to Director Pi suggesting it as the #1 soothing ampoule in her recent video. I see Director Pi's name pop up quite a lot in reviews in general.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cvm5b0doc8731.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=75f5866f4847487e1271f277ff8db20353b394b0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. \\[BADSKIN\\] Collagen BOMB Hydrating Ampoule - 4.28/5 (5,002 Reviews)**\n\n400ml/24,000 KRW (400ml ampoule??!)\n\nHydrolyzed Collagen, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Water, 1,2 Hexanediol, Trehalose, Carylyl Glycol, Allantoin, Propanediol, Brassica Olearacea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Medicago Sativa (Alfalfa) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Capitata (Cabbage) Leaf Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Brassica Campestris (Rapeseed) Extract, Raphanus Sativus (Radish) Seed Extract, Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hyaluronic Acid.\n\n*Reviews for this basically say that this is ULTRA moisturizing. A little bit on the heavier side so oily skin may not like it, but all the dry skinned people seemed to really, really love this. It's cheap, very hydrating, absorbs well. However, a few oily people said it takes a little bit to sink in for them.*\n\n[BIG](https://preview.redd.it/d2pcet1rc8731.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e4fac533d2f3f52e206e338e85a10c33fc69df5)\n\nB I G\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. \\[Manyo Factory (Witch Factory)\\] Bifida Complex Ampoule - 4.21/5 (5,368 Reviews)**\n\n50ml/35,000 KRW\n\nBifida Ferment Lysate, Lactobacillus/Pumpkin Fruit Ferment Filtrate, Niacinamide, Butylene Glycol, Copper Tripeptide-1, Aureobasidium Pullulans Ferment, Panax Ginseng Callus Culture Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Glycerin, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Caffeine, Hydrolyzed Algin, Red Ginseng Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Methyl Gluceth-20, Epigallocatechin Gallate.\n\n*This is a very popular product. This and their Galactomyces Niacin Ampoule have been consistently on #1/somewhere in the top 20 list since their debut in 2012 according to Director Pi. This ampoule has been #1 for like forever from what I'm gleaming. However, their expiry is 2 years unopened, and 6 months opened.

    "body": "#Rant#\n\nUntil recently, i only used sulphate free shampoos thinking it would be much better for my wavy/curly hair but i always used so much of product (even after dissolving it in water and emulsifying in my hands), they never removed the oil one go either leading me to go for a second rinse which inturn wastes water and it took me so much of time to just shampoo my hair. \n\nI was fear-mongered HARD. I have tried so many sulphate free shampoos and never stuck to one, i was never impressed with any. So many of them i just ended up using on my body because i got bored of them and didn't like them. At first, i believed the \"sUlpHatEs aRe bAd fOR YoU' movie trop and then, when i got to know about the CGM, i got even more afraid of them (double homicide, if i may). But over the past year ive tried some shampoos with sls in them and i always noticed less hairfall.\n\nI have been concerned about my hairfall for years, ive lost the volume i used to have back in school and mom's comments on my hair is just the cherry on cake i need. I am trying my best to feel confident in the hair I have and not letting insecurities affect me yet trying to take care of them and reduce as much of hairfall as possible. \n\nI am, i think, loosing the normal amount of hair its just my brain telling me that I need to immediately rush to the doctor. Lowkey a triggering topic, tbvh. \n\nI am just thankful i started using sulphates again and i dont have any plans to stop. Plus sulphates are better for my oily scalp.\n\n#Review#\n\nPrice- Rs. 149 for 192.5 ml.\n\nINGREDIENTS: WATER SUM LAURETH SULFATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE, DIMETHICONE, FRAGRANCE, C177891/TITANIUM DIOXIDE, GUAR HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, NIACINAMIDE, CASTOR SEED OIL, MICA, COCO-BETAINE, SODIUMBENZOATE, SODIUMHYDROXIDE, HYDROXYCITRONELLAL, HYDROLYZED SOY PROTEIN, HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARETH-6, ACETIC ACID, PEG-100 STEARATE, TRIDECETH-10, TRIDECETH-S SALICYLICACID, LIMONENE, FUMARICACIO PANTHENOL BENZYL SALICYLATE, LINALOOL BENZYLALCOHOL, PENTYLENE GLYCOL AMODIMETHICONE, ALPHA-ISOMETHYL JONONE, CARSONER, GERANIOL, CITRIC ACID CITRONELLOL, COUMARIN, HEXYLENE GLYCOL HEXYL CINNAMAL, GLYCERIN, GLYCOL DISTEARATE (FLL CE552/).\n\nHairtype- wavy/curly, oily scalp, dry ends.\n\nHair care Products- khadi protein mask (once a week), aloe gel (whenever i feel like), livon (trying to finish it up).\nI have stopped oiling completely\n\nI recently shifted L'oreal Dream Lengths Shampoo (because of the rave reviews here) and i think I have finally found the shampoo for me (don't want to jinx). I get less hairfall, it emulsifies easily, i dont need to spend a ton of time rubbing it in to remove any sort of build up and I haven't noticed any dryness of my hair as such. I haven't seen any difference in curls either (NOTE: I dont follow CGM rigorously, i have just picked up a couple of steps that suit me).\n\nI shampoo twice a week, once a week i either do aloeing or apply the khadi mask (an HG btw). Then i wrap my hair in a t-shirt and also wear a satin hair bonnet while sleeping. I have almost stopped using hair ties and only stick to those huge-ass clutchers (clips). I dont use any products after shampooing because i hate the feeling. I'll just sometimes use livon to finish that up but i don't think I'll be able to before it expires.\n\nMy shampoo method- I take a little bit of a shampoo in a mug, add water onto it and pour it on my scalp ONLY. I dont wash my ends everytime i shampoo, like once a week is enough. \n\nStatus- WRP",

Mukti gold herbal hairwash - this shampoo is used by my whole family and my dad especially have seen a drastic change in his hairfall  and we used to have tresseme shampoo before this, bcuz of which we switched onto this herbal hairwash shampoo\n2. A homemade serum after wash (aloevera gel, rose essential oil, glycerine, rose water), this makes my hair smell heavenly nice. Only I use it \n3. Cold pressed coconut oil before hair wash - for 1-2 hr , only me and my mom do the oiling part.\n4. Washing my hair more often - 3 times a week\n\nNow I would like the share the mistakes I used to make which when corrected helped me in hairfall.\n\n+ oiling for long hours -  I used to oil my hair a night before hairwash day. But one of my friend told me that oiling for long hours is one of the major reason of hairfall. So now I make sure that I don't keep oil in my hair for more than 2 hrs.\n\n+ Oiling with the right oil - I used to oil my hair with dabur amla hair oil  after which I switched to pure coconut oil.\n\n+ Diet - I eat 2 soaked walnuts, 10 soaked almonds, 2 soaked anjeer, 2 cashews. I drink anjeer water with anjeer. I have been following this religiously for a very long time. And I believe this has helped immensely in improving my hair texture. \n\n+ Washing my hair after every 2nd day - I have noticed that after every 2nd my hair gets oily and itchy and if I don't wash it the same day. My hair starts to fall out. I sort of wash my hair at every alternate day.\n\nLet me know if you guys have any questions related to this. \n\nHAPPY TO HELP 😊",

Tried all of them out there, from cheapest to most expensive, but none worked for my hair. Cut to Biotique, and my hair got so smooth and shiny. Hairfall reduced tremendously. Hair growth got better, less split ends. Then I recently switched to other sulphate free shampoos, and no matter how less or more I apply, my hair looks so dead and dull. So, I don't care if Biotique is sulphate or sulphate free. I just know its gentle, and even if I use more, it never harms me. It always repairs my hair beyond my expectation (I suffer from depression so I can go for long periods without taking care of my hair) and makes them silky smooth and in no need of any extra treatment.

It's impossible to last without sulphates. Most CG shampoos also have milder sulphates because they're cleansing agents. Shampoos also tend to have polyquaternium which is a conditioning agent that builds up (certain kinds of Polyquaternium build up more than others). Without sulphates you won't get rid of the buildup and it will lead to poor scalp health. \n\nI use Pantene Lively Clean every once in a while (maybe once a month, twice in the humid summers). It's got \"harsh\" sulphates which strip my hair and scalp clean of all buildup. Unfortunately with really short hair you can't avoid getting shampoo all up in your hair. \n\nAs to whether sulphates cause less hairfall, I won't comment because everyone shair and scalp are different. I found a method that works for me and In glad you could introduce it to your routine too without much issue :) \n\nSulphates and silicones aren't necessarily bad. It's also important to remember that you lose more hair during high humidity conditions. That's normal.",

    "body": "Hi everybody! This is my first post in r/HaircareScience, so let me know if I need to edit anything. I wanted to share some tips I have compiled and tested out for keeping your hair dye from fading as long as possible. I don't have much as far as academic research for this one, but a lot of this can be inferred from what is generally known about cosmetology and how our hair structure works. I personally have long, fine, wavy hair that is naturally a level 4 (medium brown), which I color at home to a level 3 (dark brown). I use permanent color. I am not a professional in either hairdressing or any scientific field; I am merely an average consumer that is interested in science and invested in making my hair color last as long as possible. This post isn't going to cover \"natural\" ways to dye or lighten your hair, such as henna, honey, lemon juice, etc. So let's get into it!\n\n- The Hair Color You Choose -\n1. There is a hierarchy of hair dye types that indicate how long your color is supposed to last. You will get the longest lasting results from a permanent hair dye, which uses ammonia and peroxide to break open your hair cuticle and deposit color into your hair shaft itself. In my experience, this type can still fade a little bit, but it lasts the longest because it changes the composition of your hair. You typically will only have to re-dye the new growth at the roots of your hair in a month or two. This type of hair color is the only way (out of the formulas I am discussing) to lighten your hair, and is the most effective way to completely cover grey hair. It also is the most damaging, just FYI. The next tier below that is demi-permanent hair color. Demi-permanent color formulas typically use no ammonia, but they do use a little bit of peroxide in order to activate the formula. These typically will last on your hair around 28 washes and will fade a little bit with each wash. They can handle a hair color that is the same level or darker than your natural hair color, but will not really be able to lighten your hair. Grey hairs will be \"blended\" in with the rest of the color and may look slightly lighter than the rest of the color, like highlights. The peroxide is slightly damaging to the hair, but is less damaging than average permanent dye formulas. The last type of hair color formula is semi-permanent. This type of color does not use ammonia or peroxide, it usually does not have to be mixed with an activator, and works by depositing color on top of your hair shaft. It doesn't change the composition of your natural hair at all, so it doesn't really damage it. This is the type of formula that \"fashion\" colors come in, AKA unnatural, vivid colors such as pinks, purples, blues, greens, etc. It lasts the least amount of time because it does not alter your hair's composition.\n\nSo, if you are looking to have a very long lasting hair color, go for a color that is labelled \"permanent.\" This isn't really an option if you want a \"fashion\" color, but I have heard rumors on the internet that companies are coming out with demi-permanent fashion colors that would last longer than the typical semi-permanent hair dye on the market, so be on the lookout! Also, many brands of semi-permanent hair dye have more superior formulas vs. their competitors, so checking out reviews for how long a brand lasts can really help you pick out what brand to buy! Which leads me to my next point... \n\n2. Find a high quality hair dye to use. Your best bet is to have a licensed stylist dye your hair for you, because they have access to professional level hair colors that have a very high quality standard. That being said, I am firmly in team \"DIY or die\" so I will tell you my tips for finding high quality hair color to use at home, which is your next best option. I recommend skipping the boxed dye that you can find at any drugstore in the U.S. (Ex: L'oreal, Garnier, Clairol, etc.) These are formulated to apply to any and every person who decides to use them, which means they are formulated to be harsh in order to penetrate even the most coarse, resistant, and grey of hairs. A good chunk of people have finer hair, less or no grey in their hair, or hair that is not resistant to dye uptake, so these dyes are going to be unnecessarily harsh and damaging for those people. (Hair stylists also often claim that the ingredients in these box dyes are inferior in quality to professional brands. This makes sense; however I could not find any consumer or academic studies that definitively PROVE this to be true. It is safe to say that people who went to school and have a license to do hair wouldn't lie about this, I am just reporting what I have/haven't found.) Instead, go to a beauty supply store such as Sally Beauty Supply (a U.S. chain). These stores are geared towards salon professionals, rather than the average consumer, so the dye there is of a higher quality than box dyes. In these stores, you buy your preferred color and developer separately, rather than sold together in a kit, so you can choose the level of peroxide developer that you need to dye your specific hair type. To buy every item that you would normally get in a box dye kit, it is usually between $15-$25 depending on the brand and store. In my experience, these dyes do last much longer than boxed dye kits on my hair. Usually when I use a box kit, the color fades right away as if I used a semi-permanent formula, rather than permanent. I get a very long-lasting result (with less damage!) from professional level formulas, and I highly recommend using them if you are coloring your hair at home. If you are using demi or semi-permanent hair dye, like I said previously, you can look up consumer reviews online and see anecdotal evidence of which brands are longer lasting.\n\n- After-Care for Maintaining Hair Color - \nSo now you've either gotten your hair colored by a professional or experimented at home, you love your new color, and you want to keep it vibrant until you have to touch up your root regrowth. These are tips that I have found effective and are supported by many hair stylists.\n\n1. Water is your hair's public enemy #1. Avoid getting your hair wet as much as you can. This means: wash your hair as infrequently as possible, cover your hair with a shower cap or clip it out of the way when you shower on other days, wear a swim cap if you go swimming, and if you are caught in a rainstorm, use an umbrella or cover your hair with the hood of your coat. You may ask, \"why do I need to avoid water?\" Water has a neutral pH of 7. Your hair has an acidic pH, typically between 4.5 and 5.5. When your hair is healthy and in its preferred acidic state, the cuticles of your hair are laying flat and smooth. When your hair's pH is raised, (Like when your hair is coated in water) the cuticles raise up. Hair dye adheres better to your hair when your cuticle is flat, and it escapes when the cuticles are raised. It's almost like a doorway in your hair composition that the dye molecules can move through. In order to keep your hair color from fading, you have to avoid getting your hair wet.\n\n2. Heat is your hair's public enemy #2! Avoid letting your hair get hot in any way. This includes the obvious, damage-inducing forms of heat such as using hair dryers, curling irons, and hair straighteners. (To see how awful heat styling tools are for colored hair, check out this video from hair colorist Guy Tang: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUG1Rp2FzBk) This also includes sneaky ways that heat gets to our hair, such as washing it in hot water! In addition to water inherently facilitating color fading, the heat from washing your hair in hot water ALSO raises your hair cuticle. Like I said before, this gives hair color molecules an easy way to slip right out of your hair and down the drain. Instead, wash your hair in water that is tepid to lukewarm. Aim for water that is room temperature, or slightly cooler. The water doesn't have to be ice cold, but avoid any steamy temperatures. I know for some people this can be absolute torture. In that case, you can wash your hair upside down in the shower so the spray of water isn't directly hitting your body, OR you can wash your hair separately in the kitchen sink so that you can wear clothes to keep you warm while you rinse your hair. \n\nAnother way that heat can sneak up on us is when the sun hits our hair! When you are outside on a hot sunny day and you can feel the sun beating down on your hair, this can cause your hair to fade! Antioxidants in hair products (such as vitamin E) can give your hair a little bit of protection. There are hair products that boast UV protection, so look for those the next time you go shopping. You can also wear a hat to keep your hair from getting too hot!\n\n3. Healthy hair holds on to color longer. Just like I mentioned above, healthy hair means a flattened cuticle. Flat cuticles will intrinsically hold on to hair color molecules more effectively than raised cuticles. A good guide to follow for maintaining healthy hair is in the sidebar of this subreddit. Things you can do include: trimming off the split ends and damage in your hair, washing your hair less frequently, using heat styling tools as little as possible, using conditioning products such as hair masks and leave-in conditioners regularly, and brushing/combing your hair gently to avoid snapping your hairs off. \n\n4. Use products specifically designed for color-treated hair in your hair care routine. Look for shampoos that are sulfate free, since they use gentler surfactants that strip less color than sulfate based shampoos will. Shampoos and conditioners formulated for color-treated hair will typically contain antioxidants to promote hair color retention and protect hair from the elements, as well as ingredients that keep your hair healthy and make it look shiny, like proteins, oils, silicones, and plant extracts. At the very least, find a shampoo and conditioner that say that they are safe for color treated hair on the packaging. \n\n5. Avoid clarifying treatments or shampoos. These are formulated to strip mineral deposits and product build-up from your hair and scalp. While they are effective, they will take a lot of hair color molecules right down the drain with them. If you struggle with build up on your hair, it's better to avoid the things that cause build-up in the first place. Getting a water filter for your shower will help immensely with mineral deposits in your hair, so if you live in an area with hard water or well water, this can be a lifesaver. If styling products or conditioners build up on your hair, try to identify the ingredients that cause the issue. Find lightweight styling products without heavy waxes. Some people have an issue with silicones building up on their hair. If this is the case for you, you can avoid water-insoluble silicones such as dimethicone and amodimethicone in favor of water-soluble silicones that wash out of your hair easily, such as silicones with the precursor PEG in their name. If you prefer, you can avoid silicones in your hair care routine altogether. \n\nI really hope this guide helps some of you out there. If you have questions, I will try to answer them to the best of my ability, but like I said before, I am not an expert. Thanks for reading!\n\nCitations: \n\nCasse, L. (2016, May 18).

In an effort to save my hair, I have learned so much about hair care through research and hair care classes and I wanted to share all the information I’ve gathered!\n\n#Understanding Ingredients in Hair Care:\n\n##Surfactants:\nSurfactants are the main cleansing agents in shampoos. They often end in -ate or “glucoside”.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair. They often end in -entrimonium chloride, -quaternium, or “methosulfate” (note: if an ingredient says methosulfate after a word, it is an **anti-static** NOT a sulfate).\nAnti-static ingredient examples: Behentrimonium chloride, Cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-17, quaternium-22, Behentrimonium methosulfate, etc.\n\n##Ingredients to use with caution:\n**Note: this is NOT a list of ingredients to avoid, but to rather use with caution.**\n\nThat being said, there are some ingredients which I do try to avoid, such as formaldehyde releasing preservatives (Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, and Diazolidinyl Urea).\n\nCocomidopropyl betaine impurities may cause scalp irritation: https://www.healthline.com/health/cocamidopropyl-betaine#how-to-avoid\n\nCoco-Betaine to be used with caution (pg.6-12): https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/alkbet032014final_0.pdf\n\nCocomide DEA and cancer: https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/cocamide-diethanolamine-cocamide-dea-coconut-oil-diethanolamine-condensate\n\nSoyamide DEA irritates unless formulated to be non irritating (21): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581813486300\n\nIsopropyl alcohol or SD alcohol (Volatile alcohols drying in high concentrations): https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/good-alcohols-vs-bad-alcohols\n\nWitch hazel can be drying: https://www.healthline.com/health/witch-hazel-for-hair#safety\n\nTriclosan not recognized as generally safe by FDA: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan\n\nTriethanolamine toxicity: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/706639-TRIETHANOLAMINE-TRIETHANOLAMINE/\n\nPVP/VA mild skin irritation (15-16): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818309140719\n\nIsopropyl palmitate mild skin irritation: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isopropyl-palmitate#section=EPA-Safer-Chemical\n\nQuaternium-15 formaldehyde releasing: https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/quaternium-15/\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate only safe in low concentrations: https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/butylcarbamate_rr.pdf\n\nDMDM Hydantoin and formaldehyde: https://www.chemscape.com/blog/DMDM-hydantoin-shampoo\n(This is the ingredient that OGX got sued over)\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea and formaldehyde: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/701923-DIAZOLIDINYL_UREA/\n\nPolyvinyl acetate insufficient evidence of safety in cosmetic products: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/705158-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE/\n\n#How to use Silicones and Sulfates Properly:\n\nSilicones are great, as they do the following for hair:\n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair shaft, making hair easier to brush and detangle\n\n-Great heat and UV protectant\n\n-Seals in moisture, prevents dryness\n\n-Gives hair a shiny appearance\n\n-Softens and smooths the cuticle\n\n##Silicones to use only if using a strong sulfate shampoo regularly:\n\nThese are very difficult to wash out of hair, even with a sulfate surfactant:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone\n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone\n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone\n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18\n\n-Cetyl Phosphate\n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone -Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n##Volatile silicones:\nThese evaporate after 10 minutes to a few hours after application.

These are in basically every conditioner to reduce static in hair:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate (this is NOT a sulfate, it’s an anti-static)\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n#Sulfates:\n\n##Mild Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are best used to remove volatile and easy to remove silicones. They can only remove resilient silicones with multiple washes, unless paired with many different sulfate free surfactants (a shampoo that has 3-4 or these in their ingredients list):\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n-Sodium Cocoate\n\n-Potassium Cocoate\n\n##Sulfate free surfactants that can remove resilient silicones:\n\nThese can remove resilient silicones, but not on their own, so usually a shampoo will use a combination of 2-3 of these:\n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate\n\n##High Strength Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are technically sulfate free, but they are **just** as thoroughly cleansing as sulfates, so they can still strip hair dye. Best used for removing resilient silicones\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n##Sulfates that remove resilient silicones:\n\nStrong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones.

Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt’s best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the “feeling” of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this “protein overload” is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair. This just means putting a light weight oil on towel dried hair. I use the OGX coconut milk serum oil as my sealant:\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/coconut-milk-anti-breakage-serum-xlsImpprod2960061\n\n##Protein Products:\n\n**-Hask Keratin Protein Deep Conditioning

Hydrolyzed collagen, hydrolyzed wheat protein (5th and 6th ingredient)\n\n##I’ve included this product list more for myself because it is very hard to find products with varying protein types and sizes.\n\n##The above information about protein and sulfates was found on Science-y Hair Blog!\n\n#Ingredients for Scalp Health:\n\n##Aloe Vera Gel:\n\nAloe is a great natural scalp soother and also helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it’s wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

    "body": " This is my first review on here, so I'm still trying to find my style and all that but I hope to post more reviews in the future!\n\nAnyway, onto the product.\n\n**WHY I BOUGHT IT**\n\nI bought this based upon recommendations from this sub, where I have heard people rave about it, as well as over on r/SkincareAddiction as well. This was also recommended by Cyrille Laurent - he absolutely adores this moisturiser and constantly raves about it. If you don't know who he is, he's still fairly small on Youtube and Instagram and he has a Biology PhD, so his videos and content tends to focus on what is supported by science. I find him a really valuable source of information alongside LabMuffin, Dr Ginza, The Eco Well and Skinchemy. I was looking for a new moisturiser at the time and this seemed to fit the bill really well.\n\n**MY SKIN TYPE/CONCERNS**\n\nI have pretty dry skin, and I do tend to get quite sweaty from exercise as well. I'm prone to blackheads and clogged pores on my nose, and I also get some closed comedones on my chin. I'm sensitive to fragrance and essential oils as they tend to cause some stinging and and cause acne.\n\n**HOW/WHERE I BOUGHT IT**\n\nAs I live in the UK, this is available at Boots (basically a drugstore) for £19.50 for 40g, which is a little pricey but honestly not too bad as I didn't have to pay shipping.\n\n**HOW LONG I'VE BEEN USING IT FOR**\n\nI've been using this for 3 1/2 weeks, which I think is pretty much long enough for a moisturiser. I patch-tested this first as well.\n\n**INGREDIENTS LIST**\n\n*Water/Aqua, Glycerin, Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide, Cyclopentasiloxane, Squalane, Trisiloxane, Dimethicone, PEG-3 Dimethicone, Allantoin, Magnesium Sulfate, Butylene Glycol, Isostearyl Glyceryl Ether, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Succinic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Bis-Methoxypropylamido Isodocosane, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Tocopherol, Methylparaben*\n\nIt does contain eucalyptus extract, which could contain some fragrant components, however it is low down on the ingredients list - just something to be aware of if you have very sensitive skin and tend to avoid all fragrant extracts and hydrosols.\n\nThe eucalyptus extract is [reported by the manufacturer KAO](https://web.kao.com/sg/curel/ceramide_care/) as being able to boost the skin's production of ceramides.\n\nIt contains a pseudoceramide (*Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide),* which tbh I trust more than improperly formulated ceramides, as well as allantoin, a great soothing ingredient at a concentration of 0.5%. Squalane and tocopherol as well as the classic humectant glycerin are also included. This does contain silicones, which is something to be mindful of, however my skin really enjoys the texture of silicone-containing products and the smoothing effect.\n\n**SCENT**\n\nAs one should expect, not much scent aside from a slight chemical-ish scent which disappears extremely quickly.\n\n**TEXTURE**\n\nThe texture of this is very light and fluffy, yet slightly wet. Not liquid at all, so it is very easy to scoop out from the packaging. On your skin, as you apply it it quickly sinks in very smoothly and feels invisible on the skin. Not sticky at all (yay!)\n\n**EXPERIENCE/EFFECTS**\n\nI have seen a massive difference in the plumpness and hydration since using this cream. My skin is so much plumper and less dehydrated. When I wake up in the morning, my skin feels smooth and soft, practically glowing. Honestly, I'm not sure I could wish for more in a moisturiser - it goes above and beyond to do the job and keep your skin hydrated.\n\nIt hasn't broken me out, irritated my skin OR clogged my pores (a win in my book!)\n\n**OVERALL THOUGHTS**\n\nHonestly, I couldn't rave about this moisturiser any more. My skin has never felt so good - I didn't even realise how dry and dehydrated my skin was until I started using this.\n\nI would probably suggest this to dry and normal skin types looking for good hydration but a light and elegant texture. This might work for combo skin in the colder/drier months as well.\n\nThis is definitely a HG product for me - I'm not sure what other moisturisers could top this, but maybe I'll try some more one day.\n\n**10/10 - I recommend this product if you want a light and fluffy texture, fragrance-free, very hydrating, overall plumping effect!**",

    "body": "This is my second attempt at writing this post up. Oh boy. I want to explain to folks why it's important to know what your indie/handmade watercolors (or other art supplies!) are made of. Also why they're so similar to the more popular indie loves on this sub - perfume, makeup, and nailpolish!\n\nComplete with illustrative doodles, adventures in questionable paint, and safety advice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Do not EAT the paint!](https://preview.redd.it/feqp7w2997j71.png?width=3164&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9f83c18ee1c0b9c97e8073169a0929f91c08d64)\n\n**Image:** the background is painted using the professional watercolor brand Daniel Smith. The colors are pulled across the paper and are overlapping or layered. Here, I believe I mostly used a warm red called pyrrol scarlet (sort of like how tomato soup tastes), and the cool red-pink known as Quinacridone Rose. It's a color that feels elegant - floral or lipstick like. Watercolors are known for their translucency, and they feel like the paint equivalent of a gauze or mesh fabric spread over the paper. In the center, I sketched a paint tube with a label band. The inside of the band is painted using two colors from an indie watercolor brand called Greenleaf Blueberry, The pink and blue mix in the middle to make purple. I outlined the tube with a purple fountain pen ink. The rest of the is colored with white chalk pencil. The page includes my basic rules of paint safety - which I will type out below. \\[End of image description.\\]\n\nPaint safety rules before I continue:\n\n1. **Common sense: DO NOT** ***EAT*** **THE PAINT.** Really. Even though it's a lil bit tempting. We learned this lesson with playdoh.\n2. **Assume the paint or supply is at least mildly irritating.** This means if you aren't using finger paints (or children's paints), quit using your fingers directly. The majority of watercolor paints are low in their toxicity once they are in a paint format. But you never know when skin sensitivities can develop, and professional paints have more irritants than eyeshadows do. They can contain iron oxides, cobalt, cadmium, nickel, and other substances that you might react to.\n3. **Cover your paint and paint water so toddlers and pets don't drink it.** They're unlikely to become fatally ill from an accidental sip of watercolor water, but it's still likely they'll end up pretty sick to the stomach. Oil and acrylic paints can present an even higher toxicity issue. It's good to get in the habit of covering up supplies.\n4. **Look up the Studio Safety Basics for your medium of choice.** My recommendations are:  [Getting Your Shit Together: Health & Studio Safety for Artists](https://www.gyst-ink.com/health-safety). For Watercolor specifically, please see the website **Handprint**. It is by far the best, most thorough watercolors website period. It has almost everything, to the point of being a little overwhelming. For simplicity's sake, this section [here](https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/pigmt6.html#toxicity) is the part about \"health & environmental issues.\" For Acrylics, the brand [liquitex](https://www.liquitex.com/us/knowledge/safety-disposal/) has a simple guide. For Oil Painting, I had the opportunity to read Kimberly Brooks' *The New Oil Painting: Your Essential Guide to Materials and Safe Practices*. This is a very good book on minimizing toxicity in oil painting, avoiding an excess of harsh, corrosive, or flammable chemicals. It's also aimed at being solvent free. If you want to know eeeeverrryyything, then I suggest googling \"CPSC Art and Craft Safety Guide,\" which is the US Government's guide. Just remember, the dose makes the poison.\n5. **Practice Safe Disposal -** you'll find disposal advice for paint water or other supplies in any safety guide.\n6. **Have Fun!**\n\nNow, let me explain why I felt compelled to write some...let's say, advice about indie watercolors (specifically).\n\nIt starts with me wanting very badly to order some paints from a small \"indie\" paint maker, but wanting to y'know, pick some paints within a reasonable budget. It ends with a volcano. Bear with me.\n\nWhen you go to buy a watercolor paint in general, you need to know a few things about what you're about to purchase.\n\n**Things to consider when buying watercolors!:**\n\n* Do you care about how lightfast the paint is? That is, do you intend to sell any work you make, or will you be upset if your work changes color later? If the answer is yes, you care if the paint is lightfast.\n* Did the seller give the CI number - that is, the **Color Index Number?** It may look like something like this: PG7, PB60, NBk12, PR102 and so on. This tell you what Pigment (P) or Natural pigment (N) a paint is made with, plus the color - like G = Green, and then the specific *name* of that paint. So PG7 is Pthalo Green, and you can look up what Pthalocyanine Green is made from, how toxic it might be, how light fast it generally is, and so on.\n* If they gave the CI number, did they also give a lightfastness rating? If so, does it seem generally accurate to the rating of the pigment?\n* If they don't use pigments at all, do they use dyes instead?\n* For lack of better terms, are you trying to paint *paintings*, paint calligraphy, or use paint for highlights/coloring/to decorate crafts easily?\n* Are you looking for traditional Western or Eastern watercolors (gum arabic or glue binder, usually) or are you looking for non-traditional watercolors: the sparkly, glittery, neon, or calligraphy/shimmer water colors? Do you actually want to use opaque watercolors - that is, *gouache?*\n* What paint qualities are you looking for? Do you value mixability? Translucency? Granulation? Shine? Does it matter if the neon pink fades if you're just going to digitally scan it?\n\nPaint is like Perfume, Eyeshadow, or Nail polish! The formulas are basically the same:\n\nCOLOR OR AROMA + VEHICLE = YOUR PRODUCT.\n\nThe vehicle can include: base/binders, extenders, solvents/thinners, stabilizers/preservatives other things that determine the properties and longevity of whatever is being applied.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[All doodles painted in with the Greenleaf Blueberry CYMK paint set, and in a St. Louis Art Supply Handmade multi-media sketchbook. Description below.](https://preview.redd.it/558a6j97u7j71.png?width=1421&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d9ab8280610a6dcd952efca5366583d8d5bc131)\n\nSo this image is just showing you how things like paints are composed similarly to other indie faves:\n\n* **Watercolor** = Pigment + Binder (Gum Arabic in western watercolor. East Asian watercolors may use a glue binder) + humectant (honey, clove oil, etc), plasticizer (glycerin), and sometimes fungicide, dispersants, etc. Also water!\n* **Gouache** is opaque watercolor. This is achieved either by using colorless fillers, white pigment fillers, or a higher ratio of pure pigment to watercolor vehicle (considered the highest quality).\n* **Chalk Pastels** = Binder + Pigment + Clay or Chalk. Soft pastels typically don't have any chalk, and are just binder + pigment!\n* **Oil Paints =** pigment + oils + additives (student grade oil paints may have additional fillers, usually chalk/calcium carbonate; some may also have driers, thinners, etc).\n* **Perfume =** base carrier of oil or alcohol + aroma compounds (essential oils, resins, musks, etc) + may have water, preservatives, solvents, and fixatives.\n* **Eyeshadow =** Eye Safe Pigments + base of fillers (often talc, Kaolin clay, and mica) and adhesives (often zinc and magnesium), plus slip (like silica, dimethicone, or nylon) and preservatives. These could technically double as less pigmented/not light fast pan pastels, if you really want to use them up.\n* **Nail Polish =** pigment/dye color with a film-forming polymer vehicle, and the additions of solvents. May have some combo of stabilizers, resins, thickeners, and bishie sparkles.\n\nBut as we all know within these general bounds, there's a million different unique characteristics we can look for! I'm going to show some watercolor ones. I'm just going to copy images from Etsy, but please be advised that unless I state I personally tried the paint, I don't know if the company is any good or not! I just want to illustrate what things look like.\n\nTraditional \"western\" watercolors using earth pigments can look like this [Red Clover Meadow](https://www.etsy.com/shop/RedCloverMeadow?ref=simple-shop-header-name&listing_id=789259199) set:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Pictured: a watercolor set of 12 in muted earth tones of red, yellow, blue, green, and browns](https://preview.redd.it/esb0576zd7j71.png?width=340&format=png&auto=webp&s=f56eb287f0411efe7c473aec568a7546b3c60055)\n\nOr they can be brighter and more colorful traditional watercolors, like these [Beam Paints](https://www.beampaints.com/collections/all?page=1) paintstones (I haven't used this specific set, but I have used and loved Beam Paints!):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Pictured: 6 paint stones. Left to right, top to bottom: a vibrant pink-magenta, an orange, a pale opaque pink, a pale opaque yellow, a deep blue, and graphite grey. The middle two - which are opaque, are gouaches.](https://preview.redd.it/o6jwz5idm7j71.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=f33b0b1a81553298efa1fc8bcfdf6ca0eb6d5720)\n\nBut less traditional \"watercolors\" might be fluoro/neon like this [Playful Pigment](https://www.etsy.com/shop/PlayfulPigment?ref=l2-about-shopname) set.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[I Love the 80's 3D! Pictured: Neon green, blue, yellow, orange, purple, and pink paint swatches, a tin set of the 6 paints, and a cassette tape painted in neon.](https://preview.redd.it/vxqbx13ze7j71.png?width=340&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bc239e967130bd7a948a2fa2174f18a47ff5c51)\n\nKeep in mind: [Neon paints are almost never very lightfast.](https://doodlewash.com/doodlewash-review-neon-lumi-accent-color/) That's why Playful Pigment notes (helpfully):\n\n>Display out of direct light, and use acid free paper and UV protective glass or spray to prevent fading.\n\nOr perhaps you like a mica-based shimmer, metallic, or sparkle watercolor, like this [Rivervale](https://www.etsy.com/shop/RivervaleWatercolor?ref=simple-shop-header-name&listing_id=638667884) Paint:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Pictured: Ocean Blue Mica paint, which is quite opaque, and very shimmery.](https://preview.redd.it/22c2er9fg7j71.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=891a6fdc8e9892adb44a10f0abc722f0bcbcb6ed)\n\nI want to use this particular paint as a good example of useful paint information listed in the description for a non-traditional watercolor paint:\n\n>**Color:** Ocean Blue Mica**Pigment Color Index Name:** No official name, unaltered mica goes by **PW20**. Mica is a nearly colorless silicate mineral crystal that is usually formed of very thin plate-like layers. Powdering mica produces a natural glitter, and colored mica is usually created by coating mica particles with iron oxides or titanium dioxide. This mica in particular is described as colored by titanium and tin oxides, and Ferric Ferrocyanide.**Lightfastness:** \\- Good - II**Granulation:** Moderate**Translucence/opacity:** Opaque\n\nThis is great, because you know what you're getting!\n\nYou might see a highly granulating traditional watercolor, like from [Mashas Watercolors](https://www.etsy.com/shop/MashasWatercolors?ref=simple-shop-header-name&listing_id=885912882):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Picture: This Ultramarine Purple is a pigment mix, very granulating. It's a pinky-purple with a neat, almost bubbly effect. ](https://preview.redd.it/h2capjxvj7j71.png?width=340&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ecc5beadc56933f4bf4dcc9aa2c298b2e0899b8)\n\nPigments can be synthetic or natural - and they can be \"genuine\" minerals instead of synthetic counterparts. The most common swap in paints is the color *Ultramarine Blue*.\n\nGenuine Ultramarine is actually *Lapis Lazuli* and is one of the most expensive pigments around, because lapis lazuli is only mined in Afghanistan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This tiny half pan of Lapis Lazuli blue from Afghanistan is $163.70. Quite understandably, I bought Greenleaf Blueberry's CYMK seashell set for $39.50 instead.](https://preview.redd.it/e1k53zq3q7j71.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=eaf9276bb255d7b91bdbfdacd586669bc7218197)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday, we substitute with Ultramarine blue \\[[Colors of the Iron Range](https://www.colorsoftheironrange.com/individual-pans) example\\] which is PB29.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Pictured: Ultramarine Blue Extra Dark half pan. ](https://preview.redd.it/0ds3tfv0s7j71.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=1644c6292e9609767d802144890f18dd64d6c27a)\n\nWe actually substitute a lot of pigments in 2021. There's a good reason for this: substitutes can be much less expensive, many genuine mineral pigments are actually somewhat unimpressive (at least in watercolors), and sometimes we've got Other Reasons.\n\nWhich brings us to the aforementioned volcano I promised. I've been eyeing paints at this one specific shop, and I found they had an individual store front in addition to their etsy. I clicked over to their historical pigments.\n\nAnd then I let out an aggrieved sigh:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Image: Swatch of Cinnabar - Genuine Volcanic Mineral, a fiery blood orange. \\(god she's so pretentious\\). $45.00](https://preview.redd.it/24j59njew7j71.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0168789881a2089e4fa33245e3a9412be363305)\n\nLook, I want to explain to you what Genuine Cinnabar, or Genuine Vermillion paint *is* if you don't already know. I want you to understand that I don't inherently object to professional artists choosing to use Genuine Cinnabar paints - especially in oil painting. It's a gorgeous historical color:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Image: Roman mural painting at Pompeii's Villa of Mysteries. Figures standing and seated before a Vermillion red background](https://preview.redd.it/wgph2ic4z7j71.png?width=1594&format=png&auto=webp&s=40144359dfefb4b2ae8ee8eec88b4f85b6b524d2)\n\nBut Cinnabar is **Mercuric Sulfide**. Today we say \"Cinnabar\" for natural mercuric sulfide pigment, and \"Vermillion\" for synthetic mercuric sulfide PR 106, but they can be used interchangeably. The paint in question is not listed as synthetic PR 106, though.\n\nFrom the shop in question:\n\n>Cinnabar is considered to be toxic because it contains mercury. It's most toxic in its powdered form because it can be inhaled. It's not hazardous in a watercolor form because it's not a powder, but it still needs to be handled with care...\n\nLook, is this *probably* safe-ish to use so long as you don't drink it? Probably!  I know oil painters can use genuine vermillion, and not die, so I assume that watercolor paint is probably fine also if used responsibly.\n\nBut here's my big big problem: No pigment index is listed, so if this *is* genuine volcanic material, I have no way of knowing what *other* impurities are in this pigment. Impurities that make it prone to turning brownish black, and not the color you spend $45.00 for.\n\nAnd if we're just comparing with synthetic PR 106 -- it is, uh. Terrible in watercolor. Awful. It can turn ugly colors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Image: Handprint's Lightfastness test of PR 106 Vermillion. The bottom half has been exposed to sunlight, changing it from a bright colorful red to a muddy color.](https://preview.redd.it/s483y3qa08j71.png?width=140&format=png&auto=webp&s=646a21b275dcb98b7429a2d25afe0c23948e1caa)\n\nHandprint says this of Vermillion in watercolor:\n\n>Genuine vermilion PR106 is a **fugitive**, very opaque, heavily staining, moderately dark valued, intense [**orange red**](https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/palette1.html#orangered) pigment. The [**ASTM**](https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/pigmt6.html#bluetable) (1999) rates its lightfastness as \"fair\" (III), but in my own tests, which allowed for the heat of direct sunlight\\*\\*, I saw its muted scarlet fade to a horrid scabby brown after just two weeks of sunlight exposure ([**BWS 4**](https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/pigmt6.html#bluetable)), earning it a \"poor\" (IV) rating. Mercuric sulfide is also poisonous.\\*\\* In addition to these dubious virtues, it is **extremely expensive** ($31 for a 15ml. tube in 2004). \\[...\\]   The color is a bright, opaque scarlet red. **It is not a satisfactory watercolor pigment by modern standards because it is** [**highly toxic**](https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/pigmt6.html#toxicity) **(mercury will cause severe metal poisoning) and fugitive (it quickly withers to a dull brown in the presence of light).**\n\nBasically, I cannot recommend  spending $45.00 on this limited edition historical pigment. I can't recommend buying it in a set at Choosing Keeping by what is...basically the paint equivalent of not quite Indie, but Niche - [Vintage Watercolors](https://choosingkeeping.com/collections/painting/products/mount-amiata-natural-pigments-watercolour-set).  And I found other indies selling genuine cinnabar, or strawberry cinnabar paint.\n\nThis shop with the $45.00 paint sells some gorgeous colors and color mixes - stuff I *really* want.\n\nBut I don't know how to feel when you don't explicitly label **Chrome Yellow Light - PY34** as [Lead Chromate/Lead Sulfate.](https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/waterfs.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Chrome Yellow Light half pans and swatch](https://preview.redd.it/n6dw3ypm28j71.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d838c559e76c0edcf74fd6c028237e71ebef7e5)\n\nLightfastness was listed as \"Medium.\" But Handprint says:\n\n>Chrome yellow PY34 is an impermanent, semiopaque, heavily staining, very light valued, intense [**yellow**](https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/palette1.html#yellow) pigment, in hue most similar to hansa yellow medium. Formerly a widely used industrial pigment, it is offered in a very wide range of formulations by 20 pigment manufacturers, mostly for use in metallic coatings, ceramics and plastics; its use is declining because **it contains lead, a polluting and toxic heavy metal**. Note that the [**ASTM**](https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/pigmt6.html#bluetable) watercolor tests (1999) gave the chrome yellows an \"excellent\" (I) lightfastness rating, **while my 2004 tests put the Winsor & Newton paints in category IV (\"poor\"): the chroma faded by more than 20%.**\n\nWe replaced this pigment with Hansa Yellow Medium (PY79  *arylide yellow* ). We have a lead-free alternative. Why use lead? Especially if it's less lightfast?\n\nAnother color I admired briefly was labeled PO34. \"Lightfastness: Yes.\" I went to look it up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Image of a not-light fast, deeply faded orange color on the bottom half.](https://preview.redd.it/yu7r3d8v38j71.png?width=140&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7842bde87c9a6f094030dd8674191e11e9fa24)\n\nGoing through this made me sure I wanted to explain to other people what they might need or want to know before they bought Indie art supplies. Because you should be able to determine for yourself if that much color shifting is worth the price for you! Or if you want to pay $45.00 for  mercury paint that *might* end up going from red to scabby brownish color! Maybe that genuine Cinnabar had all the volcanic impurities tested for and removed and it's perfect! I want to believe that seller genuinely did do extensive lightfastness testing.\n\nBut I'm torn buying anything from a shop that uses colors that probably aren't as lightfast as claimed, and which use toxic historical pigments without consistently indicating they're toxic. I mean, *I* know what I'd be buying, but would everyone else?\n\nSo to summarize this excessively long post now, here's the top things I advise before you drop $$$ on watercolors or any Indie/Niche art supply. A Caveat Emptor, if you will:\n\n1. If the CI number is listed, cross reference [Handprint](https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/waterfs.html) or [Artist Pigment Index](http://www.artiscreation.com/Color_index_names.html). You can look up lightfastness, or toxicity this way. Even toxic paints can be used safely. If there's no CI, assume it's not very lightfast, but don't let that stop you from buying and enjoying the paint! Just don't assume the color will remain vibrant or the same over time.\n2. Remember the color name may not be what the color index says the *pigment* is!\n3. Understand that shimmers, metallics, duochromes, holos, glitters, neons, and so on are probably *unlikely* to mix with multiple other colors as easily as traditional western watercolors. That's not to say none of them will mix, but most are used primarily as single-colors, and the different characteristics mixing may present a challenge.\n4. A lot of \"genuine mineral\" watercolor paints, and even some \"natural pigments,\" are extremely weak pigments. It doesn't matter how much of that all natural malachite you have shoved in that tiny little pan - Malachite is a pretty weak pigment, and it *will* change color over time because it's malachite. Lac Dye is *always* going to need multiple layers to get the color you want. You get the idea.\n5. If you want to only purchase vegan paints, you will need to be extra careful when selecting watercolors of any kind. While gum arabic is vegan, honey is the most popular watercolor humectant because it's *extremely* good at what it does, it's historical, and people think it makes the paint perform better. You will need to research if a shop explicitly *avoids* using honey in their watercolor. Likewise, if you are interested in East Asian watercolors (most especially traditional Japanese watercolors, but I believe this may also apply to some traditional Chinese and Korean paints), be advised that they most commonly use animal glue binder.\n6. On that note: heavily honey-based \"wet\" or \"creamy\" paints may remain much more runny for longer when in humid areas (so be careful packing them up!), but will also remain wetter longer in very dry places. Many shops advise chilling the paints in the fridge or freezer upon arrival if they think the paint may be tacky or gummy.\n7. All paint in pans should be spritzed with water to activate before you try using them, or you may be super disappointed when you don't have to be.\n8. In perfumes, marketing descriptions are part of how you know what you're going to buy! But keep in mind when a paint description says (and shop omitted to protect the guilty): *\"Imagine a shiny Cadillac, a cloud of cotton candy and the feeling of going in a holiday 😄🌈 this is what inspired me this warm pink, perfect for blossoming flowers and sunset clouds.\"* This tells you diddly squat about: what's in the paint, how the paint flows, if it granulates, what pigments are in it, and if you can hang a painting you made with it in a sunny room.\n9. If you do not buy watercolor paper, you will inevitably be disappointed with watercolor. Stop doing that to yourself! To make a long story short, ***ignore*** how many pounds the paper is (150 lb doesn't tell you anything useful) and *only* make purchases based on the GSM weight. 300 gsm Cotton Rag is considered premium. If you saw the price of Arches and thought that was too much, don't worry. Bee Paper sells an affordable 300 GSM 100% cotton rag paper - $[9.48 for 25 sheets at Jerry's Artarama](https://www.jerrysartarama.com/bee-paper-rag-cold-press-watercolor-paper-sheets-and-rolls) in 6x9 inches. To prove my point about why the pound weight is meaningless, this is 140 lb paper. Or hey, buy indie art paper, or indie made sketchbooks!  Mixed Media paper is often okay with light washes of watercolor. Check to see if it can handle multiple layers or heavier washes.\n10. In general, buy a support/paper that makes sense for your medium of choice.\n11. Unfortunately, \"[Painters have no effective control](https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/pigmt6.html#toxicity) over \\[these\\] upstream environmental impacts \\[of pigment manufacture\\].\" There's very little ways to tell that all the pigments were sourced in an environmentally friendly manner. Certain things are easier to find, like ethically sourced mica! But you can't know where or how every pigment was obtained and processed.\n12. If it can be made, someone's made it indie, or small-scale niche as an art supply! Watercolor paints are hugely popular in small maker businesses. Some people also make and sell pastels, gouaches, oil paints, fountain pen or calligraphy inks, easels, pochade boxes, paint palettes, or sell unique earth pigments for making your own paints!\n13.

    "body": "Take a second to look through these photos. Can you tell a difference between the two sides? Which is which? The answer will be in the comments.  \n\nHopefully I got enough pictures with different lighting. These are all different stages of my routine in the morning.\n\n\nSCENT:\n\nIt has been mentioned in this sub that the DT serum smells like pee. For me it has a clean, neutral scent. I would assume those were bad batches. \n\nIf I were to compare the two, I think Kérastase smells better. It also has a pleasant scent that lingers on my hair for a couple hours. DT does not linger, probably because it’s so neutral.\n\nSecond opinion: \nI asked my boyfriend to smell it too without context, he has a more sensitive nose than me. He stated that it doesn’t smell bad, I asked him if it reminded him of anything and he said it doesn’t. I told him that it smells like a clean scent to me and he agreed. \n\nThen I explained the rumor about it on Reddit and he said:\n“No, it doesn’t smell like urine. I am well acquainted” (referencing my dogs lol)\n\nSo do with that information what you will, maybe he’s just being agreeable 😂 but rest assured, you now have two more opinions on the scent. I would say to smell yours before applying to the hair just in case. I’ll update this post if there are any changes as I use it.\n\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\nDollar Tree (from the bottle):\nWATER, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, GLYCERIN, PHENOXYETHANOL, POLYQUATERNIUM-37,\nPROPYLENE GLYCOL, CYCLOHEXASILOXANE, DIMETHICONE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, PEG-20 STEARATE, STEARTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, FRAGRANCE, C13-16 ISOPARAFFIN, TRIDECETH-6 ACOHOL, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) OIL, DIMETHYL STEARANINE, HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN, ARGANIA SPINOSA KERNEL OIL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, PANTHENOL\n\nKérastase (from their website):\nAqua / Water / Eau ● Dimethicone ● C13-16 Isoalkane ● Niacinamide ● Glycerin ● Polyacrylamide ● Phenoxyethanol ● C13-14 Isoalkane ● Laureth-7 ● Panthenol ● Ascorbyl Glucoside ● Butylene Glycol ● Linalool ● Hydroxycitronellal ● Benzyl Salicylate ● Benzyl Alcohol ● Hexyl Cinnamal ● Citronellol ● Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein ● Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone ● Coumarin ● Hydrolyzed Corn Protein ● Hydrolyzed Soy Protein ● Limonene ● Iris Florentina Root Extract ● Citric Acid ● Ci 19140 / Yellow 5 ● Ci 14700 / Red 4 ● Parfum / Fragrance\n\nOne notable difference in the ingredients is the addition of niacinamide in the Kérastase. Niacinamide is supposed to promote hair growth when used on the scalp. But if you are anything like me, I don’t apply serums all the way to the scalp, I start them from about the middle of my hair through the ends. \n\nBased on this, I do not believe niacinamide is especially helpful in the Kérastase. Niacinamide is probably more helpful in shampoos and scalp products (And now I’m tempted to use a certain DT niacinamide/squalane serum in my hair instead of on my face 🤣)\n\n\nPRICE:\n\nKérastase: $60/3.04 fluid oz, or $19/oz\n\nDollar Tree: $1.25/4 fluid oz, or 31¢/oz\n\n\nTEXTURE:\n\nI put these next to each other on the back of my hand. Kérastase has more of a serum feel, it’s clear/yellow upon application, and it has a little more of an oily texture. DT starts out a little thicker and looks white/creamy at first, then it blends out to be sheer. With both products, I rub them between my hands before applying to hair. \n\n\nMETHOD:\n\nLast night I did my normal shower routine, including a clarifying shampoo and a moisturizing conditioner. I’ve been using this particular duo of products for about 6 months. \n\nI let my hair dry for a couple of hours and applied one serum on each side, washing my hands between applications. Then I put my hair in braids for the night. I didn’t use any other leave-in products before taking pictures.\n\nIn the morning I took out the braids, hand-combed them, brushed through them, and then did some touch-ups to the ends with my curling iron, taking pictures throughout every step. \n\nSo let me know what you think and I’ll put my final thoughts in the comments!

Both sides of my hair look shiny and hydrated. The ends feel great. They are equally manageable. The dollar tree side MIGHT have a little more shine to it, or it could be the angle of my camera.\n\nI seriously can’t tell a difference besides the fragrance (I had to keep smelling each side to make sure I had them right) and the fragrance is not worth $58.25 to me. So you know where I’ll be spending my money.",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

    "body": "Just received my order of Illiyoon's Ceramide Cream and initially, I thought I received a fake cuz of the differences (specifically '7 Free' vs '9 Free' and the text on the label) but I did a bit of research and turns out its the new reformulated version 😭 Bought it from TOP Korea then cross checked other shops and it seems SUI SUI's stocks will be the new one too.\n\nRight after I fell in love with my experience sa old formula from the mini bottle I bought in trying to heal my skin barrier 🫠 Not doomposting it naman but like... I hate it when something works really well for me and they go reformulate the whole thing. The money spent is no joke either.\n\nI realized too late and already applied it on my whole face without patch testing first so... we'll see how it goes\n\nSo far though...\nConsistency wise, new formula is a bit more watery compared sa old na very thick. \n - New feels a little lighter and less greasy vs. Old thats heavier to the point that u can feel it on you even on the back of my hand.\n - Maybe it could be a good thing with the PH weather. Cant say if the new one is less moisturizing yet but comparing them on my hands, Old formula is more slippery/greasy, new one feels a little matte thats slightly greasy if that makes sense?\n\nScent wise, theres a subtle difference but new one is still unscented.\n\nI'll update in maybe a week and see how it goes. Hopefully it still performs the same and nothing happens to me lmao. So far naman I'm not itching yet lol\n\nHere are the ingredients for comparison!\nTLDR the little search I did: \"One of the former occlusives used was Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, which was replaced by much lighter, less occlusive emollients like ethylhexyl stearate and dicaprylyl carbonate.\" + Added Madecassoside\n\nOLD\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Stearic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Palmitic Acid, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Arachidyl Alcohol, C14-22 Alcohols, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA(Ceramide PC-104), Polyacrylate-13, Arachidyl Glucoside, Mannitol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Polyisobutene, Glyceryl Caprylate, Panax Ginseng Root Water, Ethylhexylglycerin, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Carbomer, Perilla Ocymoides Seed Extract, Myristic Acid, Arachidic Acid, Cholesterol, Bupleurum Falcatum Root Extract, Angelica Acutiloba Root Extract, Ophiopogon Japonicus Root Extract, Glucose, Silica, Glycine Max (Soybean) Oil, Ceramide NP, Phytosphingosine, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Tocopherol, Canola Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract\n\nNEW\nPurified water, butylene glycol, glycerin, ethylhexyl stearate, dimethicone, dicaprylyl carbonate, behenyl alcohol, stearic acid, palmitic acid, cetyl ethylhexanoate, hydrogenated poly(C6-14 olefin), 1,2-hexanediol, arachidyl alcohol, C14-22 alcohol, cetyl-pigmentohydroxyethyl palmitamide (ceramide CPP-40 7622 ppm), polyacrylate-13, mannitol, arachidyl glucoside, C12-20 alkyl glucoside, hydrogenated polyisobutene, glyceryl caprylate, ethylhexylglycerin, polyglyceryl-10 laurate, hydrogenated lecithin, ethylhexyl palmitate, Dimethiconol, Ginseng Water, Carbomer, Sorbitan Isostearate, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Gold Extract, Propanediol, Cholesterol, Silica, Plum Extract, Arachidic Acid, Black Soybean Oil, Squalane Madecassoside, Polyglyceryl-10 Pentastearate, Tocopherol, Ceramide NP (4ppm), Oleic Acid, Phytosphingosine, Pentylene Glycol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Canola Oil, Rosemary Leaf Extract",

Got sick for a while so I couldn't muster the strength to be in front of a screen for long during the past few days.\n\nAnyway, here we go! **Please check replies for continuations as I'll be splitting it due to the character limit!**\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that my experiences with the old formula and the new formula have both been about 2 weeks-ish so I cannot give a HG / experienced user comparison with old formula.\n\nSkin Type: Oily-Combination (normally) but currently Dry and Sensitive due to a damaged skin barrier\n\n* Just like the old formula, I didn’t experience any breakouts, clogged pores, or signs of irritation *(just a few small pimples here and there as im nearing my period)*\n* As mentioned previously, the new formula is definitely lighter and easier to absorb vs. the old formula. I used it side by side one day and the side with the new formula didn’t feel as heavy and the finger swipe wasn’t as greasy.\n* I’m not sure if its viable as a morning moisturizer now, but I did use it as such under my Omi Sunbears Sunscreen. \n   * I avoided using this sunscreen when I damaged my skin barrier as it dried so matte it made my skin so dry and my old moisturizers *(Hyaloo and Klued)* weren’t enough for it. But the new formula was just right to keep me moisturized but not oily with this sunscreen\n\nPART 1/2",

I'm not supposed to divulge all these details! \n\n**Product reviews** :\n\n*Note* : None of these products have been used by me on a strictly daily basis, except for a week (or two) in a row during vacations, as I rarely step out of the house (lockdown, duh!) and don't apply sunscreen indoors (\\*gaasp\\* 😨)   \n Rest assured, I've reapplied some when out, and have used them on and off in a span of 6 months. \n\nFrom L-R \n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/s2C99g0N/IMG-20211119-184403.jpg\n\n\n**1-  Nivea Sun Protect And Moisture, moisturising sun and collagen protection SPF 50+ PA++++** \n\n**Quantity** **- Price** : 125 ml - ₹495 MRP\n\n(bought on Amazon for ₹396)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua, Octocrylene, Glycerin, Titanium Dioxide, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Alcohol Denat, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Panthenol, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Myristyl Myristate, Silica, Cetyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Stearyl Alcohol, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Methylparaben, Dimethicone, Trisodium EDTA, Ethylparaben, Sodium Citrate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Citric Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hydroxide, Linalool, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Eugenol, Coumarin, Methyl Benzoate, Benzoic Acid, BHT, Parfum/Fragrance\n\n**Texture** : White - Chalky Color. Medium - Thick Consistency   \n , you have to rub it in for a while for it to get completely absorbed, medium drying speed. Kinda greasy, semi matte finish. Leaves a moderate white cast, not a ghastly one though. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. Smells mostly of Alcohol! (it's one of the ingredients, so obviously..), fragrance is definitely not unnoticeable, but I don't mind it for my body, lingers around for a while. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : Hell yeah! It won't wear off unless you bathe, it survives water splashes and friction from clothes. Be careful while applying it on your feet though, I slip a lot while walking, esp when there's a rush and I put on sandals right after applying it. Give it ample time to dry before stepping out. \n\n**Reapplication** : Since the lotion sits thick on the skin, reapplication is not a bliss, the white cast becomes more noticeable after reapplication, and if you sweat after, oh god it feels a heavy /sticky mess lol, also tends to attract dust, but it's for the body, so I can compromise. 🤷‍♀️\n\n**Overall experience** : It's the best body sunscreen I've tried so far, with the highest protection and I think the brand can be trusted for its spf claims. \n\nI tried using it on my face once, oh nooo, I will never do that again! it kept moving around and just wouldn't get absorbed, plus it stung like hell because of the alcohol, and I literally felt like I was applying fevicol!   \n For my body, yep a thumbs up! \n\n\\*But\\*, if you get acne on your arms  (my arms have a tendency to break out / get textured if I use the wrong product) it wouldn't be the best choice, it seals and chokes the pores, I'd prefer something lighter. I usually wear tops/suits with long sleeves, so not much of the arm is exposed. below the elbow it feels comfortable enough. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WRP**, Hit! (for the body) \n\n**2- Iba Halal Invisible Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++**   \n **Quantity - Price** : 80 ml - ₹395 MRP\n\n(I bought it on Amazon for ₹ 337)\n\n**Ingredients** : WATER CONTAINING EXTRACTS OF ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) EXTRACT & HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) WATER, WATER & ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE & BENZOPHENONE-3 & BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE & PHOSPHOLIPIDS & 1,3-BUTYLENE GLYCOL & PHENOXYETHANOL, GLYCERINE, AMMONIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE/BEHENETH-25 METHACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL AND TRIETHYLENE GLYCOL, ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE, ALUMINIUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE, NIACINAMIDE (VITAMIN B3), TITANIUM DIOXIDE, PERFUME, DISODIUM EDTA, SODIUM HYDROXIDE\n\n**Texture** : White color. Light lotion - cream consistency, very lightweight and water like, kind of runny, it trickles down when you place a dallop on the palm and tilt it.   \n The Best consistency of a sunscreen I've used so far! Not at all heavy, takes some time to dry, esp when using larger amounts (I use 2-3 finger lengths) and still it doesn't feel too much on my face, easy to work with, requires a lot of gentle massaging because it's watery and takes some time to dry and settle in. High dry time.   \n It contains no silicones! My oily skin loves it! Doesn't give a matte finish though, on the glossy (satin?) side, but nothing bothersome.  \n Doesn't leave a white cast! On the Low I'd say, because of the presence of Titanium Dioxide. Absolutely love the texture. Skin feels very hydrated and plump and non greasy. (taaza nikhaar 😆) \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Has a \"fresh\" smell, (bamboo room freshener? idk something like that), moderate level, doesn't linger a lot. I haven't found a \\*good\\* fragrance free budget (\\*my\\* budget) friendly sunscreen yet. So I'm okay with this for now. Sometimes I'm guilty of enjoying the fragrance 😅 because all other products I use are strictly fragrance free. \n\n**Water Resistant?** :  Nope, doesn't survive water splashes or sweat (it won't come off completely in a single splash though, will wash off when sweating profusely) white colored droplets roll down the face if out in the sun for long. (the survival time is slightly more than the La Shield urban protection mineral sunscreen gel though) \n\n**Reapplication** : Breezy! Since it's lightweight, although, you might experience some moving around if there's a \\*lot\\* of product, I'd suggest applying pea by pea instead of taking a finger length at one go, I squeezed out a good amount once while in the car and kept massaging it in for a couple minutes (or more) and felt embarrassed at the weird looks my family and people outside the car gave me.. So yeah.. lol.  It doesn't feel uncomfortable after layers have been built up. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I love it! Although I'm not sure if the sunscreen has undergone the required tests to justify the actual sun protection claims, but that's all I got so far, it fits my requirements of no silicones, negligible white cast, high declared protection, non oily texture, and most importantly budget! \n\nOne important point, it stings when used after physical / chemical exfoliation. So you may want to avoid it after threading / waxing / scrubbing / masking / exfoliating.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Hit! **WRP** (for face) \n\n**3- La Shield Pollution Protect Mineral Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹280 MRP\n\n(bought it on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Purified Water, Octinoxate, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Caprylyl Methicone, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Diisopropyl Adipate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetearyl Alcohol, Brassica Campestris/Aleurites Fordi Oil Copolymer, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Phenoxyethanol, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, C20-22 Alcohols, Isohexadecane, Fragrances, Aluminium Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 60, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trolamine, Disodium Edetate, Sorbitan Isostearate\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Light - Medium gel - cream consistency. Lightweight. Doesn't require a lot of rubbing in. Doesn't move around a lot. Leaves a Low- Moderate white cast. Not the kind typical to mineral sunscreens, but more than the Iba Halal sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Lingers.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Naah, it melts away almost instantly if you happen to sweat while applying it, just a spray (accidental rain drop for example) on the face and it wears off from that spot, minor sweating and it rolls down the cheeks, doesn't adhere to the skin. \n\n**Reapplication** : Medium ease. Moves around, kind of sticky when built up. Medium White cast (visibly noticeable) after reapplication. \n\n**Overall Experience** : Um, I had expected a better performance from this one, looking at the ingredients and all, but it stings around the eyes, and on the face, makes my face somewhat tacky, my face becomes oily by afternoon (if applied in the morning). Personally I didn't like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Miss. **WNRP**.\n\n**4-  La Shield Fisico Matte Sunscreen Gel SPF 50+ PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹630 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹441)\n\n**Ingredients** : Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate\n\n**Texture** : White color, pasty. Very thick, \\*very\\* silicone-y (it's silicone based.. So), chokes the skin, spreadability is good, doesn't require a lot of massaging in, quick dry time. Moderate - slightly high white cast. Makes my face sweat! \n\n**Fragrance** : No. Silicone like.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Definitely. Strong staying power. Survives sweating and water splashes too well. Requires double cleanse or a heavy duty face wash to remove. \n\n**Reapplication** : Hahaha! Go ahead and try it if you want to look like a freshly frosted cake! Don't even \\*think\\* about it. Unless you plan to scare people with your literal white walker look. Been there, done that. I'm forever terrified, and will \\*never\\* do it again.\n\n**Overall Experience** : It's a thick paste, Stings around the eyes, which was surprising it being a physical sunscreen (probably because the zinc is micronized? idk) Reapplication is painful, can't apply more than 2 pea sized amount in the first application. Attracts dirt, Chokes my pores, I can't afford to apply something so pore clogging and then strip my facial skin away to remove it.   \n For me, it's not worth the price performance wise.   \n I'm finishing it off as a primer for occasions, smoothes out the face surface, my face gleamed during diwali :P\n\n**Repurchase status** : Miss! **WNRP**.\n\n**5- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Mineral Sunscreen, SPF 50+ PA++++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹295 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹236)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Silica, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Sodium Chloride, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Perfume, Magnesium Sulphate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Thick cream. Low - medium effort required for blending in the skin. Doesn't move around a lot. Medium - High Dry time. Low white cast (for a mineral sunscreen), medium matte finish. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : No, doesn't survive low- medium sweating. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I haven't used this sunscreen much. My mom used it a few times, and the moment I saw it melting down her face I didn't want to use it. Could have been a great affordable mineral sunscreen, but it's not even mildly water resistant, so I instantly passed on it. Might give it a try in the future. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WNRP**. \n\n**6- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Sunblock and Anti Tan Lotion Tinted Sunscreen, SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 60 ml - ₹245 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water,Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Propylene Glycol, Glyceryl Monostearate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Kaolin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Sodium Sulfite, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Extract, Saxifraga Sarmentosa Extract, Acetyl Tyrosine, Arbutin, Glutathione, Aminopropyl Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dimethiconol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Triethanolamine, Perfume, Disodium EDTA, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Ci 77492, Ci 77491, Ci 77499\n\n**Texture** : Orange color (literally). Medium consistency lotion like. Lightweight. Medium matte finish. Easy application. Doesn't require much effort to blend in. But the color is a literal disaster, it's impossible to apply a full finger length of this sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. On the Higher side. \n\n**Water Resistant** : Maybe a bit more than the mineral sunscreen variant? Not sure, rubs off on the mask \\*very\\* readily. Haven't noticed orange sweat yet, maybe because I haven't worn it enough. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. But I'm pretty sure it's not possible provided the intense color. \n\n**Overall Experience** : It could have been a good,  affordable tinted sunscreen, but the tint is just a disaster.. It dulls my face overall, and it doesn't even work as a bb cream (or sorts) although I don't expect to provide any coverage as per se (which it doesn't anyhow), but I can't find a way to finish it off other than applying it on my hands. Maybe color corrector?? Omg what'd I just come up with 😃💡. Let's see lol \n\n**Repurchase status** : Nope. **WNRP**. \n\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/RVccCB01/IMG-20211119-173651.jpg\n\n**7-** **Malibu LipCare Balm, SPF 30, UVA/UVB** (watermelon variant) \n\n**Quantity - Price** : 5 gm - ₹249-₹299\n\n(bought 2 on amazon for ₹199 each )\n\n**Ingredients** (watermelon) : Petrolatum, Paraffinum Liquidum (Mineral Oil), Paraffin Wax, Ozokerite Wax, Homosalate, Octocrylene, Carnauba Wax, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Flavor  \n May Contain: Limonene, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Citral, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol\n\n**Texture** : Ultra Rich, stiff stick, application is not smooth and breezy, tugs and pulls on the lips if you rush it, tightly press it against the surface, let the balm melt and glide on slowly. Makes lips very soft though. Staying power is great! \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Watermelon. Strong. \n\n**Taste** : Bitter Af! Avoid applying it on the insides and corners to keep it from seeping in. \n\n**Water resistant?** : Definitely! Survives liquids (tea, water, juice for me) not very heavy meals. Apply a thick layer to fight the mask rubbing off. Stays on for hours, afternoon - evening, for example. Keeps lips very soft and supple, no stinging sensation. \n\n**Overall Experience** : The only lip balm with spf 30 (plus uva/uvb protection) that has all the ingredients disclosed. Can't ask for more.   \n The only issue is, I can't use it with my waterproof /transferproof matte lipsticks. It makes them water loving and easily transferable, need to figure something out for that.. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : Unless I find some other lip balm with spf 30 mentioning all the ingredients, in a more affordable range, with no bitter taste, and better sunscreen filters. I **WRP** this. \n\nThats about it! Congrats for making it this far! Thanks!\n\n*Edited to add links to images, since I couldn't upload them with the post*",

    "body": "Sharing my post here as well. Recently, I had posted requesting dupes for Bite's Agave Lip Mask as it is now being discontinued. This stuff is ride or die lip salvation for me. I live somewhere super dry, work in a dry environment, take meds that dry me out, you get the picture. I'm a moisture junkie. I gathered the piece that works is the lanolin in it so I tried some similar products and wrote some reviews of them.\n\n[Here](https://imgur.com/kV6xjSG) are the products I've tried. Not pictured is the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, which I emptied and tossed the container.  From left to right I have the Bite lip mask, Lanolips Lanostick, Lanolips 101 ointment, Glossier Balm Dotcom in 3 flavors (original, birthday cake, and rose), Go-To Lips, Jack Black, Aquaphor, and Vaseline.\n\n**Bite Agave Lip Mask** 10/10\n\n    Ingredients: Trans-Resveratrol, Lanolin (Pharma Grade), Organic Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Organic Butyrospermum, Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Rosinate, Organic Agave Tequilana (Blue Agave) Nectar, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil Unsaponifiables, Organic Cera Alba (Beeswax), Flavor, Vanillin, Siraitia Grosvernori (Monk Fruit), Vanilla Tahitensis (Vanilla) Fruit Extract, Organic Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Trans-resveratrol, Vitis Vinefera (Grape) Oil, Tocopherol Acetate, Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, and Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, +/- May Contain: Mica (CI 77019), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Carmine (CI 75470).\n\nI think what has done it for me with this one is the occlusive elements as well as moisturizers. I can see it has oils and lanolin plus beeswax. I like the thick texture which is almost sticky as well as the tube packaging. I personally like the absence of SPF as when I am really chapped those can sting/burn my lips. I also really like the smell/taste of the original. The small tube lasts a long time and it saves me a lot of discomfort in the dry winters, especially working in a hospital with all the recycled air. \n\n**Lanolips Lanostick** 8/10\n\n    Lanolin*, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil*, capryloyl glycerin/sebacic acid copolymer*, cera alba (beeswax)*, caprylic/capric triglyceride*, persea gratissima (avocado) oil*, jojoba esters (simmondsia chinensis)*, aroma (nat flavour)*, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter*, euphorbia cerifera (candelilla) cera*, magnifera indica (mango) seed butter*, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil*, copernicia cerifera (carnauba) cera*, tocopherol (vit E)* *100% natural/naturel\n    \nI feel like this one on the lips is very similar in feel to the Bite. It is probably my favorite of the dupes that I've tried. It has a lot of similar ingredients such as the lanolin, castor oil, beeswax, shea butter, and some other oils. It has a different flavor/scent than the Bite mask. It is almost citrus in nature? I think I can see myself using this one once I go through my stash of Bite (thanks to the redditor who messaged me saying Sephora kept restocking, I was able to snag some). My complaint? The fact it is a stick and not a tube! I haven't lost the cap of this in my pocket yet but that happens to me with regular sticks. I also worry the stick will break because it gets too soft from being stored in my pocket. All in all the best dupe so far.  It also got me through days at the hospital without wanting to rip my lips off my face so win.\n\n**Lanolips 101 Ointment** 7/10\n\n    Ingredients: Lanolin, lanolin oil. *naturally derived/*Dérivé naturellement.\n\nI got this one because I was already ordering from Ulta and was able to use a coupon and my points, I imagine it is basically the same as the nipple creams and other straight up lanolin out there. It is good. Tube is nice. Cap doesn't stay on super great. No color or flavor so I can use it for my cuticles and other dry patches. I can't complain but I'm not gonna sing out from the rooftops or anything like that. You can get lanolin only products much cheaper for much more product elsewhere. It does do its job locking in moisture though.\n\n**Glossier Balm Dotcom** 8/10\n\n    Ingredients: Petrolatum, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Beeswax/Cera Alba/Cire d’Abeille, Lanolin, Theobroma Grandiflorum Seed Butter, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, BHT, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol.\n\nI know I originally wanted to avoid petroleum based products but I did have a sample of it that I liked well enough so I got the 3 pack on Glossier's site to try the other flavors. Original seems to be more sticky than the other flavors and feels more like the Bite mask. It does a good enough job, the flavors are fun. I like the tube packaging. The rose is so much better than the perfume co. rose balm which is rose flavored vaseline. I feel like it did a good job moisturizing and lasting to lock in the moisture while I was at work too.\n\n**Go-to Lips** 4/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tUltra Medical Grade Lanolin, Shea Butter, Apricot Kernel Oil, Beeswax, Sweet Almond Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Vitamin E, Fragrance (Pure Pomegranate), Pomegranate Seed Oil, Calendula Oil, Jojoba Oil, Avocado Oil.\n\nI think I might be rating this lower because I had higher expectations for it. The ingredients sound great. Its in a nice tube. But its so slippery, it feels like a lip oil on the lips instead of a balm or sticky mask. It has a strong scent/flavor but it isn't unpleasant. Its so messy out of the tube though because it is so slick! I wasn't looking for an oil so I'm a little bummed. I can't say it doesn't moisturize my lips though but it doesn't have the staying power to make use of the occlusives in it. \n\n**Jack Black Lip Balm** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tBeeswax, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, C 18-38 Alkyl Hydroxystearol Stearate, Camellia Sinenesis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Flavor, Lanolin, Microcrystalline Wax, Ozokerite, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Polyglyceryl 3 Beeswax, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n\nPretty middle of the road chapstick. Theres some beeswax, some lanolin, some shea butter. It has SPF though which is a negative for me for a day to day balm. I guess there isn't a lot wrong with it, it doesn't dry me out but if I am dry it stings. Its a little slicker than Bite too. I got it awhile ago as a sample and it just didn't wow me but it is a popular item.\n\n**Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy** 5/10\n\n    Active ingredient: Petrolatum (41%) – Skin protectant Inactive ingredients: Mineral Oil, Ceresin, Lanolin Alcohol, Panthenol, Glycerin, Bisabolol\n\nI use this at work when I leave chapstick at home because we have samples of it everywhere. It's good for prevention of radiation dermatitis if you're into that sort of thing. It has no flavor, no taste. Its slippery and greasy feeling due to the high petroleum content. It's a solid product in general just not for my dream chapstick replacement. Good stuff though. Will continue to have on hand.\n\n**Vaseline Lip Therapy Advanced Healing** 2/10\n\n    Active ingredient: White Petroleum, USP 100%. Inactive ingredient: Flavor.\n\nLiterally marked up vaseline. What makes it more advanced than regular Vaseline?? Doesn't do much for me but vaseline never did. I bought it from the pharmacy at work when I left my chapstick at home. I do like the tube so I guess it isn't pointless. \n\n**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tDiisostearyl Malate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytosteryl / Isostearyl / Cetyl / Stearyl / Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polybutene, Microcrystalline Wax / Cera Microcristallina / Cire Microcristalline, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Synthetic Wax, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax / Candelilla Cera / Cire de Candelilla, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Butylene / Ethylene / Styrene Copolymer, Ethylene / Propylene / Styrene Copolymer, Mica (CI 77019), Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Dimethicone, Fragrance / Parfum, Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Methicone, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax / Cera Carnauba / Cire de Carnauba, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Yellow 6 Lake (CI 15985), Red 6 (CI 15850), Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Water, Potassium Alginate, Propanediol, Glycerin, Alcohol, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Sapindus Mukorossi Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Chamaemorus Seed Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Chenopodium Quinoa Seed Extract, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Beta-Glucan, Manganese Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Ascorbyl Glucoside.\n\nOk at the risk of sounding crunchy granola AF what the hell is some of the stuff in this? Why does there need to be a million things in this? Theres some shea butter, some synthetic wax, other wax, silicones, and other stuff in it. No lanolin or petroleum. If you're allergic to lanolin its probably good. It's not bad. It's a little too slippery for my likes in a lip product. It doesn't stay on a long time. It doesn't seem to moisturize better than any other product. It doesn't seem to hurt my lips. I don't like the little tub it comes in because I don't want to wash my hands every time I wanna put lip balm on. It costs a little much for what it is for me. \n\n\n**Closing Arguments** *TL;DR*\n\nWhile Bite may be my ride or die, it's going the way of the dinosaur. Lanolips has good products, the lanostick might be the most similar in terms of ingredients/feel although the packaging is different. Glossier's balm is suitable too although it does have petroleum in it. Most of these products do have lanolin and/or beeswax in them so they aren't suitable for vegans. \n\nI'd love to hear if there are any I missed trying, despite having tons of chapstick I am a chapstick junkie so I'd be interested to hear!",

        "body": "First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair lip balm is my HG for dry lips. It’s a very thick, almost sticky, balm-mask. I usually have to warm a little of the product on my finger before applying it because it is so thick. It has a very slightly minty scent and a slight cooling sensation on application. It comes in a small tin, and one tin lasts me approximately a year of twice daily use. I also work in a hospital environment, and this is the only balm that has ever adequately protected my lips from the dry hospital air. It’s also currently $10 (half off) on their website. Thanks to you, I looked it up so I could post the ingredients and saw the sale so I’ll probably stock up on a little more!\n\n\nThe ingredients are: Cera Alba (Beeswax, Cire d'abeille), Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Water/Aqua/Eau, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Lecithin, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Glycerin, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Colloidal Oatmeal, Dimethicone, Aroma (Flavor), Urea, Mel (Honey, Miel), Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Propolis Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Allantoin, Vanilla Planifolia Fruit Extract, Butylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Sodium Hydroxide, EDTA, Eugenol.",

I usually use whatever face lotion I'm using at night on my lips and then put my lanolips on.

    "body": "First of all, these are a list of products available in Boots that I've found, so they're non-exhaustive. Apart from some Neutrogena products and No7 Beautiful Skin Blemish Defence Serum, they contain \"alcohol denat.\", which is a dealbreaker for me as I try to avoid drying alcohols as much as I can. \n\nBHAs are few and very far in between, in addition to not being labelled as such and most probably without the percentage of salicylic acid contained or whether it's in the right pH to be effective. \n\nI haven't done a price comparison, and since I found them in Boots I've used the online site's price point. Prices are only as a guide, they may be cheaper/more expensive elsewhere.

    "body": "So I have curly very dry very frizzy middle east/north african hair. The kind that would stump hairstylists of even high levels when they’d try to blow out or silk press it. I’ve been in the natural/curly hair community for at least ten years now and my biggest mistake was believing that high porosity hair was only damaged hair!\n\nEvery resource at the time, and even today, talks about how low-medium porosity is “natural” to what everyone has and high porosity is “damaged” from heat or bleach. After all this time, I finally cut out all that bs and started treating my hair like it’s high porosity.\n\nI’ve used most curly hair brands and some higher end brands like from sephora over years now.  Nothing has been good enough to keep as a routine. When I reflect on all the products I’ve had over time— I realized the ones that worked best always had SILICONE! i’ve seen some hairstylists and cosmetic scientists push back on the dominant narrative that silicones = bad and actually talk about its benefits! And i believe that for high porosity hair, natural or not, we need silicones. At least in our styling products! It is much better at coating the shaft than oils and butters are. In my shampoo and conditioner, i still use silicone-free. But i’ve been incorporating silicone products into my styling routine and it has been incredible. Even in all humidity Florida, It works. I always get compliments on my hair when i use silicone based serums to finish my styling because it really seems to lock in that moisture! \n\nThe problem has been finding products made for curly hair but that also include silicone. Most natural hair products exclude and admonish silicone! Just because the dominant narrative is reduced to silicone=bad even though there’s no medical or health reason to avoid it! \n\nUsually you can find drugstore “cheap” haircare with it, but those are not as moisturizing as my hair needs. My best results have been the more expensive serums $28+ but I cant afford that with how much I use on my long, dense hair. The ogx “argan oil” serum has been my favorite drugstore option (first ingredient: dimethicone) but the class action lawsuit involving ogx products included that one and I am a little scared to touch it again. Any recommendations for affordable serums/products that would be good for curly hair and include silicone please share!\n\nHas anyone realized they have naturally high porosity hair and that even experts have no idea how to deal with it? What works for your hair and what does it love? I can share my routine if anyone is interested!",

    "body": "**TL;DR: Don't fuck up like me. Make sure your moisturizer, primer, and foundation all have the same base or you will regret it.** \n\nOk, I know that this topic has come up a lot recently, but I feel like a lot of discussions leave out a key part of the problem. By now, I think most people know that you have to make sure your primer and foundation have the same base i.e. are they water based or silicone based. It makes sense since those two are layered one on top of the other and if they're immiscible then the foundation will just settle on top and come off on everything, defeating the purpose of a primer. Now, what I haven't seen discussed is how your moisturizer may be interacting with your primer and foundation. I've discovered some interesting things through trial and error recently and wanted to share it with the MUA community.\n\nFirst, I recently switched moisturizers. My skin has been a disaster this winter and I needed a major skincare overhaul. I have sensitive skin and Neutrogena has always had my back with great products that don't irritate my skin. One of the new things I got was a moisturizer with hyaluronic acid, the [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/hydro+boost+water+gel.do?sortby=ourPicks). I love this product because it absorbs quickly, eliminated my dry spots, and hasn't caused any irritation. What I didn't take into account when I bought this product was the ingredients list; I was just happy to find a non-irritating hyaluronic acid delivery system. \n\nwater, **dimethicone**, glycerin, **dimeticone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer**, phenoxyethanol, polyacrylamide, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, dimethiconol, C13-14 isoparaffin, **dimethicone crosspolymer**, chlorphenesin, carbomer, laureth-7, sodium hyaluronate, ethylhexylglycerin, fragrance, C12-14 pareth-12, sodium hydroxide, blue 1 \n\nThe bolded ingredients indicate it's a silicone-based primer. Yes, the first ingredient is water, but the silicone is present in large amounts, and it interacts differently with water-based products.\n\nMistake 1: I was going for a low-effort look one day and decided to used some of my face powder and call it good. With face powder I usually wear my [NYX HD Primer](http://www.nyxcosmetics.com/high-definition-primer/NYX_180.html) because it's lighter but still holds the powder in place. That day my makeup was slipping and sliding everywhere and I looked like a cakey hot mess when I got home. I checked the ingredients on my moisturizer, found all the silicone, then looked at the primer ingredients. \n\n**Water/Aqua/Eau,** Propylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Diethylhexyl Maleate, Glycerin, Ethylene/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Dimethicone, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, PEG-15 Glyceryl Isostearate, Trihydroxystearin, Adipic Acid/Neopentyl Glycol Crosspolymer, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Tocopheryl Acetate, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax/Cera Carnauba/Cire de Carnauba, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7, Silica, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin,  Propylene Glycol Stearate, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Laurate, Propylene Glycol Laurate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Butylene Glycol, Salicornia Herbacea Extract, Copper Tripeptide-1,  Chlorphenesin, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, VP/VA Copolymer, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, C12-14 Pareth-7, Amodimethicone,  Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance/Parfum, Citronellol, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. MAY CONTAIN / PEUT CONTENIR (+/-): Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Zinc Oxide (CI 77947), Chromium Hydroxide Green (CI 77289), Ultramarines (CI 77007).\n\nThe water-based primer just sat on top of my moisturizer, making my makeup come off all over everything.\n\nMistake 2: I somehow spaced and forgot all about my moisturizer issues and yesterday I was rushing to leave and decided to just throw on some Sonia Kashuk Radiant Tinted Moisturizer and go. Wrong move. I had already washed my face and moisturized previously, so the Neutrogena moisturizers was under the tinted moisturizer. As I was rubbing the tinted moisturizer on my face, it started to ball up and look disgusting. I quickly wiped it off and left bare faced, but later I looked at the ingredients in the Sonia Kashuk Tinted Moisturizer. \n\nFluorphlogopite, Sorbitan Is Os Tearate,\nTris Iloxane, D Is Teardimonium Hectorite,\nCetyl Peg/Ppg‐10/1 D Imethicone,\nD Imethicone Cros S Polymer, Butylene Glycol,\nSilica D Imethyl Silylate, Synthetic Bees Wax,\nTetras Odium Ed Ta, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium\nChloride, Alcohol, Talc, Peg‐30\nD Ipolyhydroxys Tearate, Aluminum\nHydroxide, Potas S Ium Sorbate, Stearic Acid,\nCaprylyl Methicone, As Corbyl Palmitate,\nTocopherol, Pentaerythrityl Tetra‐Di‐T‐Butyl\nHydroxyhydrocinnamate.\nMay Contain: Mica, Titanium D Ioxide, Iron\nOxides , Zinc Oxide.\n\nThis one is a little more tricky, as it does have some dimethicone ingredients, but my best guess is that the other ingredients react negatively with the ingredients in the Neutrogena moisturizer.\n \nNow, I know this sounds like using the Neutrogena moisturizer is too much of a pain, but it's really not that big of a deal. My favorite primer, the [ELF Poreless Face Primer](http://www.elfcosmetics.com/p/poreless-face-primer?dept=face-faceprimer), works perfectly with this moisturizer and my HG foundation, [Revlon Colorstay Whipped](http://www.revlon.com/products/face/foundation-makeup/revlon-colorstay-whipped-creme-makeup#309971347054||0), goes on better than ever. I just wanted to make this post to inform people that mismatched moisturizer can cause just as many issues as mismatched primer and foundation!",

        "body": "I am so glad I found this recommendation for a cream that's free of most silicones. Dimethicone and simethicone specifically cause clogged pores over time for me. While this product isn't completely silicone free, it contains polymethylsilsesquioxane as the 10th last ingredient. I also break out with shea butter and most heavy AB creams I've come across have one or the other or both. I've been using this for 2 weeks with no issues!\n\nI am used to thick creams (Vanicream) but the simethicone was clogging my pores. I decided to give this a try because most of my products are already AB. When I first squeezed this out of the tube, it looked like icing I make for cupcakes. Lol. It was smooth and lightweight for a cream. When I spread it on my face, it melts down to an oily-cream and it takes a bit of patting to fully absorb. It does not feel heavy, but on my skin it does feel slightly oily for a minute or two. This freaked me out at first because I am so used to a heavy-cream feeling on my skin. I had doubts right away this wouldn't be enough for my super dry skin. \n\nI am using 0.01% tretinoin through Curology right now and while I'm early in the process (3 weeks) I don't have any excessive dryness, but my skin has always been dry. I'm not sure if it's this cream that's making the difference or my entire routine, but I love it. I add a sleeping pack on top and then dab a tiny amount of Vaseline. In the morning my skin is plump, hydrated, and so smooth! \n\nI use this every night but it's also great for daytime. It dries down quick and gives you a nice healthy look to your skin. Not really glowing, just a moisturized and hydrated look. It's easy to re-apply if need be and it works great over my other moisturizers and sunscreens if I need a touch up after wearing a mask all day. \n\nI also tried it on my hands! I think I like it less for my hands, because I'm washing them constantly and prefer Vanicream for them. I didn't notice anything significantly different with dryness when I used it for a day. But no stinging across the board for hands or face which is awesome! \n\nLastly, the tube is huge! I believe it's 175ml and I paid about $23 on Jolse for this. \n\nOverall, 10/10 recommend this! If you're okay with silicones towards the end of the ingredients list, try it out too!",

Reviewing FormulaRX Barrier Relief Moisturiser\n \n* Texture and consistency:  It sinks right in the skin and has a gel like texture. It doesn’t feel heavy nor makes me sweat on application unlike other moisturisers make me do. I loved the fact it’s so lightweight and has the gel consistency.\n\n* Effect/ Result: to be very honest, when I first started using this moisturiser, I felt like it was breaking me out, at one point I even stopped using the moisturiser for a while because I was just upset. I loved the texture so much but had been doubting if it’s breaking me out. But later I realised it wasn’t the moisturiser, it was just my usual hormonal acne. I’ve been using it for 2 months and lately it has been working just fine. \n\n• It has 4% niacinamide, confirmed with brand. I had thought of using it as an alternative to a niacinamide serum, but didn’t show any added visible effects.\n\n* Would not repurchase because: \n1. The price, 699 for a 50 g basic moisturiser?!?!\n2. It does it’s job, moisturises my face. Nothing exceptional about it and honestly the Minimalist moisturiser does the same thing for a lesser price.\n3. It makes my face extremely oily and greasy in an hour. My face looks extremely dull. I wouldn’t use it in day time.\n\n•PROS.\nThe thing I love the most about this moisturiser is its consistency and lightweight feature but then the fact it makes my face oily AF is a bummer :(\n\nCute packaging: I’m a sucker for pastel colours and aesthetics and gohd I love the tube in my skincare cabinet, looks so pretty ✨\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS \nLike I’ve been mentioning again and again, I really wanted to love this moisturiser but the price point and lack of any exceptional feature wouldn’t make me purchase it again. \n\nMinimalist Sepicalm 3% + Oat Moisturizer\n\nReview Type: RAVE\n\nPrice: Rs. 345-349 for 50 g\n\nUsage Time: 4 Months, every night and sometimes day too\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Squalane, Glycerine, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Sodium Cocoyl Aminoacids, Sarcosine, Potassium Aspartate, Magnesium Aspartate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Panthenol, Pentylene Glycol, Avena Sativa (Oat Kernel) Flour, Sodium Polyglutamate, Undecane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Tocopherol Acetate, Arginine, Glycine, Alanine, Histidine, Sodium Lactate, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Tridecane, Aluminium Starch Octenylsuccinate, Trehalose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n* It has a creamy texture and is quite a thick moisturiser for an extremely oily skin person like me.\n\n* It does not have any actives and I can layer it on top on any active I use, is the fact I love this moisturiser.\n\n* It is decently priced, would definitely repurchase it. \n\n* I’ve used it under makeup and it has worked wonders since the makeup didn’t cause any breakout or any dryness or flakiness.\n\n* I’ve been using it since July, taking a pea sized amount every-night and still have almost 3/5 left, a little goes a long way for me which makes it super affordable. \n\n* I think it’s safe for me to call it my HG moisturiser. It has never broken me out or caused any CCs or any another issue.\n* Literally soothed me, I had been using pulp vit C earlier which was quite strong and potent, Sepicalm moisturiser came handy every time\n\nCONS\n* it’s thick and greasy\n\n* Does not sink in skin immediately unlike the FormulaRX one. It sits on skin for a while\n\n* Makes me sweat after application \n\n* Cannot use it in day (except under makeup)\n\nWhy do I still use it\n- No matter what texture it has, it has soothed my acne, vit C burn, and improved overall skin texture.\n\n- I love the price point \n\n- I use it at night so I don’t worry about how I look, all I care is how well it works. And it does work for me!\n\nI know we’ve missed detailed reviews on this sub here so here’s one from me, more coming in!\nHope y’all find it helpful :)",

It’s an apples to oranges comparison. One is a ceramide moisturiser which has 3 ceramides + phytosphingosine + niacinamide. This usually comes in very expensive creams.\n\nMinimalist on the other hand is the basic moisturiser\n\nIt’s a difference in needs and wants regarding which one would be preferred by a user.",

    "body": "I’ve been shopping Dollar Tree beauty for the last couple years, but never had a place to post my finds! It’s great to finally have a community only dedicated to Dollar Tree beauty products. Hurray for the appreciation for these items! \n\nHere’s some old (may not be able to find) and newer products that I’ve enjoyed and recommend. With some other products I’m less enthusiastic about but think some may still find useful for a short review. \n\n**For some background**: I’ve followed the videos and content of dermatologist Dr Dray (who visits Dollar Tree saying what’s good—she recommended the Kissable Foot Cream for instance). as well as watched a lot of skincare research videos by the two cosmetic chemists of [Chemist Confessions](https://youtube.com/@chemistconfessions?si=UOUzd8RbKlnA6VrE). Highly recommend their often very in-depth videos by the way (clinical research studies!). They are very fun and educational to watch! \n\nWith this background in mind, I’ve shopped Dollar Tree beauty with a mind on trying out interesting and effective ingredients on a budget. \n\n**Skin type:** Oily, acne prone, dehydrated. Some dryness during winter and with overuse of actives. \n\n##Miscellaneous health & beauty: \n\n_Medicine_\n* **Valu Health Non-drowsy daytime cold & flu/nighttime cold & flu acetaminophen soft gels** - As good as DayQuil/NyQuil for fever and cold. Excellent for travel. Conveniently color coded orange (daytime) and green (nighttime). \n\n_Toothpaste_\n* **Colgate Complete Protection Sensitive** - Pleasant mild mint perhaps similar to Sensodyne or Trident Spearmint gum. 5% potassium nitrate calmed my intense tooth aches before seeing dentist. In fact my dentist gave me just this toothpaste before. Tip: Use for two weeks before applying tooth whitening strips or gel to reduce sensitivity. \n\n_Deodorant:_\n* **Suave deodorant energizing sport** - Has aluminum (chemically blocks sweat). Works for summer body odor. Masculine scent. Can leave white marks on dark clothes. \n\n##Body wash, shampoo, hand soap:\n\n_Body wash_\n* **Arm & Hammer Ultra Moisturizing Body Wash** - Best consistency of the Dollar Tree body washes I’ve tried. Not runny; a regular gel. The unisex scents appeals to whole family but men especially. \n* **Power Stick Shower Gel Santal Woods** - Too runny. But nice smell. “Santal” means sandalwood but I also smelled cedarwood. Like Bath and Body Works Cedarwood Sauna perhaps. Unisex; appeals to men. \n\n_Shampoo_\n* **Pro Silk Moisturizing Shampoo Moroccan Argan and Coconut Oil** - Too runny. Builds up over time. Will need a clarifying shampoo with it. Appreciate the extra large 32 oz value size. \n* I generally like V05 or Suave for clarifying shampoo if they come with sulfates. \n\n_Hand soap:_\n* **Dermasil Extra Moisturizing Hand Wash** - Moisturizing and silky like Dove hand soap. A subtle cherry almond scent. \n* **Soft Soap Milk and Honey** - Moisturizing and gentle on hands. Pleasant, mild scent. \n* **Dial Moisturizing Hand Soap Vanilla Honey** - Similar to Soft Soap. Gentle on hands as promised. My dentist’s office uses a similar one. This is not antibacterial but antibacterial hand soap is not needed for most people and actually can lead to bacteria gaining resistance against cleaning agents. Pleasant, mild scent. \n\n##Body care \n\n_Body balms:_\n* **Personal Care 100% Pure Petroleum Jelly** - Apply on minor cuts and bruises to help prevent scarring. Use occasionally in skincare for an extra occlusive layer (“slugging”). Daily overuse can make skin lazy though. Alternatively try Aquaphor, Cerave ointment or a face oil. Slight waxy smell. \n* **Xtra Care Revitalizing Body Balm Jelly Stick** - Very firm, drags. But is unscented and not the worst.\n* **Kissable Diabetics’ Dry Skin Treatment Foot Cream** - 1% Dimethicone (similar to La Roche Posay Cicaplast Balm B5) and 30% petrolatum. More of a healing balm than a lotion. Stiff textured. But has effective strengths of active ingredients. Fragrance free. \n\n_Body lotion:_\n* **Kissable Diabetics’ Dry Skin Relief Lotion** - An excellent body lotion similar to Vaseline Intensive Care. A bit more fluid. Not as fluid as Cerave Daily Moisturizing Lotion but also more moisturizing. Simple ingredients (no ceramides), no irritants, fragrance free. \n* **Xtra Care Diabetics’ Hydrating Lotiom Dry Skin Relief** - Similar to the above Kissable Diabetics’ Dry Skin Relief Lotion. Simple ingredients, fragrance free, nice texture. Note: Was **recalled** once. \n* **Dermasil Eczema Relief Body Lotion** - Good consistency. Some soothing plant extracts and oat extract (but not to active ingredient levels). Has graveolens oil for fragrance. Imparts a sweet, herbal, earthy scent like chamomile. Liked ok. \n\n_Hand cream:_\n* **Care All Creamy Petroleum Jelly** - 30% petrolatum. An excellent hand cream much thicker than Vaseline Intensive Care, great for dry winter hands. But does smell _intensely_ like baby powder. 30% petrolatum functions as a skin protectant similar to the 40% petrolatum in Aquaphor or Cerave Healing Ointment. \n* **Udderly Smooth Hand Cream Original Formula** - The fastest absorbing hand cream I’ve found! Impressed a nurse friend. Was developed to quickly moisturize chapped cow udders. \n\n##Face products \n\n_Face cleanser & cold cream:_\n* **Skin Nutrition Botanicals Tea Tree Oil + Salicylic Acid Balancing Face Wash** - Very good, non-stripping formula with gentle but effective cocamidopropyl betaine (coconut derived). Have used both day and night. Tea tree oil can have an anti-acne effect similar to benzoyl peroxide. Perhaps can leave on skin like a mask before washing off? Does not state percentage of ingredients so assume the salicylic acid is below 1%. \n* **B Pure Hydrating Gel Cream** - Dislike this formula and intense powdery scent. But does work surprisingly well as a cold cream cleansing balm to remove makeup. \n\n_Face lotion, eye cream:_\n* **Global Beauty Care Smooth & Lift Collagen Eye Cream**, 0.5 oz - excellent silky smooth consistency like a more expensive serum. Has peptides but can’t say I noticed an effect. Squalane is the most non-comedogenic of oils \n* **Global Beauty Care Smooth & Lift Collagen Skin Cream (jar)**, 1.7 oz - the same as the eye cream in consistency but more product! Similar ingredients such as peptides and squalane too. Topical collagen is not really helpful in skincare as the molecules are too large to reach the dermis, the deep layer of the skin. Better to use a retinol, vitamin C, or to drink a collagen supplement. \n\n_Face serum:_\n* *^Skin Nutrition Botanicals Niacinamide 5% + Squalane Serum** - Truly excellent value! 5% niacinamide is quickly becoming the new industry standard for niacinamide as consumers learn that more does not equal better with this ingredient. 5% is the maximum recommended by dermatologists and cosmetic chemists these days, and even The Ordinary has followed suit. Niacinamide at this strength can help minimize large pores, strengthen skin barrier and help with hyperpigmentation as a supplementary active to a higher strength one and a chemical exfoliant (it takes a shotgun approach to deal with stubborn hyperpigmentation!). Most Skin Nutrition Botanicals serums are similar, but this one stands out because of its slightly cloudy, jelly texture due to the rice ferment filtrate and squalane. Reminds me of Korean skincare. \n* Have tried other Skincare Nutrition Botanicals serums such as the 1% vitamin C (ascorbyl glucoside; vitamin c derivative usually found between 2-5%, and up to 12%) and double retinol. Same gel serum consistency. Nice as serums. Not sure I noticed results. But others who have used them longer (especially the retinol) say they have. \n\n_Lips:_\n* **Vaseline Lip Therapy Rosy Lips** - A made in Korea product, and does have a nicer feel. Thin, jelly texture similar to Nivea lip balm. Supposed to have a tint but is pretty much colorless. Love the scent: like a natural rose, but in a pleasant, non-perfumey way. Not as moisturizing as Aquaphor but not drying either. Also: the large pull off cap is amazing for slippery, just-applied-my-skincare hands. \n* I am interested in the lip spf products. Used to think spf 15 was too low but I heard that you want to apply lip SPF more frequently anyway since it wears off the most (eating, drinking, talking). I’ll check out some more. \n\n##Limited products \n\nI have also tried and liked other Dollar Tree one-off products from better brands clearing out products such as ^^Lumin, Derma Geek, Ouidad Twist** hair conditioner, etc. My favorite is Lumin (face moisturizer in either oily or dry skin variants: citronnel scent similar to Belif moisturizer, and a similar Korean skincare feel like snail mucin infused product, except meadowsweet oil) and Derma Geek (gentle cleanser, night moisturizer with niacinamide).",

        "body": "Have repurchased:\n\n* The cold and flu capsules \n* Colgate sensitive toothpaste \n* Skin Nutrition Botanicals 5% niacinamide + squalane.\n* Global Beauty Care collagen eye cream/skin cream. \n\nWould repurchase: \n\n* Pretty much all, except I’m always trying new products so I’m usually moving on to the next thing. \n* I’d get the deodorant since it’s travel size, but a different scent. \n\nWould not repurchase:\n\n* B Pure Hydrating Gel Cream - I just don’t like the scent. Also the product was too fluid for the jar and leaked a bit when on its side. But, I think it does work as a cold cream cleaning balm in a pinch. \n* Pro Silk shampoo - maybe I’d get it again because of the value size. But it’s just not my favorite texture (runny). \n* Xtracare revitalizing body balm - didn’t really have a need for it. Thought I could use it for thigh chafing but I think it’s probably too stiff in texture to glide well. Didn’t try. \n* On this note I did try a gel stick again anyway, which I reviewed this week: [LA Splash Soothing and Cooling Stick](https://www.reddit.com/r/dollartreebeauty/s/yAX1l7nNnv). Yes it glides better but still drags compared to skipping on a regular serum. Works better with a toner for extra skip. I still feel like I don’t really need this product. And the fragrance makes it less versatile too.",

Previously reviewed in a prior post about trying Muji travel size skincare. Milky texture. Its drying and smells like citrus due to the essential oil. WNR. Feels drying on my skin. Maybe someone with oily skin would like it more.\n\nIngredients: Water, 1, 3-propanediol, fine titanium oxide, talc, dimethicone, concentrated glycerin, sugar squalane, 2-pentanediol, lipophilic glyceryl stearate, behenyl alcohol, PEG stearate, POE (20) sorbitan oleate, PEG (80), lavender extract-1, chamomilla extract-1, calendula officinalis extract, tangerine peel extract, kiwi extract, oleoyl phytosphingosine, alanine, Arginine, sodium L-glutamate, serine, proline, sodium hyaluronate-2, dipentaerythrityl hexaoxystearate, POP methyl glucoside, BG, ethylhexyl glycerin, beeswax, polyhydroxystearic acid, isostearic acid, aluminum hydroxide, hydrated silicic acid, potassium hydroxide, xanthan gum, starch-sodium acrylate graft polymer, sodium alginate, citric acid, sodium citrate, natural vitamin E, fragrance\n\n**2. Rohto Mentholatum - Hada Labo Koi-Gokujyun Perfect Gel.** Travel size that I got at a random convenience store while in Japan. Soft gel-like texture. Good in humid weather. Not moisturizing enough for my dry skin. Its a decent moisturizer for me in the daytime in the summer. WNR. Again, maybe someone with oily skin may benefit more from this gel.\n\nIngreditents: Water, BG, glycerin, hydroxyethyl urea, pentylene glycol, PPG-10 methyl glucose, triethyl hexanoin, squalane, (acryloyl dimethyl taurine ammonium / VP) copolymer, behenyl alcohol, acetyl hyaluronic acid Na (super hyaluronic acid), hyaluronic acid Na, hydrolysed hyaluronic acid (nano-ized hyaluronic acid), hyaluronic acid hydroxypropyl trimonium (skin-adsorbed hyaluronic acid), hydrolyzed collagen, glucosylceramide (ceramide), suizenzino-polysaccharide (Sakuran), dimethicone, PPG-17 butes -17, triethyl citrate, cyclopentasiloxane, phenoxyethanol, succinic acid 2Na, dimethicone crosspolymer, agarten, EDTA-2Na, succinic acid, α-glucan, acrylate copolymer ammonium , Methyl paraben\n\n**3. Kansosan Medical Highly Moisturizing Cream.** A buttery and moisturizing cream. While shopping at Donki, I googled what is the best Japanese cream for dry and sensitive skin and Kansosan was suggested so I bought it to try. \n\nIts fantastic on my dry skin. It sinks in upon application but also coats my skin with a layer of moisturizing protection. Ive been using it for 2 days now and all I can think about is how amazing this would be for winters. Im gonna stock up when I go back to Japan. I think I found my holy grail moisturizer. I need to try other products from this brand. \n\nThis cream is like the better formulated version of the Kikumasamune sake cream and the Purito Dermide sleeping pack. Plus Kansosan doesnt smell bad. People who enjoy thick moisturizers like the Illiyoon and Aestura would like this cream.\n\nIngredients: Heparin-like substance\\*, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizinate\\*, Purified Water, Glycerin, Methylphenyl Polysiloxane, Cross-linked Methyl Polysiloxane, Decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, 1,3-Butanediol, Methyl Polysiloxane, Polyethylene Glycol-Methyl Polysiloxane Copolymer, 2-Ethylhexyl Dodecanol, 1,2-Pentanediol, Poly(Oxyethylene-Oxypropylene) Methyl Polysiloxane Copolymer, Isostearic Acid Hardened Oil, Anhydrous Magnesium Sulfate, α-Olefin Oligomer, Sodium Citrate, Glycerol Mono-2-Ethylhexyl Ether, Sodium Metabisulfite, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Citric Acid, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, dl-Alpha Tocopheryl Sodium Phosphate, Vaseline, Glycosyl Squalane, L-Arginine, Hydrogenated Soybean Phospholipid, Plant Sterols, N-Hydroxysuccinimide, Water Soluble Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Polyethylene Glycol Octyl Dodecyl Ether, Plant Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate (2), \n\n\\*denotes \"Active Ingredient\", no symbol denotes \"Other Ingredients\"  \n",

    "body": "Hey guys! I have been meaning to start doing brand reviews for some time now because I’m very loyal to a lot of brands that have worked for me, and am the kind of person who likes to try a lot of different products just for the sake of collecting data on what works for me. Paula’s Choice is a good brand for this because they genuinely have a product for nearly every type of concern or goal. I would like to first of all very briefly go over the history of the brand, and then I’ll like to go into their skincare lines and share my experiences on the products I have tried. The first line I would like to go over is their RESIST line, and since I’d like to cover each product in depth, I will do it by collection. I should also mention I was not paid for this, and while my view of this company is mostly positive, it’s because this website rewards research and I’ve been happy with most of my purchases so far. However, @Paula’s Choice I’m always here if you wanna slide into my dm’s xoxo. I also have been thinking of making video/audio versions of my posts just because of how wordy they get, but maybe that should be a sign to make them less wordy lol. Anyway, I’d love to know if there is interest in that. I also know they are a controversial brand here, and since this is just a thread to give people information, I’d love to hear the experiences you’ve had with their products, especially if they’re negative.\n\nI won’t be rating any products since I still have yet to try many of them. I have tried *many* items from this site, but when you go collection by collection you start to realize just how many products they have, which in my opinion is kind of an issue. It is also the reason I am doing this, as I have spent a lot of time trying to get through the overwhelming amount of products they have to find what is right for me. Moreover, if I have tried them, I will mention my experience and of course gush about my holy grails, but I will share any negative experience as well.\n\nPaula’s Choice is a skincare company that launched in 1995 after Paula had gotten international recognition for being a bestselling beauty author and calling out big skincare brands in broad fucking daylight. She at the time prioritized being open about ingredients, using sustainable packaging, and using the most efficacious and proven ingredients to get the job done. The company has been sold up to three times since, however, and is now owned by Unilever, who also owns Dermalogica. For better or worse, Paula’s Choice has embraced many of the things she used to rally against, such as eye creams (which they insist only have only been listed due to high customer demand) and needlessly overpriced products, and should more or less be separated from this crystal clean image. They are still a top quality brand with tried and true formulas, and they still do a great job at informing the customer, but they only inform the customer as much as their marketing lets them now. \n\n[Here is their own timeline of how the brand came about](https://www.paulaschoice.com/who-we-are/about-paula), but I will go over some important milestones. In 2000, they launched their BHA Exfoliator that we have probably all seen at this point. This was a game changer, and has been replicated in many products since. They have since added many more options for BHA, which I will list later on. In 2002, they launched their [Ingredient Dictionary](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary), which is an amazing resource for learning about ingredients. As with all education resources on skincare sites, just remember that skincare is a huge industry and consider the source. Either way, this was a very smart move of transparency, and I believe it is still one of their strongest assets. In 2008, they launched Beautypedia, which is genuinely a laughable site and I would discourage you from checking it out. It may have been reliable at one point, but it is now a Paula’s Choice circle jerk and they put down every single other brand I have checked out on there. It is hilariously biased, and is one of my least favorite parts of Paula’s Choice’s brand. I would also be willing to bet that they will quietly update reviews for other companies owned by Unilever, but I will not be checking in.\n\nThey are now a website with a bit too many products, and a line for every single type of skin you could really think of (except maybe people of color with their sunscreens 🙁). For instance, they have a CALM line for sensitive skin, a RESIST line for dynamic anti-aging concerns, a DEFENSE line to enable your skin to protect itself from environmental stressors, and a CLEAR line of products to aid in fighting acne. They also have a few lines with fewer products, as well as a good many products that explicitly don’t have a line. In this post, I will just be reviewing the RESIST line.\n\nRESIST:\nThis is perhaps their most varied line, as it covers those with dry and oily skin pretty well. Their lighter blue RESIST products are typically meant for oilier skin, and their darker for dryer. They base most of their formulations in this line (and in general) on the efficacy of antioxidants in fighting sun damage, protecting the skin from free radicals and future sun damage, and healing skin. They have an anti-aging line within this line, but I won’t be covering that because I think needlessly upcharging people for anti-aging products is shady at best and ageist at worst.\n\nThere are two cleansers in this line, and they are both focused on thoroughly cleansing the skin while retaining moisture and balance, though I do find their cleansers are typically very foaming and rough from the ones I’ve tried (the CALM and the CLEAR). The Optimal Results Hydrating Cleanser for dry skin would be your go-to here if you want a thorough cleanse, but you have dry skin to begin with and need to keep your moisture barrier in check. Looking at the ingredient list, it has some light cleansing agents with a focus on soothing antioxidants and emollients. The Perfectly Balanced Foaming Cleanser is the stronger of the two, destined for oily skin, and is focused on cleansing your skin of sebum and reducing pore size. This one has three ceramides, arginine, and aloe extract; so you really could do worse as far as formulations go. The hydrating cleanser is definitely better for sensitive skin, though; and while those calming ingredients help prevent the foaming cleanser from disrupting your skin barrier, I would still beware if you have sensitive skin since this is a wash off product and those skin soothers won’t have nearly enough time to sink into your skin. If what you need is a thorough wash, though, and you’re looking for a nice, calming formula, then the foaming cleanser would be great!\n\nThere are two toners: The Advanced Replenishing Toner and the Weightless Advanced Repair Toner. The first is their highest rated toner (on their site that is), and is a combination of antioxidants, essential fatty acids, and some nice hydrating ingredients. Looking at the ingredient list, I really don’t understand why this is their top rated, but I’d love to hear what people have to say. The second one is one of their more promising, albeit short toner ingredient lists. Its primary ingredient toted is niacinamide, but I think it is also worth mentioning willow bark extract (a natural BHA whose concentration is undisclosed as far as I know), retraversol, and licorice root extract. The willow bark extract isn’t going to go quite to the lengths salicylic acid would, but it is a solid BHA for people with sensitive skin. This toner is meant to absorb right into the skin, and should help with inflammation and clarity.\n\nThey also have two serums in this line, The Super Antioxidant Serum, and the Ultra-Light version of the same serum. Again, the dark blue/light blue dry skin/oily skin combo is at play here. Both of these are a collection of antioxidants, but they surprisingly have very different ingredient lists. The normal, dark blue serum is a vitamin c-driven antioxidant serum with ceramide NP and dimethicone towards the top of the list, whereas the lighter version is a hyaluronic acid and niacinamide driven antioxidant serum with dimethicone and sea whip extract. Their serums are horribly overpriced, and I would avoid them. You can find much better serums with antioxidants on the market for cheaper, in my opinion.\n\nThere are three moisturizers here, and two of them are in darker blue packaging signifying dry skin. They both are focused on repairing your skin barrier, but both have retinol which is interesting. I understand that retinoids can have a firming effect, but I wouldn’t really recommend it as a star ingredient for barrier repair. Both of them are at a .01% concentration, though, so I would be curious to see some studies on the effects of retinol at this very low percentage. Either way, the Skin Barrier Repair is an emollient moisturizer with glycerin, ceramide NP, and licorice and green tea extracts.The Intensive Repair Cream is a bit more of an oily cream with Jojoba oil right up at the top. This cream seems a bit more preoccupied with using skin soothing extracts such as watermelon, licorice, green tea, apple, soybean, and lentil extracts. This is a neat ingredient list, and should honestly smell really nice, but if you have any sensitivities to fruit extracts, I would avoid this one. The light blue moisturizer is called the Anti-Aging Clear Skin Hydrator, and is more of a gel than a cream. It also opts for vitamin C as its active as opposed to retinol, and completes this skin brightening effect with Niacinamide. As far as moisturizers go, this is very basic, though, and considering the price point I would opt for something else that is friendly for oily skin.\n\nOkay guys these are the ones I’ve tried! I became obsessed with their sunscreens earlier this summer and have sampled almost every single one. There are two in this line, and they are pretty different. The Skin Restoring Moisturizer with SPF 50 is the dry skin option, and this is one of my favorite sunscreens for a good glow. It reminds me of the same finish as the dewy moisturizer from Tatcha, which is a compliment if you have dry skin. It can, however, be a bit much for people who are looking for a matte finish with their sunscreen. The active ingredients are Avobenzone 3%, Homosalate 5%, Octinoxate 7.50%, Octisalate 5%, and Oxybenzone 5%; so this is for sure a chemical sunscreen! This burns my skin just slightly, and my friend whom I gifted it to while we were vacationing (he didn’t bring SPF to the desert!) reported the same experience. Also, I would caution against sunscreens containing both Avobenzone and Octinoxate as Octinoxate tends to catalyze the degradation process of Avobenzone in direct sunlight, thus necessitating reapplication. This is a silicon and shea butter driven moisturizer, and has some stellar ingredients in niacinamide, aloe leaf juice, and licorice, coffee, oat, and apple extracts. If you have low sensitivity to chemical sunscreens and are looking for a solid formula for dry skin or just a healthy flow, then this is your girl. Their second sunscreen in this line is their Super-Light Wrinkle Defense SPF 30, which is their only SPF composed of only zinc oxide (13%). To compensate, it is tinted, but I would warn BIPOC against this one as its tint is too bright for even my tanned white skin sometimes. If you are off-white/olive/slightly tan, though, this gives some great color correction. There is also some evidence behind tinted sunscreens providing better protection against blue light. This leaves a very matte finish on the skin, and I often will layer it under another SPF for a more glowy complexion. Zinc oxide also provides some oil and sebum controlling qualities that make this a solid choice for people with oily skin in addition to the finish. The ingredient list focuses more on antioxidants such as vitamin c and retraversol, and I believe is the first item in this line so far without a drop of glycerin. I use this one often, and my “glassy skin” routine needs its color correcting qualities. The fact that a full size is 2 ounces, however, is an issue, and I believe it goes against Paula’s original mission of sustainable packaging. I don’t see this changing, but considering they are popular for choosing basic but efficient formulations, they should realistically have better price points than they do. And that’s just in America! They have even crazier pricing abroad. \n\nTo get these items at decent prices, though, just be patient. They have sales almost all the time, and I would make good use of free shipping passes from their rewards program and/or free shipping promotions to try out their travel sizes, most of which are actually reasonably priced. They also have one of the more flexible return policies I’ve seen in the skincare world, so I would make use of exchanges on products that don’t work for you. I never buy anything without a promo or a gift card, and I’ve managed to score some solid prices on their site. Avoid buying elsewhere as many of their approved retailers like Sephora NEVER have sales! Rude tbh. They are also running their Anniversary sale right now, and I sometimes see the whole website marked down 20%.\n\nSo that’s it! They also have some exfoliants in this line, but I will be doing that in my next review, where I will go through the exfoliants in general. In the meantime, let me know your experiences with this brand and what you think in general!",

Like hair type: porosity, coil vs. S-wave, fine vs. course. There are so many things you have to figure out and remember, so it would be helpful to have a place to save it all. \nIt would be really cool if the app let you set up your personal hair profile, add preferences for ingredients, and scan barcodes. I think that would really set it apart from other apps and websites. If you don't already have a name, it could be My Curly Journey or something. \nI would be interested in helping test it when you get to that point! I hope you're planning to put it on the Google play store 😄",

    "body": "So I spotted the above-named product at the grocery store while meandering past the grooming section.  I picked it up and wondered if it was as good for a primer, as it's neighbor, Nivea Post Shave Balm, has been known to be.  I compared the two products' ingredient lists, and noticed some big differences.\n\n> **Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm**: Water, Glycerin, Isopropyl Palmitate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Bark/Leaf Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tapioca Starch, Triceteareth-4 Phosphate, Maltodextrin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol , Piroctone Olamine, Fragrance.\n\n> **Dove Men+Care Post Shave Balm Hydrating+**: Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 MA Crosspolymer, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, DMDM Hydantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Stearic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Panthenol, Sodium Lactate, Triethanolamine, Sodium PCA, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Ceramide 3, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Ceramide 6 II, Ceramide 1\n\nThe first thing that jumped out at me was the inclusion of silicone compounds in the Dove shave balm.  It contains cyclopentasiloxane and dimethicone.  Silicones are absent from the Nivea balm.  This is a pro or a con, depending on your skin type and the base of your foundation.  \n\nThe second thing I noticed that I liked was the inclusion of ceramides in the Dove balm.  However, they're mostly on the tail end of the list, so it's hard to say how much is actually in the products, and if it is present enough to do any good.  Certainly can't hurt.\n\nThe Nivea balm has the benefit of having tapioca starch in it's formulation, which can be good for oil, and it has Witch Hazel extract.  Both balms have pretty good ingredients.  Neither contains drying alcohol.\n\nSo I purchased it.  When I got home, I washed my face, moisturized as normal, then put the Dove balm on the left side of my face and the Nivea balm on the right side.  I eschewed all other primers.  I dabbed a little Maybelline FitMe concealer under my eyes, and used a RT sponge to apply some L'Oreal Infallible Pro-Matte.  The foundation went on very smoothly and did not cake up or pill.  I set it with NYC loose powder.  I added some blush and bronzer for some depth, then I went about my day.\n\nSix hours later, I surveyed the first round of results.  Aside from my foundation being rubbed off of the tip and bottom of my nose (got the flu), both sides looked okay.  I did noticed, however, that the foundation on the right side of my face was more textured.  I could see my pores way clearer than the other side of my face.  Both sides were moderately oily.  The left side of my face was holding up somewhat better than the right side.  I noticed fewer flakes around the dry spots of my face on the left side.  At eight hours, all of these observations were more pronounced.  I noticed more oil on the right side, enough that my pores were \"shining\" with oil.  It was odd.  Neither side looked bad, however.  But for me, the left side (Dove) was winning out in the overall appearance category.  \n\nSo, for my initial testing, Dove Men+Care Post Shave Balm Hydrating did better than Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm, as a foundation primer.  Both have pretty good ingredients, both are alcohol free, and each can serve certain skin types better than the other.  Cheers! ",

    "body": "Nitong nakaraang mga araw may isang Tiktok content creator ang inulan ng comments sa kanyang Tiktok page dahil diumano sa hindi magandang paraan o istilo ng pagrereview ng sunscreen na ito. Dahil dito , naisipan kong bilhin at subukan itong sunscreen na ito. \n\nUna sa lahat, binili ko itong sunscreen na ito sa tingin kong official store nitong Worada sunscreen na ito. Ito yung store na may Worada din sa pangalan. Dito din sa store na ito binili nung content creator na binanggit ko kanina. Yung B1T1 na yung binili ko, yung isa sa usage test, yung isa naman e sa gagawin kong test sa lab. May kasama din pala itong freebie na Whitening Antiperspirant and Deodorant Cream (isusunod ko itong i-review). \n\nSimulan ko muna sa packaging. Yung packaging nito ay 50 g Cosmetic Pouch with spout. Ito ay gawa sa BOPP/VMPET/LLDPE/Aluminum Foil na sinadya para maprotektahan ng husto ang laman na sunscreen. Ito yung isa sa mga usual na material na ginagamit sa paggawa ng mga cosmetic pouch. Makikita din sa packaging na gawa pala ang Worada Sunscreen sa China. \n\nHindi ko nakita sa packaging ng sunscreen na ito yung mandatory warning para sa mga sunscreen na dapat present sa mga sunscreen products na binebenta sa ASEAN: Do not stay too long under the sun, even when using a cosmetic product. \n\nSa paggamit naman. Pagkabukas ko pa lang ng sachet nitong Worada sunscreen, naamoy ko na agad yung fragrance nito. Amoy milky floral ang fragrance na ginamit dito. Ang laman na sunscreen ay isang cream na off-white na may hint ng dilaw ang kulay (mas maputi ng kaunti sa evap na gatas). Kapag inilagay na sa daliri, nagbe-break na agad ang emulsion at nagiging matubig o runny, kagaya nung sa video review. Noong ipinahid ko ang 2-finger lengths nitong sunscreen, una kong napansin e masyadong maputi yung sunscreen para sa skin tone ko. Tinagalan ko na ang pagbe-blend nito sa buong mukha at leeg ko, pero sa huli halata pa din ang whitecast. Nasabihan pa nga ako ng kasama ko sa lab na nagsusumigaw yung sunscreen ko sa mukha. \n\nNgayon sa ingredients naman. Ito ang ingredients nitong Worada sunscreen:\n\nMilk, Aqua, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Titanium Dioxide, Glycereth-26, Potassium Laurel Phosphate, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Isohexadecane, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polysorbate-80, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Niacinamide, Trehalose, Tocopheryl Acetate, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA, Parfum\n\nUnahin na natin ang UV-Filters. May tatlo na UV-Filters ang Worada Sunscreen:\n\n* Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (UVB) \n\n* Ethylhexyl Salicylate (UVB) \n\n* Titanium Dioxide (UVB) \n\nBabalikan ko ito mamaya para mai-relate sa product claim nitong sunscreen. \n\nAng pinakaunang ingredient sa IL nito ay Milk. Maling entry na naman. Lac (Milk) ang tamang INCI name kung naglagay ng gatas as ingredient. \n\nRelated naman ang gatas sa susunod kong punto. Gumamit ng Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, at Propylparaben itong sunscreen na ito bilang preservative system. Angkop itong preservative system na ito, dahil ang taas ng ginamit na Milk sa formulation na ito. Nararapat lang na broad spectrum preservative system ang gamitin. \n\nPreservative Efficacy:\n\nParabens: Yeast and molds; Gram(+) bacteria\n\nPhenoxyethanol: Yeast and molds; Gram(-) bacteria\n\nRegarding sa safety ng parabens (methyl, propyl), approved for use pa yan ng regulatory bodies ng ASEAN at EU, basta masunod lang ang maximum allowed concentration. Pakitingnan na lang sa pic yung statement ng SCCS, ang committee na inaatasan ng EU na magsagawa ng safety assessments ng mga ingredients kagaya ng parabens. Pero kung isa ka sa mga nakakaranas ng contact dermatitis dahil sa pagiging sensitive ng iyong balat sa parabens, mabuting iwasan na lang ang mga produktong gumagamit nitong mga preservatives na ito. \n\nSunod, may laman naman itong mga ingredients na moisturizing sa balat: \n\n* Glycerin (humectant) \n\n* Trehalose (humectant) \n\nPara naman sa whitening:\n* Milk\n\n* Niacinamide\n\nMay antioxidant din: Tocopheryl Acetate\n\nSunod nating tingnan ang product claims ng Worada sunscreen:\n\n* SPF 60 PA+++ UVA-UVB Protection\n\n* Invisible\n\n* Waterproof\n\n* Sweat Resistant\n\n* Lsolate Skin (nasa harap, di ko naintindihan kung anuman ito) \n\n* Whitening\n\n* Moisturizing\n\nSa SPF claim, hindi ko mawari kung papaano nasabi ng brand na ito na may UVA protection ito, samantalang yung tatlong UV-filter nito e puro UVB protection ang kayang ibigay. Dagdag pa, wala pa akong nakikitang SPF test report para sa Worada sunscreen na ipinakita ng brand owner sa kanilang soc med accounts. Kung meron man, makikicomment na lang sa baba. \n\nSa claim na invisible, hindi naman invisible e. Kitang kitanang white cast e. \n\nSa water proof claim, hindi pwede ang water proof claim. Water resistance ang tamang ilagay jan. At kailangang may patunay na tinest ito, kesyo ito ay 40 min or 80 min water resistance. Ganoon din sa sweat resistance. May test din para jan, either 40 min o 80 min, kagaya ng water resistance. \n\nYung Lsolate Skin na claim na nasa harapan, malay ko jan. Kailangang i-clarify ng brand owner yan. \n\nSa claim na moisturizing at whitening, meron namang ingredients na laman ang sunscreen para masabi kahit papano na pasok ang claim nila. Ang concern ko lang e yung paggamit ng Milk. Matumal ang mga studies kung sa nakakapagpaputi ang gatas. Tapos, takaw-mikrobyo pa yan. Mabuti na nga lang, ginamitan ng broad spectrum preservative system. Pero kung mahina ang preservative system nito, madaling masisira ang product na ito. \n\nFinal words:\n\nMarami akong concerns na nakita sa product na ito. Una na jan yung kung SPF-tested ba talaga ito. Pangalawa yung claim na may UVA protection, pero malabo base sa mga UV filters na ginamit. Ikatlo, yung mga unallowed (water proof) at unsupported (water resistant at sweat resistant) claims. Yang tatlo na yan, major red flags na agad dahil hindi tama na magki-claim para sa product na hindi pa naman nagtetest. Palaging tandaan, sa mga product claims, laging dapat may kaakibat yan na substantiation. Kasi napakadali gumawa ng product claims, ang mahirap e patunayan kung tunay ba talaga yan. Performance-wise, hindi para sa akin itong sunscreen na ito, dahil ayoko ng whitecast. \n\nAbangan ang Part 2 para sa mga isasagawa kong mga test sa lab. \n\nAyun lang. Salamat sa pagbasa. \n",

I may or may not have been keeping a weather eye on upcoming SPF releases ever since Director Ahn In-Sook mentioned in passing in a video that many cosmeceutical brands have either put a stopper on releasing new sunscreens or postponed the release of those awaiting completion to better the formula and ensure they're up to snuff, thus there will be a slew of SPF releases come March. ~~Heaven forfend we suffer the wrath of deadly solar lasers cuz finding The One is nothing short of a bluidy struggle.~~\n\nWhat I've noted in these new releases was a combination of robust formulas and new filters. *Exciting!* I've already translated the INCI lists and entered them into Incidecoder & Cosdna.

The About Me Be Clean seems to be alcohol and fragrance-free (non sure if rosemary leaf oil is an essential oil and fragrant??). I would probably go with the Innifree though because I prefer alcohol in my sunscreen, otherwise they are too too dewy and greasy looking, and the ingredient list is rather simple. If only it didn't have fragrance, but I can compromise with that. The Dr. G has too many unnecessary ingredients and many comedogenic ingredients like myristic acid, so I would stay away from it.",

    "body": "As someone being extremely acne-prone and sensitive to cream bases/fatty alcohols, I have a very hard time finding good moisturizers. Because of my skin issues, I've naturally been drawn to gel moisturizers and I have tried many but often times don't find them hydrating enough. They all had stuff I didn't like:\n\nGarnier Moisture rescue gel:Highly fragranced and also has alcohol in it (alcohol denat! why is this in a \"moisturizer\"?)\n\nClinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing gel: Amazing texture that soaked right into skin and never let my skin feel greasy. I used this for years until it was not hydrating enough and also did a search for it on cosdna and found a couple pretty comedogenic ingredients in it. Discontinued use.\n\nClinique Moisture surge: There was a time when I really liked this stuff. But sometimes, after I'd put it on my face using my hands, my hand and face honestly felt like they took a bath in a tub full of silicone. It just feels like there's tons of it in this gel-cream. \n\nClinique moisture surge intense: Even though oil free and meant to be a gel-cream, felt more creamy than I usually like. Also felt kind of heavy/waxy at times.\n\nPhilosophy Take a deep breath: Sister loves this stuff. I tried it and found it thick and almost waxy feeling in a weird, gel-cream texture way. Smelled funny too. Blech! Returned.\n\nPhilosophy clear day ahead: this had salycilic acid in it i believe. Plus, it smelled SO horrible, like plastic? And generally smells don't bother me so I was surprised how much this one bothered me. Also had a weird texture and felt like it dried me out more vs. moisturizing, obviously because of the salycilic acid in it. Returned.\n\nSimple ultra-light hydrating gel: I did like this, plus it has no fragrance no dyes etc and nothing that can cause breakouts (unless you are sensitive to dimethicone, this has that). it is just a little on the thick side and can feel sticky upon application, and at times does not feel hydrating enough.\n\nBelif aqua bomb: This stuff is really popular at Sephora and it got recommended to me by someone who worked there. I've been to two Sephora's and I've had two employees there tell me this is oil free. It is not oil free. I mean, no offense to Sephora employees (I used to work there at one point) but if you're not sure, don't just throw things around randomly and give customers false information. It felt really nice going on but I think the oils in it eventually broke me out and my face got realllly greasy through the rest of the day with it on. I'm not 100% sure but I believe I also saw that it contained alcohol. \n\nBUT.\n\nI recently tried the Neutrogena hydro boost gel cream. Just be careful, there are two versions, and the containers look exactly identical. There is one called the neutrogena hydro boost WATER GEL. this is the one you want to stay away from. I don't know full ingredients but it has dye and fragrance in it. The one you want to look for is the neutrogena hydro boost gel-cream for extra dry skin. This stuff is MAGIC. It was so smooth, cooling, silky, not heavy or greasy AT ALL. I applied this last night after stridexing my face and my face felt like a baby's bottom, I'm not even joking. I woke up in the morning and it was completely soaked in. I just had smooth, hydrated, supple skin. So if you've been struggling like me, try this cream. It is fatty alcohol free, does not have any comedogenic ingredients (checked cosdna) dye free, fragrance free, and oil free. Even though it is listed for extra dry skin, I think it's perfect for oily/combo/acne prone skin. Try it! Hope this was helpful =)\n",

    "body": "Noticed that a lot of the same questions get asked over and over again, so I thought I would start a thread with the basics! Feel free to add to what I wrote in the comments! \n\n-  hair care: first step is determining if you have curly, wavy or straight hair as curly/wavy hair needs to be cared for differently than straight hair. If your hair is \"poofy\" \"frizzy\" or \"unruly/uncooperative\" it's highly likely you have curly/wavy hair that isn't being properly cared for. (Pop on over to r/curlyhair for more in depth routine if so). But basically, you want to use a gentle routine for your hair so it stays moisturized and soft. The best way to do this, for all hair types, is to cut out harsh sulfates and silicones. The harsh sulfate I am talking about is sodium laurate sulfate (it is the in the first three ingredients in most shampoos). This is a *clarifying* shampoo. Sodium laurate sulfate is used for deep cleaning and for removing silicones (a wax like substance that coats your hair giving it the appearance of being healthy but long term damages hair because it prevents your hair from properly absorbing moisturizing ingredients). A clarifying shampoo should be used roughly once a month to remove build up, but most people use it everyday: this causes dry and damaged hair. It strips your hair of moisture, and then silicones (in most conditioners) coat your hair and prevent your hair from replenishing all the moisture the shampoo stripped from it. This can actually cause your hair to be *greasy* as your scalp will overproduce oil to try and compensate for the drying shampoo. So, this is what you should do instead: do one last clarifying wash (any shampoo with sodium laurate sulfate and no silicones will do, but a cheap option for this is most VO5 shampoos, should have SLS as one of the first three ingredients and say no silicones on the bottle) and then follow up with a silicone free conditioner (a cheap option for this is suave daily essentials conditoners) silicones is written as Dimethicone, so as long as there is no Dimethicone in the conditioner, you're good. Dimethicone PEG-8 or higher is fine. Once you do this clarifying wash, set the SLS shampoo aside and dont use it again for a few weeks! Now use a mild sulfate shampoo instead- I like trader Joe's tea tree tingle, but there's lots of options. The holy grail list on r/curlyhair has tons of suggestions. \n\n\nSwitching to a gentler shampoo and cutting out silicones should make your hair felt softer and get greasy less often. If you feel so inclined, you can also do deep conditioning treatments for your hair. Some common ones are aloe vera gel (just get a leaf from the grocery store and scoop out the blend the gel), castor oil, avacado, olive oil, argan oil, jojoba oil, plus lots more! Deep conditioning is necessary for curly or thick hair, but if you have straight or thin hair, then it's likely not necessary (altho it never hurts!) \n\nMake sure you really rub your scalp (not with your nails!) while shampoing/washing/rinsing  (check r/curlyhair for technique if this is unclear) \n\nTurn down the heat in the shower! Super hot water is bad for your skin and hair! Cold water while rinsing out your conditioner should give your hair a nice shine! \n\nAlso, sleep on a satin or silk pillowcase and NEVER brush your hair while wet!  Give yourself regular  scalp massages. Try not to wear your hair pulled back in tight hair styles as this is harsh on your hair line and causes breakage. \n\nAll of these combined should reduce breakage and help you have soft, shiny hair! It can also help thicken your hair (assuming your hair isn't naturally thin-- genetics does play a role here) \n\n\n- skin: you want a skin care routine (check out r/skincareaddiction for more in depth info/routine help also see a dermatologist if you have really bad acne) . Basically, you need a cleanser and a moisturizer, at the very least. Many people also use chemical exfoliants. Skin care is individual to each person so it's hard to recommend products without knowing your skin BUT a routine that is basic and works for a lot of people is: \n\nAM: wash with water, pay dry, moisturize (some good brand are cerave and cetaphil- they work for a lot of people), apply sunscreen if going outside \n\nPM: wash with gentle cleanser (again cetaphil or cerave are good brands) , use stridex wipes in the red box, wait 15 min., apply moisturizer \n\nYou can obviously have a much more elaborate routine than this, but this is a good beginner routine. \n\n- teeth: if you are concerned about yellow teeth, make sure you floss at least 3 times a week, use a quality electric toothbrush, brush your teeth twice a day (am and pm) and use an anti cavity or whitening mouthwash (one without alchohol as alchohol makes your breath stink in like 20 min lol). Cut down on the coffee and sugar (it stains teeth).  If you have dark stains on your teeth, this won't completely get rid of them, but this is a good place to start. If your teeth are only mildly stained, this should fix the issue. \n\n- body: if you have body acne, use a body wash with salicylic acid. For your armpits, use stridex in the red box, witch hazel or a scrub after/in the shower, and then wait 15 to apply deodorant. This should help you stay smelling fresh for longer by getting rid of any clogged pores and sloughing off dead skin. \n\n- Lips: to have soft lips, you have to moisturize! You want to use something moisturizing like shea butter  or coconut oil and then apply vaseline/petrolum jelly! Petroleum jelly *does not actually mosturize* it just *seals in existing moisture*. So you *must* do both steps if you want soft lips. Most chapsticks only hav petroleum jelly which is why they make your lips feel better for a bit, but soon enough they're super dry again. If you have chapped lips, before you can moisturize you have to get the dead skin off. A good way to do this is to slather your lips in oil (the shea butter or coconut oil or jojoba oil will work fine) and then brush your lips with an old manual toothbrush. The dead skin should peel off. \n\n- Shaving: shaving with olive oil or coconut oil can reduce shaving bumps. Coconut oil can clog your razor though, so be aware of that. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions! \n\nHelpful Subs for beauty related questions: r/beauty r/curlyhair r/skincareaddiction  r/hair  r/malefashionadvice r/femalefashionadvice ",

    "body": "**CoTZ Sunscreen Review (Part One?)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ogkbnjalmbc51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74541de92caf8a4ccb74b007f922509d62a1848b\n\nWell hey there!\n\nAfter striking out with a number of Supergoop! face sunscreens (more reviews coming soon)…I decided to incorporate a new brand into my routine in hopes to give my skin a chance to recover. I really dove into ‘Best Mineral Sunscreens For Dark Skin” videos/posts and ended up purchasing a number of recommendations. The CoTZ Flawless Complexion Tinted Sunscreen came up a few times. So, I grabbed that along with their Sensitive Non-Tinted Sunscreen.\n\nBoth products are 100% mineral based sunscreens with 20% Zinc Oxide as the UV protector. The tinted version contains Mica and Iron Oxides for color but outside of that the formulations are nearly identical. Various silicones, preservatives, and texturizes make the list for both products.\n\nCoTZ focuses on mineral based sunscreens that are relatively “clean” and suitable for sensitive skin. No dyes, fragrance, or essential oils are here which is nice to see (and a nice change from the potpourri bowl that is Supergoop!). The brand name itself stands for Contains Only Titanium Zinc…a nod to the focus on physical SPF.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/er2a827mmbc51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=03a682918bc1a5e6fca56553c0f80811ed71ed0c\n\nBoth sunscreens have a rather thick/creamy texture that in turn applies a bit heavy as well. But, this heaviness absorbs down within a couple of minutes with a “residue” that I don’t have an issue with. Those that have kept up with my reviews (LOL) know that I really like that K-Beauty glow/near shiny look. These sunscreens from CoTZ provide that for sure without being greasy (for me).\n\nBut aside from the application and feel…the white cast (or lack of) from these mineral sunscreens is really what sets them apart. The very minimal white cast from the non-tinted version and the total lack of white cast from the tinted is something I have not experienced from a Zinc Oxide based product before. Seriously…I was ready to grab every other SPF in my stash and give it all away. “This is all I need for the rest of my life!” I thought LOL!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qm8hmunmbc51.jpg?width=2316&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0981a2fd35f82b034386bb64e24973b9264ef8d\n\nThe Sensitive Non-Tinted Sunscreen does start to show its mineral roots after a few layers throughout the day (especially when exercising/sweating). But still, the white cast is minimal compared to other products I have used. As for the Flawless Complexion Tinted Sunscreen…I could just layer and layer that stuff on. I think this particular tint is just a really, really good match to my skin tone. It totally masks any white cast and disappears into my skin. CoTZ isn’t kidding with their “Vanishing Zinc Oxide” marketing.\n\nI won’t throw out my other sunscreens just yet LOL…and will keep testing/reviewing mineral sunscreens from brands like Australian Gold, Elta MD, and Versed. Hopefully there will be some more winners in the bunch but for now I am happy to say I have found my new favorite sunscreen brand. The tinted version would be my overall go-to but with the tint liking to transfer to my face masks…I find myself reaching for the non-tinted version just as often.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jwzwmadpmbc51.jpg?width=2316&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3a59f1d13f6e5e23331ac0775bed47c48cfe860b\n\nHonestly, I think anyone who has struggled with finding a decent mineral sunscreen should give these a try. My only hesitations in recommending them would be if you have particularly oily skin, need something that can stand up to a good workout, or really prefer a matte finish SPF. These two products will range from dewy to rather heavy depending on your skin type and neither really “dry-down” all the way. CoTZ makes some primer/matte style sunscreens and I am tempted to give them a go.\n\nI’m so happy to have stumbled across these two sunscreens as they were a much needed reprieve from Supergoop! (not everything has been a miss so far from that brand…but most everything LOL). Part of me wishes I would have invested in the entire CoTZ product range and reviewed that vs. Supergoop!…ah well.\n\nNeedless to say I’ll be keeping a couple of bottles of CoTZ sunscreens in my stash going forward. \n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nSensitive Skin Non-Tinted Sunscreen: **Active Ingredients:** Zinc Oxide 20% **Purpose:** Sunscreen **Inactive Ingredients:** C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Cetyl PEG/PPG 10/1 Dimethicone, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Disodium EDTA, Glycerin, Hydrogen Dimethicone, Microcrystalline Wax, PEG-10 Dimethicone, PEG-30 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Chloride, Stearyl Dimethicone, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Water\n\nFlawless Complexion Tinted Sunscreen: **Active Ingredients:** Zinc Oxide 20% **Purpose:** Sunscreen **Inactive Ingredients:** Bismuth Oxychloride, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Cetyl PEG/PPG 10/1 Dimethicone, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Disodium EDTA, Glycerin, Hydrogen Dimethicone, Iron Oxides, Mica, Microcrystalline Wax, PEG-10 Dimethicone, PEG-30 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Chloride, Stearyl Dimethicone, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Water\n\nWhere To Buy (Link To CoTZ Site - Prices Vary Depending On Product/Size): [https://cotzskincare.com/mineral-sunscreens/](https://cotzskincare.com/mineral-sunscreens/)",

    "body": "Alright, so SkincareAddiction's Holy Grail of moisturizers doesn't work for you. You might have broken out or even developed a skin condition like me (contact dermatitis, yay!). You're desperate, you want to fix this, you are even willing to shell out more than your budget allows just to get rid of it. This post is for you. I'll walk you through the steps of figuring out what went wrong, and how to avoid making the same mistake in the future. \n\n**Why did I break out?** \n\nLet's look at the ingredients in CeraVe's moisturizing cream and run them through CosDNA:\n\n**FYI: skincare ingredients are usually listed in descending order. That is, from what ingredients they contain the most of to the least of. This is important in determining what went wrong with your skin, as it's more likely for the ingredients high on the list to be the irritant.**\n\n**Cetearyl alcohol and ceteareth-20** are fairly high up in the list, and combined they are known irritants. Despite the name they are not the type of alcohol you're most familiar with (drying), but fatty acids often derived from oils. I should mention it is uncommon to have a sensitivity to fatty alcohols, but it does happen, particularly in acne-prone skin. So make a mental note of it. Common fatty alcohols: **stearyl, cetyl and cetearyl alcohol.** \n\n**Caprylic/Capric triglycerides.** These are coconut derived ingredients that work as occlusives. They can cause clogged pores.\n\n**Dimethicone** is a silicone functioning as an occlusive. If you have broken out from silicone-based makeup primers in the past, this ingredient might be worth taking note of as well. \n\n\n**Where do I go from here?**\n\n Now that you have a general idea of some ingredients that could have irritated your skin, you can form a battle plan. First off I want to mention that you should definitely make an appointment with your derm if your skin is so uncomfortable that it is interfering with your daily routine.\n\nI don't want you to fear these ingredients. They are generally beneficial and harmless. What I want is for you to take note of the possible irritants in CeraVe, and when you use another product and have a reaction, take note of the irritants in that. Then you can start making connections. \n\n**Your ammunition:** \n\nIf you're unfamiliar with the site [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/), it is a database designed to analyze cosmetic ingredients. To use this tool, go to the [Anaylze Cosmetics page](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/ingredients.php), paste in the ingredients of a product and click Analysis. This should bring up the ingredient's function and their irritant and acne ratings.\n\n \n**FYI: CosDNA's comedogenic rating system is based on data from old rabbit ear studies. Treat it as a guideline and not the be all end all.**\n\n**The Plan:** \n\n\n* Put on some inspirational music. \n* Pick your website of choice with good shipping rates or whatever you look for in a cosmetics website. I chose well.ca\n* Arrange the products from lowest price to highest if the site has that feature. Write down all the products you see within your budget. \n* [This is my finished list.](http://i.imgur.com/XZLuwsC.png)\n* Analyze the ingredients.\n\n**FYI: While some products may be cheap, they might also be skimpy on the amount of product they contain. It's a little bit deceiving if you're working within a budget. It makes a lot of sense to instead sort things by the price per mL. Sometimes products that cost a bit more but also contain more product are worth the investment.**\n\n\n**Analyzing:** \n\nOkay, so one of the cheaper products on my list is Kiss My Face Moisturizer with Olive & Aloe. I found the ingredients list and put it through the CosDNA analyzer. [This does not look like something that would do well with my skin. ](http://imgur.com/a/rozIJ) \n\nLots of fragrance, lots of plant extracts, and that possible problem ingredient **cetyl alcohol** that we looked at earlier. Notable good ingredients: **allantoin, lecithin, squalane.** \n\nNext one I'll look at is [St. Ives Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin Facial Moisturizer.](http://i.imgur.com/0J5Ssw5.png) First of all, applying topical collagen won't be beneficial because collagen is [too large a molecule](http://www.smartskincare.com/smartchoices/myths/myth_collagen_creams.html) to penetrate the skin. Secondly, this has **fragrance, dimethicone and cetyl alcohol** which are all on our mental note list. \n\nYou get the basic idea. \n\nThe main thing I want you to take away from this post is how to do your own research. I mean, the reason I messed up my skin with CeraVe in the tub is because I didn't do my research and blindly bought something that is highly recommended on this sub. While a lot of skincare is trial and error, finding what irritates you and doesn't (and you should always patch test), hopefully this guide helps you to make more informed decisions on what you buy. I hope that when someone makes the same mistake I did and breaks out from CeraVe, they'll search the sub and find this post. \n\n**Extra:** \n[Products without fatty alcohols.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1ufvym/megalisting_products_without_cetylcetearylstearyl/)",

Available in different molecular weights. For some people, lower molecular weight HAs cause breakouts.\n2. **Glycerin:** A cheap, but very effective ingredient\n\n \n\n# Emollients\n\n* Ingredients that soften and lubricate skin.\n* There are different classes of emollients, but the ones we most concern ourselves with are fatty emollients\n\n**Skin concerns it's used for:** Dryness, Textured skin\n\n**Non-Exhaustive List:**\n\n1. Plant oils: Argan oil, Coconut oil, jojoba oil etc\n2. Mineral oil, Light liquid paraffin\n3. Plant Butters: Shea butter, Cocoa butter, Mango  butter\n4. Fatty Alcohols\n5. Squalane\n\n \n\n# Occlusives\n\n* They form a protective layer on skin to prevent loss of moisture from the skin.\n* Thicker or higher concentration emollients  also work, as an occlusive in addition to moisturising.\n* Difference between emollients and occlusives, is that emollients eventually sink in. Occlusives are supposed to sit on top of the skin, for the most part.\n\n**Skin concerns it's used for:** Sealing in hydration and moisture\n\n**Non-Exhaustive List:**\n\n1. Petroleum Jelly\n2.

Retinol\n2. Retinaldehyde\n3. Adapalene (Rx)\n4. Tretinoin (Rx)\n\n \n\n# Peptides\n\n* Collagen is a protein made of peptides in our skin. Think of Collagen as a building block in your skin. Your body naturally produces it, but the production reduces with age.  This can can contribute to skin ageing.\n* Topical collagen molecules are too big to enter your skin. But collagen peptides can. They are fragments of collagen. There are different kinds of peptides and they work by different mechanisms, but the end result is that they are **purported** to increase collagen production in your skin. (Purported because research on this is scanty and fairly recent.)\n\n**Skin concerns it's used for:** Aging, Wrinkles, Indirectly pigmentation\n\n**Non-Exhaustive List:**\n\n1. Matrixyl 3000\n2. Copper Peptides\n3. Agireline\n4. Palmitoyl Tripetides\n5. Tetrapeptides\n\n \n\n# De-Pigmenting Agents\n\n* This isn't exactly a class of ingredients the way the others, mentioned above, are. I'm grouping them together because this is a ELI5 series.\n* These are ingredients that work on different enzymes, pathways or mechanism of actions to prevent or reduce the possibility of occurrence of pigmentation or directly help with reducing pigmentation after it occurs.\n* Basically they're faders, brighteners or stop the trigger/transfer of pigment.\n\n**Skin concerns it's used for:** Pigmentation, Tanning, Dark skin\n\n**Non-Exhaustive List:**\n\n1. Niacinamide\n2. Kojic acid\n3. Alpha Arbutin\n4. Tranexamic acid\n5. Hydroquinone (Rx, can have side effects)\n6. Liquorice extract\n\n \n\n# Lipids\n\n* The outermost layer of skin forms a barrier with a protective function.\n* Lipids are cells that naturally exist in that barrier to strengthen and maintain it.\n* There are 3 main classes of lipids that are used as Skincare actives, **Ceramides, Cholesterol, Free Fatty Acids.**\n\n**Skin concerns it's used for:** Dehydration, Dryness, Weak or damaged barrier function\n\n**Non-Exhaustive List:**\n\n1. Ceramide EOP, Ceramide EOS, Ceramide AP, Ceramide NS etc\n2. Cholesterol\n3. Phospholipids\n4.

It shows the ways skin gets damaged and the step by step hyperpigmentation process it triggers and how different ingredient works at different stages to reduce hyperpigmentation.

I've been using this cleansing oil on and off for about 18 months.\n\n**Skin type:** I'm in my 30s, and my skin is generally oily (formerly dehydrated/oily), but has recently become a lot more dry due to the dry winter weather and prescription tretinoin use. My primary skin concerns run a wide gamut - I'm focused on anti-aging because of my age, but I also have acne, clogged pores, PIH, and melasma. My skin is very, very clog prone. Basically, my skin is a \"special snowflake\" that thinks the world should tremble in fear.\n\n**Location/weather:** I live in the Mid-Atlantic area of the US, so the weather is hot and humid in the summer, and cold and dry in the winter.\n\n**Other first cleansers I have tried:**\n\n* Heimish All Clean Balm\n* LJH Dr's Care Cleansing Oil\n* Whamisa Organic Flowers Cleansing Oil\n\nI have also, in the past, tried traditional OCM with mineral oil. It did not go well (lots of clogs), and in general, I now try to avoid cleansing oils with mineral oil in them, hence why I haven't tried some of the more popular cleansing oils on this sub. The LJH Dr's Care also contains mineral oil, and also didn't go over well with my skin.\n\nAnyway, onto the actual review.\n\n**Ingredients (copied from Ulta.com):** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Peg-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Peg-10 Isostearate, Bis-Ethoxydiglycol Cyclohexane 1,4-Dicarboxylate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Water, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Black Sugar Extract, Sodium Pca, Betaine, Threonine, Sorbitol, Proline, Lysine, Lepidium Meyenii Root Extract, Glutamic Acid, Arginine, Alanine, Butylene Glycol, Cholesterol, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Serine, Glycine, Alcohol Denat., Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake), Hydrogenated Lecithin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Ceramide Np, Sarcodon Aspratus Extract, Sucrose, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium Edta.\n\n**Price:** This oil cleanser is easily found on tons of websites. I most often buy from Amazon, and pay about $14-15 USD for a 200mL bottle.\n\n**Smell:** This oil smells *strongly* of lemon, with the faint hint of sugar. The smell is very noticeable on application, but once the cleanser is rinsed off, it dissipates completely. I happen to like the smell, but others may find it a little too reminiscent of Lemon Pledge.\n\n**Texture:** This cleansing oil seems rather thin - it seems to be slightly thinner and less viscous than vegetable oil. Sometimes this is annoying, as I have to use a little more oil than I'd like to really massage my face well without pulling my skin (3 pumps or so).\n\n**Cleansing Power:** In my opinion, this oil cleanser does a fantastic job with face makeup and sunscreen. It does not excel with waterproof eyeliner and mascara - it will remove some but not all waterproof eye makeup. I, however, do not like to use this on my eyes. I wear contact lenses and it always causes them to get milky, making it difficult to see. The cloudy residue lasts several hours. I do not know if this would impact someone who doesn't wear contacts. However, with face makeup and sunscreen, as well as with some superficial clogs, this oil cleanser does a great job. I sometimes, but not routinely, feel grits coming out of my skin. It does not help break up deeper clogs or closed-head blemishes.\n\n**Emulsification:** This stuff turns pretty darned white when mixed with water. I make sure to rinse all traces of it off my face so I don't see any of the cleanser, especially near my hairline. It emulsifies and rinses off easily, and doesn't leave any feeling of residue on my face. I always follow with a second cleanser, but I do not feel a film or greasiness with this cleanser. It also doesn't make my skin feel tight or dry - just clean.\n\n**Overall:** I really like this cleanser and have repurchased it many times. At the price point, it does what I need it to do. It breaks down the face makeup (Mac Studio Fix Fluid or Estee Lauder Double wear, topped with Innisfree powder) and my sunscreen (La Roche Posay Ultra Fluid). It rinses cleanly, and it is inexpensive and easy to find. I don't expect **any** cleanser to address aging concerns, or to meaningfully use acids. Any claims of brightening from a cleanser are probably worthless, since the product isn't on your face long enough to do any meaningful chemical exfoliation. This cleanser is best at what it does not do: it doesn't create new acne for me and it doesn't irritate my skin.\n\nIt is probably not my favorite of all oil cleansers. Right now that would be Whamisa, which is great, but expensive, and which also doesn't seem to penetrate pores as deeply as the Skinfood cleanser. Skinfood Black Sugar Perfect Cleansing Oil is a great choice that I will probably continue to buy it, especially since it's easy to get in the United States. I think it's an excellent pick for a first cleanser that isn't based on mineral oil, but only if you are not sensitive to fragrances.",

The extra oil in the makes it less drying than kose too.",

Like someone else said I also had problems with the pump and how it dispensed product - I found mine leaked sometimes. \n\nThe one I'm currently using is the Rice Water Brightening Cleansing Oil from The Face Shop and it's comparable in performance, texture and after effect IMO. I think the fragrance in it is lighter as well :) If you're looking to try something new I would recommend!",

Mostly wanted to comment on using it for eye makeup removal and me not wearing contacts. I use waterproof mascara and this product does a really good job removing it. Part of why I stayed with this oil is because it doesn't make my eyes sting when I use it to remove tight-lined eyeliner. The only problem I've had with it is some slightly blurry vision like you'll get with any liquidy product that's in your eyes, but even that effect seems to not be as present anymore since they updated the product.",
