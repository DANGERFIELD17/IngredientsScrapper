Glycerin, Urea, Coconut Oil, Jojoba, Gluconolactone, Aloe, Ammonium Lactate, Shea Butter , Cocoa Butter, Ceramide NP & NS & EOS & EOP & AP, Panthenol, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Tocopherol Acetate … oh, and enough silicones to seal it all in better than friggin’ Mederma???\n\nI’ve never had anything work this well or this long (until you wash it off) on roughness, KP, flaking, you name it. Please everyone go buy several bottles, I’m terrified they’ll discontinue it.\n\nEDIT: I *usually* use on my body cause I suspected it’d cause breakouts, but in a fit of desperation when nothing helped with extreme actives-adjustment flaking, I put it on my face. GONE overnight and some lingering cystic purge-monster-bumps dramatically diminished. WOW. WHAT. WOW. ",

    "body": "I wanted this to be thorough so this is going to be kind of long, sorry bout it.\n\nFor reference, I have oily skin and my routine before makeup is: wash with Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser, follow up with The Ordinary's Niacinamide then Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, then moisturise with Clinique DDMG, then apply Biore Watery Essence sunscreen. My current everyday makeup routine is primer, MUFE Full Cover Concealer on spots, NARS Soft Velvet Loose Powder all over, highlighter and Hard Candy Fast & Fabulous Makeup Setting Spray/Skindinavia Bridal Finishing Spray. I mention the different climates below in each review because I find my skin behaves differently in different places.\n\nThe primers I've tried are:\n\nELF Mineral Infused Face Primer, $6 for 0.49 oz, price per oz: $12.24\n\nBlack Radiance True Complexion Shine Control Primer, $5.99 for 0.84 oz, price per oz: $7.13\n\nSmashbox Photo Finish Foundation Primer, $36 for 1 oz, price per oz: $36\n\nSmashbox Photo Finish Foundation Primer Light, $26 for 1 oz, price pr oz: $36\n\nHylamide Finisher Matte 12, $24 for 1 oz, price per oz $24\n\nBecca Ever Matte Poreless Priming Perfector, $36 for 1.35 oz, price per oz: $26.67\n\nMUFE Step 1 Equalizing Primer in Mattifying, $37 for 1 oz, price per oz: $37\n\nSoap & Glory One Heck of a Blot Instant Perfecting Power Primer, $14 for 1 oz, price per oz $14\n\nThe ELF primer was the first I'd ever used back when I didn't really know shit about makeup. It's alright as a primer but utter shit for oil control. If you're oily and all about that matte life just bypass this one. To give a specific example, I used this once with Revlon Colourstay for Oily/Combo while I was in the Caribbean and my face was oily within 2 hours of application, which was disappointing because it specifically says \"Developed to combat against excess oil\". I've used it in a more \"regular\" climate and it held up fine enough but it still wasn't great. It's silicone heavy so it has that slippery powdery feeling when applied and if you apply too much it'll pill. Rating: 3/10\n\nNext I tried was one from Black Radiance. It has a light lotiony texture like any regular moisturiser and you can actually see a slight mattifying effect when you apply it. I've used this over the summer in the Caribbean with Revlon Colourstay and I currently use it with my current routine. It's honestly one of the best I've tried. When I used this at home in the Caribbean, I never really had an issue with oil. I would see some shine but I was never an oil slick. It held up even when I was walking around in the sun all day running errands and when I was out all night clubbing or whatever. Here in the states with my current no foundation routine I can see some shine after maybe 4 or so hours but it's not too bad, I can just do a quick blot and go. It holds up slightly better with the Hard Candy spray than the Skindinavia. Rating: 9/10\n\nNext I tried Smashbox's Photofinish Primer, their \"Iconic\" one. This one wasn't so bad. I can't remember much details about this one, only how it performed. It was used with Smashbox Studio Skin Foundation. I saw a slight dewy sheen after 2 hours and the oil started coming through around 6 hours but it looked like a natural shine it wasn't gross or anything. I think if it was used with a more matte foundation results might have been better. It holds up well enough against oil even though it doesn't make any oil control claims but I wouldn't repurchase this. Rating: 7/10\n\nNext, Smashbox Photofinish Foundation Primer Light. This was suggested to me by a Sephora SA and used with MUFE Mat Velvet Foundation and my current routine. It has a lotiony texture. This doesn't do shit for me, when I use this I'm oily within 2 or 3 hours. Big disappointment. Rating: 3/10\n\nNext up, Hylamide Finisher Matte 12. This primer can choke and die tbh lmao I hate this primer so much. This was used both at home in the Caribbean and where I am now which is a more regular climate. At home I tried this with Maybelline Fit Me Matte + Poreless and with my current no foundation routine. When used with the foundation I was oily and gross within the hour. Without foundation I was really shiny and it was really gross but not as bad as it was with foundation. I used this under powder alone when I was coming back to the states and I was oily 1 hour into the flight I literally cried when I saw what my face looked like. It does nothing to help combat oil and in fact I find it makes me oilier. It has a slippery silicone texture and when applied you can see a mattifying effect on the skin but that shit does not last. I tried patting it on, rubbing it in, under and over foundation. Rating: -10/10\n\nNext one I tried was Becca Ever Matte. It's hella thicc. You see the mattifying effect instantly, like it makes my face look desert dry but the weird thing is, it doesn't hold back oil? Like at all? I was oily within 2 hours with this one. I wasn't like, gross oily but I was noticeably oily. I tried to pat it, dab it, rub it in, so many methods and I got the same results. And wherever I put it my face gets white idk what's up with that. It just doesn't work for me which is a bummer because I had really high hopes for it. Rating: 3/10\n\nMUFE Step 1 was another one I had high hopes for but it ended up being a disappointment. It performs exactly the same as the Becca. It even looks just like the Becca. The only difference in the two is that MUFE has a pretty scent and Becca is scentless. But same performance, same results, same problems. Rating: 3/10\n\nAnd finally we have Soap & Glory's One Heck of a Blot Instant-Perfecting Power Primer (why is the name so long). This is actually my first time using this one. I did my face around 6:30 am and it's about 2:30 pm now. I saw shine around 9 but it wasn't too bad and right now it's straddling the line between acceptable and \"girl you need to blot\". It has a texture and look similar to the Becca and MUFE primers. As far as application, I applied it by dotting it all over my face and then rubbing it in. Tomorrow I'm going to try patting in it and see what happens. I bought this as a replacement for the Black Radiance because that one is just about finished so hopefully patting gives me better results. This one is on par with the Black Radiance. I see shine a little faster with this one but I like how my face looks 6 hours later with this one more than I do the Black Radiance. Rating: 9/10\n\nThanks for reading, hope this helps someone!\n\nEdit: In the last section the time originally said 8:30, which was a mistake so I fixed it.",

Oranges are high in Vitamin C)…however, “Fruit Extract” is extremely vague (as is “Essential Oils”) & there’s no way to know how many fruits, nor which fruit(s), are used to make the extract, how much extract is used from each fruit, what “extract” refers to—what’s extracted from the fruit(s) (oils, juice, rind, specific nutrients/vitamins, etc)?—, & how much “Fruit Extract” is in the serum, as a whole?…Being the 5th ingredient out of 11, I’m going to assume that amount is quite low…& that’s referring to: “FRUIT EXTRACT”-AS A WHOLE, NOT “VITAMIN C”-ONLY!\n\nSo, with ALL of that being said, without seeing a breakdown of wtf “Fruit Extract” is, it’s impossible  know exactly how much Vitamin C this product contains, if it contains any, at all…however, if I had to guess…based on the info given on the label, I’d say the amount of Vitamin C this serum contains (if it contains any, at all) is most likely extremely low, minuscule, almost absent…\n\nI hope this helps? … (Sorry I couldn’t give more of an absolute, specific answer…I hope I was able to somewhat answer the question, at least!)",

That's just me tho :) The Cosrx is definitely weaker, but suitable for those with very sensitive skin who needs very slow exfoliation.   \n\n\n**QUESTION TIME!** \n\nDoes anyone know anything about JainaFace? How legit is this brand?   \nI have their 10% Glycolic Acid that doesn't even tingle on my face and seems to do nothing at all. Meanwhile, Cosrx AHA liquid, that has a lower percentage of free acid even, tingles. I suspect this brand to be a hoax but I'm not sure. Their 2% salicylic acid doesnt' really do anything for me either *(and I have spent 12 months testing out salicylic acids)*.  Same with a friend, she says she tried some products *(HA and some vitamin C stuff)* but that it didn't do anything for her face at all.   \nI contacted JainaFace a couple of months back to ask **1**. why they are allowed to use 2% salicylic acid in their products when the limit is 0.5% in Korea, and **2**. why there is next to zero information about this brand.  \nThe person who answered was nice enough but I find it shady that they don't want to market themselves... They claimed they would have to think about it, if it was true that people were starting to think they repackage and sell an American product, or that their products are generally fake/Chinese.  \nNothing's really happened except I saw they made a reddit account and posted a statement in  a reddit thread that they're not fake :P",

    "body": "⚠️ **DISCLAIMER:** Since making this post, I've learned some new information that has changed my perception and usage of the term \"fungal-safe\". I've shared about this at length in my post [\"Fungal-safe\" skincare: unscientific BS?](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/IxvbUdN1jv) The TLDR of that post: there is no scientific proof showing that the ingredients excluded as not \"fungal-safe\"  actually cause problems for those with malassezia-related conditions. The concept of \"fungal-safe\" is something created purely based on the personal experiences of people on the internet. It is 100% anecdotal. I will no longer be perpetuating the concept of \"fungal-safe\" skincare, and all previous or future posts by me should not be considered advice, but merely recountings of my personal experience. **These are simply techniques and product choices that have worked for me, personally.**\n\n♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️\n\nIt's been over a year since I first made a list of fungal-safe products, for anyone dealing with malassezia follicutlitis (fungal acne), seb derm (seborrheic dermatitis) or similar conditions. Since then, more products have come on the market, reformulations have happened, I've used more products - plus I figured having just a list would be handy reference, since my first post was... really long 😂\n\n[My first list of fungal-safe products](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), with an in-depth guide to how I made my first fungal-safe skincare routine, and practical tips. Notable point is, since that post, I've learned that cetearyl alcohol is not fungal-safe, and switched to using https://folliculitisscout.com as an ingredient checker since I find it up to date, with that ingredient flagged. if any of you want to check if a product is fungal-safe - that's the website I personally use ☺️ If you want a detailed rundown of how and why these ingredients affect our skin, I highly reccomend the SimpleSkincareScience website - [Their Fungal Acne Treatment Bible post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) is very thorough and cites sources ❤️\n\n[My current routine in 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/uwmvkk/my_current_2022_fungalsafe_skincare_routine_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (more or less) with some haircare.\n\nThese are not recommendations, they're just useful information - some products have reviews linked, but please do use ✨️the search bar✨️ as well as other sources to check out other reviews, and make an informed purchase  ☺️\n\n**Disclaimer:** These products are not guaranteed to suit anybody. It's just that ingredients that are known triggers for seb derm or fungal acne - like plant oils, esters, fatty acids, etc. - are absent in these products. They may not suit your skin for other reasons. YMMV.\n\n**They will not treat malassezia related conditions**, they're intended as options for those who want to use a fungal-safe routine, to prevent flare-ups and maintain their skin.\n\nIF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU MAY BE SUFFERING FROM ONE OF THESE CONDITIONS, PLEASE SEEK MEDICAL GUIDANCE FROM A DERMATOLOGIST. These products are not a substitute for medical treatment.\n\n#✨️ First cleansers/makeup removers\n\n+ Solimo Micellar Water\n\n+ Garnier Naturals Micellar Water (the pink one)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil (plain pink original formula - does not emulsify, but can be used to dissolve and wipe off sunscreen/makeup, and followed up with a foaming cleanser)\n\n#✨️ Foaming cleansers\n\n+ Sebamed Clear Face Cleansing Foam\n\n+ Simple Kind to Skin Refreshing Face Wash\n\n+ Kaya Clinic Soothing Cleansing Gel\n\n+ Deconstruct Niacinamide Brightening Face Wash - 2% Niacinamide+2% Liquorice Root Extract\n\n+ Deconstruct Salicylic Acid Oil Control Face Wash - 0.5% Salicylic Acid +1% Niacinamide [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/y3ynhi/review_deconstruct_salicylic_acid_oil_control/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=2&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Deconstruct Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Face Wash - 0.5% Amino Acids + 0.1% Hyaluronic Acid\n\n+ Body Cupid Deep Clarifying Face Wash (with Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E) \n\n+ Body Cupid Tea Tree and Neem Anti Acne Face Wash (with Tea Tree Oil & Neem Extract) \n\n+ Body Cupid Vitamin C Brightening Face Wash (with Fruit Extract of Kakadu Plums) \n\nAll the Body Cupid face washes appear to be fungal-safe, but the ones I left out have \"menthol crystals\" and \"strawberry microbeads\" in, respectively, so... wouldn't recommend, even in theory 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\n+ Bliscent Lychee & Sea Buckthorn Face Wash\n\n+ Himalaya Purifying Neem Face Wash (tube, not foaming pump)\n\n+ Himalaya Tan Removal Orange Face Wash (not the scrub)\n\n+ DermaCo 2% Cica-Glow Daily Face Wash with Tranexamic Acid & Licorice Extract (contains something called \"Gillet-C\", which I cannot find as an ingredient anywhere, but seems to have something to do with vitamin C?)\n\n+ Mamaearth Charcoal Face Wash (with activated charcoal and coffee)\n\n+ Clean & Clear Natural Bright Face Wash\n\n+ Re'equil Fruit AHA Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Rejusure 2% Salicylic Acid Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/th4u4s/review_rejusure_2_salicylic_acid_face_wash/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Zitclin Zitcare Foam Face Wash (2% salicylic acid in a \"gel base q.s. containing aloe vera\". Pharma product with incomplete ingredients - currently using, will review)\n\n+ Pulp Off-Duty Cleanser - Aloe Vera, Azelaic Acid, and Alpha Arbutin\n\n+ Aqualogica Clear+ Smoothie Face wash\n\n+ Aqualogica Radiance+ Smoothie Face wash (contains menthol)\n\n+ Plum Green Tea Pore-Cleansing Face Wash (contains cellulose beads and glycolic acid)\n\n+ Put Simply Get Your Greens pH Balanced Gel Cleanser \n\n+ Joy Coconut & Coffee Skin Refreshing & Energising Anti Pollution Gel Scrub (contains walnut shell, coffee seed powder, and perfume - wouldn't suggest for sensitive skin)\n\n+ Joy Spearmint & Eucalyptus Mood Uplifting & Skin Softening Stress Relief Scrub (Seems to be a sugar scrub, contains spearmint & eucalyptus essentil oils)\n\n+ VLCC Mulberry and Rose Fairness Face Wash (contains mulberry, rose, orange and lemon peel extract and glycolic acid)\n\n+ Round Lab 1025 Dokdo Cleanser\n\n#🐳 Moisturizers\n\n**Note:** people with malassezia have quite an individual reaction to squalane. Sugarcane squalane is considered fungal-safe. Olive squalane is variable - some people with malassezia use it with zero issues, some find it aggravates their condition. I've mentioned the source of the squalane in these products whenever I've been able to find that info.\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you are dealing with active seb derm/fungal acne and want to be on the safe side, best to avoid products containing mineral oil, liquid paraffin or Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather - even too much MCT oil - can lead to oil and heat building up and cause flare-ups. Less is more.\n\n+ Body Cupid 99% Pure Aloe Vera Gel (OG Aloe gel for me. Soothing and healing for skin, plus I use it every time I shampoo - I use the WOW one only if this is unavailable)\n\n+ Rahul Phate's lnnovations Hydra-smooth Hydrating Gel (contains urea. Also gelatin - not vegan) [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/prsssq/review_of_rahul_phates_hydrasmooth_hydrating_gel/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n+ WOW Aloe Vera Multipurpose Beauty Gel\n\n+ Innisfree Aloe Revital Soothing Gel\n\n+ Innisfree Orchid Enriched Cream (contains squalane, adenosine, betaine, and a polypeptide.

Looks like a standard gel type sleeping mask, but their products tend to be heavily fragranced) \n\n+ Dot & Key 72 HR Hydrating Probiotic Gel Moisturizer With Hyaluronic & Japanese Rice Water\n\n+ Dot & Key CICA + 5% Niacinamide Oil - Free Moisturizer for Dark Spots & Acne (mentions oat oil, which isn't fungal-safe, but ingredients say oat meal extract, which is) - contains multiple ceramides\n\n+ Dot & Key CICA & Niacinamide Night Gel (contains oat flour, multiple ceramides and peppermint oil)\n\n+ Derma Essentia Advanced Mattifying Moisturizer\n\n+ Treeology 72 moist Moisture Therapy Cream with Pentavitin, Hyaluronic Acid & Ceramide - [reviewed here by our very own u/thesoapmaker_](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/rlet4a/treeology_72_moist_moisture_therapy_cream_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Dr. Sheth’s Aloe & Panthenol Hydrating Gel - contains urea, niacinamide and xylitol! It's more expensive that the Rahul Phate one, but on the pro side - it's vegan [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/sirkr3/review_of_fungalsafe_moisturiser_dr_sheths_aloe_1/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) \n\n+ Dr. Sheth’s Haldi & Hyaluronic Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer (contains \"haldi beads\")\n\n+ Dr. Sheth’s Hibiscus and Niacinamide Lotion (contains 5% niacinamide and allantoin, mentions lightweight but also contains occlusives like paraffin above the 5% niacinamide, so if ingredient order is reliable, this may be good for those with dryness)\n\n+ Dr. Sheth's Vitamin E & Ginseng Moisturizing Cream (contains light liquid paraffin as occlusive, so should help for drier skin)\n\n+ Earth Rhythm Sea Glow Gel\n\n+ Earth Rhythm Phyto Clear Oil-free Moisturiser (contains Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Extract) \n\n+ Earth Rhythm Depuff Undereye Gel (contains kojic acid,   botanical extracts)\n\n+ ONE THING Centella Soothing Cream ([my review here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/z72rrf/review_one_thing_centella_soothing_cream/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)]\n\n+ Zitmoist Gel (the [ingredients provided on the packaging](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/zitmoist-gel-50gm) are just 1% sodium hyaluronate and 0.3% allantoin, in an \"gel base containing aloe vera gel\" - incomplete list) \n\n+ e.l.f.

Yes. Do I appreciate that they clearly state when their products are malassezia safe? Also, yes 😂)\n\n+ It's Skin Aloe Relaxing Cream\n\n+ It's Skin Hyaluronic Acid Moisture Emulsion\n\n+ Aqualogica Glow+ Luminous Under Eye Gel (contains niacinamide, fragranced)\n\n+ CeraVe Healing Ointment (contains petrolatum, mineral oil, ceramides, hyaluronic acid and panthenol. Does also contain water, so I'd consider it a rich moisturizer rather than a balm/plain occlusive)\n\n+ Aveeno Daily Moisturizing  Body Lotion with SPF 15 (not the other variants, only the SPF 15 one)\n\n+ Nykaa SKINRX Ceramide Barrier Repair Deep Nourish Night Moisturizer For Oily Skin (contains ceramides 1, 2, 3, 4, 6II, cholesterol and oat extract)\n\n+ Nykaa SKINRX 5% Niacinamide Day Moisturiser with SPF 15 for Oily Skin (also contains alpha arbutin, ceramides 1, 2, 3, 4, 6II and cholesterol)\n\n+ Nykaa SKINRX Oil Free Vitamin C - Illuminate + Day Moisturizer with SPF 15 for Oily Skin (contains ethyl ascorbic acid)\n\n+ Nykaa SKINRX Hyaluronic Acid Hydra-X Night Moisturizer For Oily Skin (NOT the one of the same name for Dry Skin, that one contains olive oil)\n\n+ Truekind Daily Dew Hyaluronic & Squalane Water Crème \n\n+ Truekind Manjistha and Saffron Moisture Gel (contains botanicals, 1-2% niacinamide)\n\n+ Truekind Bio Exfoliant Brightening Sleeping Mask (contains botanicals, 1-2% niacinamide, less than 0.5% potassium azeloyl diglycinate)\n\n+ Truekind Acne Calming Herb Rescue Mask (gel mask with various botanical extracts - suggested use as sleeping mask/daytime moisturizer)\n\n+ Lakmé Sun Expert After Sun Cooling Gel\n\n+ Joy Hydra Refresh Ultra Light Gel (with glycerin, allantoin and D-panthenol.

Also bakuchiol, cica and green tea)\n\n+ Lacuna Light Daily Protect Gel Moisturizer (contains niacinamide and antioxidant botanical extracts)\n\n+ Ceuticoz - Moduseb Moist Oil Free Moisturizer (seems to be a pharma brand)\n\n+ Pilgrim Oil-free Gel Moisturiser (contains betaine)\n\n+ Suganda Centella Green Tea gel (contains cica and betaine)\n\n+ Aroma Treasures Lightening Pigmentation Gel ([ingredients list here](https://www.salonmart.net/aroma-treasures-lightening-pigmentation-gel-50-gm) - contains arbutin, botanicals including licorice, and essential oils)\n\n+ Nature Derma 1% Natural Biome-Boost™ Moisturizer with Subligana (anti-acne botanical, the claims ingredient is arctium lappa root extract)\n\nShoutout to u/Remarkable-Ant360 for sharing a ton of fungal-safe moisturizers, especially K-beauty ✨️\n\n#💆🏽 Oils/Occlusives\n\n+ Luxura Sciences MCT Oil (what I currently use, either mixed in or layered on top of other steps)\n\nAny MCT that specifies \"C8-C10\", \"capric/caprylic triglycerides\" and \"keto\" should be fine. People have asked me how I choose one, and having looked at the available brands on Amazon, I can say that the brands Sharrets, Carbamide Forte and Growfit appear to be C8+C10 only, so they're suitable. \n\nThe brands Laurin and Kayos, for example, also contain C12, which is lauric acid - NOT fungal-safe. The brand Simyl is available in chemists and very cheap, but it's meant to be a weight gain supplement for infants, and is not fungal-safe. That's about all there is to look out for when purchasing, the rest is trial, even for me ☺️\n\n+ Aiwo MCT C8 Oil (unfortunately the only C8 oil I can find, only available  in a 500ml bottle for around 2000 bucks)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil with Vitamin E (the original, plain one) - just mineral oil with vitamin E and added fragrance\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you want to be on the safe side, best to avoid mineral oil, liquid paraffin and Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather, even too much MCT oil, can lead to oil and heat building and cause flare-ups. Less is more, and if using mineral oil, a literal drop or two may be enough.\n\n+ Plain mineral oil/liquid paraffin - available at chemists. Not sure if it's less refined than the baby oil, but it's far cheaper (as it should be baby products are marked up like crazy) and has no fragrance\n\n+ Boroline/Boroline Night Repair Cream (waterless balm - same ingredients list, contains lanolin - not vegan - which may not suit some people's skin)\n\n+ Good old plain Vaseline \n\n+ Minimalist 100% Squalane (olive squalane, which works for some people with fungal issues and breaks some people out 🙃)\n\n+ Indulgeo Quench – 100% Sugarcane Squalane\n\n+ Indulgeo Squalane (70% olive, 30% sugarcane)\n\n+ PURITO Plainet Squalane Oil (sugarcane squalane, which is fungal-safe for sure. Will definitely be purchasing this myself, thank you u/imnumo!)\n\n+ The Ordinary 100% Plant-Derived Squalane [Edit: may be derived from different sources in different locations, will update if I find out details. From what I can find online, its derived from [sugarcane and beets](https://m.facebook.com/theordinary/photos/a.286843978083265/2326766210757688/?type=3)]\n\n+ Earth Rhythm Sugar squalane (ingredient list as 100% sugarcane derived)\n\n#🌤 Sunscreens \n\n+ Episoft AC moisturizer with microencapsulated sunscreen SPF 30 (water-based)\n\n+ Fixderma Shadow Spf 30+ PA+++ Gel (water based)\n\n+ Fixderma Shadow Sunscreen SPF 50+ PA+++ Gel (water based)\n\n+ Re'equil Ultra Matte Dry Touch Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA++++ (the blue one - silicone based) \n\n+ Brinton Healthcare UvDoux Face & Body Sunscreen gel with SPF 50 PA+++ (silicone based)\n\n+ IPCA Acne-UV Gel SPF 30 PA+++ (silicone based)\n\n+ IPCA Acne UV Gel SPF 50 PA+++ (silicone based)\n\n+ Missha All Around Safe Block Essence Sun Milk SPF50+/PA+++ - green (contains denatured alcohol as third ingredient, and various botanical extracts, water based)\n\n+ DermaCo 1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum SPF 50 PA++++ (has niacinamide - water based)\n\n+ DermaCo Hyaluronic Invisible Sunscreen Gel SPF50 PA+++ with Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E (silicone based)\n\n+ DermaCo Ultra Matte Sunscreen Gel SPF60 PA+++ (silicone based)\n\n+ Plum 2% Niacinamide & Rice Water SPF 50 PA+++ Hybrid Sunscreen (contains rice ferment filtrate. Water based)\n\n+ Phy Active Sun Protect Sunscreen Gel SPF 60 (no PA rating, contains niacinamide, green tea extract, panthenol, fragrance) - \"for men\" brand, same ownership as Plum\n\n+ Rivela Ultralight Matte Dry Sunscreen Gel SPF50 PA+++(silicone based)\n\n+ Bubblefarm Ultra Light Daily Sunshield SPF40 PA+++ (UVA/B)(water based) - contains Thermus Thermophilis Extract, a fermented ingredient, \"essential oil blend\"  and undisclosed \"eco-certified preservative\"\n\n+ Photon 360 Hydra Sunscreen Fluid Cream SPF50 PA+++ (water based) - near identical ingredient list to the Bubblefarm one, except it contains Yellow Iron Oxide instead of zinc oxide. Also contains Thermus Thermophilis Extract and \"essential oil blend\". The tinted version is not fungal-safe.\n\n+ Ekran Soft Spf 50+ PA+++ Silicone Sunscreen Gel\n\n+ CeraVe AM SPF 30 (broad spectrum)\n\n+ Heliocare Advanced Gel SPF 50 (broad spectrum)\n\n+ Kiko Cosmetics Daily Protection BB Cream SPF 30\n\n+ Banana Boat Baby Tear Free Sunscreen Lotion Spf 50+ Pa++++ (water-based)\n\n+ Banana Boat Simply Protect Kids SPF 50+ PA++++ (water-based mineral sunscreen)\n\n+ Sandiva One & Done Tinted Sunblock SPF35 PA++++ (purely mineral - contains 24%Zinc oxide, and iron oxides. Also contains sandalwood powder.  Silicone-based, waterless, comes in 4 shades)\n\n+ La Shield Sunscreen Gel SPF 40 Pa+++ (silicone-based, waterless)\n\n+ Z BLOCK Sunscreen Gel SPF 50+ PA+++ (purely mineral, silicone-based, 25% Zinc oxide)\n\n+ Derma Essentia Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50 Gel with Zinc Oxide (silicone-based, 25% Zinc oxide)\n\n+ Sunstop Gold SPF 55 PA+++ Sunscreen Gel (Silicone-based)\n\n+ Aurel Derma UVedge GOLD Ultra Matte Sunscreen SPF 50  PA+++ Gel (silicone based)\n\n+ Aurel Derma UVedge Soft Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++ Gel (silicone based, only zinc oxide)\n\n+ Vilvah Melt-In-Milk Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++ (silicone-free!

    "body": "#Vitamin C Products: L-AA vs the Derivatives\n\nI feel like lately we’ve been seeing a lot more affordable (and also more expensive!) vitamin C products and options on the market, and there’s been an increase in questions about which is the right option for you.  Some of the more common options available, and the ones I’m going to discuss, are the following:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n * L-Ascorbic Acid (L-AA)\n * Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (MAP)\n * Ascorbyl Palmitate (AP)\n * Ascorbyl Tetra-tetraisopalmitoyl (ATIP) *(also known as Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate)*\n * Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (SAP)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nVitamin C is an antioxidant, meaning that it will prevent and remove free radicals from the skin.   This is important, as these cells are damaged, often from pollution, and can age your skin by breaking down skin collagen. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThese vitamin C products have the capability to increase collagen production, help PIH, and treat acne.  It is an active, and while it does provide UV protection by protecting the skin from the above mentioned free radicals, it is important to use it alongside sunscreen.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n***\n\n\n###L-AA###\n\n\nThis is the preferred version of vitamin C derivatives.  The pros and cons of it have been discussed extensively, especially on this sub.  For in depth information on it, I recommend checking out the [Vitamin C Serum FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2h5n6b/the_more_you_know_vitamin_c_serum_faqs/).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nL-AA is *the* best form of vitamin C in terms of collagen production and UV protection.  So why wouldn’t you just use it?  It has a low pH (of approximately 3.5) that can cause skin irritation for some people.  It can also, in some cases, exacerbate acne. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nFurthermore, L-AA is unstable in liquid based solutions.  Some brands have tried to get around the instability by using powder suspended in silicone based solutions.  However, Brandon Truaxe (from DECIEM - the umbrella brand that makes The Ordinary, Hylamide and NIOD among others) has said the following regarding these solutions:\n\n\n> “In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.“\n\n\nThis means that for TO Vitamin C Suspension 23%, your skin is potentially using 2% of the vitamin C.  This is significantly lower than L-AA’s maximum absorption rates (20%); however, Paula from Paula’s Choice claims that research has shown that concentrations as low as 0.6% will provide protection against free radicals, and have anti-aging benefits.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThe last thing to keep in mind if you choose L-AA - normally these products have wait times (approx. 10-20 mins) and are best used in the mornings.  This will obviously increase your morning routine times.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n***\n\n\n###MAP###\n\n\nMAP is a water soluble solution similar to L-AA.  Unlike L-AA, however, MAP vitamin C products are stable.  These products will be also effective at significantly lower concentrations than L-AA, and are a better product for those with sensitive skin.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n10% solutions of MAP are considered to be high.  However, even with these relatively “high” concentrations (in comparison to the 10-20% commonly found in L-AA), only about 2-3% vitamin C will come in contact with the skin, as MAP must be effectively converted to L-AA.  Even at the low quantities, studies have found this to be the best derivative for brightening and you only need approximately 5% MAP concentrations to even out skin tones.  Studies have also found that MAP is better than L-AA at penetrating deeper layers of the skin.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nMAP solutions are not pH dependent, and do not need wait times in your routine.  TO says that their emulsion will absorb in 5-10 seconds.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**If you're interested in the collagen boosting properties of Vitamin C, please keep in mind that this is the only derivative that is proven to be as effective as L-AA.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n***\n\n\n###AP and ATIP###\n\n\nI’m going to talk about both AP and ATIP here because they’re very similar.  Both of these derivatives are fat-soluble.  Because of this, it may penetrate your skin worse than MAP or L-AA depending on the formula.  For these derivatives, it’s better to choose oil-based solutions (which will penetrate) as opposed to emulsions (which tend to be thicker and more creamy and these will sit on the surface of the skin).  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nAP is usually found in low concentrations, but it requires a low pH to perform and has more stability issues than MAP or SAP.  Furthermore, many studies cast doubt on whether AP is capable of improving collagen.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSimilar to AP, ATIP is also found in low concentrations (normally around 3%) and also requires a pH of about 5 to be stable.  ATIP doesn’t seem to have many benefits in comparison to other derivatives except when it comes to brightening complexions.  It's very mild on your skin, especially since it doesn't have any exfoliation properties. \n For anti aging properties, in comparison to MAP, ATIP is worse at preventing and removing free radicals - even other antioxidants like vitamin E perform better (AP will perform at least as well as vitamin E).  Furthermore, studies have found doubts that this has collagen boosting capabilities.  ATIP is also a relatively new product; there's been very few and conflicting studies into this. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n***\n\n\n###SAP###\n\n\nIt is more difficult to find studies and documentation on SAP in comparison to the other derivatives of vitamin C.  Similar to MAP, SAP is water soluble and stable at a pH of 7 making it a decent option for sensitive skin.  SAP will also convert to ascorbic acid on your skin, unlike other derivatives such as AP (I could not find any data saying AP converts) and will have very low concentrations.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSAP will stimulate collagen production, but it will not perform as well as L-AA or MAP.  It also will prevent the free radicals, but again less than MAP or L-AA. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nEDIT:  Sorry everyone apparently my reading comprehension is poor at 2am.  SAP is very beneficial for acne and can effectively be used  with anti-acne products like salicylic acid as outlined by both u/psithyrstes [here](http://wisderm.com/ingredients/Sodium+Ascorbyl+Phosphate#32-acne-vulgaris-treatment) and u/miclitis.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n***\n\n###References###\n\n\n1. “Antioxidants and Free radicals”.

Of course it doesn't have a huge amount of research behind it in general, but that still may be good to take into account for people who want an acne-friendly vit c and want to chance the fact it may cause acne in some people. \n\nThe second thing is about L-AA and I actually can't remember where the source is from. I've heard that L-AA \"tops off\" and that you really only need to apply it once every other day to get benefits, because your skin can't really absorb more than that.

Having tried a couple of L-AA serums (OST C20, Skinceuticals), I felt that the irritation (and the Skinceuticals irritated much less than the OST) negated the positive effects. I was getting more dehydration and overexfoliation and I couldn't use them often enough to see a benefit. I know multiple people who have accidentally overexfoliated with L-AA; it's important to treat it as an acid product, not a regular serum.\n\nOn the other hand, I've tried a few SAP serums and, when they're well-formulated, I find them to work far better for me and my dehydrated skin. A strong SAP serum (Aromatica's vitamin C serum, which is 50% SAP and an undisclosed amount of ATIP) cleared up my pregnancy acne within a month. And I've gone through a couple bottles of Dermapeutics Vital C (which I found at TJMaxx for $7 a bottle) and it helped boost the translucency of my skin and kept breakouts at bay far better than L-AA serums did. Also, no drying my skin out with wait times before and after, and no stability issues. It's a win-win for me.\n\nedit: typo",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

        "body": "My Mom had subtype 3, with thickened skin. She had it really badly her whole life. I have some rosacea but have done my best to try to not wind up like her.  Sadly, I gave up on facial sunscreen a number of times because they irritated me or made my eyes swell shut. I currently use Dermologica which is really spendy and I am not sure it's coverage is that great, but it's the only thing I can use on my whole face so far.\n\n\nTwo things than help me a lot were cutting out black pepper and using more foundation. Environmental irritants wreck me, it seems. I used to wear moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, power, liquid, more powder and then setting spray. Very heavy coverage, but I realized that pretty much sealing my cheeks off from the world made them finally calm down, or maybe it was something in the primer. I kept at it for a long time, but now use lighter coverage. My cheeks are red, but not nearly as bad. Between that and two laser treatments I think of my problem as under control, but can't go out barefaced. And since age is a trigger I could be unknowingly doomed to the burning sensation and painful cysts Mom had, but try to live like that isn't lurking around the corner. \n\n\n\nI've never been able to use anything anti-aging, so the ideal that a retinol might actually help me is very intriguing. All my current doc will prescribe me is metrolotion, which never helped in the slightest. I might go talk to a derm at my own cost and see if that or rhofade might be good for me.",

    "body": "For the purposes of this review of multiple products, I’ll be *categorizing items by routine placement* rather than when it was introduced.  These items are very much YMMV but I thought it may be helpful for some who are newer to AB (seen with the large influx of newbie questions I’ve seen in the DHT) or even those wondering about products generally.  Also **this isn’t a particular look at my routine(s)** or how my routine has transformed as I’ve learned more about my skin; rather, this review is of products used to target particular concerns.  This mega-review really came about after a response comment from /u/theCuriousAmerican (whom I thank for keeping me and much of the board in the loop regarding newer products/ lesser known brands in Korea).  I am over 30 but I haven’t started picking out my coffin lining just yet (rose gold silk, plz) so be aware this isn’t really an anti-aging post as I don’t consider myself having “mature” skin (whatever that means).  As I go through reviews, I’ll also include my rational as to why I purchased a product if it wasn’t impulse and link any relevant posts from the sub that informed my purchase. \n\nI've decided to break up this review and present categories like a series.  This post will be centered around 1st cleansers, hydrating toners, and serums.  The second post will be centered around oils, moisturizers/occlusives, and masks. *Also, I will only discuss AB/ sub-related products*. While I went through a smattering of samples, they will not be discussed. All products discussed were used for at least 2-3 months, if not longer. \n\nAbout my skin prior to developing a skincare routine: \n\n- extremely oily\n\n- flaky under makeup (my makeup would separate in hours and have dry patches)\n\n- riddled with closed comedones (whiteheads)\n\n- bumpy skin texture (under the skin pimples)\n\n- uneven skin tone, hyperpigmentation (PIH)\n\n- icepick scars\n\n\n**1st Cleanser**:\n\n\n*Heimish All Clean Balm*\n\n- Ingredients: [Posted from CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2186231803.html) so take with a grain of salt as anyone can add or delete ingredients. \n\n\nI've been using this balm since February. My initial impression was satisfaction. It melted well (not as well as Clinique's Take The Day Off), a slight herbal/citrus smell which didn't bother me, and a lower price point than TTDO. The price is really the main positive of this product. I don't find it cleans as well as TTDO so I have to use more product to make sure everything is eliminated. Nowadays I don't even wear a full face or any makeup at all really except Heroine waterproof mascara and Beauty People Lip Tattoo. I usually let this balm sit on my face for a minute or two before going at it and it does remove most of these products. Into May, I'm still satisfied with this product. Sometimes I only use this cleanser at night if I wasn't wearing anything but sunscreen since it does the job and I've worn a full face and it does remove base makeup well enough (even though I need to use more of it). It'll also last a bit longer, I'm thinking 2-3 more months, so at least 6 months of use for me. I also like that this comes in travel size (I got a few from a Ohlolly.com promo).\n\n\nRepurchase? I'd likely repurchase TTDO if choosing between the two, yes TTDO is more expensive but I liked that it removed makeup easier, it melted better as well. \n\n\nFor my next 1st cleanser, I'll likely repurchase TTDO or make my own cleanser as a way to dupe Tatcha's oil cleanser (beautiful cleanser, only had a sample but loved the feeling). \n\n\n**Hydrating Toners**\n\n\n*Kikusamusane High Moist Lotion* (30 mL decant)\n\n- Ingredients: [From CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_5173202878.html)\n\n\nRemember mid-2016 when kikumasamune was on everyone's lips? I purchased a decant of this hydrator partially on the [buzz](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3tgula/a_letter_to_kikumasamune_high_moist_lotion/?st=j2jobol7&sh=17239e4e) created by the sub and other blogs.  This product seemed like a good way to target PIH and increase hydration for my dehydrated skin.  It took me about 2 months to get through my decant. I'm not gonna go through my use of this product because it's been discussed by this sub so much (do a google search). \n\n\nRather, I'll discuss why I ended up not purchasing a full size of this product. I ended up not purchasing a full size because by then I felt my skin didn't need what the Kiku was offering. I didn't get any significant lightening of PIH, brightening yes but I felt I could get brightening from other products. I could get hydration from other products as well.  And I suppose I just wasn't *impressed* enough to want to purchase it. This was also when I realized I get bored of products and the thought of purchasing a 500 ml product seemed so daunting to finish. LOL. \n\n\n*Hada Labo Albutin Lotion Moist*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Arbutin, Disodium Succinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Methylparaben, PPG-10 Methyl Glucose Ether, Sodium Hyaluronate, Styrene/VP Copolymer, Succinic Acid, Tremella Fuciformis Polysaccharide (from hadalabousa)\n\n\nI recently finished this product (mid-April) and I'm so happy I never have to use this product again. LOL. I purchased this product in December on ABX. I primarily purchased it because of its ingredient list and was interested in using a product with MAP and Arbutin to see if it could attack my PIH in anyway. Also, I felt it would be another good addition for my skin that leans perma-dehydrated. Little to no smell, watery texture, and economical. \n\n**Performance**: Overall, I was significantly disappointed by this product and the longer my time away from this product the more I'm able to realize why I'm disappointed.  It just didn't do anything. It felt like I was throwing cloudy water on my face most of the time. Cloudy water that wasn't even showing a difference in my skin. I would take days off from using this product and saw no difference in brightness to my face. I also saw no lightening of PIH. I expect my toners to hydrate *at least* and it seemingly failed on this front as well. I added another toner to back up this one but I don't like wasting product so I finished it. I found it as a good way to give myself lotion masks and to hydrate my legs. Essentially, this may be the most boring product I've ever tried. \n\n\n*Meishoku Extra Moisturizing Lotion Moist* \n\n- Ingredients: [From cosdna](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_f35b176780.html)\n\n\nI purchased this toner around December from the r/abx with the Hada Labo moist.  I didn’t know what to expect purchasing this product but I did based on the ingredients. I was searching for a product that had ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids. I should also add that I was searching for a product that had the 3-1-1 ratio because my face does best with a pretty constant use of acids and I needed something that would deliver on the moisture front. \n\n\n**Performance**: I can't actually say much about this product which I don't know if that's good or bad. It's slightly thicker than the HL moist, it's more moisturizing than HL and I feel like it does more than HL ever did. I still enjoy using it after all this time and I may even repurchase. It absorbs quickly, has no discernible smell, and is pretty economical for the amount you receive vs how long it lasts. If the product ingredient listing is correct and I understand how each ingredient fits, this product may have the 3-1-1 ratio (plz, correct me if I'm wrong as I'd love to know for sure!).\n\n\n*PyunKyang Yul Essence Toner*\n\n- Ingredients: Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\nMy newest toner purchase.  I’ve been using this toner for about 3 weeks so I can only give a first impression.  My main interest in this toner was sparked by [Gothamista’s YT review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9_mJoK4gr4) of this product when she covered the 7 skin layer method.  I was interested in finding another hydrating toner to try out the method as I felt that HL was too thin and really felt more like I was patting ‘cloudy water’ on my face every day. \n\n\nAbout the PKY line: The PKY line was developed by the Pyunkang Oriental Medicine Clinic (info provided by Ohlolly.com).  It boasts a list of ingredients commonly found in these types of products but I was especially interested in milk vecht root extract, which is an extract that I haven’t come across much in products. (NOTE: I've been searching high and low for any clue of what this ingredient does topically, can't find anything.) I’m a bit of a lover for simpler aesthetics.  I like it when bottles are plainly labeled and look like they belong in an apothecary.  In this sense, PKY hits all my wants; sleek and simplistic design, electric blue bottle (hard plastic), and **no** dropper. \n\n\n**Performance**: What I expected from this product was hydration and I can say this toner delivered.  The liquid is slightly thicker than HL lotion moist but not too much.  I live in a high humidity area and we’re going into summer but I don’t expect to rotate this toner out of my routine.  I tend to only need 2-3 layers for the skin method when I’m using this toner. I’ve tried doing up to 7 but my skin calls it quits in absorption around layer 5. But I'm also wondering if this product just isn't as easily absorbed as meishoku. I think this product would be a great skin soother, since it comes across as so ...mild and inoffensive (if that makes sense). \n\n\nHave I seen a discernible difference in my skin using this product?  I don’t think so. I would notice more if my skin didn’t get the proper hydration it needed from this product but I haven’t seen that. \n\n\nMISC: There is no discernible smell but I’m not sensitive to smells.  The bottle is 6.7 oz which is a lot of product and likely this bottle will last me at least 8 months, making the price ($19) very economical. \n\n\nIf I didn’t think I’d have another toner waiting to be purchased, I’d say I’d repurchase this but I already have my sights set on toners by kyotosilk and swanicoco.  \n\n\n**Serums**\n\n\n*OST20*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Ascorbic Acid, Alcohol, Sodium Lactate, Butylene Glycol, Glucose, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Xanthan Gum, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Flower Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Glycerin, Zinc PCA, Panthenol, Niacinamide, t-Butyl Alcohol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ubiquinone, Diisopropyl Adipate (from Wishtrend)\n\n\nI'm going to be honest, I won't say much about this product because this sub seems to have a love+hate relationship with it. But I feel like a complete *sucker* for using this product when Timeless's Vit C formula exists. Reviews by [Holysnails](http://www.holysnails.com/2015/03/a-rant-on-osts-c20-and-c215-serums-and.html) and [Fiddy](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2017/01/04/vitamin-c-serum-101-timeless-vitamin-c-serum-review/) and [sub reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4edywb/timeless_vitamin_c_e_ferulic_serum_review_with/?st=j2joba2v&sh=f554f12e) should have had me clicking to Timeless's site. \n\n\nBut no, I tried OST20 first (at least I don't have to wonder) came away disappointed (easily oxidized, serum-like feeling, faint smell, and a bit tacky on the skin). If I regretted purchases this would likely be the ONE I regret most, especially after using Timeless (water-like feel to the skin, subtle scent, stabilized with vit E and ferulic acid, great pricing). NOTE: Please purchase from Timeless's site, while offered on Amazon I can't say for sure that is Timeless's vendor. \n\n\n*Stratia Rewind*\n\n- Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Ethoxydiglycol, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, 2-Dimethylamino Ethanol (DMAE), Panthenol, Hydrolized Rice Protein, N-Acetyl Glucosamine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Tamarindus Indica (Tamarind) Seed Extract, Hydrocotyl (Centella Asiatica) Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA\n\n\nAgain, this is another product that is known enough in the sub that I don't really feel like I need to say much. I purchased this product based on the ingredients. I wanted something with niacinamide + nag and licorice. Also, I wanted to support an independent maker who I know was knowledgeable about skincare. I was really interested to see what this product would do for my skin. NOTE: I purchased before stratia dropped the use of biokelp ferment so I've never tried the newest formulation. \n\n\nFor skin feel, this product was slightly oily but sank in well enough. I found it slightly hydrating/moisturizing but not heavy. It really did help with providing a boost of moisture to my skin while being soothing. \n\n\n**Performance**: Overall, I didn't see any significant change in my skin except for moisture/hydration. My PIH was not lightened and I didn't see significant brightening and really that's what I wanted. \n\n\n*Hungarian Water Essence*/*Mizon Hyaluronic 100 Serum*\n\n- Ingredients (BELIF): Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Officinalis(Sage) Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Peucedanum Graveolens (Dill) Extract, Alchemilla Vulgaris Extract, Rose Extract, Poncirus Trifoliata Fruit Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, *Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, *Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, *Nepeta Cataria Extract, *Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Leaf Extract, *Baptisia Tinctoria Root Extract, *Stellaria Media (Chickweed) Extract, +Alchemilla Vulgaris Leaf Extract, **Equisetum Arvense Leaf Extract, **Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Leaf Extract, **Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Triethylhexanoin, Tromethamine, Sclerotium Gum, Ammonium Acryloyldimethltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Trisodium EDTA, ***Fragrance, Citronnellol, Limonene. *Napiers Original Formula. **Napiers Aqua Formula. ***Fragrances of Natural Origin.\n\n- Ingredients (MIZON): Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Copper Tripeptide-1, Butylene Glycol, Sclerotium Gum, 1,2-octanediol, Ethylhexyl-glycerin, Tropolone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Carppyl/capric Triglyceride,Hydrogenated Lecithin, Stearic Acid, C12-c20alkyl Glucoside, C13-22 Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Cholesteryl Hydroxystearate, Cholesterol, Ceramid 3, Triethanolamine, Carbomer, Betula Platpyhlla Japonica Juice, Portaluca Oleracea Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, Amica Montana Flower Extract, Artemisia Absinthium Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Gentiana Lutea Root Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Rasberry) Fruit Extract, Beta-Glucan, Adenosine, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA\n\n\n**Performance**: I'm putting these two together because I felt like they acted as similar products. Very inoffensive serums with little to no scent. I couldn't pinpoint to their overall effect but I will say that when I started mixing them together before application I saw a def increase in the ...bouncy-ness of my skin. I can't explain it and I'm little miffed that separately they didn't perform but together I loved the effect. I refuse to purchase extract water as I got a deluxe sample size from Sephora (Belif got me on the moisturizer train already) and Mizon did very little for my skin alone so both were a dud in my opinion. \n\n\n******\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nI suppose I should discuss my skin now. Overall, I'm pretty happy with where my skin is although I think I'm gonna need laser work for some PIH or start on tret. I don't get flakes even in the face of all the actives I through at my skin. I barely purge (except for retinol) and I don't break out really. When I do breakout, it's usually from products/ environmental, not hormonal. I guess I have a semi-glow, although IRL I just look semi-sweaty or really shiny with makeup on. I'm not as oily and I usually don't get oily until about 4PM now and my makeup no longer separates. \n\n\nI think what's made the largest difference is introducing a hydrating toner. Before this I cleansed and moisturized but hydration was a key element that I wasn't getting. Adding hydration was such a wonderful step towards aiding my skin and I really think that in those who are new to AB, learning the importance of hydration is critical in understanding your skin. ",

If you guys are unfamiliar, [AB University has some insight into the scientific world of skincare](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/vitaminc). TL;DR: we should be vigilant for the derivative of Vitamin C our potential serum claims to contain. Not all forms are alike, actually, L-AA is the clear winner. As of yet I have yet to try this sure-to-be HG, but my personal anecdote is MAP reduced the discoloration under my eyes and left a silky finish on my skin. Considering I am not capable of providing the same raw data as a seasoned professional, I should conclude that MAP is a ‘non-clinically proven’ runner-up to L-AA.\n\nI looked for bottles that were amber or blue, labeled their Vitamin C derivative, and listed L-AA as one of the first 5 ingredients. All vials will vary in price, though most will be within $10-$20 range. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Claire-ity Vitamin C Serum](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OKY87OS/ref=ox_sc_act_title_12?smid=AJEX40L1EE1DV&psc=1)\n\nAscorbic Acid (L-AA)—25% Vitamin C\n\n27 ingredients, Vitamin C is listed number 6 and 7. Considering the large number of ingredients, the potency of each of the beginning products listed could potentially be small enough that the 6th and 7th ingredients combined could actually be 25%. (Q&A says 20% Ascorbic Acid and 5% L-Ascorbic Acid)\n\nMultiple actives: Vitamin C, Vitamin A, Hyaluronic Acid\n\nConsidering the claims of the 7th ingredient being 5%, Vitamin A and Hyaluronic Acid must be a very low percentage considering their order in the ingredient list. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n[New York Biology Super Vitamin C](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073X4KPBM/ref=ox_sc_act_title_11?smid=A3K94VWQ8DVMOE&psc=1)\n\nAscorbic Acid (L-AA) & Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (MAP)—+20% Vitamin C\n\n19 ingredients, Vitamin C listed as ingredient 3 and 6.

The following ingredient accounts for less than 2%, so this serum is mostly water. (This is the serum I have tried and I do think it works. I don’t have much else to compare it, but it did reduce some darkness under the eye as well as leave a silky finish on skin. )\n\nMultiple Actives: Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid \n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Majestic Pure Vitamin C Serum](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M5CLQ0A/ref=ox_sc_act_title_9?smid=AEWXAV3T5UC41&th=1)\n\nL-Ascorbic Acid (L-AA), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (MAP), Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate—+10% Vitamin C\n\n19 ingredients, Vitamin C is listed 3rd, 6th and 7th.

I can’t imagine some of the results I could have missed because I didn’t have the patience to investigate over 100 results (ok, it was 102). If hidden gems could be kept in plain sight on the second page of results, I wonder what more I could be missing out on because I simply don’t know any better. \nGood skin is obtainable without the huge price tag as long as you know what and where to look. While searching for ingredients, I spent some time reading the Q&A section. Some people knew what to ask and got indirect or misleading answers, some people seemed to straight up not know what they were answering. Education is the key to our eternal youth, with patience to inspect our potential products, we can all be wise and beautiful glowing gods and goddess!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPM me if you would like to make any amendments.

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

        "body": "Hi AB! :) I lurk here *every single night* and also occasionally post here. I recently wrote this... enormous monstrosity on rosacea and shared it over at /r/skincareaddiction, but also wanted to share it here since I have found lots of value in the discussions here as well as the science surrounding AB ingredients (such as snail mucin, propolis, etc.). \n\nIn the future, I plan to do a large post that combines both AB product recommendations and SCA recommendations (as well as mine) for rosacea, but I felt this would be it's own post that I would later connect to this one.\n\nThanks so much for being awesome. I love this sub to bits and frequently come here when I am feeling down or anxious. I hope this helps some of you. <3",

    "body": "hi guys! it's been a year since the beginning of my skincare journey, so i think it's time to give back to these skincare communities which have taught me so much! here is an extensive list of **AB** (asian beauty) and **non-AB** products i've tried in the past year, ranging mostly from drug-store to mid-range products. i've arranged the list in the order of the **highest to lowest** ratings.\n\n**skin type:** early 20s, sensitive, acne-prone, combination (oily over forehead, dry everywhere else), Fitzpatrick IV/brown\n\n**skin concerns:** inflammatory acne, closed comedones, some PIH/PIE, a few freckles, anti-aging\n\n**skin irritants:** most plant extracts, most essential oils, any form of physical exfoliation\n\ndespite my sensitive skin type, i have gone through a number of products with artificial fragrances/EOs/strange plant extracts, because i didn't know what my skin triggers were back then. hopefully even my negative experiences will be of some help! :)\n\ncaveat: my experiences will likely differ from most of yours, since everyone reacts differently even to the same ingredient :D. do note that i have a rather finicky skin type that sadly disagrees with an overwhelming majority of products!\n\n# 1st-step cleansers\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) bioderma sensibio micellar water** ($14.90 for 16.7oz) is a no-frills micellar water that is extremely suitable for sensitive skin types. it has no fragrance, and also has an extremely short ingredients list which does not contain any comedogenic/irritating ingredients. because of this, it truly stands out from most other brands of micellar water! this has never once caused any breakouts for me. it is good at removing light makeup or non-waterresistant sunscreen. however, with heavier makeup/ water-resistant sunscreen, you'd need a lot more effort to rub (gently) them off. that irritates my skin, unfortunately. therefore, i'm currently only using this to quickly and gently remove non-water resistant sunscreen, and it causes no irritation this way, yay! for those of you with sensitive/dry skin types, using micellar water to remove light makeup/sunscreen may wind up being much gentler and less stripping than oil cleansers, as it is for me. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**muji sensitive cleansing oil** ($19.90 for 13.5oz) is a thick, non-stripping, unscented cleansing oil which is effective at removing sunscreen/makeup. it has no discernible scent to me. this rinses cleanly without leaving an oily film. while this did not cause any dryness, i experienced some irritation (redness, tingling) after a few uses. i am suspecting that something in the ingredients list (eg: ethylhexyl palmitate, which may be slightly irritating) did not agree with my skin. otherwise, the ingredients list is free of any other common skin irritants. i also did not enjoy the thick texture of the oil which was difficult to spread around my face. however, this is affordable and comes in a large pump bottle! i could see this working well for many other skin types. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**shu uemera anti/oxi+ pollutant and dullness clarifying cleansing oil** ($58 for 9.8oz) is also a thick, non-stripping, luxurious, gorgeous cleansing oil that is effective at removing makeup. it is of very similar texture to muji's sensitive cleansing oil. but this contains a number of skin irritants, and is also heavily fragranced; it has an earthy, herbal smell. after about 4-5 uses, my skin began to feel irritated-- unbearable tingling in my cheeks. this was very disappointing given its steep price point :-(. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# 2nd step cleansers\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) paula's choice optimal results hydrating cleanser** ($19 for 6.4 oz) is the only cleanser so far that ticks all my boxes! it is non-irritating, non-stripping, ph-balanced, and does not break me out. i'd gone through at least a dozen cleansers throughout my life, before i found this, my very first ride-or-die cleanser! every other cleanser in the past would either strip my skin too dry OR irritate my skin. i love that it has no artificial fragrance; it only has a mild, inoffensive soapy scent. it also has an ingredients list that's free of irritants. this cleanser has a cream-gel texture that does not foam up at all. if you're used to foaming cleansers like i was, i totally understand your apprehension. however, many of us would benefit from gentler cleansers like this one, and i'd highly recommend this cleanser to any skin type except those with particularly oily skin. this also comes in a pretty, blue bottle with a pump dispenser! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) fresh soy face cleanser** ($69 for 13.5oz) used to be a staple in my skincare routine till i discovered the cleanser above. yes, this contains rose water and other plant extracts, as well as rose oil, which are common skin irritants amongst folks with sensitive skin :(! apart from these irritating additives, however, it was perfect in my eyes. it has a heavenly cucumber scent. despite the alarming ingredients list, it caused no signs of irritation, also probably because i cleanse my face really quickly to minimise contact time with cleansers in general. it was non-stripping, rinsed off very easily and cleanly, and smelled great (like fresh cucumbers) to me. this is still the 2nd best cleanser i've tried to date despite the disappointing additives... and i've tried at least 20 different cleansers so far. go to sephora and take a whiff! if the scent is your cup of tea, and you're not at all sensitive to its ingredients, i'd still recommend this cleanser. **4/5, MRP**\n\n**krave matcha hemp cleanser** ($26 for 4 oz) is a gel cleanser that appeared perfect in every way till i used it. IMO, it was difficult to rinse off, and left an oily film on my face after washing. i know some people are fine with that, but that sensation of *something* left on my skin after cleansing my face unsettles me. it was also much more drying than fresh soy face cleanser, probably because it contains coco-betaine (which is a much harsher surfactant, as compared to the top surfactant in fresh soy face cleanser, coco-glucoside) at the top of its list. it was mildly irritating too if i took my time with it-- i was surprised when it made my skin tingle, since its ingredients list seemed so gentle! i expected this to smell like matcha but instead it smelled like soap... which is reasonable, since it has no artificial fragrance/EOs. i see that this could be a potential HG for many skin types. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**innisfree blueberry cleanser** (\\~$9 for 3.4 oz) is a creamy cleanser that produces a rich lather. it has a pungent citrus smell which i simply couldn't come to terms with. it's also slightly irritating, and definitely too stripping for me. i eventually gave it away to my bf, and it works really well for him! he uses a tiny bit each time, otherwise it'd be too stripping for his normal-dry skin type. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) qv gentle wash** (\\~$24 for 33.8 oz) is a no-frills, unscented, foaming, cream-gel cleanser. this was definitely too stripping to be used on my face, so i use this sparingly on my body instead. this cleanser has a faint soapy smell that's much more pleasant than vanicream's, and it's completely non-irritating. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) sebamed liquid face and body wash** ($13.5 for 6.8oz) is similarly a no-frills, unscented, foaming cleanser. it has a gel consistency and dried out my skin very badly. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) avene soapless foaming gel** is rather similar to the sebamed liquid face and body wash, in that they are both incredibly drying, no-frills sort of gel cleansers. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n**hada labo super hyaluronic acid foaming wash** ($9 for 5.4oz) is an unscented self-foaming cleanser. the foam is very soft and abundant! it also rinses off effortlessly and cleanly. it has a pleasant, mild soapy scent. unfortunately, it caused my skin to burn after a few uses, and i had to discontinue use. it was also definitely too stripping for my skin. i think i think this would make a great basic cleanser for most skin types, but my skin's just... *sighs.* **0.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) vanicream gentle facial cleanser** ($9 for 8 oz) is a no-frills, foaming, cream-gel cleanser. it is unscented and has one of the shortest ingredients lists. it left my skin squeaky clean within 1 wash despite using only a pea-sized amount of the cleanser. my cheeks were also blotchy afterwards, and i still haven't been able to identify what is the irritant within this short and innocuous-looking ingredients list! of all the basic drugstore cleansers, this had the least pleasant chemical scent to it. but i think this would make a great basic cleanser for most skin types. **0/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche-posay toleriane hydrating gentle cleanser/ toleriane caring wash** ($15 for 13.5oz) is a non-foaming, ultra-gentle cream-gel cleanser. this burned both my bf's and my faces on the first wash... achievement unlocked, i guess! but i could feel that this was definitely non-stripping. i still don't know what irritated my skin here, since it works so well for so many other people with sensitive skin. **0/5, WNRP**\n\n# toners\n\n**isntree green tea toner** ($20 for 6.7 oz) is a thin, watery toner with a rather strong herbal scent. this did nothing much for my skin. it wasn't effective at hydrating/soothing my skin, controlling sebum production or calming my breakouts, which some other reviewers seemed to experience with this toner. though this toner does not contain any artificial fragrance/EOs, it has a cloyingly sweet scent that i am not a fan of. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**klairs supple preparation unscented toner** ($22 for 6.1 oz) is a viscous, hydrating toner. this has a mild chemical scent to it which did not bother me at all. it did pack a punch of hydration but also broke me out after a week of use. i've since learnt that butylene glycol, which is 2nd in this ingredients list, is rather comedogenic for me. however, i really appreciated the inclusion of non-irritating and soothing ingredients! it would have been perfect if it didn't contain butylene glycol. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) kiehl's ultra facial toner** ($17 for 8.4 oz) is a milky, viscous, moisturising toner. this broke me out very quickly, possibly due to the squalane and quite a number of other comedogenic ingredients that are further down the ingredients list. this has no EOs/artificial fragrance, and has a neutral, inoffensive scent. i would recommend this only to normal-dry skin types which are not acne-prone. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n# serums\n\n🌟 **purito centella unscented serum** ($20 for 2oz) is my favourite serum thus far! this contains 49% centella asiatica (tiger grass), \\~3% niacinamide, asiaticoside/asiatic acid/madecassic acid, sodium hyaluronate, and peptides. the star ingredient here is the centella! this calms my skin down like no other product ever has. my cheeks are less red and painful. my acne heals a lot quicker while using this too. while this doesn't contain artificial fragrance, it has a light sweet scent that doesn't bother me. it also provides a nice layer of hydration. it is viscuous, takes a short while to absorb, dries down kind of tacky and leaves your skin looking dewier. overall, it's still a cosmetically elegant serum to me. i've repurchased this a few times and i plan to use this for a looooooong time! i'd highly recommend this serum to almost anyone. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) paula's choice 10% niacinamide booster** ($44 for 0.67 oz) is a great niacinamide serum. it's filled to the brim with great ingredients. this contains 10% niacinamide and stabilised derivatives of vitamin c (acetyl glucosamine, ascorbyl glucoside) which work together synergistically alongside niacinamide to effectively brighten your skin. it also has sodium hyaluronate, other soothing ingredients and antioxidants. it's a tiny bottle but it lasts half a year for me, because i mix this booster with purito's serum, so i use only 4 drops per day. it's watery and absorbs extremely quickly without leaving tackiness/shine. this has a light pleasant scent, but does not contain artificial fragrance. i'd highly recommend this to anyone who's looking for a gentle but immensely brightening niacinamide serum with a ton of other great ingredients. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) timeless hyaluronic acid + vitamin c serum** ($21 for 1 oz) is a minimalistic serum containing 5% MAP (magnesium ascorbyl phosphate). MAP is a gentle, stabilised derivative of vitamin c, that can help with skin brightening, and perhaps, prevent aging. my skin cannot tolerate daily use of L-ascorbic acid, hence i use this too. this also has 1% hyaluronic acid and 1.5% of matrixyl 3000. it is non-irritating and provides a nice layer of hydration despite being pretty thin. i definitely notice that my skin's duller and less plump when i go without this. this doesn't have a detectable scent. i love timeless, in general! it has a whole range of simple but effective serums that are suitable for even sensitive and acne-prone skin type. i highly recommend checking out their serums! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) timeless vitamin c + e ferulic acid serum** ($26 for 1oz) is a 20% unscented L-ascorbic acid serum. it has a very low pH of 2.4, so it's pretty irritating and drying :\\\\. this is really the only significant issue that i have with this product. i can only use this a maximum of 2 times per week, and even at this conservative frequency, i experience quite a bit of flaking. this has a bit of a sausage-like/metallic smell but it doesn't disturb me at all, personally. i absolutely loveeeee that this comes in an airless pump now. the ingredients list is as simple as it gets for an L-AA serum. it can easily last 6 months after opening as long as i keep it refrigerated! ensure that you order this from a reputable seller who orders fresh stocks or else your product may oxidise quickly. this is an affordable and effective L-AA serum. **4.5/5, RP**\n\n**purito centella green level buffet serum** ($20 for 2oz) is basically the scented version of purito centella unscented serum. this contains EOs so it has a stronger herbal scent. i've noticed that this is slightly irritating when my skin's very sensitive. i'd recommend the unscented version above if you're interested in this! but if you're a sucker for the scent of lavender oil, i think this would be great too, because i had really great results using this for months as well. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n# moisturisers\n\n🌟 **etude house soonjung 2x barrier intensive cream** ($18 for 2 oz) is a medium-weight, unscented, simple creamy moisturiser. of all the creamy moisturisers that i've come across, this has one of the simplest and least comedogenic ingredients lists. it has a faint shea butter smell. don't be fooled by the name, it's definitely not a thick, suffocating cream! it spreads easily like a dream, and hasn't broken me out at all! this is also very effective at moisturising my skin-- my dry spots improve significantly overnight whenever i slather this on. however, it does leave your skin feeling pretty tacky especially if you layer other hydrating products beneath this. again, tackiness doesn't bother me since i don't (and shouldn't) touch my face much at all. this cream leaves me looking dewy too. even when my skin was at its worst, this caused 0 irritation, and in fact, helped to reduce redness and minimise tingling. i feel a fresh, cooling burst of hydration whenever i slather this on. i'd highly recommend this to almost any skin type. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) avene skin recovery cream** ($35 for 1.7 oz) is one of the simplest, most basic, unscented, no-frills cream moisturisers on the market. it has a slightly heavy, thick texture, but still glides on quite smoothly. the ingredients list only has 11 ingredients! i know that i can always switch back to this moisturiser if somethings goes awry. it is non-irritating but also doesn't soothe my skin. i think it moisturises decently but etude house soon jung barrier cream is a more efficacious moisturiser, IMO. the soonjung one's spreads much more effortlessly too. i'd recommend this to those with extremely sensitive skin types/those who may have accidentally destroyed their skin barrier. **4/5, MRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) rocky mountain oils sacred skin facial moisturizer** ($50 for 1.7 oz) is a highly emollient, medium-weight, luxurious cream that is scented with frankincense EO. i was previously using this for half a year till i discovered a better replacement, aka etude house soonjung barrier cream. i adore the texture of this cream-- it's so emollient and rich, so it does require some warming up in your palms. while this worked beautifully as a moisturiser and caused me no issues such as irritation and breakouts, i wanted to move towards building a fragrance-free routine due to my pretty sensitive skin. perhaps the EO in this was not yet causing me issues, but in due time, it could potentially contribute to significant inflammation, then finally culminating in significant skin irritation. my risk threshold is pretty low now because i've come very close to ruining my skin barrier with products, so i've decided not to continue using this. regardless, i'd recommend this to anyone who'd like a medium-weight cream with an amazing frankincense scent. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n**cosrx oil-free ultra-moisturising lotion** ($24 for 3.4 oz) is a gel-cream moisturiser which features a high amount of birch sap. i used this for a week and it was a decent, unimpressive moisturiser. i experienced a bit of irritation (skin burning) with this, perhaps due to the citrus peel EO in this. it has a distinct sweet, fruity scent. because of its thin gel-cream consistency, and their intention to exclude many emollients/oils, this moisturiser wouldn't be adequate for my combination skin type in the long run. sadly, this contains butylene glycol and dimethicone at the top of the ingredients list, which are known acne triggers for me. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# eye moisturisers\n\n**laneige water bank eye gel** ($39 for 0.8 oz) is fragranced gel moisturiser. it didn't cause any issues for me, but also wasn't impressive in any way. this had a sharp floral scent. again, i could do without this in-your-face sort of fragrance. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n**laneige time freeze eye serum** ($52 for 0.7 oz) is a fragranced, thin, milky eye serum. i soldiered on despite the old-lady fragrance and then got milia after a few weeks of use... that isn't a surprise, in retrospect, because butylene glycol are dimethicone are at the top of the ingredients list. thankfully, i experienced no irritation with this. otherwise, this did moisturise pretty decently... but nothing different from other moisturisers that i've tried. it is expensive for the small amount, and i do think there are many other better eye/face moisturisers out there that contain far better ingredients at the same price point. i wouldn't recommend this to anyone simply because it is unimpressive. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# sunscreens\n\n🌟 **purito centella green level unscented sun spf 50 pa++++** ($18.90 for 2 oz) is an unscented, soothing, chemical sunscreen that is not water-resistant. this doesn't leave a white cast on my brown (Fitzpatrick IV) skin even though i slather on a liberal amount-- about 1/8-1/4 teaspoon each time. many unscented products may smell a little strange but this only really has an extremely light chemical scent that doesn't seem to bother anyone so far! this is very hydrating and moisturising, so it leaves my skin looking dewy. it contains 2% niacinamide, centella asiatica, madecassoside, asiaticoside, madecassic acid, and asiatic acid. this pretty much looks and feels like a moisturiser with spf! i suspect that this, alone, would be enough in the AM for pretty dry skin types too. i break out from all sunscreens, and i think this one contributes a little to my acne. however it really is the least comedogenic sunscreen that i've tried/seen! i'd highly recommend this to pretty much anyone without a very oily skin type! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**missha all-around safe block essence sun spf 45 pa +++** ($16 for 1.7 oz) is a fragranced, water-resistant sunscreen. i'm personally fine with its light floral scent. this has caused my no irritation, doesn't leave a white cast, and moisturises well! i could even skip my serums because this is THAT hydrating/moisturising. as a result, it does leave my skin looking quite dewy, but that's fine with me! unfortunately, it may have broken me out a little, but then again, all sunscreens, especially water-resistant ones, tend to have that effect on me. i'd highly recommend this to pretty much anyone without a very oily skin type who's looking for a water-resistant sunscreen! **4/5, RP**\n\n**purito centella green level safe sun spf 50 pa++++** ($18.90 for 2 oz) is a scented version of the sunscreen above. this contains EOs and smells extremely strongly of lavender. the other difference is that this doesn't contain madecassoside, asiaticoside, madecassic acid, and asiatic acid. this caused no irritation for my skin type too! while this worked really well for my skin too, i'd recommend the unscented version instead for the reasons stated previously. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) skinceuticals physical fusion uv defense spf 50** ($34 for 1.7oz) is a tinted, physical, water-resistant sunscreen. this left me looking like a very anguished ghost. it is advertised to be suitable for all skin types, but obviously, if you do apply an adequate amount, it leaves an unavoidable violaceous-beige cast on my brown (Fitzpatrick IV) skin... this was super disappointing! immediately upon application, i also experienced tingling on the more irritated areas of my face. i'd only recommend this to normal, fair (Fitzpatrick II-III) skin types... **0/5, WNRP**\n\n# wash-off face masks\n\n**(NON-AB) origins 10 minute drink up hydrating mask with apricot & glacier water** ($26 for 2.5oz) is a fragranced, creamy, ultra-moisturising wash-off mask. this caused closed comedones after 1 use (30min), though it was non-irritating. it smells strongly of fresh oranges. this would be awesome for drier skin types which are NOT at all acne-prone. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) fresh rose face mask** ($62 for 3.3oz) is a gel mask containing bits of rose petals. this was supposed to soothe my skin, but instead, this irritated my skin right away and caused tingling/redness. it also did not seem to hydrate my skin much at all. i wouldn't recommend this (or any products featuring a high concentration of rose) to sensitive skin types. **0.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**raw manuka honey:** i decided to spread a generous amount of pure manuka honey with decent UMF rating. immediately, my face stung and turned pink. moral of the story: always patch test!\n\n# sheet masks\n\n**klairs rich moist soothing tencel sheet mask** ($30 for 10 sheets) is an unscented, ultra-hydrating, simple sheet mask. the essence is quite viscous but doesn't leave my skin feeling too tacky. it has pretty much no scent to it. it contains a list of non-irritating ingredients, and some ultra-calming ingredients such as panthenol and centella. it also has ceramides. all in all, this is a great mask to fix your skin barrier! within one use, all of my dry patches were gone. unrestrained sheet masking (a few times per week, in my case) always breaks me out, as it did when i used this mask too. however a single use is fine. i also love that the material of the mask is pretty thin and soft. i'm deducting 0.5 point just because butylene glycol is a known acne trigger for me, and it's at the top of this ingredients list. **4.5/5, MRP**\n\n**twotsp ggulba mask** ($30 for 5 sheets) is a fragranced, incredibly moisturising sheet mask containing very thick essence. what sets this apart from many other sheet masks is that the essence in this is INCREDIBLY sticky, since it is enriched with honey. there's also niacinamide in here, near the top of the ingredients list. the material of the mask is pretty thin and soft! it has a cloyingly sweet scent which reminds me of a sweet dessert. this is absolutely nourishing. however, it contains a few potential skin irritants, such as a few plant extracts, including rose extract. otherwise, this did not break me out (as long as i realllyyyy space out my sheet masking) or irritate my skin. i won't be repurchasing due to the potentially irritating additives. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**mediheal teatree care solution essential mask** ($3 per sheet) is a fragranced mask featuring centella asiatica and tea tree extract. the essence isn't sticky. there's nothing really outstanding about this. it contains lavender EO. while it didn't break me out or irritate my skin, it also didn't soothe or hydrate my skin remarkably. i'm nitpicking here... but the material of the sheet mask is pretty thick! **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**papa recipe bombee honey mask** ($20 for 10 sheets) is a fragranced mask that reminds me of a lighter version of the ggulba mask. the essence is pretty sticky here due to its star ingredient, honey. my experience with this is largely similar to my experience with ggulba, except this is less moisturising. both have a similar artificial, cloyingly sweet scent. **2.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**dr jart+ cicapair calming mask** ($23 for 5 sheets) is a mask featuring centella asiatica. it is pretty similar in its scent to the mediheal tea tree mask, but the centella in here seems to be lower in concentration. the mask material is very soft and thin, and seemed to hug my face better. the essence is a pretty thin too. this contains no artificial fragrance/ EOs. however! it irritated my skin slightly-- it caused a bit of tingling. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n# lip balms/masks\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar baume ap+** ($20 for 13.5 oz) is a thick, unscented moisturising cream. it has a shea butter scent. it leaves a pretty tacky feeling and shiny appearance. of all the moisturisers that i've tried, this is the most moisturising! i apply a layer of this on my chapped lips, followed by a layer of laneige lip sleeping mask to seal the deal. when i wake up in the morning, my lips are all dandy again! this + laneige lip sleeping mask is my magical duo! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **laneige lip sleeping mask** ($20 for 0.7 oz) is a fragranced, extremely thick and emollient lip mask. there are a few flavours to choose from, and they all contain strong artificial fragrance. personally, i chose the berry flavour, and it really smells like a strawberry sweet, lol. i could do without the scent. aside from this, this is perfect. compared to other lip masks and balms that i've tried, this is the most hydrating and moisturising mask, by far. it comes with a cute little spatula too. **4.5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**klavuu nourishing care lip sleeping pack** ($15 for 0.7 oz) is a lightly fragranced lip mask. it feels much less oily and thick than laneige's. it also has a faint vanilla scent that's much more tolerable and lighter than the laneige's lip masks. sadly, it did a mediocre job at moisturising my lips. this doesn't come with a spatula :(. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n(**NON-AB) la roche posay cicaplast levres** ($12 for 0.25 oz) is a thick, unscented, simple lip balm. my lips were still very dry despite slathering this on generously. i appreciate the simplicity of this product, but it just didn't work for me. this had a waxy texture. i'd prefer a lighter lip balm than this, personally. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) supergoop! acai fusion lip balm spf 30** ($9.50 for 0.5 oz) is a thick, unscented spf lip balm. it has a waxy, thick texture, and would ball up and flake off my lips so badly. this is not at all cosmetically elegant and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone! **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# actives\n\n🌟 **differin gel** ($15 for 0.5 oz) is a form of acne treatment that contains 0.1% adapalene (a form of retinoid). since incorporating this regularly into my routine, i've noticed a lot less inflammatory acne (giant pimples) and smaller closed comedones too. it doesn't tingle on application but it definitely increases my sensitivity to other products in my routine and causes redness. it's too drying when i use it more than 4-5x per week. however, as long as i use it at a moderate frequency, and pay attention to how my skin's feeling and looking, i experience not many issues with this. i'd highly recommend this to those combating acne, because it's a relatively gentle topical acne treatment. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n# cleansing devices\n\n🌟  **muji unbleached cotton pads** ($3.9 for 80 pieces)are the softest cotton pads ever! it's so gentle on my face, so there's no chafing at all! i find that it's just the right amount of thickness. i never experience issues with loose fibers. i use this to gentlyyy remove my sunscreen with micellar water. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **klairs toner mate 2-in-1 cotton pad** ($6.50 for 120 pieces) are extremely thin, compact cotton pads. they're pricey for cotton pads but they absorb very little product, so it'd be economical to use this for expensive products (toners/essences). i find that this is rougher than the muji unbleached cotton pads, so i personally use this on my bacne instead, since my back's not sensitive like my face is. i think this serves really niche purposes, i.e. to reduce wastage of pricier products, and to lightly physically exfoliate. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) normal foreo luna 2** ($169) is a cleansing device that gently vibrates to exfoliate your skin. it was too abrasive and irritating for my sensitive skin type. i experienced tingling and redness even after one use. i kept at it (i couldn't believe that even this would irritate my skin) and those symptoms only got worse! interestingly, this works very well at reducing breakouts for my sister (does not have sensitive skin)  without causing irritation. compared to other cleansing devices on the market, foreo is probably one of the gentlest around. it's still a form of physical exfoliation, so it'd be safer to use it with some caution, aka space out your use when you first begin. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# body care\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) physiogel ai lotion** ($25 for 3.4) is a lightweight, unscented, simple moisturiser. what sets this apart from most other body lotions is that it is so lightweight. it's almost like a milky emulsion! and it surprisingly does a great job at moisturising my dry skin despite its lightweight consistency. i love that it absorbs very quickly without leaving much tackiness or shine. it is also pretty non-comedogenic compared to other body moisturisers, which is a big deal to me, because i actually am acne-prone all over my body. :( it has a light shea butter scent. i'd recommend this to anyone who's looking for a light, no-frills body moisturiser! **5/5, WRP**\n\n🌟 **cos de baha niacin toner** ($17.50 for 6.76 oz) is an unscented toner packed with brightening ingredients. this contains 5% niacinamide, 1% panthenol, hyaluronic acid and licorice root extract. i use this on the areas of my body (back, neck, upper arms) which are suffering from acne and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation/erythema. so far, it's caused no issues such as breakouts or irritation. i primarily chose this for the high concentration of niacinamide, to brighten my acne marks. it's pretty affordable too, so i can slather it on generously on my body. this would also make a good facial toner, but do note that it contains eucalyptus, which is a potential irritant. **5/5, WRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar fluide** is a lightweight, gel-cream moisturiser. it absorbs fully within minutes and leaves no tackiness/shine at all! this also contains 4% niacinamide. in general, LRP products contain no skin irritants in its products. if you're looking for a light body moisturiser, this is it! this make work very well as a facial moisturiser too. i personally prefer creamier moisturisers that are richer in emollients, so i may not repurchase. **4.5/5, MRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) the ordinary 7% glycolic acid toner** ($8.70 for 8oz) is a potent AHA toner. it has no artificial fragrance, but it has quite a number of plant extracts. whenever i slather it on my back, i feel as though i'm in a bed of roses. this is rather potent, or perhaps the rose water in this is irritating me, because i do experience some tingling occasionally. i would never use this on my face because this is definitely too irritating/strong. this makes a great body AHA since it's affordable compared to most other exfoliants. **4/5, WRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) sukin natural botanical body wash** ($17 for 33.8 oz) is a fragranced, non-stripping gel wash that is filled with plant extracts. it contains a number of EOs and artificial fragrances so its botanical scent is really strong. it's non-irritating to my skin, however. it doesn't dry out my skin unlike most body washes i've tried. a non-irritating version of this would be sukin's daily gentle face and body wash, if you're interested! **3.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar baume ap+** ($20 for 13.5 oz) has been described above under the lip section! while this is intensely moisturising and leaves my skin feeling the softest, it also causes body acne for me, because it contains a high amount of shea butter and dimethicone, which are acne triggers for me. this would be best for pretty dry skin types/extremely dry patches/winter! if you're not acne-prone and have very dry skin, you can also apply this on your face too :). **2/5, WNRP**\n\n# summary: my holy grails\n\n1. bioderma sensibio micellar water\n2. paula's choice optimal results hydrating cleanser\n3. purito centella unscented serum\n4. paula's choice 10% niacinamide booster\n5. timeless hyaluronic acid + vitamin c serum\n6. etude house soonjung 2x barrier intensive cream\n7. purito centella green level unscented sun spf 50 pa++++\n8. la roche posay lipikar baume ap+\n9. laneige lip sleeping mask\n10. differin gel\n11. muji unbleached cotton pads\n12. klairs toner mate 2-in-1 cotton pad\n13. physiogel ai lotion\n14. cos de baha niacin toner\n\nwhew, that was a real mouthful. i'll be back in a year's time, with a hopefully shorter list :). my fingers are crossed!

    "body": "This post will cover topical use of vitamin c and it's derivatives.\n\n[Link to the previous post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/j5jq2i/series_part_1_vitamin_c_for_skin_health/)\n\nTopical Use of vitamin C has been proven to be beneficial in many many studies. I am quoting all the studies I could find, and listing all the benefits as well.\n\nTopical use of Vitamin C (L-Ascorbic Acid/Ascorbic Acid) has been proven to:\n\n1. *Help with the biosynthesis of collagen. -* Anti - Ageing benefit.\n2. *Help in the repair of damaged skin/ skin wounds with anti-inflammatory properties -* Restore skin health.\n3. *Increase the proliferation rate of fibroblasts. -* Anti - Ageing benefit.\n4. *Provide greater photoprotection against UV induced photoaging, immunosuppression, and even skin cancer. -* Anti - Ageing benefit, - Anti - skin cancer.\n5. *Inhibit the action of tyrosinase in melanocytes thus helps to make skin even-toned.-* Helps with pigmentation.\n6. *Restore structural and functional losses in the skin architecture associated with ageing.* - Anti - Ageing benefit.\n7. *Help to strengthen the lipid barrier (possibly, proven in vitro)*. - Restore skin health.\n\n***There have been A LOT of studies on topical vitamin C.*** *I have extracted and link a few I found relevant that support it benefits at THE END of this post.*\n\n***There is enough evidence to believe that topically applied L-ascorbic acid is beneficial.***\n\n*While most people treat Vitamin C like an acid, it's mechanism isn't exactly similar to AHA's. L-ascorbic acid is a form of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) that is recognisable as vitamin C in the skin.* ***Topical use adds to the existing concentration of Vitamin C in the skin.***\n\n*Thus, once it penetrates into the skin, it* ***cannot be washed off/neutralised***. However, some actives applied together/at the same time can change its performance/form.\n\n*L-ascorbic acid is a hydrophilic charged molecule so it doesn't easily penetrate our lipid (hydrophobic) barrier. For optimal penetration of the epidermal barrier, aqueous formulations of ascorbic acid must be at a pH which is below the pKa (4.2) of ascorbic acid itself. Thus, L-ascorbic acid must be formulated below the PH of AT LEAST 4 for it to penetrate in our skin.*\n\n*Although ideally around* ***3-3.5 increased penetration*** *without excessively compromising the skin barrier.*\n\n*The prime concentration depends on the formulation and associated delivery method. It is a general agreement that concentration needs to be more than 8% to be bio-available and effective. According to* [*this study*](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227542100_Topical_L-Ascorbic_Acid_Percutaneous_Absorption_Studies)*, varying concentrations from 5% to 30% were applied to pig skin(similar integumentary system approach).*\n\n*It was observed that vitamin C concentration was maximum at 20% and anything above 20% surprisingly caused depletion in tissue concentration levels.* ***Thus anything below 8% and above 20% is usually seen to be sparse or superfluous.***\n\n*There are many stability issues with L-ascorbic acid solutions. An L-ascorbic acid solution is highly unstable and is prove to oxidation to dehydroascorbic acid(DHAA) and degradation to 2,3-diketogulonate in high temperature, light, heat, high ph, presence of oxygen and catalytic amounts of metal ions. This makes the solution progressively* ***turn*** *in colour* *from clear to* ***yellow, to deeper shades of orange as it continues to degrade.***\n\n* ***Now the question comes: is dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA) bad for our skin?***\n\n***The answer is No and Yes.***\n\nAscorbic acid or ascorbate in its ionised form is called L-ascorbic acid. Our skin recognises L-ascorbic as ascorbic acid. Our body (and skin) also contains an oxidised form of ascorbic acid which is Dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA). A high amount of vitamin C found in normal skin is in the form of dehydroascorbic Acid. [This](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225274699_Topical_Dehydroascorbic_Acid_Oxidized_Vitamin_C_Permeates_Stratum_Corneum_More_Rapidly_Than_Ascorbic_Acid) study shows that DHAA penetrated faster than L-ascorbic acid even. DHAA may not necessarily be bad and can be converted back to ascorbic acid in the presence of glutathione & thiol-containing reducing agents such as cysteine, homocysteine, 2-mercaptoethanol, and DTT, already present in our body. However, in the presence of water DHAA may be irreversibly hydrolysed to 2,3-diketogulonate and further degrade to Erythrulose. Erythrulose is a chemical used in fake tanning.\n\nBut **“Aap Chronology Samajhiye**” with this representation -\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ipk7xxd87ar51.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=b353acd40e51fbe1a80e72d94f3e4e2a8c771cd7\n\nL-AA is first oxidised to DHAA (which can be reversed in our skin). Oxidation means a reaction with the free form of oxygen molecules. Remember we learnt this in the last post. So oxidation can happen if L-AA is exposed to UV/oxygen in the environment at high temperature. However, DHAA can be reversed to AA in our skin because the presence of network antioxidants like glutathione that's already present in your skin. Check out [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/figure/nutrients-09-00866-f004/) diagram to understand how that works. However, when DHAA comes in contact with water it hydrolyses to 2,3-diketogulonate. Which cannot be turned back into AA due to the 5 hydrogen ring rupture. L-AA will not directly convert to 2,3-diketogulonate. It has to first oxidize then hydrolyse.2,3-diketogulonate may be further converted to other byproducts by other processes.\n\n[Lab muffin](https://labmuffin.com/vitamin-c-can-stain-skin-avoid/) made a post on this.\n\nIt is possible that DHAA may not convert to Erythrulose in our skin.\n\n***In conclusion, there is a lot of ambiguity around oxidised L-ascorbic acid and further processed byproducts.***\n\n***No studies have evaluated the benefits and side effects of these oxidised and degraded compounds.***\n\n***Although, the presence of antioxidants like ferulic acid, glutathione, vitamin e, etc. has been shown to increase the stability and efficiency of L-ascorbic acid serums. These are called network antioxidants because of this reason. Again check out the diagram linked above to understand more.***\n\nTo improve stability, the delivery mechanism also plays an important role. The right delivery mechanism can help prevent oxidation and conversion to other forms. Novel delivery mechanisms may also improve penetration along with stability. New delivery mechanisms to deliver L-AA without oxidizing are bein developed. [This study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4687614/) advocates using liposomal technology patented by Sesdema to deliver sodium ascorbate deeper into the skin. Many skincare companies are developing new anhydrous bases to disperse L-AA to prevent oxidation. Here is [another study](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/dd22/feb6b83ba354a50547c05552e70908f24460.pdf) of a new delivery mechanism.\n\n***However, an independent comparative study comparing different forms and delivery mechanisms of topical ascorbic acid has not been conducted.***\n\n*So in conclusion:*\n\n* *For L-ascorbic acid formulations in an aqueous:*\n   * *Must be formulated to be below PH 3.5 or below.*\n   * *Must be formulated using oxygen-impermeable packaging and stored at low temperature.*\n   * *Must be at a concentration above 5-8% and below 20%.*\n   * *Addition of other antioxidants can help improve the stability of the formulation.*\n   * *Must be stored in a dark/light-proof packaging at a stable temperature of  25 celsius or below.*\n   * *Must be used up quickly once exposed to air/light.*\n   * *Addition of penetration enhancers may help improve results.*\n* *For L-Ascorbic acid in a Non-aqueous solution:*\n   * *Must be formulated using oxygen-impermeable packaging and stored at low temperature.*\n   * *Addition of other antioxidants can help improve the stability of the formulation.*\n   * *Must be stored in a dark/light-proof packaging.*\n   * *Performance varies with the efficiency of delivery mechanisms.*\n\n***Owing to these stability, penetration and delivery issues with L-Ascorbic acid formulas, new derivatives of Ascorbic acid were developed.***\n\nNow my field of experience is not even remotely linked to bio-chemistry so I am not going to go in detail about the biochemical pathways that are hypothesised for their efficiency. I will, however, try to compare popular derivates and their performance/properties in brief based on information available on the internet.\n\n[A comparative analysis of various Vitamin C Derivatives](https://preview.redd.it/e99su3ae7ar51.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=14189617e8871c7968728ad2b907b4a0f7ff99b3)\n\n*Let's be honest picking one among the sea of options is intimidating. It comes down to personal preference and availability.*\n\nWhile choosing though there are certain things you should keep in mind. Only L-ascorbic acid has been studied for over 40 years now and has consistently proven to be advantageous topically.\n\nDue to its highly unstable nature,\n\n* *It is best to keep all your water-based L-AA carefully protected*. \n* *Ideally, they should be stored in a place with a stable temperature (in the fridge) and away from light. The smaller the quantity size the better.*\n* *Once oxygen touches the formula it starts to become unstable and turn yellow, making it very important to screw the lid tightly. The more product you use; the more the leftover product oxidises.* *Some people recommend transferring them in smaller bottles. I, apart, found that it gets tiresome to clear, sanitize bottles and dry old bottles ever. Any remains of LAA will oxidize and adding fresh batch in oxidised bottled can spoil the new batch.*\n\n***Using waterbased L-AA requires some commitment and care.*** *I love the effects though. Personally, I will walk the mile for those benefits.*\n\n***Anhydrous variants are another great option.*** *There are some limitations with anhydrous versions as well though*\\*\\*\\*.\\*\\*\\* ***Since AA is acidic and gritty in itself, these formulas can sting and sensitize your skin.*** *Many people break out while using high-concentration L-AA for the first time.  Its highly acidic nature can compromise the skin barrier. It's best to start with a lower concentration and gradually make your skin acquainted with L-AA. This can also be achieved by using L-AA a few times a week at the start and adding barrier-healing skincare products to your regime.*\n\n*Most people experience a slight stinging when they use L-AA-based products. There is a difference between stinging and burning although.* ***If your skin feels like it's burning, it's best to step back, stop use and choose a diluted version/low-concentration formula.***\n\n* ***The question comes: How to differentiate between stinging and burning?***\n\n*Stinging is a sharp, short-term, tingling sensation associated with low ph. It can last anywhere from a few seconds to a minute. Skin doesn't itch, turn red or feel sensitive to touch post that duration. This sensation may be experienced every time you apply L-AA but the intensity may reduce over the period.*\n\n*Burning is a strong irritation that feels different from tingling. It is a strong discomfort which may be coupled with redness, itching and touch sensitivity. It feels like your skin is on fire. Please immediately wash your face with water to wipe off any remains of the product. Apply some soothing, gentle products containing restorative ingredients like aloe, snail mucin, ceramides etc.*\n\n*It is best to patch test L-AA based products before applying it all over the face to understanding the way it reacts with your skin. Our mod* u/avaale *has made an amazingly detailed guide about* [patch testing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/iyxdqe/guide_how_to_patch_test/) *Please check it out to understand more about patch testing.*\n\nIn conclusion, L-AA may not be the best option for everyone due to its stability and skin sensitizing issues. If that is the case, you can still get some benefits by incorporating vitamin c derivatives. There is a catch though. ***Not all derivates are equal and not enough comparative studies have been conducted to conclude which one is the most superior form.***\n\n*However, by understanding the nature of the ingredient coupled with the anecdotal evidence we can understand a few things:*\n\n* Some derivates are lipophilic/ amphiphilic so they dissolve better in lipid formulations. These formulations may include oils, butter and silicones.\n* While each formulation differs from another due to the ***choice of base ingredients***. Some base lipids may be balanced to reduce the likeliness of comedogenicity and therefore may be less likely to cause breakouts in acne-prone skin type. Others may not suit your skin type.\n* *The* ***concentration*** *of active ingredient plays equally an important role.*\n* ***Pick a formula that works with your skin type, condition and goal.***\n   * Concentrations at which **Ascorbyl palmitate ( AA-PAL)** is used are extremely low. While vitamin C has shown some effects at concentrations as low as 1% but at the benefits of that concentration aren't hugely significant. When using derivatives in those concentrations, keep in mind that the derivative needs to convert to Vitamin C in your skin and some strength may be lost in the conversion. Coupling that with its stability issues, Ascorbyl palmitate doesn't catch my interest.\n   * **Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (SAP)** & **Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (MAP)** are more stable than AA-PAL but face the same roadblocks when it comes to formulating restrictions on concentration. Poor penetration and unreliable conversion don't benefit their case point. However, if acne is a pre-existing condition that you are dealing with, SAP may be an option to consider since there are some studies that support its anti-acne benefits. MAP is generally considered a better option in the industry than SAP from the overall vitamin C benefit perspective.\n   * **Ascorbyl Glucoside** is a better option than the ones I discussed above. It is stable at a variety of pH. Thus, it can comfortably be used by with sensitive skin. It can be incorporated in a liquid water/serum-based or formulated in a cream/gel base. It has been proven to convert into vitamin C in the skin and has been proven to have some anti-ageing benefits. However, potency is still questionable due to concentration restrictions. If you prefer easy of use and elegant- textured cosmetic products, this derivative may be considered.\n   * **Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate** is a newer derivative. It has not been independently researched much. There is this one study in a formula that also contained AA, which advocates it's benefits. In general, this derivative is unique due to its chemical structure and properties. Manufacturer claims suggest that it seeps in deeper into the skin than L-AA and stays in the skin 40-80% longer than L-AA. ( I am not sure if I can link/upload manufacturer documents I found through some sources and digging so if you are curious, watch out for my Instagram stories). Overall this ingredient is popular in Japan for its whitening properties and its lipid solubility puts it in an advantageous position to penetrate through the stratum corneum into the epidermis and the dermis. There is some anecdotal evidence that supports the claim that it may be one of the best derivatives out there. I also found some very expensive luxury skincare brands using this ingredient (will be sharing those insights on Instagram as well; May make a separate post if I am not being lazy).\n   * Last, but not least is **3-O-Ethyl Ascorbate.** It is one of the newest kid in the lot. Experts think it's structurally the closest to AA. It is an Ethylated form of AA so it's both water and lipid-soluble.   Stability tests have shown it's a very stable derivative at a PH of 5. Thus, the shelf life of EAC formulated products should be longer than others. Manufacturers and cosmetic companies claim that it provides similar benefits of L-AA is not better, without the stability issues. None of these claims has been verified although. It has shown to provide some de-pigmenting and antioxidant benefits by manufacturers in vitro trials. It can be formulated using high concentrations thus, it's another derivative to watch out for.\n\n**So, which one is perfect for you?  YOU decide that.**\n\nThis chart may help you come to some conclusion:\n\n[A graphical representation to make your decision easier.](https://preview.redd.it/3vmyn9yh7ar51.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bb6b780c72938114bf4e5d219cc2624e197d54c)\n\n***Another important detail:*** Almost all vitamin C formulations stay in your skin for up to 72 hours. Metals like iron and copper are known to destabilize and cause unwanted biochemical reactions with AA. *Thus is it best not to use copper peptide formulation with vitamin C to maximize their benefit.* By not using Copper peptide, I mean not just applying them together at the same time but also not using them in the same duration. So if you wish to use copper peptide you can rotate by using it for the first 3 months of the year and next three months using vitamin C and so on.\n\n***Some Extracts with Links to Clinical Studies/Research Journals I found relevant that support the benefit of topical application of L-AA:***\n\n23.8% L-ascorbic acid and a chemical penetration enhancer consisting of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and dimethyl isosorbide with iontophoresis to maximize amounts of L– ascorbic acid delivered were applied once daily, in a split-face study on twenty females (Fitzpatrick type III & IV to study the effect of Vitamin C on photoaged skin.

It has been observed to flatten out with age. The influence of ageing on the density of the functional entities of the papillae containing nutritive capillaries, here in terms as the papillary index, and the effect of topically applied vitamin C were investigated by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM in vivo. There were significant decreases in the papillary index showing a clear dependency on age. Topical vitamin C resulted in a significant increase of the density of dermal papillae from 4 weeks onward compared to its vehicle. Reproducibility was determined in repeated studies.) **Topical vitamin C may have therapeutic effects for partial corrections of the regressive structural changes associated with the aging process. -**[ Link](https://bmcdermatol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-5945-4-13)\n\nForty subjects with melasma were treated with C'ensil during an open-label trial over a period of 16 weeks.

    "body": "Hi all -- I have been  a pretty religious ABer for about 15 months now. I have always been very helped by this sub as well as the Snailcast ladies (SnowWhiteandtheAsianPear, Holy Snails, Fiddy Snails, and Fanservicedb). I wanted to leave some hopefully helpful reviews for people.\n\nMy skin used to be combination, closed comedones on forehead, some of cheeks, hormonal acne on chin every month, redness on cheeks, redness and hyperpigmentation after breakouts, sensitivity to many products. I live in Austin, TX. I'm 28. I'm white/Jewish. I have neutral toned skin.\n\nNow: skin is on the drier side (thank to all my actives) if I don't moisturize properly, no more acne ever, no more redness, learned I am sensitive to silicones! (so almost all problems have gone away)\n\n**First Cleansers**:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBanila Co. Clean It Zero Purity: what is there new to say? It's really good, it's great for sensitive skin. It's nice that it's a balm so you can let it sit on your face for a little while to dissolve makeup or grease or sunscreen. It's kind of hard to use in the shower; it's better to apply it on dry skin with dry hands (I think it's significantly more effective that way). I went through three tubs, but will not be repurchasing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Rituals Namasté Cleansing Oi](https://www.rituals.com/en-us/the-ritual-of-namaste-cleansing-oil-1101155.html)l (not AB): This is a really nice AB-inspired product. It's my first oil cleanser, and it has a nice, relatively weak smell. It's definitely a lot easier to use in the shower, but less comfortable than a balm to let sit on the face. It contains Lotus and Avocado and a number of oils (olive, sesame, sunflower, avocado, moringa, sunflower, macadamia). I have never had an issues with sensitivity to it, but it might be a problem for those who can't use anything with fragrance at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Second Cleansers:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHada Labo Rohto Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Cleansing Foam: for me, it's the best. again, not a lot to add to the conversation, but it's definitely the least drying of everything I've tried. Super basic, does the job. Nice foam, no smell, good price (HG)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHeimish All Clean Green Foam Cleanser (pH 5.5): ick. this is awful! SO DRYING. broke me out. I hate it. One of the only things I've straight up thrown away without finishing or giving to someone else. WNRP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCosRX Low pH Good Morning Cleanser: I...thought I liked this until I tried other things. It's just too drying for me and left my face tight. It now lives in the second bathroom for guests. Probably more appropriate for people with oily skin, but I honestly think it's just too drying for most people to use daily. WNRP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Exfoliating/Misc Cleansers:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBioderma Sensibio H2O Micellar Water (not AB): for me this is perfect for the morning. I use it on a cotton pad every single morning and it's perfect to take off anything from the night without being remotely drying. I highly recommend it and will repurchase forever (HG).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSon & Park Beauty Water: I actually really like this. I know many people think it's stupid, but I like to use it after my micellar water if I am putting on actives (it's pH balancing), and it just makes my face feel good. It's also really good at removing stubborn makeup. It smells nice. I'm not sure it does anything important but it makes me happy and maybe that's enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTosowoong Enzyme Powder Wash: I bought this as a cheaper alternative to the AmorePacific one. It's.....fine? The granules are pretty big and it doesn't feel very appropriate for sensitive, acneic, or similar types of skin. I usually try to start the foaming process on my hands first so that I don't rub the hard granules directly into my face which helps. Not sure I'd recommend to most people, but it is cheap (\\~$7).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAmorePacific Treatment Enzyme Peel: This is honestly really lovely for an enzyme wash (which I wanted to try), but it is also $60 at Sephora, which is just unreasonable to me. I have have it for almost a year to be fair, but I just don't use it all that often since I prefer actives rather than scrubs. If you have the money though, this is great! The granules are small and gentle, and it creates a really nice foam and leaves my face insanely soft. It isn't too drying, although I would avoid using it with a lot of other actives in your routine. If you need just a weekly enzyme treatment, it's a really good option, and it will last you for a LONG time this way. It also dispenses one \"dose\" at a time, which is nice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Masks:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOle Henriksen Hygge HydraClay Detox Mask (not AB): an ok clay mask. It's pretty moisturizing if you need that in a clay mask. I actually like it a lot, but now that I've discovered AB alternatives that are cheaper, I will stick with those. It is really great for dry skin though. Soothing texture, medium thick, won't pull out all the moisture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInnisfree Super Volcanic Pore Clay Mask: my preferred AB alternative due to price. It goes on super thin and dries quickly which is convenient so a tub lasts awhile. It's not too drying. The texture alone though makes it a great buy. I use it for the Fiddy Snails \"pore reducing\" method. RP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSkinfood Black Sugar Strawberry Mask Wash Off: It's nice. It smells good. It's definitely not a great option for very sensitive skin due to the granules, but it leaves your skin SO SOFT. I probably use it once a month (again, I'm super into actives). It's not an HG for me, but I imagine it's nice for people who like smelly things, cute things, or have oilier skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSkinfood Rice Mask Wash Off: Ahh so lovely. It's just soothing and it feels great on  your face. A much better plan for sensitive skin, due to texture and smell. I'll probably repurchase, but it's not an HG or anything like that. Nice for when you want to do something self-care-y, or you want to gently remove dry skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMalin + Goetz Detox Face Mask (not AB): a foaming mask à la Elizavecca. it's nice. It's fine. It's way too expensive. Fun if you have $$ to spend. Leaves skin a little drier than I would prefer, but it's a \"high end\" product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Actives (yay!):**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRohto Melano CC: I wanted to like it so bad. It broke me out so bad. I am sad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDear, Klairs Freshly Juiced Vitamin C Serum: It's just boring and not really effective so I passed it on to my boyfriend (hah). It did not break me out, but nor did it really do anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Ordinary Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate 10% (not AB): This is the first Vitamin C I used that made a HUGE difference (currently testing some stronger stuff). It almost completely eradicated my freckles (which was weird to be honest), but daily usage got rid of tons of brown spots, evened out skin tone. I honestly think this is a great, unsung product! High recommendations! (I used it daily -- AM)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Make Up Artist's Choice BellEvolve Lac-Luronic Serum](https://www.makeupartistschoice.com/BellEvolve-Lac-Luronic-Serum_p_291.html) (not AB): amaaaaaaaazing AHA. HG for sure. I can use it daily (After a little skin training) due to its inclusion of hydrating ingredients. It's an absolutely wonderful strong alternative to Sunday Riley and much cheaper. GO GET IT. seriously. This plus CosRX completely eradicated all my closed comedones. I literally did not believe that could happen. It's beautiful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCosRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid: HG for me. I also use it daily with no issue (again, after a little training). It's just wonderful, not too drying as long as you properly moisturize. I adore it. Also one that has been written about a lot so not going to say much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 2% Emulsion (not AB): well...I wanted to try a retinoid and so there was this. It definitely works. I'm hoping it will help with my fine forehead lines and smile lines. It's definitely drying so you need to add a lot of moisture but obviously it's no tret. I use it at night a few days a week. I still love it and will rebuy. Maybe will try something stronger one day, but I'm a little scared.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSunday Riley Good Genes All-in-One Lactic Acid Treatment (not AB): it's honestly an HG magic potion but it's expensive AF so I turned to the above choice which does almost as well. I still will love this forever. My skin was like a radiant sun the morning after. Wish it was cheaper.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution: This is terrifying looking but nice! I use it once a month, and it's hard  to tell how amazing it given that I already have a lot of actives in my routine, but I think it's a good option for people who want an acid punch every so often and their skin can tolerate it. Skin is left suuuuuuper smooth and plump after. WRP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurology (zinc pyrithione 0.25%, niacinamide 4%, azelaic acid 4%): I think Curology is super cool. I like my cream a lot. I kind of want to replace it with other products, but I use it when I want an alternative to my cabinet of actives. My formula is definitely not super strong, but if I am lazy and just slab some on before bed, my skin always looks great in the morning. It's also nice for traveling to bring fewer products along.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCosRX Natural BHA Skin Returning Emulsion: I bought it before I knew what I was doing. Worthless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FTEs**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMissha Time Revolution First Treatment Essence Intensive Moist: I thought it was great until I tried other stuff, but it was a nice place to start. Definitely helped products absorb better and had some brightening affects. Meh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecret Key Rose Starting Treatment Essence: same as above, it was fine. Helpful, but not overly so. Meh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNaruko La Creme Face Renewal Miracle Essence: THE BEST. HG. I loove this FTE. It makes everything soak in incredibly. It is SO brightening for me and makes me feel radiant. I pat it on with my hands and one bottle lasts forever. It's also on sale a lot on the Naruko US site, but I have bought it from eBay too. Truly a wonderful product. Not good for those with fungal acne I believe since it has ferments. But seriously, check this out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Hydrating Toners**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDear, Klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner:  It's distinctly fine. It hydrates. It does an ok job. It did not break me out. I find it deeply boring and not especially great, but also not harmful. Meh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIsntree Hyaluronic Acid Toner: A little bit of an improvement over Klairs. I sometimes put two layers on and I like the viscous texture. It's also not magical but it does the job of hydrating fine. I will not repurchase. I know some people really like it so if you like trying out new hydrating toners, this is worth trying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHada Labo Gokujyun Premium Lotion (Hyaluronic Acid): HG. I know I know everyone and their mother loves it, but it is perfect. I only do one layer but it just works SO well. A lot has been said about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Essences/Serums**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Ordinary Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA (not AB): I think this is a good product. I wanted a brightener, I bought this since it was a good price and it did fine. I liked until I discovered ---->\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNaruko Raw Jobs Tears Supercritical CO2 Pore Minimizing & Brightening Essence: this one! Omg, it is absolutely amazing. HG forever. It is seriously magical and makes me glow. I adore this essence and I kind of hoard it. It has a nice slightly viscous texture and soaks in well. I wish the glass bottle was larger because it doesn't last as long as I would prefer, but it is a GREAT product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCosRX Advanced Snail Mucin 96 Power Essence: also HG for me. It really soothes my redness and is a great thing whenever I am feeling dry at all. A lot has been said about it. I like it very much\n\n&#x200B;\n\nScinic Honey All-In-One Ampoule: another HG for me. I'm not sure if it's being discontinued though because I can't seem to find it most places and just ordered a new bottle off eBay. It is SO hydrating and delicious. It smells good, it feels great, and leaves my skin deeply hydrated and plump. Really a wonderful product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHoly Snail Shark Sauce: broke me out A TON. nope.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Moisturizers/Occlusives**:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFresh Lotus Youth Preserve Face Cream with Super 7 Complex (not AB): so this was my HG for many years before I got int AB. It does have silicone low down on the ingredient list and it never bothered me. I still think it's my favorite non-AB moisturizer, but it's a bit $$.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDr. Jart +: Cicapair Tiger Grass Cream: This honestly is a greasy mess but it's wonderful if you have difficult angry red skin. It saved me during allergy season last year and it's great for repairing. I would not wear it outside though due to grease factor. Great for red people!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRosette Ceramide Gel: it broke me out and I'm sad. Will probably retest in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBenton Aloe Propolis Soothing Gel: Also broke me out and I'm not sure why.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDear, Klairs Rich Moist Soothing Cream: I really like this stuff. It has a great texture, it dries down well. I like to try new creams, but I think this is very solid product and I have repurchased. I would highly recommend giving it a try if you're silicone-sensitive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInnisfree Green Tea Fresh Cream: Oh dear. So this is a tub of gel. It smells. It's shiny...but at least it doesn't break me out! So there's that. Definitely never again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInnisfree Jeju Sparkling Moisture Cream: Also broke me out and I'm not sure why. I wanted to like it. It smells nice. It feels nice. Too bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEtude House Soon Jun 2x Barrier Intensive Cream: This is just thick and goopy. It doesn't feel good and if I use it too much it starts making closed comedones. Not a fan. WNRP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEtude House Soon Jung 5-Panthensoside Cica Balm: Another one that is just WAY too thick, does not absorb and starts creating CCs. Nope.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA'Pieu Sea Buckthorn Cream: this is such a solid product. I'm not sure it's magical but it's a really lovely cream without silicones that dries well and is cheap. That's a lot going for it. I am currently trying out some new stuff, but this is a solid choice for those of us who can't use silicones.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEtude House Soon Kune 5-Panthensoside Sleeping Pack: This just...gives me acne if I use it nightly which sucks. It's perfectly fine if I use it once every few days, but not optimal. I can't use most sleeping packs so I'm still looking for a better option. WNRP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSulwhasoo Overnight Vitalizing Mask: dear god broke me out SO BAD. Now it belongs to my mom. It makes her happy. Probably for the best since it's $$\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStratia Liquid Gold: also so much breaking out. Definitely never again. No.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGarden of Wisdom Black Current Seed Oil: really great! Seriously. perfect in winter. No breakouts. Check it out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sunscreen**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNivea Sun Protect Super Water Gel SPF 50/PA+++: drying and acne. Trying to pawn it off on other people in my life at the moment who don't wear enough sunscreen\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCanmake Mermaid UV Gel: HG forever the end. I should probably wear it more often.....>.>\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Foundation (so difficult if you can't wear silicones!!)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHera UV Mist Cushion: HAHAHA I didn't know about my silicone problem and it was acne hell. HELL.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMilk Makeup Sunshine Skin Tint (not AB): it's really nice. light. feels good. doesn't break me out. I don't makeup very often but I like this one a lot!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBareMinerals Complexion Rescue Tinted Hydrating Gel Cream (not AB): another solid choice. my skin is so nice now after this year that I don't ever want thick foundation and this can still be used with a beauty blender and gives a nice clean glow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToo Faced Hangover Replenishing Face Primer (not AB): a great primer for silicone-free people! It's not like profoundly mattifying or anything but it works and we have so few options.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMilk Makeup Blur Stick (not AB): pilling. pilling. did I mention pilling? No silicones though and mattifying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sheet Masks I Like:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnnie's Way Black Rose Devils Moisturizing Secret\n\nBNBG Vita Genic Relaxing Jelly Mask\n\nElizavecca Honey Deep Power Ringer\n\nEtude House Ceramide\n\nEvercos Luxury Bogam Herbal Clinic Mask - Licorice\n\nEvercos Luxury Bogam Herbal Clinic Mask - Ginseng\n\nIlli Camellia Oil Nourishing\n\nL'Herboflore Ceramide Complex Moisturizing Silk\n\nLeaders Amino Clearing\n\nLovemore Loofah & Aloe Vera\n\nLuLuLun Sweet Drop Nature Care\n\nMamonde Rose\n\nMamonde Hibiscus\n\nMaskingdom Chinese Medi Roseroot & Liquorice\n\nMediHeal Vita Lightbeam\n\nMy Beauty Diary Liposome Hyaluronic Acid\n\nMy Beauty Diary Black Pearl\n\nMy Beauty Diary Squalene\n\nMy Scheming L-Ascorbic Acid\n\nMy Scheming Hot Spring Water Moisturizing\n\nMy Scheming 7-in-1 Brightening\n\nNaisture Tea Tree\n\nNaruko Rose and Botanic HA Aqua Cubic Hydrating\n\nNaruko Snail Essence Intense Hydra Repair\n\nNaruko Magnolia Brightening and Firming\n\nNaruko NRK HA Hydro-Lock Moisturizing\n\nNature Republic Aqua Collagen Solution\n\nPapa Recipe Bombee Honey Mask\n\nTosowoong Pure Green Tea\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sheet Masks I Don't Like:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCosRX Holy Moly Snail Mask\n\nEtude House Hyaluronic Acid\n\nIlli Mugwort Calming Mask\n\nJayJun Rose Blossom\n\nJM Solution Water Luminous S.O.S.

        "body": "Whoa those are a lot of products for 15 months! Thanks for the reviews :)\n\nI feel like it's hard for me to tell when or if I break out from a product since I would sometimes get a random breakout that isn't confined to a specific part of my facr anyway. I've also read that it can take up to a few weeks to see results from a product – be it an amazing glow or crazy bumps or horrible breakouts, which again adds to the whole dilemma of like, how do I know if this is just the regular breakout, or if it's from that product, or if it's maybe from that cake I ate or sth :/ \n\nI actually have been using the same products for almost a year now because of this. Like I would try adding new stuff but I would get a breakout, usually not straight away, and I would get paranoid about it being from that new product and cut that out again.\n\nAll is to say.. *how* are you able to use so many products and tell if one is breaking you out??

        "body": "Very helpful! Thanks for the list! I am restocking a lot of my routine and your skin seems pretty similar to mine so I am going to try a number of the products that you said worked for you.\n\nI agree that balm style cleansers are hard to use in the shower for sure! I usually don't shower at the same time I oil cleanse (I only oil cleanse 1x day, at night) but when I do, what I do is turn on the shower, then standing at the sink with dry hands I rub my balm cleanser on my face first & massage my eyes a little to release waterproof mascara. Then I blindly step into the now-warmed-up shower to rinse it off & wash my face with 2nd cleanser. I haven't fallen and hurt myself yet!!\n\nAnyways .... since you found balms a little less convenient, it might be that liquid oil cleansers just fit your habits better-- but if you ever want to re-try balms I'd make 2 more recommendations for you: either Aromatica Orange Sherbert or Farmacy Green Clean.\n\nAromatica is a #1 amazing product, the 180 mL jar is humongous and aggressively priced (even w/the Banila \"large\" 180mL, or \\~20% cheaper).  I find it gets mascara off 100x better than Banila and rinses more easily. I like Farmacy Green Clean even better -- small jars are available for $$$ at Sephora so it's quite easy to try/access -- but I haven't decided whether it's really worth 2-3x the price.... sigh.\n\nAs for Curology, I love mine too!! It's well priced imo and nice to get all the stuff they will put in there for you. I personally started on the formulation you have! I always recommend it to my family. Getting on their cream subscription solved like a 2 yrs straight acne breakout issue for me.\n\nThanks for listing all the sheet masks you've tried rq in such an organized format!!!! As a person who rarely sheet masks, whenever I try a new one, I always feel like I'm picking at random because so many exist and it's so hard to find opinions.  Great post :)\n\n&#x200B;",

I know this topic has been discussed many times before, but my problem showed up after a YEAR of constant use, it wasn't an immediate reaction. The Hada Labo products were my HGs! I used the Premium, Moist and Light lotions depending on the climate and my skin needs. I also used the Premium and Moist Milks and the Perfect Gel. I loved all of the products as they were giving me the best skin I ever had! One day, out of the blue I started breaking out in small pimples all over, which is the reaction other users have reported as well. Tried cutting out other products from my routine, but the breakout didn't stop until I cut out the Hada Labo products. I waited a week for my skin to calm down to reintroduce the lotions and got the same breakout, this time an immediate reaction overnight! The breakout was all over my face, eyes, neck, chest area, everywhere the product has been applied to. Tried introducing the products a third time with the same outcome and gave up. I am now trying to use them up on my legs as this is the only area of my body that doesn't break out from them. To this day I cannot pinpoint what caused this delayed reaction. Some say it's the alcohol, but it can't be as I use other lotions containing it and don't get that reaction, plus I would expect for my skin to react to it straight away, not wait a year! Also, the Light lotion doesn't contain alcohol and I still breakout from it. Some say it's the hyaluronic acid, but again, I use other products containing it without issues. Now, I am trying to find a lotion that comes even close to the Hada Labo's effect, but no luck so far.",

Like I was happy it was in there instead of some other random ingredient, but wasn't expecting much from it.)",

        "body": "Hello, just checking in to vouch for the Good Molecules Discoloration Serum. This is the ONLY brightening serum I’ve tried that lightened my acne spots in a matter of 2-3 months rather than 1.5-2 years. I just finished my 3rd bottle last night, lol. Tryyying to go on a no buy for all of May, but if I start breaking out into new zits, I will 100% buy this to take care of the hyperpigmentation.\n\nI went through 1.5 bottles of the Inkey List Tranex Serum and saw zero results. My acne marks showed absolutely no change over the few months that I was using this. Then I went back to the Good Molecules, boom 2 weeks and the spots were basically gone. Also the texture of the Good Molecules is slightly thinner, and doesn’t make my moisturizer pill the way the Inkey List does.\n\nEdit: Another product with TXA is the Murad Replenishing Multi-Acid Peel. It’s a biphase acid toner with tranexamic, salicylic, glycolic, lactic, and malic acids. I don’t believe they disclose the % of any of the acids.\n\nEdit #2: I just saw your reasoning for not including the Murad on the list!",

However the Inkey List one sometimes causes my moisturizer to pill, which is annoying. I only use it at night, so it's less of an issue I guess!\n\nI was wavering between this one and the Good Molecules tranex serum. I'm betting (hoping) the Good Molecules formula has at least 2-3% tranexamic acid and probably 5% niacinamide. I'm also interested in the JJLabs formulas. A youtuber I follow knows the founder/chemist behind the brand and swears by some of his products, so I do think they are legit. I figure it's kind of like going to a compounding pharmacy to get a specific drug combination custom formulated for you, but instead it's skincare. I agree it's unusual.\n\nMy questions about tranexamic acid that I can't seem to find much on are the side effects - I was really worried if this would cause irritation because I'm sensitive to most acids (bha, aha, even ascorbic acid), so I didn't know if this would be something like hyaluronic acid or more like an exfoliating acid. So far it's been fine! I alternate it every other night with my retinol serum and I use the Inkey List's alpha arbutin every morning.",

    "body": "I was thinking about posting this in the DHT but then I decided a good discussion might come of it. Have you switched from more of a \"I want to test everything\" to \"I'd like to stick to what works\". I know there are people who actually like to stick to their favorite products once they find them but I was always mostly keen on experimenting except for lately when I mostly thought about some products running out... and I actually wanted to repurchase them because they work very well for me and they fit my very tight budget just perfectly and experimenting in this case would be very unreasonable. Now, also I'm a blogger but I'm so behind on blogging I've barely talked about any of my hits of 2017 so I'm not gonna run out of products to to write about any time soon and ordering new stuff just so I can experiment seems unnecessary. \n\nWhat are the products keep going back to or you don't even feel like experimenting? \n\nFor me it was sunscreen. Even though I would eventually order new one once favorites would get discounted but I've bought numerous tubes of ***Missha All Around Safe Block Waterprood Sun SPF 50 PA +++*** and now I will stick to the updated version. I'm also a fan of **Missha All Around Safe Block Essence Sun SPF 45 PA +++**. The other 2 high SPF versions are not bad either, I would repurchase them too. Bioré UV **Aqua Rich Watery Essence** and **Watery Gel** would always find themselves on my shelf because of their elegant formulas. **Bioré UV Perfect Milk** is a great base for dry skin and I will forever stick to it as long as the formula is as good. \n\nSkincare favorites that I keep getting back to again and again are **Mizon Snail Recovery Gel**, **All In One Snail Repair Cream** and **Snail Repair Intensive Ampoule** for their soothing and healing properties. The **Scinic Honey All In One** Ampoule is amazing for hydration and soothing and I don't think I can't find something as good for that price per ml so I will have to repurchase it right away. And I am addicted to the scent. **Kikumasamune High Moist Toner** is also incredibly cheap and moisturizing and forever my bae.  I think I will repurchase **Mizon Skin Power Original First Essence** because it does the job for me and it fits my budget and what more can I want from it? \n\n**Cosrx Natural BHA Skin Returning A-Sol** is incredible for when you have an annoying spot that doesn't want to go away, apply it morning and evening and it significantly improved in two days. When you use it as a spot treatment it lasts you ages, it's inexpensive and worth every penny, better than every other product I've used because it's not irritating. \n\nHigh end repruchase is a **Sulwhasoo Overnight Vitalizing Mask** because it gives me a glow that no other product does. I simply love what this sleeping pack does with my dry skin. \n\n**Kosé Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil** is inexpensive and removes heavy makeup oil with ease so I'll definitely repurchase it, the packaging is very convenient, it has the best pump ever but I love that I can buy a refill too. Fragrance-free is something I enjoy too. Something I would call a reliable product, very easy to emulsify and wash off. Non-AB but **The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter** can often be found on sale and it's convenient for traveling, again reliable and easy to use. Would keep it in my stash. \n\n**Yves Rocher Nutritive Végétal Velvety Toner** is a super inexpensive hydrating toner I always have around for DIY masks or just in case. I love the fragrance of the line. \n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%** is great for overall brightening strengthening of the barrier and fighting breakouts, it's hard to find a basic ingredient like that on its own in Europe and TO has pretty good service so for now I am sticking to them. Yes, I run out of it quickly but the price fits my budget for now. **Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate 10%** is an amazing vitamin C serum without all the irritation of the L-AA, TO has the cheapest formula I've found so far. **Advanced Retinoid 2%** is relatively inexpensive and it doesn't cause me any irritation so yes, I am very much sticking to it, it has visible brightening effect for the 2 months I've been using it. \n\n\n\n\n***\n\nWhat are your staples? The products you've purchased again and again because they work for your skin, because they are inexpensive or because you are too lazy looking for an alternative. ",

Mind you, this does not mean that I won’t be tempted to try out some new stuff in the future...\n\nMy repurchases:\n\n- Leaf & Botanics Cleansing Cream Sake 4-5x\n\n- Mochitto Face Wash >5x\n\n- House of Rose Milcure Pure Powder and Wash 1x\n\n- SK-II Facial Treatment Essence 2x — this one is a case of “I tried it, tried to dupe it, failed, and am now still trying”\n\n- Kuramoto Bijin Komeyu Serum 2x\n\n- Mochitto Face Lotion 1x\n\n- Leaf & Botanics Face Emulsion Sake 2-3x\n\n- Benton Snail Bee High Content Steam Cream 2-3x\n\n- Evermére Cosmetics UV Gel SPF50+ PA++++ 3-4x\n\n- Shiseido Perfect UV Protector SPF50+ PA++++ WetForce HydroFresh 1x\n\nNotice how I haven’t repurchased any toner just yet.

But I also had some foil samples of it that I took on travel and when I used them, my skin was so glowy and supple that I decided to add the cream to my routine. Never looking back -- it's the perfect thing under my sunscreen in the winter.\n\nI also keep going back to **Stratia Liquid Gold**. I constantly try newer, more exciting things to take its place and nothing measures up. I recently upset my skin with a new cleanser and nothing was bringing it back into line until I went back to slathering it with Liquid Gold mixed with Aquaphor (thanks u/the_acid_queen for the fantastic idea).\n\nI've also recently switched from using the Klairs toner to using the **Klairs Rich Moist Soothing Serum**, which I like because I can use a cheaper, easier-to-find glycerin mist right after cleansing, but get the soothing and deeply hydrating properties of the Klairs toner without doing multiple layers. And I might be able to just toss the full-sized bottle into my TSA-approved bag when I travel again next month.\n\nFinally, it irritates me to say this every time I do because I find Glossier's ~aesthetic~ annoying, but I simply can't use any water-based cleanser besides **Glossier Milky Jelly**. I've tried, ye gods how I've tried! But there's something about the gentle, non-eye-irritating, pH-4.5 formula that is perfect for my skin.

This has mostly been driven by a tendency for my skin to freak out at multiple layers, so if I find something that keeps things calm, I'm likely to stick with it. Although not all my products are AB, the ones I'm staying with are there because of suggestions in this community.\n\nAfter a few duds, I came across **DHC Deep Cleansing Oil**. I feel like this is widely known, but I like it because there are minimal ingredients, it's easily purchased on Amazon Canada, it spreads easily, emulsifies nicely, and washes off without residue. I left it for a while for a balm, but eventually came back and remembered how much I like it.\n\nThis is a prescription, but **Finacea** (azelaic acid) is HG status for me and I can't see myself stopping it anytime soon. It has helped immensely with my acne, it controls perioral dermatitis, it clears my pores a bit, and it helps with pigmentation. I first heard about this med here, and I'm so glad I did.\n\nAlthough I switch it around from morning to nighttime routines, **CeraVe PM** is something I repurchase frequently. It's accessible, nicely formulated, and works well with my skin. It's not particularly exciting or fun, but it seems my skin doesn't really like that.",

I love it.

It doesn't leave a residue and doesn't break me out. And I adore the fragrance, which is very, very light and washes away with the makeup. One of the few products I've had no interest in replacing.\n\n**Stratia Liquid Gold** My first Holy Grail.  I completely fried my moisture barrier using an acid peel. My face burned anytime I washed it and looked dry and withered. I ordered Liquid Gold and in *2* days my skin was soothed, healthy and healed.  It is a great light moisturizer, but I use it as an emulsion and love it.  I flat out couldn't use acids to the level I do without it.  If I could only keep one item from my current line up, this would be it with no question or hesitation.\n\n**CosRx Ultra Moisturizing Lotion with Birch Sap** Where I live, summer will hit 100F.  This CosRx Lotion gives me an occlusive layer of hydration that's very lightweight on my skin.  It's the only moisturizer that doesn't leave me a sweaty mess on the hottest days.  It also plays great with sunscreens.  I'm still searching for the cream of my dreams, but this will forever be my summer moisturizer.\n\nI do have a roving eye though.  I'm currently giving longing looks at several 2nd cleansers, like Holy Snails' new Kadi cleanser, Simplistic's Begin cleanser, Hygee All In One Cleansing Foam.  Toners are another category where I'm not feeling faithful to my current choices. It's mostly that the ones I want to try are not the cheapest. 107, Hygee, Earth's Recipe and Swanicco are not drug store priced by any stretch of the imagination. The new Banila V-V toner sounds great, but I have issues with W2's (now Beauty Tap?) shady pricing and I haven't seen it anywhere else.",

Others I like and they could continue to grow on me, but I’d still give new things a shot out of curiosity (although I’m currently mostly sticking with particular brands that I’ve already liked products from previously). Mostly I’m having renewed love for some western favorites (Caudalie, Origins, Sunday Riley), but these are the AB products I’ve been re-buying consistently:\n\n**Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence** - I don’t spend much time out in the sun, so mostly I just want the most cosmetically elegant formula I can get and this is it. I don’t even feel the need to try other options because this is everything I want and nothing I don’t want. I’ve lost count of how many tubes I’ve gone through at this point.\n\n**Blossom Jeju Blooming Flowers Toner** - This is the perfect mix of function and enjoyment for me. It’s calming, hydrating, and plays well with every product I’ve ever used in a routine with it. Plus, it has the most stunning scent and the prettiest bottle. I’ve tried worse, but I’ve never tried better and the products that have been similar in quality just don’t make me as happy and that’s what makes it worth it for me. I’m only on my second or third bottle because it lasts me forever, but I’ve been using it pretty consistently for a few years.\n\n**Dr Jart Cicapair Color Correcting Treatment** - This is a recent love, but I’m adding it here because it’s a pretty unique product for me, so I don’t see it having any foreseeable competition and even if it did, dang, it would have to be something revolutionary. This simultaneously masks and calms my redness, evening out my pale skin in a way I much prefer to foundation.\n\nI don’t know. Products have to basically be HG to convince me not to cheat on them. I go through things slowly enough that I want to really enjoy what I’m using. It’s easier for me because I don’t keep a consistent routine and like mixing things up depending how my skin feels that day, so I keep multiples for each category in rotation. RP is sort of a vague term for me in that way. My skin does best with options.",

But I also wonder, since ferments aren't really a thing that majority of consumers in the Western market are looking out for (like fragrance, rose water, coconut water, rosehip oil, fruit/veggie extracts that have label/experience appeal, but aren't necessarily good for skin), why would these huge companies bother putting ferments in their expensive skin care if they didn't have evidence that they do SOMETHING?\n\nI especially am curious because AB/Korean beauty are sometimes looked down upon as just being trendy and not using ingredients that are scientifically proven to be truly beneficial for skin.\n\nDo you think ferments are legit?

Fermenting antioxidant rich ingredients such as ginseng, green tea etc. breaks down the antioxidants/complex molecules that are beneficial to our skin into smaller molecules, which allows it to be absorbed into the skin easily. Not only that, yeast/bacteria ferments produce additional metabolites (AHAs, peptides) that provide additional benefits such as whitening, hydration, skin repair, you name it!\n\nEdit: forgot to put my favorite fermented product!! I love the Manyo Factory Galactomyces Niacin Special treatment. :) \n\n2nd Edit: here are the links to some scientific literature articles on fermented cosmetics which were found through PubMed! You do need access to the database if you want to read them in its entirety, but you can get some brief information on the topic just through the abstract.\n\nFermenting red ginseng enhances its safety and efficacy as a novel skin care anti-aging ingredient: in vitro and animal study.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23126662\n \nEvaluation of tyrosinase inhibitory and antioxidant activities of Angelica dahurica root extracts for four different probiotic bacteria fermentations.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254340\n\nSkin resistance to UVB-induced oxidative stress and hyperpigmentation by the topical use of Lactobacillus helveticus NS8-fermented milk supernatant.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28598022\n\nBifidobacterium-fermented soy milk extract stimulates hyaluronic acid production in human skin cells and hairless mouse skin.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12637786",

The infundibulum within the **hair** follicle (400-600 μm deep \\[.4 mm to .6 mm\\]) is lined with a particularly dense network of dendridic cells making it the most immunologically active region, therefore this was specifically targeted for delivery. As they had previously demonstrated that particles of different sizes penetrate **follicles** to different depths, the vaccine carriers were of **1 mm** diameter to target the infundibulum. They showed that their **1 mm** silicon dioxide microparticles efficiently penetrated the **hair** **follicles** to deliver vaccine constituents to dendridic cells in the infundibulum within 1 hour of topical application. They also showed that particles remained as a depot within the **follicle** for up to 10 days contrasting with particles on the stratum corneum \\[most outward layer of skin\\] that were rapidly removed after about 1 day.

A significant increase in level of **collagen** type I, III, and VII, newly synthesized **collagen** and tropoelastin from baseline was observed after 6 **microneedling** sessions at 2-week intervals. This percutaneous **collagen** induction leads to an overall youthful appearance of the skin by reducing fine lines and wrinkles, reducing pore size, more suppleness, and elasticity.\n\nThe needles also breakdown the old hardened scar strands and allow it to revascularize. Neovascularization and neo**collagen**esis is initiated by migration and proliferation of fibroblasts and laying down of intercellular matrix. A fibronectin matrix forms after 5 days of injury that determines the deposition of **collagen** resulting in skin tightening persisting for 5–7 years in the form of **collagen** III. The depth of neo**collagen**esis has been found to be 5–600 µm \\[.5–.6 mm\\] with a **1.5 mm** length needle. Histological examination of the skin treated with 4 **microneedling** sessions 1 month apart shows upto 400% increase in **collagen** and elastin deposition at 6 months postoperatively, with a thickened stratum spinosum and normal rete ridges at 1 year postoperatively. **Collagen** fibre bundles appear to have a normal lattice pattern rather than parallel bundles as in scar tissue.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4976400/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4976400/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Low-Level Laser Therapy [LLLT]\n\n2013: **LLLT** was discovered serendipitously in the 1960s when mice irradiated with a low fluence red laser grew **hair**. Animal and human data have slowly accumulated supporting **LLLT** for **hair** growth. **LLLT** appears to improve a variety of non-scarring alopecias—AGA \\[Androgenetic Alopecia\\], AA \\[Alopecia Areata\\], and chemotherapy-induced alopecia. Based on the studies demonstrating **LLLT**'s effects on promoting graft survival, it may be further suggested to have a potential to be used during the immediate period of post-**hair** transplant surgery to facilitate the healing process and enhance viability and earlier growth of the grafts. While mechanisms are still emerging, **LLLT** may increase **anagen hairs** through release of NO \\[Nitric Oxide\\] from CCO \\[cytochrome c oxidase\\] by photodissociation and **LLLT** may reduce inflammation in AA. Most studies investigating effects of **LLLT** on **hair** growth have used wavelengths that range from **635 nm** to **650 nm**, but as of today no study has compared the effect of near-infrared wavelengths such as **810 nm**, which have deeper penetrating capacities, to red light.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3944668/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3944668/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2013: **LLLT** aids skin rejuvenation through increasing **collagen** production and decreasing **collagen** degradation. LED which is a novel light source for non-thermal, non-ablative skin rejuvenation has been shown to be effective for improving wrinkles and skin laxity. It is not a new phenomenon since the first reports of **LLLT** effects on increased **collagen** go back to 1987. Studies by Abergel et al. and Yu et al. reported an increase in production of pro-**collagen**, **collagen**, basic fibroblast **growth factors** (bFGF) and proliferation of fibroblasts after exposure to low-energy laser irradiation in vitro and in vivo animal models. Furthermore, **LLLT** was already known to increase microcirculation, vascular perfusion in the skin, alter platelet-derived **growth factor** (PDGF), transforming **growth factor** (TGF-β1) and inhibit apoptosis.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4126803/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4126803/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LLLT Use**\n\nMy LLLT wand/stick is to be used once every two days.

The mechanism of this increase is not known, however, it may involve increased expression or activation of TGF-β. In addition, treatment of skin with all-trans **retinoic acid** before UV exposure inhibits **collagen** breakdown by matrix metalloproteinases and protects against UV-induced reduction of pro**collagen** expression, as demonstrated in this study. Therefore, all-trans **retinoic acid** and its metabolic precursor all-trans **retinol** (**vitamin A**) should have the capacity to both repair existing photodamage and retard accumulation of new photodamage.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC381286/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC381286/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tretinoin Prescription**\n\nTo get **tretinoin** you need to have a doctor’s prescription–in USA. A way to do this is to say that it is for Actinic Keratosis.\n\n2011: Actinic keratosis is the third most common skin complaint treated by dermatologists in the US and, according to the American Academy of Dermatology, 60% of predisposed individuals over the age of 40 years have at least one lesion. They occur most frequently on sun-exposed skin of the face, scalp, arms, and hands. Important risk factors include fair skin, cumulative sun exposure, and immunosuppression, including further ultraviolet light exposure. Actinic keratosis is now considered to be the beginning of a biologic continuum that leads to invasive squamous cell carcinoma, thus treatment is medically necessary.\n\nSource:[ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3132090/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3132090/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nActinic keratoses describes lesions caused by too much exposure to the ultraviolet rays of sunlight. They are the beginnings of skin cancer, most often appearing after age 40. In some areas where climate is mild year-round, these lesions appear in much younger people. People with fair skin, blond or red hair, and blue or green eyes are most at risk of developing these rough, scaly patches, or keratoses.\n\nSource: [https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-actinic-keratosis-basics](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-actinic-keratosis-basics)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tretinoin Use**\n\nI am supposed to use my **tretinoin** every evening–so I assume all are to be used daily–but the study used **.01%**, I was given **.1%**. The skin cell cycle is 28 days, if I don't use my **tretinoin** for even half that, 2 days after the first application I am peeling all over; it looks terrible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Retinoids**\n\nTopical **retinoids** are still considered the gold standard for clinically effective topical antiaging products . **Retinoids** are a family of compounds composed of **vitamin A**, its derivatives, and synthetic molecules acting through the same pathway. Besides all-trans **retinoic acid** (**RA**), the major bioactive form, the term “**retinoids**” includes retinaldehyde, retinol, and various retinyl esters. They act through **retinoic acid** receptors (RARs) and **retinoid** X receptors (RXRs), increasing the amount of type I procollagens and decreasing the amount of MMPs. **RA** increases the amount of type I, III, and VII **collagens** in the **dermis**, and can reorganize the dermal **collagen** into new woven bundles. In addition, **RA** stimulates normalization of the elastic tissue organization and GAG deposition in the **dermis**. In clinical trials, topical **retinoids** are clinically effective for the treatment of dermal aging, including wrinkles, roughness, and laxity. However, they can be irritating to a significant percentage of the population, and further development of ways to reduce their irritation potential is needed. Retinol, which metabolizes to retinaldehyde and **retinoic acid**, has been found to be less irritating than **retinoic acid** and is widely used as an ingredient for antiaging cosmeceuticals.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6540032/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6540032/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Vitamin C\n\nNote: **Vitamin C**’s purest form is  **L-ascorbic acid**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2017: The following information is available as a result of research into the role of **vitamin C** in skin health:\n\n* Skin fibroblasts have an absolute dependence on **vitamin C** for the synthesis of **collagen**, and for the regulation of the **collagen**/elastin balance in the dermis. There is ample in vitro data with cultured cells demonstrating this dependency. In addition, **vitamin C** supplementation of animals has shown improved **collagen** synthesis in vivo.\n* Skin keratinocytes have the capacity to accumulate high concentrations of **vitamin C**, and this in association with vitamin E affords protection against UV irradiation. This information is available from in vitro studies with cultured cells, with supportive information from animal and human studies.\n* Analysis of keratinocytes in culture has shown that **vitamin C** influences gene expression of antioxidant enzymes, the organisation and accumulation of phospholipids, and promotes the formation of the stratum corneum \\[most outward layer of skin\\] and the differentiation of the epithelium in general.\n* Signs of aging in human skin can be ameliorated through the provision of **vitamin C**. A number of studies support this, although measurement of skin changes is difficult. Some studies include objective measures of **collagen** deposition and wrinkle depth.\n* The provision of **vitamin C** to the skin greatly assists wound healing and minimises raised scar formation. This has been demonstrated in numerous clinical studies in humans and animals.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2012: **L-ascorbic acid** can be used orally and topically for skin benefits. **Vitamin C** is a cofactor for lysyl and prolyl hydroxylase, which stabilize the triple helical structure of **collagen**. It also plays a role in cholesterol synthesis, iron absorption and increases the bioavailability of selenium. The most commonly described cutaneous manifestations accompanying **vitamin C** deficiency are attributed to the impaired **collagen** synthesis.\n\nFurthermore, oral administration of an antioxidant mixture containing **vitamin C**, vitamin E, pycnogenol and evening primrose oil significantly inhibited wrinkle formation caused by chronic UVB irradiation through significant inhibition of UVB-induced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity accompanied by enhancement of **collagen** synthesis on hairless mouse skin.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583891/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583891/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Vitamin C Use**\n\n2001: L-ascorbic acid must be formulated at pH levels less than 3.5 to enter the skin. Maximal concentration for optimal percutaneous absorption was 20%. Tissue levels were saturated after three daily applications; the half-life of tissue disappearance was about 4 days. Derivatives of ascorbic acid including magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, ascorbyl-6-palmitate, and dehydroascorbic acid did not increase skin levels of L-ascorbic acid.\n\nSource: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11207686/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11207686/)\n\nThe above says that **vitamin C**’s low pH may irritate your skin. So only use it a few days before a **dermarolling** session, it only takes 3 daily applications of 20% **vitamin C** to saturate the skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Hyaluronic Acid [HA]\n\nNotes: **HA** can be bought as a lotion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFindings \\[from 1999\\] indicated that suppression of transcriptional activity of type VI **collagen** is associated with the reduction of cartilage matrix tissue, and that **HA** is associated with the suppression of the effect of IL-1β.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6603175/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6603175/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat sentence is hard to understand. It says that **HA** suppresses the effect of IL-1β, which is good because IL-1β suppresses transcriptional activity of type VI **collagen**, which in effect reduces the cartilage matrix tissue.\n\n2011: A major component of the extracellular matrix is \\[**HA**\\] or **hyaluronan**. **HA** is a naturally occurring anionic **polysaccharide** most abundantly present in mammalian skin where it is localized not only in the **dermis** (≈0.5mg/g wet tissue), but also in the **epidermis** (≈0.1mg/g wet tissue). Due to its considerable capacity to bind water, **HA has greater skin hydration properties than other** **polysaccharides**. Topical application of **HA** increases hydration of the \\[stratum corneum⁠—most outward layer of skin\\] largely through a humectant effect.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3050617/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3050617/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2018: \\[**HA**\\] is a naturally occurring biopolymer in bacteria and vertebras. **HA** is a highly hydrophilic molecule with the ability to bind water up to a 1000 times its own weight.\n\nThe turnover rate of **HA** in vivo depends on where the **HA** is located. The half time of **HA** in the circulation system is approximaty 2-5 minutes while the half time in more rigid tissue, such as cartilage, is 1-3 weeks.

These in vitro results suggest that **tea-tree** oil may be useful in the treatment of yeast and fungal mucosal and skin infections.\n\nSource: [https://japmaonline.org/view/journals/apms/88/10/87507315-88-10-489.xml](https://japmaonline.org/view/journals/apms/88/10/87507315-88-10-489.xml)\n\nEssentially **Tea Tree** oil just kills everything, including **hair**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Lavender**\n\nNote: **Lavender** is an antibacterial and antifungal like **Tea Tree**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2016: These results indicated that **LO** \\[**Lavender Oil**\\] has a marked **hair** growth-promoting effect, as observed morphologically and histologically.\n\n**LO** maintains the **anagen** phase and delays the transition to the **catagen** phase.\n\nSource:[ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4843973/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4843973/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe 2016 study and 2012 **Tea Tree** study make me think that **Lavender**’s effect on **hair** needs to be studied further, as currently there is contradictory information. **Please share if you find any research about Lavender’s effects on hair!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Vitamin / Supplements\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Biotin / Iron / Zinc / B12 / Amino Acids**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2017: Despite its popularity in the media and amongst consumers, **biotin** has no proven efficacy in **hair** and nail growth of healthy individuals.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5582478/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5582478/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2018: **Biotin** **deficiency** causes **hair** loss, but there are no evidence-based data that supplementing **biotin** promotes **hair** growth.\n\nIron supplementation \\[...\\] reversed the **iron** **deficiency** and induced **hair** growth.\n\nAlopecia is a well-known sign of established **zinc** **deficiency** with **hair** regrowth occurring with **zinc** supplementation.\n\nThe reduction in vitamin **B12** levels had **no adverse effects** on **hair** shedding or **hair** growth.\n\nThe possible impact of **amino acids** on **hair** growth has yet to be elucidated.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6380979/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6380979/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2016: The fact is that unless **hair** loss is due to a specific nutritional **deficiency**, there is only so much that nutritional therapies can do to enhance **hair** growth and quality. In general, **malnutrition** is due to one or more of following factors: Inadequate food intake, illness that causes increased nutrient requirements, increased nutrient loss, poor nutrient absorption, or combination of these factors.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4989391/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4989391/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe above 3 studies say that unless someone is malnourished or deficient in nutrients, adding more vitamins(biotin)/minerals wouldn't have an effect. **I have seen no evidence that extra vitamins(biotin)/minerals will do anything for hair growth**–**Please share if you find any research about extra nutrients causing** **hair growth!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Phases of Hair Growth\n\n**Anagen**→**Catagen**→**Telogen**\n\n**Anagen** phase: Growth—2 to 6 years of growing, starts when a hair follicle forms a new hair shaft. Most (90%) of the hair on a scalp is in a growing phase\n\n**Catagen** phase: Transition—1 to 2 week transition stage between anagen and telogen. Less than 1% of scalp hair is in this phase.\n\n**Telogen** phase: Rest—3- to 4-month phase, some hair falls out. When a hair falls out, a new hair is grown in the same hair follicle, and the growing cycle begins again. Accounts for 6% to 8% of hair.\n\nSource:[ https://www.uofmhealth.org/health-library/ug2799](https://www.uofmhealth.org/health-library/ug2799)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Epilogue\n\nThanks for reading!

Thank you to this community for introducing all of this to me and providing education while I started my journey. The[ r/MinoxBeards FAQ](https://www.beardwiki.com/minoxidil-faq) is a great resource, but none of the following is in the FAQ–though they are in this post:\n\n* Low-Level Laser Therapy \\[LLLT\\]\n* Tretinoin or other Vitamin A derivatives\n* Vitamin C\n* Creatine\n* Keratin\n* Hyaluronic Acid \\[HA\\]\n   * Nivea Soft is mentioned multiple times (without any reasoning to its hydration strength). I’m sure it’s good, but is Hyaluronic Acid better? Probably.\n* Peppermint Oil \\[PEO\\]\n   * Though the acronym PEO is once written–in LCLT section–but with no context or explanation what it is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI humbly implore the [mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minoxbeards/about/moderators/) to please input into the [r/MinoxBeards FAQ](https://www.beardwiki.com/minoxidil-faq):\n\n* at least those sections above that are completely missing from the FAQ,\n* at most everything that is backed up by research.\n   * My count is \\~35 unique studies in this post.\n\nI am willing to help integrate the above information with the FAQ, please just allow me.",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

I was thinking try using on face, I don't know if I will like it haha\n\nI will try corsx mask, I had on my wishlist long time. Do you apply moisturizer and this after or just this mask?",

    "body": "Hi! I tried these three online prescription services over the past two years and thought a comparison review might be helpful. \n\nMy skin: dry, extra sensitive, eczema prone \n\nConcerns I wanted to address: redness, slight texture\n\n[Packaging of all three (pumps) ](https://imgur.com/a/tZZx3vP)\n\n**Rory**\n\nCost: $5 trial, then $75 per quarter (for my specific formula) \n\nPrescriptions: first 10% azelaic acid, 2% tranexamic acid, 1% magnesium ascorbyl phosphate. Second 0.015% tretinoin, niacinamide 2.5% \n\nFormulation: this formulation also includes ceramides, which I really liked for my dry skin. It was the creamiest and thickest out of all three brands. However, it also had gritty bits in it that made it less enjoyable and more irritating to apply. \n\nResults: Slight redness reduction after 4 months of using every other night \n\nPersonal Opinion: I felt the entire experience was very generic and that my provider was not personalizing my formulas. After experiencing irritation with azaleic acid, they switched me to tretinoin, which did not make sense to me. I did not purchase or try my second formula with the tretinoin.  \n\n**Curology** \n\nCost: $5 trial, then $19 + shipping every month or $40 with free shipping every two months \n\nPrescription: 4% azelaic acid, 4% niacinamide, 0.25% zinc pyrithione \n\nFormulation: this formulation was the smoothest and felt most like a normal moisturizer to apply. Mine had no scent and layered well with the products I used underneath it. It caused no irritation. \n\nResults: Significant redness and texture improvement after 3 months of nightly use \n\nPersonal Opinion: My Curology provider was the most responsive and informative of the three. Curology is known for their low-strength formulas, so I wasn’t surprised that this was the mildest of my prescriptions. My provider has been clear that I can increase strength when I feel ready, though. For now, I appreciate that this causes no sensitivity, and I don’t feel like my skin concerns need anything stronger. Also, the zinc pyrithione in this one really helped flakiness around my eyes and mouth. I usually use a zinc pyrithione cleanser, so it was nice to be able to skip that step with this. \n\n**Apostrophe**\n\nCost: $90 without auto refill, $75 with auto refill every three months \n\nPrescription: 15% azelaic acid, 4% niacinamide \n\nFormulation: This was the thinnest of the creams. It disappeared almost immediately after spreading it on my face. It also had gritty pieces similar to Rory, but these ones were much finer. \n\nResults: Unable to tell because it was too irritating to use more than twice a week \n\nPersonal Opinion: The 15% azelaic was too strong for me to start out with. When I asked my provider if I could have something milder or a different ingredient, they replied that I should just use an over the counter azelaic acid. I did not appreciate this, because I have tried the over the counter products and do not like the consistency or the other ingredients they contain. Apostrophe was by far the least helpful and least informative of the three. \n\n**Overall favorite: Curology** \n\nCurious to hear others’ experiences!\n\nEdit: i also forgot to mention these all use the same base formula containing: \n\naloe barbadensis leaf juice, C13-14 isoparaffin, caprylic/capric triglyceride, water, laureth-7, maltodextrin, phenoxyethanol, polyacrylamide, tocopheryl acetate, triethylene glycol",

When they announced in 2021 that they were decreasing their product amount but still keeping the same cost, I changed to Curology. The Curology provider was way more informative and each response seemed more personal than Apostrophe. However, the Curology provider only prescribed me 0.035% to start off and using it every night made me peel like crazy when fall/winter hit. It might have been a combination of the formulation and weather change, but my skin didn’t peel this badly at all with Apostrophe. Curology just bumped me up to 0.05% this month. I’ll most likely stick to Curology unless peeling becomes a constant issue, which then I’ll try out Agency or go back to Apostrophe.",

    "body": "\nWhat is Vitamin C?\n\nWe know we should be eating plenty of vitamin C, but what’s the deal with vitamin C serum?\n\nFree radicals are highly reactive molecules with unpaired electrons that are known to damage various cellular structural membranes, lipids, proteins, and DNA. It is one of the widely accepted mechanisms that lead to skin ageing.\n\nThe body can be exposed to free radicals from environmental exposures (as well as intrinsic exposures), such as cigarette smoke, air pollution, and ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Consequently, the body employs antioxidants which aim to protect cells from the damaging effects of free radicals.\n\nVitamin C reacts rapidly with free radicals; it is widely understood that vitamin C’s antioxidant properties are partly responsible for its biological activity.\n\nVitamin C is the most prevalent antioxidant already present in our skin. Vitamin C is also required for collagen production and has use in the reduction of fine lines. Thus, topical application of vitamin C has been shown to have many positive effects on the skin, ranging from collagen production to protection from environmental stressors.\n\nSo, why not simply ingest enough vitamin C in our diets or take supplements for these effects? Why do we need to apply it topically to reap the rewards?\n\nAs humans, we are unable to synthesise our own vitamin C and we typically get this vitamin from our diet instead. However, factors such as absorption, metabolism, and distribution, limit the amount of vitamin C that can eventually be delivered to the skin. Additionally, when this vitamin neutralises oxidative stress in the skin, it is used up. This is where topical application can be beneficial.\n\nWhat should I look for on a product label?\n\nVitamin C in skincare can be found in both active and inactive forms. It is important we choose wisely if we want to see the beneficial effects that vitamin C has to offer. Vitamin C’s most active and well-studied form is known as ‘L-ascorbic acid’ and is present as ascorbate, a water-soluble molecule, in most biologic settings. So make sure to look for ‘L-ascorbic acid’ or ‘ascorbic acid’ on product labels (with or without the ‘L’ – they are the same compound, just the former is more descriptive).\n\nL-ascorbic acid is more desirable in skincare products over derivatives (e.g. ascorbyl-6-palmitate, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, disodium isostearyl 2-0 L-ascorbyl phosphate, ascorbic acid sulphate, tetraisopalmitoyl ascorbic acid) since it is the most effective and well-researched.\n\nFor vitamin C to be absorbed into the skin, the skincare product must be formulated at a pH of 3.5 or lower. Usually though, this isn’t something you need to worry about if you are purchasing a product from a reputable brand.\n\nVitamin C for Hyperpigmentation\n\nHyperpigmentation – a darkening of the skin that occurs due to an excess of melanin, for example, in the case of age spots, freckles, melasma, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Cosmeceuticals are commonly used to target hyperpigmentation; hydroquinone being a common example in the treatment of hyperpigmented skin conditions. However, hydroquinone has recently come under fire due to chronic adverse side effects such as discolouration of the skin, cataract, pigmented colloid milia, loss of elasticity of the skin, impaired wound healing as well as safety concerns.\n\nStudies have show that vitamin C acts as a reducing agent at various oxidative steps of melanin formation, hence inhibiting melanogenesis. Thus, vitamin C is widely used in dermatology for depigmentation of hyperpigmented spots on the skin.\n\nAnother study compared the use of 5% ascorbic acid and 4% hydroquinone in female patients with melasma and found that there was a 62.5% and 93% improvement in appearance, respectively. Side effects were present in 68.7% of people with hydroquinone use, versus 6.2% with ascorbic acid. Despite hydroquinone being the better performer, vitamin C may have a role to play in the treatment of melasma, since it is mostly devoid of any side effects.\n\nVitamin C for collagen production/anti-ageing effects\n\nWith age comes reduced fibroblast activity, leading to fine lines and wrinkles in the skin due to loss of collagen and elastin. Fibroblasts have a dependence on vitamin C for the synthesis of collagen and the regulation of the collagen/elastin balance in the dermis.\n\nThe topical application of vitamin C has been shown to elicit anti-ageing effects by increasing collagen synthesis in the skin, resulting in an increase of the structural integrity of our skin as well as slowing down the loss of structural integrity due to decreased degradation of collagen.\n\nVitamin C for Redness\n\nVitamin C is known to improve skin erythema (redness) due to its ability to strengthen blood vessel walls since collagen is a major component of these walls.\n\nFor example, studies have showed that 5% vitamin C caused a significant erythema reduction in capillary skin and photoageing skin. The research was conducted on a group of 30 women. Erythema decreased by: 9% after 2 weeks; 16% after 4 weeks and 21% after 6 weeks.\n\nAnother study showed that application of 10% topical vitamin C was able to reduce UVB-induced erythema by 52%.\n\nVitamin C for protection against environmental stressors/photoprotection\n\nVitamin C can be useful in providing protection from ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced oxidative stress. Such oxidative stress may result in acute (e.g. sunburn) and chronic photodamage (e.g. skin cancer and photoageing). Topically applied vitamin C has been shown to induce significant photoprotective effects at concentrations of at least 10% in humans. This same photoprotective effect has not been demonstrated by oral administration (even at high doses) in humans.\n\nP.S. This is not an excuse to skip sunscreen!\n\nVitamin C DOs and DON’Ts\n\nDon’t\n\nSince Ascorbic acid is a weak sugar acid it is wise to avoid the use of alpha-hydroxy and beta-hydroxy acids at the same time to avert irritation (and avoid a disruption in the pH, unless the vit. C is formulated with other acids then the pH should be fine, but in this case, stop usage if you find irritation occurring).\nAvoid the use of benzoyl peroxide since this is a powerful oxidant – or say hello to potentially deactivated vitamin C.\nFurthermore, if you use retinol (or other retinoid), to avoid irritation it is best to apply vitamin C in the morning and retinol in the evening. In addition, it’s best to avoid usage at the same time to avoid disrupting the ideal pH level used in each specific formulation (or having any unwanted interactions occur). Retinol products are typically formulated at higher pH’s.\nDo\n\nUse in combination with vitamin E. Vitamin C and E act synergistically in many biological systems – these vitamins help to protect each other and increase overall effectiveness. Ferulic acid (plant antioxidant) is another one to look out for, since it results in improved chemical stability of vitamins C and E.\nUse daily for maximum effect (or less frequently if your skin finds it particularly irritating).\nCertainly, application in the morning, on a clean face is the preferred time to apply for most people. This way one can reap its photoprotective effects to a greater extent. If, however, you are just looking to tend to some hyperpigmentation, then consistency is key, whether that’s through application in the morning or night. Although, if you are a retinol user then it’s best to apply your vitamin C in the morning and retinol at night.\nCheck that the percentage of vitamin C is between 10-20% (for the greatest effect). Remember that 10% of a vitamin C derivative may not actually supply 10% of pure vitamin C. So check the label to make sure. P.S. serums tend to typically offer higher concentrations of vitamin C (skin penetration is also typically better with serums).\nLook out for ‘L-ascorbic acid’ or ‘ascorbic acid’ on product labels since this is the most effective and well-studied form of vitamin C.\nLastly, to make sure the vitamin doesn’t degrade, look for products in airtight, opaque packaging to avoid exposure to UV rays, or the air.\nProduct recommendations and references can be found at the link below.\n\nhttps://insidemyproducts.com/vitamin-c-serum-what-does-it-do/",

Personally I don't believe in preformulated water based ascorbic acid products. Even when it's fresh the amount of studies that prove that vitamin c really works topically is quite limited. Vitamin c penetrates skin rather poorly. There simply is no standardization to prove the effectiveness of a specific formula, unlike sunscreens and retinoic acid. Shelf life is no indication of the stability of actives and doesn't say anything about it's stability on skin.

I've been debating with myself wether to put this on the good or bad list. In my opinion there are a lot of uncertainties about the stability of diy formulas, especially if you start mixing it through existing products. Even destilled water contains impurities that will react with ascorbic Acid, and many people don't use water reducing agents, or stabilizers like propyl gallate, sodium metabisulfite, chelators etc. A low pH, vitamin E, Ferulic acid help of course, but I don't think many people really understand the exact chemical reactions going on and don't have analyzers like they do in labs, so how certain can you be about your own creation. Most often DIY formulas also just recrystallize on skin. Formulating an ascorbic acid serum really is difficult, it is more than just dissolving some ingredients in water. Dissolving in TO Ferulic Acid will be difficult since maximum solubility in Propanediol is just 5%, in contrast to 33% in water. The key here is to make it fresh every 1-3 days I guess.\n  * [€5.80/20g TO Powder](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-100pct-l-ascorbic-acid-powder-20g?redir=1)\n  * [€89 /20mL Philosophy Turbo C booster](https://www.sephora.com/product/turbo-booster-c-powder-P204606)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Anhydrous formulas**: best stability, but not much research on penetration\n\n* [€9.60/50mL - The Ordinary C23](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-vitamin-c-suspension-23pct-ha-spheres-2pct-30ml?redir=1)\n  * **Pros:** Cheap, anhydrous (stable), together with TO Ferulic+Resveratrol a very affordable good combo\n  * **Cons:** No other actives,  no vitamin E, relatively unpleasant texture, stinging, for me too thick/greasy for daytime use.

They claim that the THD ascorbate is 50x more powerful than traditional vitamin c (I am skeptical and what are they referring to with “traditional vit c”).  Also has 3% vitamin E and 2% ferulic acid.

It doesn't use a dropper, I have a bottle and it's an airless pump.\n____\n\nAlso about The Ordinary, I have information about its penetration ability if you'd like:\n\n\nA quote from Brandon Truaxe:\n> In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.\n\nThat means that with TO Vit C 23%, your skin is only using about 2%, while L-AA's max absorption rate is 20%.",

    "body": "This review is for [Overt's The Brightener Serum](https://overtskincare.com/products/the-brightener)\n\nI promised to write this review last week when I covered the hydrator serum, but didn't manage to get around to it. I got insanely busy with some personal stuff. Anyway, I am back to cover Overt's Vit C Serum.\n\n**Two things really made me want to try this serum.**\n\n1. The simplicity of the ingredients (there are 6 total, but essentially just three active, 20% Vitamin C, HA, and Purified Water)\n2. It is not like most serums (L-Ascorbic) it's Vit C MAP (Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate) which from what I can read online is more stable and not sensitive to heat or light. So it shouldn't turn brown like some other products I've bought...\n\nI've been using it now consistently for a couple months so I know what I like about it, and how it improves my skin. I wanted to even out my skin tone while keeping it bright, and honestly, I really didn't like the bags under my eyes, which this has helped a lot with.  I said this in my other review, but as someone who suffers from sensitive skin, I am really careful with what I put on it. **I have finally found the Vitamin C serum that works and will be sticking exclusively to this one.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Picture of the brightener](https://preview.redd.it/5yifb44ww7b51.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3014723ed2727cd8832832008ea5a3a1507415e6)\n\n\\----\n\n*For reference my routine is as follows:*\n\n*AM:*\n\n*CeraVe Moisturizing Face Wash*\n\n*Overt Skincare - The Brightener*\n\n*CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion*\n\n*Biore Aqua Rich Sunscreen*\n\n*PM:*\n\n*CeraVe Moisturizing Face Wash*\n\n*Overt Skincare The Hydrator*\n\n*CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion*\n\n*Twice a week Paula’s Choice BHA Liquid Exfoliator*\n\n\\---\n\n**I am now on my second bottle of the Brightener.** I usually put it on in the morning, before moisturizing, to help even and protect my skin.\n\nBefore the brightener I had tried other Vit C serums (like Mad Hippie, Glossier, I bought a skinceuticals dupe etc), but they just weren’t as effective. I didn't notice as dramatic a change as with the brightener, and sometimes the textures were kinda sticky. Basically, I've tried at least 6 different Vit C formulations over the period of a couple years, and this one is finally going to stick. **I really have noticed a huge difference in my skin, and recommend it 110%.**\n\nLike I said in the other post, I like Overt because they have a cause and donate to charity. I know it's only the icing on top of the cake in terms of effective skincare, but to me it makes a difference.\n\nAnyway, these are the two reviews I've been promising. I think I will try out more of their serums in the future :)\n\nNote: I buy the brightener and the hydrator as part of their duos which lets me save a bit on the price.",

I starting layering my vitamin C serums (put one on, wait 20 minutes, put the next one on) bc I know the different types are more effective at different skin issues and I have noticed that my skin texture and PIH are generally improved after these days.\n\nBut, I am wondering if it is effective to layer the Vitamin Cs (especially in terms of PIH) or if I am just wasting product? I know that 20% is the highest effective percentage *in* a serum, but does more than one serum make a difference? Or is the difference in skin I am seeing just because I actually have time to let my actives work? Is there any evidence for or against what I am doing?",

These forms take on names such as Ascorbyl Glucoside (usually used at 2%), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (MAP, usually used between 1%-15%), Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (similar to MAP) and Ascorbyl Palmitate (usually used at less than 0.2%). There are two problems with this approach: 1) These forms still need to be converted to L-Ascorbic Acid—the pure form of Vitamin C useful to the skin—and this conversion, if it it happens perfectly, represents as little as 2% of the actual material used—and 2) the maximum amounts of these materials that can be solubilized in a formula is between 0.5% and 15% depending on the material. **These compounding problems suggest that a maximum of 0.3% of actual L-Ascorbic Acid would be available for use by the skin in a perfect formulation using these materials.**](http://niod.com/product/ethylated-l-ascorbic-acid-30pct-network-30ml)'\n\nI like the brand, but given what they've said about the ineffectiveness of other Vitamin C derivatives, why hasn't the bolded portion been mentioned on The Ordinary Guide to Vitamin C?",

I hope I've followed all the rules!\n\nHere is the deal:\n\nSo, I have been on the hunt for a daily mist that does more than just \"this makes my skin so hydrated throughout the day!\" That's nice and all, however the reality is: It **should be** hydrating as I'm literally spraying my face and saturating it with liquid. In most of the more famous \"thermal water\" mists, its literally just water and pressure.\n\n\n**a note** I'm not bashing water mists, I own one! I think they are great for what their purpose is, pure hydration. I just find it easier to put some bottles water in a fine mist spray bottle, tbh.\n\n\n**So, what are you getting at here?**\n\nI have skin that (like many of us here) isn't flawless, spotless perfection. So I have been on the hunt for a mist that does more than simply hydrate, be cause we all deserve a mist that can help us with skin problems too, right? I think that some of the issue is, when looking for a mist, we all just assume that **hydration is all we are supposed to get from a mist** & that just didn't sit right with me. I feel like we should at least get a little bit more. Whitening/brightening effects, acne control, sebum control, pore minimizer, etc. I wan't all a mist has to offer!\n\n\n**You said you were on a hunt, did you find anything? Or are you just smack talking?**\n\nThis is why I'm here. I found a few mists that I would like to share and hope to get some recommendations for more! I hope to compile some type of list, so any and all suggestions are welcome.

It's probably the most finely-misted spray I've ever come across for anything though, but the issue with that is that it's *so fine* that it requires me to spray it continuously around my face for a good 5 seconds to get a good layer on, instead of just a few spritzes. Even so, the spray can lasts a long time.\n\nNon-AB, but I also have the **Mario Badescu Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs, and Rosewater** that's already popular, which I think works really well, but I'm not a fan of rose-scented things and it's very, very fragranced.\n\nAside from those two, I've heard good things from **Avene's Thermal Spring Water**, which is what I was planning on trying next.",

Since then I’ve found some products that work really well for me and which haven’t been mentioned on this sub before, so I decided to share my shelfie and write some reviews.\n\nI'm happy to hear your opinion about the products or my routine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Skin type**\n\nDry and sensitive, some general redness, not acne-prone.\n\nMy skin reacts to most artificial fragrances and some essential oils. \n\nI also prefer to use products with “natural” ingredients and try to avoid parabens, PEGs, micro plastic and mineral oil as much as possible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Products (from left to right):**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch** \n\nINCI: AQUA, CENTAUREA CYANUS FLOWER WATER, DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS HYBRID OIL, CETEARYL WHEAT STRAW GLYCOSIDES, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM BENZOATE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, STEARIC ACID, XANTHAN GUM, TOCOPHEROL, LACTIC ACID\n\nPrice 11 € for 200ml, available at Müller drugstore in Germany\n\nThis gentle cleansing milk is one of my holy grail products. All other cleansers that I’ve tried before where either super drying and/or made me break out. This one isn’t drying at all and yet leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. Only on days when I wear a lot of makeup I need to do an additional oil cleanse. I like that the formulation is not too watery, so it’s easy to spread on my face. It doesn’t have a noticeable smell. The bottle lasts a long time for me, usually over 6 months even with daily use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme**\n\nINCI: HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL, ETHYLHEXYL STEARATE, CERA ALBA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, KAOLIN, ZINC OXIDE, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND) OIL, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice 2 € for 50ml, available at Rossmann drugstore \n\nThis water free balm with oils and beeswax is a thick and oily formulation, similar to a cold cream. I sometimes use it on cold and dry winter days as a thin layer between my daytime moisturizer and sunscreen. I’m not sure if it truly qualifies as an occlusive cream, but in my experience it does help with preventing moisture loss in dry weather. It takes a while to get absorbed into the skin. A little goes a long way and when you apply too much your face is going to shine like crazy. I noticed that when I use this cream several days in a row my skin texture starts to feel a bit smoother than usual. The beeswax smell is nice too. It works well under makeup as long as you give it enough time to dry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dermaveel  (OTC pharmacy cream, made by HEEL)**\n\nINCI: ECTOIN\\*, AQUA, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PANTHENOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, SQUALANE, TOCOPHEROL, OLEA EUROPAEA FRUIT OIL, HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, VANILLA PLANIFOLIA FRUIT EXTRACT, ALCOHOL DENAT., CARBOMER, SODIUM CARBOMER, RHIZOBIAN GUM, CORYLUS AVELLANA BARK EXTRACT, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, C12-16 ALCOHOLS, PALMITIC ACID, CERAMIDE 3\n\n\\*Since this cream is a medical product, its active ingredient (Ectoin) is listed first, even though it’s not the main ingredient.\n\nPrice about 10 € for 30ml in online pharmacies \n\nSo this is a medical product for people with neurodermatitis that was recommended to me by my dermatologist. It has a thick, slightly oily consistency but doesn’t take too long to get absorbed into skin. The smell is slightly chemical. Its active ingredient, Ectoin, is supposed to protect skin cells from environmental stress factors and help with skin barrier restoration. It is also used in other products such as eye drops and nasal sprays.\n\nNow I don’t know enough about skincare to judge how solid the research behind this patented molecule is. When my skin was a bit over exfoliated a few months ago, my experience was that Dermaveel was in fact better at repairing my damaged skin barrier than other moisturizers that I tried.\n\nI only use this cream during the winter months; it’s too heavy for warm summer days, even for my dry skin. I use it as a daytime moisturizer a few times per week; I find it a bit too pricey for everyday use. Unfortunately it does sometimes pill up under my makeup foundation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Manuka Repair Creme/Miel de Manuka Crème Réparatrice (OTC pharmacy cream, made by French brand Comptoirs & Compagnies)**\n\nINCI: MEL, AQUA, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, MACADAMIA TERNIFOLIA SEED OIL, GLYCERYL STEARATE, SQUALANE,SODIUM STEAROYL GLUTAMATE, LEVULINIC ACID, PHENETHYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, BISABOLOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM LEVULINATE, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice about 10 € for 40ml in online pharmacies\n\nThe reason why I bought this was simply that I really wanted to try a Manuka product. It contains 40% GMO 300 Manuka Honey. This isn’t exactly the highest GMO rating, but it’s the best price-performance ratio I could find. Despite its 40% honey content it has an average moisturizer consistency, not sticky, dries fast. The smell is amazing! Very sweet, smells of honey and beeswax.\n\nWith my dry skin I found it not hydrating enough as standalone moisturizer, though it might work for normal to oily skin. I apply this in the evening (few times a week) in combination with my usual moisturizer (TO NMF). On the next morning my skin is smooth and soft; feels slightly exfoliated and overall texture seems to be improved. Manuka honey, or honey in general, is said to have exfoliating properties. Manuka also has anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial effects though I can’t really comment on that since I luckily don’t have any breakouts at the moment.\n\nOnce or twice I made the mistake to use the Manuka repair cream on the same evening as my AHA exfoliator- which resulted in slightly flakey skin on the next morning. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dado Sens Sun - Sonnencreme SPF 30**\n\nINCI: AQUA \\[WATER\\], DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE (UVINUL A PLUS) , ALCOHOL, ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE (UVINUL T 150), BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE (TINOSORB S), GLYCERIN, ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE (OCTISALATE), SUCROSE PALMITATE, DISTARCH PHOSPHATE, PANTHENOL, TITANIUM DIOXIDE (NON-NANO), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CANDELILLA/JOJOBA/RICE BRAN POLYGLYCERYL-3 ESTERS, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM STEAROYL LACTYLATE, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, BENZYLIDENE DIMETHOXYDIMETHYLINDANONE, ALLANTOIN, POLYHYDROXYSTEARIC ACID, SODIUM ALGINATE, CALCIUM ALGINATE, GLYCINE SOJA OIL \\[SOYBEAN\\], ALUMINA, STEARIC ACID, ECTOIN, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, LECITHIN, TOCOPHEROL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE\n\nPrice 20 € for 125ml, available at Müller, Douglas\n\nThis is my favourite sunscreen ever! Definitely a holy grail candidate. Sunscreens have always been a bit problematic for me, for two reasons: 1: I need to use a product without acrylates, which unfortunately are an ingredient in nearly every sunscreen formulation ever.  2: I’m a bit picky about sunscreen filters; I’d rather not use problematic filters like Octocrylene, Octinoxate, Oxybenzone and Homosalate. And now I finally found something that works for me!\n\nDado Sens Sonnencreme SPF 30 has a thick, creamy consistency, perfect for my dry skin but it is probably too much for oily skin. There is no noticeable white cast, however I’m pale as ghost anyway, so results might be different for darker skin tones. It leaves a small amount of shine but I’m not too bothered by this. Smell is slightly chemical (different from usual sunscreen smell) but not very strong.\n\nThe downsides are that it has only SPF 30 and contains alcohol. I don’t find it drying though. What I like best about it is that it has great filters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETYL ALCOHOL, PROPANEDIOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ARGININE, ASPARTIC ACID, GLYCINE, ALANINE, SERINE, VALINE, ISOLEUCINE, PROLINE, THREONINE, HISTIDINE, PHENYLALANINE, GLUCOSE, MALTOSE, FRUCTOSE, TREHALOSE, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SODIUM LACTATE, UREA, ALLANTOIN, LINOLEIC ACID, OLEIC ACID, PHYTOSTERYL CANOLA GLYCERIDES, PALMITIC ACID, STEARIC ACID, LECITHIN, TRIOLEIN, TOCOPHEROL, CARBOMER, ISOCETETH-20, POLYSORBATE 60, SODIUM CHLORIDE, CITRIC ACID, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, TRIETHANOLAMINE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, PHENOXYETHANOL, CHLORPHENESIN\n\nPrice 10 € for 100ml, available at Douglas\n\nI actually don’t want to write too much about this one, there are already tons of reviews on this sub. It has fairly good INCIs, doesn’t dry or break me out and is cheap – that’s all that I want in a moisturizer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), LACTIC ACID, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PROPANEDIOL, SODIUM HYALURONATE CROSSPOLYMER, TASMANNIA LANCEOLATA FRUIT/LEAF EXTRACT, ACACIA SENEGAL GUM, XANTHAN GUM, ISOCETETH-20, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL\n\nPrice 7 € for 30ml, available at Douglas\n\nThis is the first acid exfoliator I ever bought, so I can’t really compare it to other products. After a short purging period it got rid of the tiny closed comedones I had all over my face within about 6 weeks.  I like it a lot and use it about twice per week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Timeless Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin C Serum**\n\nINCI: WATER, MAGNESIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE, ALOE BARBADENSIS, GLYCERIN, HYALURONIC ACID, MATRIXYL 3000™, BENZYLALCOHOL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID\n\nThis is usually not available in Europe. I found it at my local TK Maxx store for 10 €. Bought it because I wanted to try Vitamin C. The lightweight, watery formulation is nice. It doesn’t have any noticeable smell.\n\nI’ve been using this for 8 weeks now and don’t really see any difference. When it’s empty I’m probably going to replace it with a more potent Vitamin C product from The Ordinary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Salthouse Totes Meer Therapie - Beruhigende Maske Akut** (Picture only shows lower half of sachet)\n\nINCI: AQUA, CELLULOSE GUM, GLYCERIN, PANTHENOL, PROPANEDIOL, MARIS SAL (DEAD SEA SALT), PROPYLENE GLYCOL, MAYTENUS MACROCARPA (CHUCHUHUASI) BARK EXTRACT, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE POWDER, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) LEAF EXTRACT, CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA FLOWER EXTRACT, PHENOXYETHANOL, CITRIC ACID, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL ALCOHOL\n\nPrice 1.25€ for 2x7ml, available at DM drugstore\n\nThis is a gel mask with Dead Sea salt and other calming ingredients. It calms down irritated skin and reduces redness. Most of the time it doesn’t completely get rid of the redness, but there is a visible difference. A hydrating, oil free formulation which I think is suitable for all skin types. The smell is slightly sweet but otherwise neutral. As usual, one of those “single-use” sachets is enough for at least three applications. It’s currently not a permanent part of my routine, but I use it whenever my skin gets irritated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Schaebens Augen & Lippen Maske**\n\nINCI: AQUA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, DIISOSTEAROYL POLYGLYCERYL-3 DIMER DILINOLEATE, GLYCERIN, CERA ALBA, ZINC STEARATE, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, CITRUS LIMON PEEL OIL, GLYCINE SOJA OIL, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA WATER, PANTHENOL, RETINYL PALMITATE, TOCOPHEROL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, UBIQUINONE, ALCOHOL, BENZOIC ACID, CITRAL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE, LACTIC ACID, LIMONENE, MAGNESIUM SULFATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, SORBIC ACID\n\nPrice 0.60€ for 4x1.5ml, available at DM, Rossmann\n\nThis is the only product with essential oils that I put on my face. It works surprisingly well for my sensitive skin. Even though it is advertised as an eye-and–lip mask and the instructions say to take it off after 10 mins., I use it as an overnight leave on mask for my whole face.\n\nIn the morning my skin feels plump and well hydrated. The mask reduces very fine lines overnight. Not permanently of course, but the effect does last at least a day for me.\n\nWhen I use this mask everyday my pores start to clog up after a while, so I make sure to not use it too frequently. 2 or 3 times a week is completely fine though. It’s also super cheap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Current Routine**\n\n**AM**\n\n\\-wash face with water\n\n\\- moisturizer: either TO NMF or Dermaveel\n\n\\- on cold days:  Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme\n\n\\- sunscreen: Dado Sens  Sun Sonnencreme SPF 30\n\n**PM**\n\n\\- Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch\n\n\\- one of the following:\n\n* TO NMF\n* TO LA 5% + TO NMF\n* Timeless HAC Serum + TO NMF\n* Manuka Repair Creme + TO NMF\n* Schaebens Augen und Lippen Maske as leave on overnight mask on whole face",

May Contain: Mica, Iron Oxides, Titanium Dioxide.\n\nThen they released Complexion Protection, another liquid\n\nComplexion Protection Ingredients \n\nACTIVE INGREDIENTS: Titanium dioxide 6.2%\nINACTIVE INGREDIENTS: water, coconut alkanes, propanediol, squalane,\ntrehalose, isostearic acid, glycerin, silica, agar, caprylic/capric\ntriglyceride, globularia cordifolia callus culture extract, salicornia\nherbacea extract, melilotus officinalis extract, coco-caprylate/caprate,\nbutylene glycol, lauroyl lysine, sodium hyaluronate, succinoglycan,\npolysorbate 60, cellulose gum, polyglyceryl-4 laurate/succinate,\nsorbitan sesquiisostearate, magnesium stearate, magnesium hydroxide,\nmagnesium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, potassium\nsorbate, phenoxyethanol. may contain: titanium dioxide, iron oxides.\n\nTHEN most recently they released Bare Pro -sigh-\nWater, Cyclopentasiloxane , Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Butylene Glycol, Silica, Peg-10 Dimethicone, Bis-Butyldimethicone Polyglyceryl-3, Bambusa Arundinacea Stem Extract, Sodium Glutamate, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Sorbitan Sesquiisostearate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Methicone, Papain, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Algin, Tocopherol, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Phenoxyethanol. May Contain: Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxides.\n\nNot terrible, but I feel like this is totally the opposite of what Leslie intended for her brand.\n\nWhat prompted this entire thing, was they just released a new Blush called Gen Nude and it felt soooo different from Bare. I turn it over and look at the ingredients. I was shocked!  All of us in the store working were so surprised to see Bare release this.\n\nMy ingredient lists go from their original blush - 4 ingredients. To the Ready Blush which is still pretty good and then we go to Gen Nude!\n\nLoose Blush Ingredients \n\nBismuth Oxychloride (CI 77163), Mica (CI 77019), Carmine (CI 75470),\nIron Oxide (CI 77491)\n\nReady Blush Ingredients \n\nMica, Lauroyl Lysine, Boron Nitride, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate,\nCaprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Corallina Officinalis Extract,\nOctyldodecyl Stearoyl Stearate, Alaria Esculenta Extract, Tocopherol,\nCamellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Calcium\nKetogluconate, Silica, Carmine (Ci 75470). May Contain: Titanium Dioxide\n(Ci 77891), Iron Oxides (Ci 77491, 77492, 77499), Manganese Violet (Ci\n77742).\n\nGen Nude Blush Ingredients \n\nSynthetic Fluorphlogopite, Diisostearyl Malate, Dipentaerythrityl Hexahydroxystearate, Lauroyl Lysine, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Triethylhexanoin, Sorbitan Sesquiisostearate, Hydrogen Dimethicone, Dimethicone, Tocopherol, Barium Sulfate, Silica, Alumina, Tin Oxide, Chlorphenesin.

So I can understand why they made these changes. However, they haven’t adjusted their marketing and image for these new changes.  They have clientele who have been using Bare since the first day and who refuse to use anything else because Bare is the only thing that won’t bother their skin/is natural/is safe....etc. \n\nThis isn’t a post about Bare, but I am using them as a example as the blush really threw me for a loop. \n\nHow do you feel about brands who not only evolve (as all brands must) but also change what appear to be their core values to remain relevant?",

Even that felt like a sell-out to me...and to see how far they've come now is a whole different level of disappointment. I loved that they had a focus and \"priorities,\" and now that they've done a 180 on those I feel like they've really sold out. Personally I refuse to buy anything other than the loose powder products from them on principle (lol...maybe that belongs on the \"petty\" thread but I don't care).\n\nHonestly I can't think of another brand that had such strong guiding principles to begin with and then tossed them all to the side in pursuit of profit. I don't have a problem with brands changing their focus somewhat (like how UD used to be more alternative makeup and now they're very mainstream), but when your focus is based on \"principle\" and you abandon it completely I really lose respect for you as a brand.",

Taiwan's max is 3% I believe, but don't quote me on that either. :P",

I'm 38F, and have very sensitive skin that turns red just when I touch it. I've been travelling a lot so I have no set routine, but I've mostly just used either Avene or Aveeno moisturizer and cleanser for super dry/very sensitive skin. I've always, always used an SPF moisturizer, mostly Aveeno SPF 15 or 30. I've tried countless other moisturizers for aging skin and cleaners, but they all burned and left my face red.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow that it's time for me to finally pay attention to my skin and early signs of aging, I wrote to them with a description and a photo (worst selfie ever), and asked for their recommendations. I haven't yet bought anything (I just got their email 5 minutes ago), but thought I'd share. I will be purchasing all the items they recommend, starting with The Buffet, and will eventually give you my feedback! Here's their recommendation:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"*A regimen with the recommended products would look something like this (see below), we have listed them in order of application:* \n\n# AM\n\n1. [*The Ordinary “Buffet”*](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-buffet-30ml) *A multi-technology peptide serum that targets various visible signs of ageing at once.*  \n*\\*It is best to not use Peptides in the same routine as the following products: Direct acids, LAA (L-Ascorbic Acid) and ELAA (Ethylated Ascorbic Acid).*\n2. [*The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5*](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-hyaluronic-acid-2pct-b5-30ml) *A multi-depth hydration support serum that contains 3 hyaluronic acid complexes at multiple molecular weights and Vitamin B5.*\n3. [*The Ordinary Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate 10%*](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-magnesium-ascorbyl-phosphate-10pct-30ml) *A brightening and hydrating cream formula with stabilized Vitamin C derivative to visibly target uneven tone, dullness and signs of ageing.* \n4. *The Ordinary Mineral UV Filters SPF* [*15*](https://theordinary.com/product/rdn-mineral-uv-filters-spf-15-with-antioxidants-50ml?redir=1) *or* [*30*](https://theordinary.com/product/rdn-mineral-uv-filters-spf-30-with-antioxidants-50ml?redir=1) *with Antioxidants*  \n\n\n# PM\n\n1. [*The Ordinary \"Buffet\"*](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-buffet-30ml)\n2. [*The Ordinary 100% Organic Cold Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil*](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-100pct-organic-cold-pressed-rose-hip-seed-oil-30ml) *A daily support oil for healthy, hydrated skin; Rose Hip Seed Oil is rich in linoleic (omega 6) and linolenic (omega 3) acids as well as pro-vitamin A, which enables it to target signs of photo-aging, inflammation, signs of dehydration, scarring and pigmentation.*\n\n*We recommend avoiding unprotected solar exposure, gradually incorporating one new product into your regimen at a time and applying test patches first to see what works best for your skin. \"*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll keep you posted on how it goes!\n\n&#x200B;",

But I'm really curious why you've chosen for this Vitamin C product and what your opinion is on the other vitamin C products.\n\nPersonally I've chosen for the **20% Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate**, because it's one of the most stable Vitamin C derivatives, it's oil soluble (so penetrates best), it doesn't sting or irritate your skin, and it's compatible with all the other products (suspension is incompatible with Niacinamide according Deciem). But so far I'm a bit unsure if the serum I have chosen could cause breakouts, because it's an oil and contains coconut alkanes. Of course the advantage of the 23% vitamin c suspension is the price and the potency.\n\nThe list of Vitamin C products from Deciem:\n\n- Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2%\n\n- Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12%\n\n- Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate 20% in Vitamin F\n\n- NIOD Ethylated Ascorbic Acid 30%\n\n- Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate 10%\n\n- Hylamide Booster C25\n\n",

Please check the comments for any updates. If you have something to add, feel free to leave a comment below.\n\nAll productsof these are available at meamo use the code Tori15 to save\nhttps://meamoshop.com/fat-dissolvers/\n\n\nFat dissolvers are non-surgical\ntreatments designed to target stubborn\npockets of localized fat. This body\ncontouring method works by breaking\ndown fat cells, which the body naturally\neliminates over time. It's ideal for\nindividuals looking to sculpt areas that\ndon't respond well to diet and exercise.\n\nInjection:\n\nSpacing: Injection sites should be spaced 1 cm (12 inch) apart for even distribution Depth:Inject into the subcutaneous fat layer typically 6-12 mm deep, depending on the treatment area and individual anatomy. Avoid going too deep, as this could result in injecting into muscle or vessels. Inject at a slight angle if necessary to stay within the fat layer. You can pinch the area/square you are going to inject if needed. Needle Choice: These solutions are thin and watery. A commonly used, 30G 13mm though a smaller guage may be preferred by some users. Please disinfect before doing the treatment. \n\nTechnique Tips: Shake the vial well before use. To remove air: hold the syringe upright, tap gently to move air\nbubbles to the top, then expel them. Mark injection points using tools\nlike a polka dot stencil or tattoo\ntransfer sheets (searchable\nonline). Do not inject directly into the dots inject just beside.\n\nTip: Type into Google: polka dot stencil and buy tattoo transfer sheets\n\nStorage and Handling\n\nStore vials at room temperature\nunless otherwise specified by the\nmanufacturer. Some brands allow leftover product to be refrigerated for a short period (check the label for guidance) It's generally recommended to use the full vial once opened. I use the full bottle and do not save anything for later.\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nSide Effects: Pain, bruising, and\nswelling may occur and can increase\nwith the volume injected. Please note in some of these products description it is recommend to dilute with lidocaine and triamcinolone, to reduce pain and swelling.\n\nBe patient and allow your body time\nto metabolize and eliminate the\nbroken-down fat.\n\nPlease follow the aftercare instructions provided in the links below; however, be sure to read the product instructions for specific usage guidelines and details.\n\nI have included the brochure link with most products. Please read the instructions on each one. These are the fat dissolvers available at meamo shop please use code Tori15 to save.

        "body": "having had kybella done in office and diy-ing kabelline, they are not very similar. kybella is _much_ stronger — i believe it is 20% deoxycholic acid, whereas i think kabelline is 5%. imo, for submental treatment, this makes kabelline a better product. i would rather go low, slow and more sessions than deal with extreme pain and swelling. kabelline is nearly painless (1-2 out of 10 on the pain scale), while kybella is the only cosmetic procedure i’ve had at the medspa that nearly made me pass out from pain. and i consider myself to have a very high pain tolerance. it’s honestly wild to me that i wasn’t numbed for it. kybella also causes extreme swelling, for **weeks**, and kabelline caused almost zero noticeable swelling. \n\nfor those looking for something most like kybella, aqualyx is supposedly the closest analog to kybella thats available for purchase from some of the European vendors; i believe it is manufactured by an italian company. personally i have no desire to use something as strong as kybella while diying and not having to worry as much about “bang for your buck” since i can do multiple rounds at home.\n\ndr. lipo has been very effective for me and is a great happy medium between the two. it definitely burns for about ~30 mins after injection, with the burning building starting 5 minutes after injection and peaking around 15 mins after, then tapering down gradually over the next hour or so. you can add lido if you prefer, but i don’t find it necessary.\n\n**a question for those experienced:** after a few rounds of dissolving submentally, i want to focus on tightening with a more ppc-forward product. i have lipo lab on hand, but its not the v-line version that is intended for face and neck. is there any major concern with using a light dosage of regular lipo lab under the chin, versus buying v-line? i wouldnt be going anywhere near my face or jawline, my jawline is already nice and tight. i just have a lot of lipo lab on hand already and would prefer to use what i have instead of buying v-line — i think i only need a few rounds, and while i could use v-line elsewhere on my body if i don’t need the whole box for submental treatment, i know its just a less strong product and would rather save the cash! anyone tried it?",

I mean, **REALLY dry.** Already had dry skin but with tret every other day, it's crazy, crazy dry. I can't do regular tret either, gotta be microsphere. \n\n*Climate:* Dry, desert Cali. Not too cool but not disgustingly hot as of yet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, let me eat my words. I figured out that my skin does best with many different hydrating AND nourishing/fatty layers.

Dimethyl isosorbide also feels similar to glycols, but much lighter and not sticky like them. Absorbs quickly. Non-sticky. Layers well with others. \n\n**COLOR:** Pale yellow-tinted transparent gel.\n\n**SCENT:** None.\n\n**RESULTS:** Light texture/pore refinement. Noticeable, but not hugely so. \n\nI am ***extremely*** prone to dark spots. I only get breakouts on my chin. The PIE/PIH that gets left over from acne are only on my chin. The other spots are from sun damage. Aaaand, as you can see from the before and after pictures, my dark spots have actually gotten slightly worse, and more numerous. It's easier to tell irl than in pictures. \n\n[Before/After pics](https://imgur.com/a/SAWwCqK)\n\nI feel like I haven't given it enough time to see real results since I used it for less than 3 months. 3 months is the standard time you should give skin-brightening products time to work. But from the results I can glean from this limited time, I am not super impressed. \n\nHowever, I'm willing to give it another try if it comes out for $35 instead of $45, because I *mostly blame the switch to a new sunscreen* on my spots darkening/getting more dark spots. \n\nI know many people love the Purito centella sunscreen, but it just is not protective enough for my skin type. I am super diligent about sun protection, and the 99% of the sun I get is from commuting in the car once or twice a week (\\~20 min) and sitting in front of windows for meals. I have blackout curtains in my room and only exercise during the night. \n\nSorry for the rant, but I'm honestly kind of upset that the progress on my dark spots that I worked so hard on for years have been reversed a little. \n\nAnyways, the ingredient list is absolutely fantastic. It's definitely a much better deal than Skinceuticals' 3% tranexamic + 5% niacinamide serum. So perhaps if I use a better sunscreen and give it longer, LEVEL may work better for me. \n\n**PRICE:** *$35-45 /30ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** Maybe. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# VITAMIN X Serum\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Propanediol, Ascorbic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Propylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Acetyl Zingerone, Glycerin, Hexanediol, Tocopherol, Epigallocatechin Gallate, Ferulic Acid, Resveratrol, Genistein, Glutathione, Quercetin, Silymarin, Hesperidin Methyl Chalcone, Dimethylmethoxy Chromanol, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol, Citric Acid.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** Also has a \"glycol feel\". Lightweight, absorbs quickly. Feels like I should use it after watery toners, but since it's vitamin C, I used it before anything else. \n\n**COLOR:** Orange tinted transparent gel. It did not change color the entire time I have had it, but I can't be sure of course, because of the original color. I imagine I will only be able to tell once it oxidizes heavily and turns brownish. \n\n**SCENT:** None.\n\n**RESULTS:** Light texture refinement. Like the LEVEL serum, I started out only using it once a day. Then I switched to using it twice a day after about almost a month in or so. \n\nGave my skin a subtle, soft glow. \n\nCompared to the Timeless Vitamin C serum, I just didn't see nearly as much texture/pore refinement and glow factor. I have the type of skin that sees zero results from ascorbic acid derivatives (SAP, MAP, etc).\n\nA bit disappointing on the visual results department, but perhaps other people may like it for all the other antioxidants loaded in this serum that may be protecting the skin without visual refinement. \n\nI was still happily using it up, BUT, I had to stop several days ago. I noticed that it was suddenly filled with tons of little grains??? \n\nI'm not sure if you can [**see it in the pictures**](https://imgur.com/a/PkTvttF), but it almost seems like the vitamin C in the serum spontaneously changed back to powder form.\n\nWhat the hell happened? Stability issue? I am not sure. \n\nAmbitious little serum, but it didn't work out for me in practice.\n\nI'm testing out Maelove Glow Maker at the moment, and so far Timeless is winning out but since it's only been a very short time, we'll see. Am planning to try a Skinceuticals sample next. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$50-60 / 30ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** No. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# WAVE Serum\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Betaine, Glycerin, Urea, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Saccharide Isomerate, Sodium PCA, Sodium Lactate, Sorbitol, Lactic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Pectin, Proline, Serine, Arginine, Glucose, Fructose, Maltose, Trehalose, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Chloride, Allantoin, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** A thin gel. Thicker and heavier-feeling than LEVEL & VITAMIN X. Absorbs a little slower. Still lightweight.  \n\n**COLOR:** A slightly cloudy, transparent.\n\n**SCENT:** None.\n\n**RESULTS:** It has a ton of beneficial ingredients, and was pretty hydrating. But for some reason, I found myself reaching for this less than my other, more watery hydrating essences/toners. \n\nIt may just be my personal preference, but I've been more into thinner, watery layers more than thicker ones as of late. \n\nFelt similar to Hada Labo Premium lotion but a little less hydrating? I still quite enjoyed using it. \n\nThis would be plenty of hydration for most people probably, but I have exceptionally dry skin, and this by itself was not enough to really plump out my skin. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$40-50 / 30ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** Maybe, if it was cheaper. Urea in serum form is a really rare find. But I can probably get a similar effect with a couple of different serums and a urea moisturizer combined for cheaper. If my skin wasn't so darn dehydrated and dry, this would be a fantastic all-in-one sort of convenient step for me since it really has every humectant your skin can use/has naturally. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TABULA RASA Cleanser\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Betaine, Propanediol, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate (and) Aqua (and) PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Acrylates Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium EDTA, Phenylpropanol, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic acid, Citric Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexylglycerin.* \n\n**TEXTURE:** A fluid gel. It doesn't foam up a whoooole lot, but the ideal amount foams up to a thick, luxurious feeling foam if you keep rubbing. It has more \"slip\" than Sunday Riley's Ceramic Slip cleanser if you've used that before. (If you use too little, it fails to foam.)\n\nIt feels really similar to my drugstore HG cleanser, Garnier SkinActive Gentle Sulfate-Free Cleanser initially. But that one doesn't create nice, thick feeling foam. That one cleans well but foams out to very small, non-substantial foam. \n\n**COLOR:** A opaque, white gel. \n\n**SCENT:** A strong, glue-like smell? No masking fragrance. \n\n**RESULTS:** I'm not always a gel-cleanser type of gal, but I actually really enjoy using this cleanser. It really *does* feel MOIST after washing, like my initial assessment. I personally have not used a cleanser with that sort of after-feel before. As a dry-skinned person, I *really* like that!\n\nIt didn't end up drying me out. I found it a really nice, hydrating second cleanser. The only issue was the strong smell, but I have a sensitive nose. I prefer it to smell a little weird than it be loaded with fragrance, personally. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$17-20 /100ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** Yes, I really like this cleanser and would not mind having it on my sink if it came in pretty packaging! I can find other cleansers that can do the job just fine, but if it was pretty and maybe came in a bigger size, I can definitely see myself repurchasing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# C.R.E.A.M.\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Squalane, Capric/Caprylic Triglycerides, Propanediol, Glycerin, Glyceryl Glucoside, Isosorbide Dicaprylate, Phospholipids, Ursolic Acid, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Ceramide NP, Ceramide EOP, Bisabolol, Isoamyl Laurate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Cholesterol, Stearic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Tocopherol, Dimethoxymethyl Chromanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** Picture of texture [here](https://imgur.com/EhE4aHM). A *very* thick, nourishing cream. A little hard to spread. Layered well with other things, cosmetically elegant.\n\n**COLOR:** White, opaque. \n\n**SCENT:** None. \n\n**RESULTS:** I have this MIGHTY NEED to try out as many ceramide/pseudo-ceramide/barrier repair creams as I can get my hands on. So I was REALLY excited to try this cream out. \n\nThis cream was really moisturizing and felt protective on the skin. However, I had to use quite a lot to moisturize my skin. So I ran out of it pretty fast. \n\nIt felt really good, but it failed to keep my skin completely flake-free under sunscreen & makeup and throughout the night by itself. \n\nBut **please** keep in mind that I have *incredibly* dry skin; My skin is an asshole and it's not enough to merely slug life with Vaseline/Aquaphor/CeraVe Healing ointment. It needs lots of humectants and lots of FATS & occlusives to keep it from feeling tight. (I have eczema-prone body skin as well and go through moisturizers by the bucketloads..)\n\nNone of these creams *by themselves* can prevent me from waking up to skin tighter-feeling than I'd like despite *slathering* them on: CeraVe cream & First Aid Beauty UR creams - *way* too light & matte, Atopalm MLE, Zeroid Intensive, Zeroid Oint-Cream (almost!), Real Barrier Extreme, Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Cream, La Roche Posay Lipikar AP+ Baume, Udderly Smooth, etc. \n\nI have to layer multiple of these on in order to wake up to moisturized skin. The only ones applied by themselves that give me the same results as layering multiple on are Aveeno eczema therapy cream & Ceradan barrier repair cream so far.\n\n(I have a big review post coming up sometime in the future on all these but it's gonna take a while.\\^)\n\nI've seen other reviews saying how much this C.R.E.A.M. has helped their dry skin, so I think it should work well for most folks. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$45-55 / 50ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** No, unless somehow they come out with an actual bucket-sized option for cheap lmao. \n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\nHope that helps! I had a lot of fun trying this kit. The company's customer service was incredibly helpful and nice. I hope they can tweak and improve on some things and their actual release goes well!",

Haha. I tried a bunch of the zeroid products (oint cream, soothing cream, and 5% urea cream) and the oint-cream is my favorite for night time, urea for day, and the soothing cream is alright but has a stickier consistency that I don’t like as much. Would repurchase the other 2 probably but none of them made me go WOW. \n\nMeanwhile I’m still hoarding the tiny sample of the skinceuticals cream I got and it’s been my go-to whenever I get a random dry patch. So I might just have to pull the trigger on that...\n\nThank you for the great review!",

I'll be posting my weekly roundups with new releases and interesting products that I've come across here instead of on the Asian Beauty Reader’s Digest Monday thread on ABD(sadly it's no longer possible to keep doing it there right now and it was suggested to me that I post it here). I plan to keep posting each week on monday like I did on ABD.\n\n\nThis is my first thread and I'm a bit nervous since I'm not sure if my usual formatting works so if anyone finds things hard to read or understand please let me know.\n\n\n**New Stuff:**\n\n\n**Apieu**: has some new tools and some pet care: [My Pet AIO Shampoo](http://apieu.beautynet.co.kr/goods.detail.do?goodsNumber=79156),

    "body": "Hi! I often see questions about pigmentation, spots, and I know that vitamin c is good for pigmentation, and other skin problems. I found and structured information about the form of Vitamin C and its effective concentrations.\n\nMy post about:\n\nWhat is the concentration of vitamin C good for anti-aging/ pigmentation/acne? What concentration of vitamin C should apply for the first time? How to choose the form and concentration of Vitamin C\n\nMaybe it is helpful to you.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n# Which Vitamin C is best for the skin?\n\nThe main forms of vitamin C and their markings in cosmetics.\n\nPopular stable forms of Vitamin C: \n\n* Ascorbyl palmitate, AA-PAL, ascorbic acid-6-palmitate (AA6P)\n* Tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, ascorbyl tetraisopalmitate, VC-I\n* Magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, MAP\n* Sodium ascorbyl phosphate, SAP\n* Ascorbyl glucoside, AA-2G\n* Ester-C, calcium ascorbate\n* Sodium ascorbyl palmitate\n* 3-O-ethyl ascorbate, EAC).\n\nAn unstable form of Vitamin C – Ascorbic acid, L-ascorbic acid, LAA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7dolbbpc59781.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=18dfb30391b03af79d38fceaf5d3f02804a7d756\n\n# How to determine the Vitamin C concentration\n\nIf the Vitamin C concentration is not indicated on the package of the care product, the location of the Vitamin can determine the approximate content of the ingredient. The ingredients in the compounds are indicated in descending order. So, if Vitamin C is at the beginning of the list, the concentration is high. The closer to the end of the list,  the lower the concentration. Ingredients with content of 1% or less can be listed in any order. Of course, the exact amount of Vitamin C cannot be determined in this way, but it will help determine the expectations of the care product.\n\nFor example, you choose a face cream, and  Vitamin C is indicated in the compound, as Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate. As you can see from the compound, Vitamin C is not in the first position,  so you should not expect strong lighting of pigmentation from the cream  (Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate lightens pigment spots at 10%). The cream will work as an anti-age by increasing collagen synthesis and improving skin tone.\n\nFor example, Serum with 10% Vitamin C contrast in the form of Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate  (in the compound in second place) will work as an anti-aging agent, help reduce pigmentation, and protect the skin from the aggressive effects of UV radiation.\n\n## How to choose the form and concentration of Vitamin C\n\nIf you are starting to know Vitamin C or your skin is sensitive, I recommend paying attention to stable forms or a low concentration of unstable forms.\n\nIf your skin is dense or already ready for more active action, you can switch to the option with a concentration of 15%.\n\nA slight stinging after applying Vitamin C is quite normal, but if the skin is hypersensitive or prone to rosacea, a highly concentrated vitamin C serum (above 10%) will not suit you.\n\nIf you have previously used Vitamin C serums and skin irritation has occurred (severe burning or redness), I recommend switching to a milder form of Vitamin C or reducing the concentration of the product.\n\nRegular use of vitamin C in small percentages is much better for the skin than a single-use in high concentration.",

        "body": "Start with the wiki always! But here’s my individual take:\n\nI think about it a lot like retinols and their derivatives. Ascorbic Acid is the gold standard period. Most studied,reliable results, etc. Most formulations aren’t at the correct pH or effective %. I doubt people who mix using AA powders are consistently formulating something truly effective. Like retinol, in its effective range, it’s gonna be tricky and potentially irritating to work with. I don’t really have hyperpigmentation or effects of photoaging (humble brag) so I’m not at a place personally where I’m gonna put my reactive skin in the line of fire like that. \n\nNow derivatives have little to no clinically backed results. That’s true of most at home skincare. There’s no incentive for studies of these kinds unless it’s coming from skincare companies themselves who are obviously biased. Dermatologists study things in **clinical** trials to use in their **clinics**.  Aside from ceramides, niacinamide, retinol, sunscreen and AA, which all have to be formulated and used correctly (which most products probably aren’t), everything else is more or less a scientific unknown. A lot of AB superstar ingredients fall into this category but people will swear up and down it’s the snail mucin/green tea/centella etc that changed their whole life. For this reason I don’t mind derivatives. They tend to be more stable, less irritating, and not pH dependent. Are you gonna see results as good or better than AA? Probably not. But it will work better than AA that’s oxidized, at the wrong pH or concentration, in the wrong place in your routine/not preceded by a pH adjusting toner, etc. I would say for newbies, people with sensitive skin, or who aren’t dedicated to researching AA to just stick to derivatives.",

Upon application they are completely inactive. We don't know much about how efficient this conversion process is or even if it happens for everyone, since our individual skin environment is so different.\n\nMore reading on Vitamin C derivatives here: \n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/7vh3if/research_kindofstephen_just_posted_about_a_study/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Be00ARIlbpZ/?igshid=6rl55r95fc5j \nhttps://thebeautybrains.com/2014/05/which-kind-of-vitamin-c-is-best-for-skin-the-beauty-brains-show-episode-31/\n\nThe overwhelming majority of research on Vitamin C derivatives is in vitro research.\n\nI choose to use Ascorbic Acid because why wouldn't I use the ingredient directly that everything else purports to convert into? I'm skipping a step, in essence. It's more active, more bioavailable and more effective  than any derivative.\n\nBut, not everyone can tolerate Ascorbic Acid.\n\nIf you (understandably) can't tolerate Ascorbic Acid, my recommendation is to use a different, evidence based antioxidant, not a Vitamin C derivative. I'm talking about Niacinamide, Vitamin E, EGCG, Coenzyme Q10, Resveratrol, etc.",

        "body": "**Brand:** [Timeless Skincare](https://www.timelessha.com/)    \n\n**Product Name:** [20% VITAMIN C+E+FERULIC SERUM](https://www.timelessha.com/collections/all/products/20-vitamin-c-e-ferulic-acid-serum-1-oz)    \n                 AKA [CEF Serum](https://ibb.co/HTpvL46)\n\n**Ingredient List:** [Water, Ethoxydiglycol, _20% L-Ascorbic Acid,_ Propylene Glycol, _1% A-Tocopherol,_ Polysorbate 80, _Panthenol, 1% Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate,_ Benzyl alcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid](https://www.timelessha.com/products/20-vitamin-c-e-ferulic-acid-serum-1-oz?variant=31714127773807#ingredients)\n\n**Vitamin C Type:** L-Ascorbic Acid   \n\n**Vitamin C Percentage:** Twenty Percent    \n\n**Price Range:** $17.95 half oz | $26.95 full oz    \n\n**Country of Purchase:** United States   \n\n**Skin Information:** Combination of mildly-moderately oily & normal^ish when not using tretinoin gel. With my full skincare routine my skin remains rather normal, but if I overuse my exfoliants or retinoids then the lower third of my face can get dry/flakey. I’m moderately acne-prone and extremely discoloration-prone. I don’t consider my skin to be sensitive but it does react negatively to certain ingredients.   \n\n**Experience & Opinion:**   \nBest OTC product I’ve used for brightening my skin and keeping it looking healthy & radiant and I’m ecstatic it doesn’t exacerbate my acne! Despite its excellent brightening abilities it doesn’t fully remove my brown post-acne discoloration on its own _(it fades them but it needs help from other ingredients to remove them)._ I don’t fault the brand because no vitamin c product I’ve tried fully lightens my acne PIH spots; they’re incredibly stubborn. I’m pretty sure it prevents them from getting worse because when I’m not using this serum my post-acne marks can sometimes darken further when I’m not using a depigmentation product. This benefit is probably due to the L-AA enhancing my skin’s photoprotection. \n\nWarning, this has the highest viable percentage of active vitamin c; accordingly it can be quite irritating when you first start using it but its entirely tolerable once your skin is acclimated if you’re not overly sensitive to the ingredients. If you use other sensitizing products like I do make sure to wait a few minutes in between applying. Storing it in the fridge so it’s cool also seems to improve tolerability but YMMV. Refrigeration also can increase stability so I also recommend it for that reason; especially if you’re after the collagen-synthesis & free radical neutralizing effects of vitamin c.   \n___{Edit:___ *Timeless Skincare now offers a 10% version of this serum that would be more suitable for novices.*}\n\n**Special Information:**   \n• It’s worth noting that L-ascorbic acid is the active form of vitamin c, it doesn’t need to be converted to work. Similarly, when compared to other forms of vitamin e, alpha-tocopherol is preferentially absorbed and accumulated in humans. So, this formulation is a really good option if you’re wanting the best bang for your buck.\n\n• It’s noted on Timeless Skincare’s [FAQ page](https://www.timelessha.com/pages/frequently-asked-questions) that this serum may not be suitable for individuals w/ _”very oily or very fair skin types.”_\n\n• The FAQ page also notes _”We refrain from testing on animals and avoid the use of animal byproducts whenever possible.”_\n\n• I’ve been buying this product on & off for years and I’m fully satisfied with the quality of the service and product. When I order it a fresh bottle always arrives to home rather quickly. Every time I’ve pH tested it in the past I was satisfied with the result. It’s not always exactly the same but it’s always in the 2s or low 3s. It has never seemed to oxidize/degrade before I finished using it _(I usually use it both day & night but if you only use it once a day I think you’ll be fine since this is one of the few L-AA serums that comes in an airless pump bottle)_",

I think it's one of TO's most cosmetically elegant serums: doesn't pill, isn't tacky, etc. The consistency is like a dry oil, although it contains no oil. You only need 2-3 drops, which I spread between my hands and press it into my skin. If you use to much or drop it straight onto your skin, you might end up with absorbency issues and greasiness. I've been using it for two years now and it's helped fade my hyperpigmentation and give my skin a nice glow. A bottle lasts me around a year and I haven't had any oxidization issues.",

My boss bought the one from “Then I Met You” and gave me a sample. I loved how not stripped my skin felt and how it didn’t irritate my eyes, but she and I both agreed $38 is still a bit steep, though warranted if you have that kind of cash. Considering the size, amount you need (it’s not super spreadable without using a generous amount) and the fact that because of sunscreen you kinda have to use it every day, I really would have loved to see more options. Banilla isn’t exactly cheap, but it kind of works for much less.",

    "body": "Hi everyone! I've recently started looking more and more into AB, and I came across [this](http://www.snowwhiteandtheasianpear.com/2015/07/beginners-korean-skincare-routine.html) article recently (Beginner's Korean Skincare Routine, on snowwhiteandtheasianpear). Basically, it talks about how dehydrated and oily/combo skin may have a thick layer of oil and dead skin cells blocking the absorption of hydrating products. Here are some excerpts:\n\n> ...but if you've been struggling with both Dehydrated and Oily or Combo-Oily skin, there's very likely to be a disgusting shell of dead skin and + oily sebum that is coating your face.  You've probably noticed that your skin is prone to dead skin build up, including dry flakes, alongside greasy and clog-prone skin.  Thus, I have dubbed this slurry of goo 'The Shell' and we're going to talk about how to get rid of it. ...\n\n> ... Your skincare isn't penetrating down to where it needs to, because The Shell, like a layer of plaque over your teeth, is obstructing it.  We need to get rid of The Shell, and physical scrubs, as you have probably noticed, aren't cutting it. Enter chemical exfoliants...\n\n> ... Now that the layers of old buildup are out of the way, you are free to focus on re-balancing the missing water from your skin.  This is the real drawback of The Shell; the precious water that your skin lacks was unable to penetrate through the greasy sludge that coated your face.\n\nI'm having trouble reconciling this with what people normally say to do for repairing the moisture barrier, to avoid ALL actives. I know fixing the moisture barrier is highly variable, so this probably isn't true for everyone... or maybe some of you had to stop all actives, AND also find that one magical HG that finally got your skin to a good place. Thing is, prior to discovering SCA, I never used actives anyways-- it was just water/cream cleanser, hydrating serum, and moisturizer for years, and I just dealt with feeling dehydrated (and estheticians have confirmed my skin is inflammed and dehydrated). Then I started adding a few more non-actives based on what I've learned here, and got a slight improvement after about a month. And theeenn I started slowly experimenting with AHA's-- saw another slight improvement with TO's 10% lactic acid. I just started incorporating a BHA (TO's salicylic acid 2%) a few days ago, once every other day. I hope I'm on the right track-- for the first time EVER, I am experiencing what it feels to have my skin \"drink something up\". I have not experienced anything that I recognize as over-exfoliation (weirdly non-oil shiny, paper thin).\n\nAnyway, I'm curious what everyone's thoughts are on these different approaches, if you've had personal experiences with AHA/BHA on dehydrated skin that you're willing to share, if you feel strongly one way or another, if you think I'm misinterpreting anything, etc. And for those of you who have fixed your dehydrated skin this way, could you say a little bit on your routine, including specific products, frequency, and timing?\n\nThank you!!\n\n\nOh, my routine if anyone is interested. My skin is dehydrated/combo, some redness (AzA is helping a lot!!), no acne or flakes. Texture issues resolved with lactic acid. I apply thinnest-to-thickest:\n\n* CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser\n* every other PM: Thayer's with cotton round, TO salicylic acid 2%, TO lactic acid 10% (wait, but don't let my skin dry out), then Hylamide Hydra-Density Mist  (starting to experiment with TO's Glycolic Acid Toning Solution instead of Thayer's but so far, I don't think I like)\n* TO Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 **or** Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium, sometimes both if I'm not in a hurry\n* TO Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%\n* Kiehl's Hydro-Plumping Re-Texturizing Serum\n* 1-2X a week: TO Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate 10% with three drops of Resveratrol 3% + Ferulic Acid 3% or Alpha Lipoic Acid 5% (I haven't noticed an improvement with either the resveratrol/FA or ALA, so I'm just using these up)\n* TO Azelaic Acid Suspension 10%  (my first empty!!)\n* AM finish: CeraVe Moisturizing Cream in the tub, CeraVe sunscreen\n* PM the day after BHA/AHA: Kiehl's Ultra Facial Overnight Hydrating Masque (has urea!)\n* PM finish: CeraVe Healing Ointment mixed with CeraVe Moisturizing Cream\n\n**Some products I've removed:** TO's squalane and NMF+HA after testing it for several weeks before realizing that CeraVe Moisturizing Cream felt more hydrating, less greasy, and dried more matte. I tried Stratia Liquid Gold for several days and did not notice any extra benefit-- maybe I should give it more time? Same with Cosrx Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence (during another period of several days, not while testing LG).\n\n**Some products I currently have, but not yet tested:** TO's AHA/BHA peeling solution, TO Vitamin C + HA Spheres, Cosrx Advanced Snail 92 AIO Cream, Dr Jart Ceramidin Cream, Dr Jart Cicapair Cream",

        "body": "I think this is a very interesting question.\n\nI have been dealing with dehydrated skin for some time, and I feel there is a strong case to be made that using a gentle exfoliating product does help hydration. My logic (and I may be wrong) is that it gets rid of a layer of keratin, and presents newer skin cells which hold on to water better.\n\nHowever, 2% salycilic acid is way to drying to do this job for me. As is 10% mandelic, and any gylcolic acid (TO 30% aha is way to strong). I've been experimenting with 5% lactic acid, but even this I believe is too drying/disrupts moisture barrier to much. I'm starting to think, that maybe the traditional chemical exfoliators are too strong, and that something more gentle is required. Some options which I think exfoliate but have less impact on the moisture barrier/TEWL (water loss function) i'm experimenting with now are:\n\n1) Melano CC (a vitamin C product), definitely provides some exfoliation, and leaves my skin feeling fresh and soft. Doesn't seem to increase TEWL\n\n2) Malezepam (20% azaelic acid): of all the AA i've tried, this is the least irritating as it's in an emolient base. This again provides more gentle exfoliation, but just strays over to being too irritating. So this week I am buffering it 50/50 with moisturiser. Will see how this goes.\nF.C. on Simpleskincarescience cites evidence that AA doesn't increase TEWL. However, it can be irritating.\n\n3) Tretinoin 0.025%: Often people cite tret as something to avoid with dehyrdated skin. But i'm interested by it's mechanism. It works differently to exfoliators: Retinoic acid binds to receptors in skin cells and gets them to start behaving differently, increasing the speed of the skin cycle and presenting fresher, newer skin cells at the surface. Again, my experiment is to see if this will help hydrating. Of course, tret is very irritating, but I don't think it causes big TEWL like BHA/glyclic does. Also, tret is far easier i find to redcue irritation than acids. Just buffer it, takes days off etc. It's more predictable than acids. Often the day after a 2% bha, my skin is nice and soft, but by the next day it is very deyhdrated again.\n\nJust my 2cents in here, please feel free to correct any of my reasoning.",

        "body": "So I learned courtesy of a very kind esthetician at Sephora that my skin was/is dehydration-prone and all the flaking and dryness I was trying to moisturize away was dehydration. However, she also suggested that my skin at that time had the flakiness that was preventing penetration of products and that I should incorporate an exfoliant. In all honesty I didn't think it'd work, but by God it did. My skin could suddenly \"absorb\" stuff. I have also found that when I haven't exfoliated in a while that my skin just doesn't want to take in anything and I'm left with a weird sticky feeling of my products all built up.\n\nMy current arsenal of acid is \n\n-\t15% azelaic acid (Finacea; aka God, Baby Jesus, Allah, and Buddah in a gel) applied morning and night\n-\t10% mandelic acid (Stratia Soft Touch AHA) applied every week or two weeks as an intensive masque\n-\t0.5% salicylic acid (La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo+) applied on active breakouts or on particular congested areas morning and night for up to a week\n-\t(not technically an acid but) 0.1% adapalene (Differin Gel) applied every night\n\n I've found that when I'm comprehensive and diligent with my chemical exfoliation, all my products work in better harmony. Some days I'll also use a konjac sponge with my standard foaming cleanser in the shower for a gentle physical exfoliation.\n\nTL;DR exfoliation can help dehydrated skin especially if that skin hasn't had a good exfoliation for a while. Frequent mild acids may work for you, but doing slightly more intense exfoliation infrequently may also be another way forward. Try it out and experience softer than a baby's butt.",

My moisture barrier did repair itself... but I also got tons of clogged pores and broke out horribly. I’m still trying to repair the damage.

    "body": "Okay I had a few comments and messages so here is update so far. I had a message with someone asking me to take a picture of the ingredients, through this I noticed the ingredients on the website do NOT match what’s on the packages, it seems like more than just a different of MD or for public sale products. I have sent a message to inquire about this. Below is the difference between what is listed on medestitics website and the ingredients on the actual box. \n\n\tCaprylic/Capric Triglyceride\n\t•\tAzelaic Acid\n\t•\tTitanium Dioxide\n\t•\tAloe barbadensis Leaf Juice\n\t•\tCopernicia cerifera Cera (instead, List Two has Euphorbia Cerifera Cera)\n\t•\tKojic Acid (List Two has Kojic Dipalmitate, which is a derivative)\n\t•\tPEG-8 Beeswax\n\t•\tAlpha-Arbutin\n\t•\tCetearyl Alcohol\n\t•\tNiacinamide\n\t•\tSodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (List Two has Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, another vitamin C derivative)\n\t•\tCeteareth-25\n\t•\tBisabolol\n\t•\tMagnesium Aluminium Silicate\n\t•\tStearyl Dimethicone\n\t•\tBehenyl Alcohol\n\t•\tDisodium Ethylene Dicocamide PEG-15 Disulfate\n\t•\tSodium Lauroyl Lactylate\n\t•\tAscorbic Acid\n\t•\tCitric Acid\n\t•\tAllantoin\n\t•\tAcacia senegal Gum\n\t•\tGlyceryl Stearate Citrate\n\nWhen I asked chat gpt if any of these ingredients could change the effectiveness this was the answer:\n\nIt depends on the goal of the product. If the formula is meant for brightening and treating hyperpigmentation, losing Azelaic Acid, Alpha-Arbutin, and Niacinamide could reduce its potency. If it’s meant for acne-prone or sensitive skin, removing Bisabolol, Allantoin, and Aloe could make it harsher. However, List Two does have other effective ingredients, like Retinol, Kojic Dipalmitate, and Hexylresorcinol, which may compensate for some of the missing benefits.\n\nHowever, Skin is doing as expected and so far the same as when I had it applied in office by physician. Red and tight but very little peeling yet… I think it’ll start tomorrow. \n\n1st pic is immediately after rinsing to show my before. 2 picture are yesterday evening, skin looks the same today.\n\nOk thanks for listening to my rant 😅",

    "body": "Apologies for the mild overboard of the diary aspect. I'm not particularly sensitive to critique. My partner's pronouns are they/them and mine are she/they. :)\n\n**Section One: Assets and Debt **\nRetirement Balance: £30k with Aviva, through Salary Sacrifice. Last year I bumped it up to 10% from me with a 10% employer match. \nEquity if you're a homeowner: I'm in the process of buying a £190k house with a £19k deposit. \nSavings account balance: £26k, but that's house deposit + house fees as well, so will be decimated soon. \nChecking account balance: £1200\nCredit card debt (and how you accumulated it): -£1000, I do my monthly spending (all of it) on a credit card then pay it off in full. \nStudent loan debt: My highest level of education is 4 years of high school in a different European country. No uni/college/etc. \n\n**Section Two: Income**\nIncome Progression: \n- At 16 I worked 10 hours a week for minimum wage at a florist\n- At 18 I joined a small startup doing [rare foreign language] customer service. In true startup fashion I then took on sales (not for me), marketing (fine), change management and analytics. One of the directors taught me a little bit of SQL and got me a Power BI license, then I self-taught. I worked there for 5 years, going from £17k to £22k. Not great salary progression!\n- At 24 I was recruited into a big business that's now part of a Fortune 500, at £27k\n- That takes us to tax year 2019, £31k as I was being underpaid in comparison to a male colleague in the same role. \n- 2020, no change. \n- 2021, small raise to £34k\n- 2022, my ex dumped me and after a Very Bad Mental Health Time I entered a pretty manic period and said I needed a raise or promotion or I would leave. Raise to £54k and a promotion. \n- 2023 no change as of yet, however I was off for several months with a mental health crisis.\n10% yearly bonus. \nMain Job Monthly Take Home:\n- Salary: £4814\n- Pension: -£481\n- Making gross: £4436\n- PAYE: -£751\n- NI: -£381\n- EE NI: -£10\n- Making net: £3292\n- Numbers rounded for ease. :)\n- No side gig atm. \n\n**Section Three: Expenses**\nRent / Mortgage / HOA fees (please specify how you split it if living with a partner): Living alone in a flat, rent £425 as it never increased in 10 years. \nSavings contribution: £200 in a H2B ISA, and between £500 and £700 into savings. \nInvestment contribution: Not right now. \nDebt payments (please break this down individually and specify if you're paying above the minimum): None. \nElectric: £45 DD. Gas I'll put £50 on whenever it needs it, so it's seasonal. Probably 5-6 times a year. \nWifi/Cable/Landline: Internet £45. \nCellphone: £45 handset (0% finance as I prefer to buy the device outright, maybe 5 months left. I'll keep using the device until it becomes untenable, likely another 12-18\nmonths as I use it a LOT). £16 for the sim. \nSubscriptions: Netflix £10.99 (which I rarely use... but 5 people I know do!). Spotify family £16.99. Patreon £5. icloud storage £0.99\nGym membership: £21.99 gym. £130 for my PT (hour session every week). \nPet expenses: None :(\n\n**The diary:**\nWednesday:\n7:45 - Awake. Daylight doesn't stream so much as whimper through my open curtains, suffocated by the grey sky that's plagueing us. I almost convince myself that getting out of bed will be fine, until I actually do, and the reminder that I had a great workout yesterday presents itself. I shamble through the morning like a poorly reanimated corpse. \n9:00 - Take 10 mins to nip to Sainsbury's for a 4-pack of monster. I get some raspberries, strawberries, bananas, and mint. It'd be cheaper in aldi but I have limited time. At home I stick some of the berries in a nutribullet with a Myprotein vegan protein blend sample in the flavour White Chocolate Raspberry. Please don't be awful. (It is kind of awful and has that horrible grainy quality that vegan protein powder so often has, made barely tolerable by the fruit. I would not rebuy and am glad I spent a little bit of extra ££ per portion to get samples of a lot of different flavours.) From here on out I'm in a variety of meetings, ask questions no one gives me an answer to, and try to hammer out some work. £11.04\n11:00 - I'm doing some \"thinky\" work and fold the laundry so my brain can wander a little bit and alight on a solution easier. It does help a bit and I have a somewhat-reasonable idea that I ping to 2 colleagues for some honest feedback/flaw-finding. Surprisingly, they both are pretty happy with it. A colleague I'm also good friends with confides that recently there have been good things said about me and I'm pleased - I struggled earlier in the year without purpose and was off sick for a while for [big long diary entry of reasons]. Our manager has been dropping notes about me going for a promotion in one of the 2024 cycles so this will look good. I'm in the process of buying a house and though I'm unaware of the exact raise of a promotion (probably between 10-20k) I keep doing mental maths on paying off the house in x years if I hammer the whole increase into overpayments or lump sums. \n12:00 - Someone who repeatedly lets us down in the team, once again, lets us down. I'm temporarily annoyed but it's a sunny nice day so off I go for a little walk. On the way I get hungry and I really fancy a croissant for lunch. £3.05 at M&S since I get pomegranate juice too. Once home I stick some veggie chicken pieces and some cheese on it, heat to melt, 10/10. Straight back to work for a few meetings, a 121, and a little work. Little snack of crackers and peanut butter. \n16:00 - I decide to call it a day and go back outside. It promptly pisses down. Fuck you too. I nip into asda for a quarterly shampoo purchase (big tub, once a week wash) which makes up £12 of the total of £15.50. I also get a Freddo for doing well today, some strawberry protein milk, and some cocoa pops. I'm super not in the mood to cook so that's fine for dinner.\n17:30 - Cocoa pops and strawberry milk. I recognise that is incredibly juvenile, so I play on my switch until I get very tired, and off I go. Productive work, 10k steps walked, good amount of protein, not too bad on the spending. Decent day all-round. My long distance partner is sick and I'm very tired, so they text a LOT of \"I'm sick\" messages and eventually I'm a bit too harsh asking them what else they want me to say after the 50th time, and we end up chatting on the phone for an hour or so when I call quickly to apologise for snapping. I can be worn out without acting like an ass. I move my plan for Couch to 5k day 2 to tomorrow, and have a bagel with pesto and cheese, and a snack pack of crisps to hit my macros. \n22:30 - Bed. \n\nThursday:\n07:45 - Up. Wake up, browse internet a bit. Consider buying Dorian Electra tickets but I lost most of my local friends in a breakup and would have no one to go with. In and out of meetings all morning, and I sneak a chocolate mug cake from Myprotein at one point. It's mediocre but made better by stirring through a crack of salt, a little sweetener, and a little powder peanut butter (and a touch extra water to maintain liquid balance). \n10:30 - Solicitor call. I'm buying a house and this is the first time they've deigned to speak to me.... because I decided to opt out of a £300 indemnity policy that my risk appetite is fine with forgoing. I use the opportunity to ask them if I need to do anything, whether it's me or them who has to ask for gas&electricity safety checks (which I hope were done as it was a landlord property!), and let them know I'm considering a damp and timber survey off the back of my level 2 survey. I wish I wasn't doing this alone. My current relationship really needs to end but I've never broken up with someone before (as the breaker) and I struggle with doing it long distance, and due to their mental health never being great. But given some events [insert story of catching them sexting a mutual friend and promising to do therapy but never doing so here] I'm not motivated to move there anymore and they've, in hindsight, never been serious about the suggestion of moving here. This relationship has an expiry date. I wish I at least got some support out of it, but whenever I talk decisions or finances they just start scrolling tiktok or stop listening. I text a close friend and ask him if he had an extra survey done when he bought with his girlfriend a year or so ago. He suggests he could give me his opinion on that and perhaps the whole survey at our pub quiz pub and I like this idea. \n11:00 - Ryanair emails me again to get me to try to book a seat for my upcoming trip to see my partner. No, airline, I do not care. Not worth the money. \n12:00 - Little break for a walk. I consider what I want for lunch and fancy a big nice salad so swing by aldi first, then sainsbury's for missing items. I also stop for a bit to pet a cat called Cuddles who is a little old man and a total mush that loves love. I don't see him much anymore as he's getting older, but he's always a treat to see. 3 people I know have tested positive for covid this week, and I feel suspicious and anxious of the coughing around me, especially the uncovered open-mouthed cough of a grown man! Leaves, cucumber, tomato, mozzarella, eggs, and a protein yoghurt drink from aldi for £6.76. In sainsbury's I see but don't buy cute boots for £30 and will keep an eye on if they go on sale. I get some fake chicken (fhicken), fsausage, more but different leaf, and some quavers for £7.95. \n13:00 - Back to work. Salad is a base of lamb's lettuce, then chopped tomato, cuke, paprika, tinned sweetcorn. If I had time I'd put in a soft boiled egg. Fhicken and mozarella in it, dressed in salt, pepper, balsamic vinger, EVOO, and a little nutritional yeast. The ingredients will make 2-3 satisfying salads, though I'd add other stuff like pickle if I had it in the fridge. \n16:45 - Call it a day, freshen up, and head to the train. Return train ticket £4.65. It pisses down on the walk and now I have wet feet. Rude. \n17:40 - We meet and share lebanese food of various dips and pastries and bread and a great fresh lemonade. My friend pays the bill of £60. \n19:45 - Pub time! I pay £2 quiz entry and spend £35 on drinks for both of us (I'm drinking thirds cause I feel really full, so I repay him most of my half of dinner). On our way out we get asked by an old couple if we'll be in next week (we come regularly but not every week). When I move I'll be walking distance. I'm looking forward to it!\n23:00 - The trains home are cancelled so I wait 25 minutes for a bus that's supposed to come every 10, and as soon as I order an uber, a bus shows up. Uber puts a £12 charge on my card that will get refunded. I pay £2 for the bus and listen to my october playlist on the journey. I had a lot of fun and a great catch up! I'm looking forward to the work quiz he's doing tomorrow and will get the expert surveyor's details from him and organise it. We discuss doing boardgames soon, no date but I'd love to get to it. \n23:30 - I'm enjoying the music I'm listening to when I get off the bus and have like 35 minutes of music queued up I want to walk to, so I turn my walking pad on (speed goes up to a jog which is enough) to do week 1 day 2 of couch to 5k. I'm not a big fan of cardio in general but I want my heart health and endurance to be better so I'm just sucking it up and sticking to it. Playlist hits include Snow - Informer and Rock Me Amadeus. \n\nFriday:\n00:18 - Done! I feel good and less uncomfortably full. Quick rinse in the shower, teeth, face, to bed. Alarm's set for 8:20. \n08:20 - alarm. Treat myself to 25 more minutes but wake up soon anyway. Then I'm in meetings till 12, and have a banana and a can of monster. Also the last bagel with the dregs of a jar of pesto and some cheese. My sprint has gone well and as I planned, which is nice. Trucking along well. In my little between-meeting breaks I browse reddit a bit. The next level of promotion I'm told (on the downlow) comes with £20k of RSUs yearly, vesting after 3 years as a \"golden handcuff\". I could see myself staying with the business as it pays well and when things are good, I'm happy enough. I would sell them after the 3 year period to diversify my holdings and not have stock and employment in the same business. I'm curious what the sub things of it as part of a compensation package!\n11:50 - Meetings done for the morning. I see the cutest halloween flash of a little bat and I NEED him. DM the artist and book in for 8pm next friday. Total cost £50 but will send £20 today as deposit when she sends me her paypal. I have an almost full sleeve on the left (need to chase my artist for the final session and touch up, but £450 is a little out of budget this month so I'll pick it up in december/february) including the elbow ditch, then 6 disparate on the other arm, so I'm unworried by getting it done and healing it. I check my spending (all on the credit card so it's easy to see, I pay it off in full, and after the house purchase I'll open a new one with rewards again) and at 60% of the month done, I'm at 50% of my usual monthly spend. It may see a bit of a hit when I'm in [redacted] for Halloween in either drinks going out or in getting home drinks and snacks. \n12:00 - It has been absolutely pissing down since I woke up which is really fucking with my usual lunch walk plans. Fuck you, clouds. I scroll social media a bit. Mustard (i think that's the brand) keeps advertising me cute pastel lockers and I like them, but the price is just really steep. Something to ponder. Because I'm not made of sugar, I suck it up and leave the house. As a reward, I get a meal deal from asda for £3.20 and snaffle it while I do friday afternoon training. Truly dull material. Its mind-numbing \"professionalism\" cements my long-standing decision to present/train in a pretty informal fashion (well-documented for reference, but trying to be more fun and conversational) as often as I can. \n14:00 - Quiz! The friend I saw yesterday (we also work on the same team) put one together. I have a blast! I also win. Fucking SUCK IT. \n16:30 - Rain, still. Orange wind/rain warnings, but life goes on. Converse in the bag, docs on my feet (so, so worth the investment on each pair), and off we go with the last monster ultra rose from the 4-pack in hand. Before I go I do some stretches as my right shoulderblade us acting up. Wind blows my door closed with the key inside the house as I open my umbrella. Fuck my life. No spares. Hate this fucking auto-lock door. Piece of shit. I call a locksmith on my way to the gym to meet me at 18:30. \n17:00 - Gym. Great session with all the adrenaline. I up the weight on every exercise I do and leave feeling good. Shit happens. I've found a solution with the locksmith and will fix the issue. I deal with a lot of mental health shit and deal with it with a regimen of very thoughtful nutrition and exercise, 7+ hours of sleep a minimum of 6 nights a week, aggressively being kind of myself even if I want to call myself world's dumbest fucking bitch, and holding so firm the belief that I AM IN CONTROL of my life and within reason I can achieve all I want with work and perseverance. Also a lot of past therapy. Meds do not agree with me. I still experience really low lows, but I can fight them. They're worst when I'm in love or a new relationship or have a fixation on a person. I'm a happier and better person single or having lost feelings. Something to work on when I have more spare money. I'm trying to get more therapy but the process is slow. \n18:30 - Home, sort of. Shelter in a covered area across the road. Scare a kitty by accident when he walks around the corner expecting it to be empty and he seems me. Sorry buddy! There's a chair and I'm close enough to use my wifi so all good. Several uber delivery drivers parking to collect from a burger place get jumpscared when their eyes adjust to see me lurking in the dark. Ehehehehehehehehe. It's the little things. \n19:45 - In. The locksmith gets it open easily and quickly and I consider a life of crime. It's so good to finally pee. So good. I'm hungry as fuck though, in a shaky-sweaty-lightheaded-vomity kind of way. Not sure why that happens to me. I can't be fucked to cook so even though it feels gross, I spray on some deoderant and lush body spray and head to sainsbury's for an oven pizza. I don't generally sweat THAT much in the gym as it's mostly strength work, so my stinki is at a minimum. £100 for the locksmith, and I save his number for when I move house so I can ask him to change the locks. \n20:30 - Treat myself to an optimum nutrition protein bar to tide me over. When googling them to see if they're veggie I see 10 for £20 and honestly with inflation for veggie and a good protein ratio it's... not bad. I make a mental note to order some bars for convenience later. I buy a spinach and ricotta pizza, a jar of pickles (I'm empty at home!) and a bottle of lemonade. And I want a caramel freddo, for winning the quiz earlier, but they aren't selling singles. Boo. Last minute I grab baked beans to have with brunch tomorrow. And also bagels. The quick shop escalated. £15.45. I see an obviously stoned man trying very hard to not appear stoned. Ganbatte, buddy. At home I do the dishes while the oven preheats and take out the rubbish and tidy a bit while it cooks. \n21:15 - Stuffed. Shower. Sheets. Watch stuff, chat to my long distances besties a bit, fall asleep. \n\nSaturday:\n08:30 - Wake up. Nope. \n09:30 - Wake up 2, electric boogaloo. I lay in bed scrolling social media and playing some mobile games till the urge to pee makes me get up. Listen to a youtube drama documentary thing in the background. \n12:00 - Up. 4/10 DOMS in my lats, 3/10 in my  glutes. Realize I'm in bed since my body's dragging my NEET down after being active, but I don't want to waste my weekend. The manchester museum reopened this year(?), so I get up and dressed to head into town. I leave the house and notice my phone battery is at 60% which isn't great, so I buy a train ticket for £4.40, check what the next train I could catch is, and put my phone in low battery and walk till it's time. \n13:23 - Train. I maybe eavesdrop on a conversation next to me that sounds like the opposing perspective would be on the JustNoMIL sub. Interesting. Even when she tries to frame herself as the hero, she comes off as a villain. \n14:30 - Hungry. I buy a bean and cheese quesadilla from eight day for £2.35. \n16:00 - Done in the museum - it's nice! I enjoy the dinosaur/fossils through the ages exhibit, and chinese and indian histories. The egyptian exhibit is interesting but feels somewhat uncomfortable as many are looted artifacts. I'm overall glad I went and had a walk around. \n16:30 - £12.99 in superdrug for a lipbalm, hair mask, and the hair colour touch up I use to stay vibrant. \n17:00 - Get a \"build your own salad\" kind thing with egg and pasta bits etc etc. Drink, crisps. £4.99. Catch a train. A woman yells into her phone on a call which she has on maximum speaker volume the whole time. I try to argue myself out of hoping she spontaneously loses the power of speech forever, but then she starts talking about how Laura (who is giving her several items she's going to keep for her kids for christmas!) is such a bitch and she really hates her, and I feel a bit better about my failure to resist. \n18:00 - Home. Eat a bit of the \"salad\" and a pickle. Mmm, pickle. Flop on the bed for a while. Bra off. 10km walk today so far! Not bad. \n21:30 - Little walk. I feel like I have energy still, which makes it hard for me to consider sleep. I grab a bottle of diet coke and some ice cream. £7. At home I eat my ice cream while catching up on the 2 episodes of Bake Off I've missed. A baker starts to endear himself to me during episode 3, but my loyalties lie with Selasi, even though he was many seasons ago. \n00:00 - Bed. The thought I need to break uo with my partner haunts me. I suppress the feeling and throw myself into watching youtube to take my mind off of it. \n\nSunday:\n09:30 - Alarm. I think I turn it off half asleep. \n12:30 - Actually wake up. I guess my body needed it? My fitbit says I slept about 9 hours and 45 minutes. I'm mildly concerned about falling asleep tonight, but if I'm a bit tired waking up tomorrow, so be it. \n13:30 - Make a small salad and fry up some richmond's veggie sausages, fry off an egg, stick some baked beans in mïcrowãvé. Hearty! I'll try and tidy/clean after this. I eat while watching some youtube; updates on the ruby franke shit (finally, but so so long overdue), some mr olympia predictions. I open all the windows and put on a jumper - it's a bit chilly but that airing out is so good. I look for a podcast to listen to and spot one from Mascha Feoktistova - what a throwback! I haven't thought about her/beautygloss in over a decade. I end up listening to Casefile Presents: In The Shadows. After a bit I decide that, fuck it. Even if I do nothing today, I'll average 12k steps a day this week. Plus work. Plus 2 days of couch to 5k. Plus two chunky, good, heavy gym sessions. I get under my weighted blankets. \n14:00 - Do fuck all. \n23:45 - Go to bed. My broken-ass leaky water bottle stabs me when I refill it and I make a note to stop being fucking cheap and get a new one tomorrow. Good night y'all. \n\nMonday:\n8:20 - Alarm. Awake. I struggled hard to fall asleep and am running on limited sleep. I struggle with insomnia so have some reasonable accomodations. I message on slack that I'll be sleeping in a bit. Too little sleep also triggers my anxiety. \n10:30 - Awake second time. Stay awake this time. 6.5 hours of sleep with this extension. Work!\n13:00 - Snacky. Bagel with fsausage and cheese, bagel with chocolate spread and banana. Mm. My whole day so far has been troubleshooting/fixing/identiying other people's fuckups. \n13:30 - My fucking finger hurts from being stabbed by my water bottle. I want big, cold, and with a straw. I google a bit and end up ordering a big-ass tumbler in black from PureFlow. £22.99. \n16:45 - I get nothing done today and call it here. Better luck tomorrow. I realise I've had no caffiene today - I have max one can of monster per day, but it makes a difference to my mood and energy. I need to buy a 4 pack for the week. It's too late in the day to have any now, so I'll finish monday without. \n20:00 - Go for a walk. I'm hungry so I get an asda meal deal £4. \n20:45 - Sainsbury's. Clothes are on sale so I get a sports bra, a tank top, and some pants I've been needing for a while. I also buy a protein bar, a freddo, and some monster. I think I'm PMSing based on the freddo cravings and few days of tiredness - I don't currently get a traditional period as I take birth control continuously to skip it. If I don't I have to be off sick roughly 24-36 days a year with cramps and I can't afford that, so fuck it. £23.05, of which £15 is clothes. \n21:00 - Home. I take out the trash, do the dishes, tidy. I must vacuum tomorrow! \n21:30 - Need some more steps. Do week 1 day 3 couch to 5k. I'm technically a day late, but I'm sticking to it! I'm definitely not a born runner, and I'm embarassed to only do 7 of the free minutes as a run. My fitbit gets very confused on the GPS by me being on a treadmill, but sets me at 13'40\" per KM which is consistent to last time. I am sweaty. I spent most of my time in my cardio and peak zones. Step goal achieved. \n22:45 - Flopped a while, showered, back in bed. On go 2 pumps of the Nip+Fab Vitamin C Serum. I can't tell if it's PMS, the cheeky freddos, or the serum giving me a blemish. Every time I like a Q+A product (the mint cleanser, vit c serum) it disappears from the shelves... so this is a new product for me. I miss the ordinary's magnesium ascorbyl phosphate. It was my favourite. If anyone has a like-for-like, please let me know. (I beg). Vaseline on the lips. I could really go for a good overnight lip mask recommendation for winter!\n23:45 - Try to sleep and aim for 8-9 wake up tomorrow. I watch some stuff on youtube. Last diary day tomorrow!\n\nTuesday:\n08:10 - Wake up. Linger in a state of tiredness for a while. 6.5h sleep. Eventually get up properly. I'm really looking forward to washing my hair after the gym tonight. Work a bit. \n12:00 - Lay down for a few minutes and accidentally nap for an hour. \n14:00 - 3rd meeting of the day. I offer to pick up a problem so I have a bit of motivation going between the two. Have a quick bagel with chocolate spread and a banana. I briefly commiserate with a colleague on how we both got nothing done yet this week and we come to self-compassion. I need some better rest tonight, really. I'm out of melatonin, which, yes, I lie to online doctors about being jetlagged to get. I use them responsibly! If I wasn't a loser I would love some weed gummies to get me to sleep. I'll probably order some more melatonin next week. \n16:00 - Gym time. I leave a bit late, but my PT is also a bit late, so I swing by a locker to pick up the water bottle. \n17:45 - Good session! I feel a bit flat but try to push myself a bit still. I feel like I put in the effort I had and didn't phone it in. The water bottle is good, I like it! Time to walk home. I swing by sainsbury's and grab a spinach & ricotta canneloni, veggie meatballs, some prawn cocktail quavers, a freddo, and a protein shake. Also cheese! £12.70. \n18:30 - Eat my quavers and hop in the shower. L'oreal's Bond Repair shampoo on my hair, followed by a mix of pantene's keratin reconstruct mask and clairol's colour gloss up in terra copper. Normally I just use the colour, but the one in the shower was near empty and the full one is upstairs. Q+A niacinamide cleanser on the face and lush's octopus jelly thing on the body. After the shower I lay on the bed for a while with a rich moisture sheet mask from Simple. \n19:45 - Mask off. Food in the mic, cheese, sweetcorn, extra seasoning in the food, food in my mouth. Tasty. Little bit of laundry. I'm just in time to catch bake off live! Saku seems to be loosening up week by week and  her personality is so cute shining through. Rowan continues to be lovely. I'm a firm believer that the \"time crunch\" element introduced when the shows moved to channel 4 resulted in a quality downgrade and the show would be better, with better outcomes if the times were 10% longer. The people want good bakes, not drama from getting them out of the oven with 25 seconds to go!\n21:20 - I finish bake off and notice that a loss of vision has crept into my right eye; a warning sign of a migraine I get 1-2 times a year. The first time it happened was terrifying (and I worked a full day half blind and trying not to vomit!). I brush my teeth and head to my blankets, lights off, soothing video on. Maybe I can sleep through it. Eventually I drift off at about 10 after the other unpleasant effect of a brief loss of feeling in my right hand. Fun! Good night, MD sub. \n\n**Eventual expenses:**\nFood: £90.03\nBooze: £35\nAesthetics (clothes, haircare etc): £59.99\nTravel: £12.05\nMisc: £124.99. \nTotal spend: 322.06. \n\n**Lastly, reflect on your diary! **\nOverall this wasn't too bad. I generally carry a £1000/month balance so averaging 200-250/week (depending on month length) so without the locksmith it's pretty bang on target. Food may seem high to many, and it is, but I'm not too bothered as it's eating in a way that feels good to me. I could stand to cook more but it's a life of convenience ultimately when I'm busy. I'm glad with my activity and work being largely good, and I had a decent amount of fun between quizzes and the museum! Thank you for reading.",

    "body": "This review is for Timeless Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate serum in the blue box, not for the much raved about L-AA serum which comes in the yellow box. After throwing out two half full bottles of Timeless's L-AA vitamin C because of oxidation, I decided to try this formulation with MAP instead. (Yes I kept it in the fridge, yes I separated the bottles, my apartment just gets too hot during the day). I just turned 40 and just started tret so I want the anti-aging benefits of vitamin C and the boost to sun protection. I found the yellow box version slightly irritating to my skin plus waiting for it to fully absorb before moving on the next step because of the low ph was a hassle. Also, it was so watery it was hard to apply.\n\nI liked the research on MAP better than that of SAP so started hunting around for a MAP version. This was very affordable at the right concentration, and I'm already a fan of Timeless. I really like this version. I can't say for sure if any vitamin C serum is working-- I'm taking it on faith that it is fighting free radicals and helping build collagen. I've not noticed much improvement on sun damage from before and after photos so I'm not going to bother posting them. I started OTC retinol at around the same time so I can't isolate if the C or the retinol caused my improved skin tone. My skin didn't get worse when I switched to this formulation so it's at least as good as the other version. More importantly, it has a much better shelf life, it's a bit easier to use because the serum is not as watery, it doesn't irritate my skin, and no wait time for the next step. I put it in an airless pump and one pump is enough to cover my face. I did split the bottle and keep half in the fridge, and I'm already on the second half with no oxidation. Overall, I'm very happy with the product and plan to repurchase.",

        "body": "I'm actually making my own vitamin c serum for very cheap with L-Ascorbic Acid and it works really well for me. It's important to boil the water first to get rid of the oxygen, then I put 1 teaspoon of LAA in a small spray bottle and add 10 teaspoons of the boiled water for getting a really strong serum, or 15-20 teaspoons of water for getting a lower concentration serum. Of course I'm keeping it in fridge and make a new one about every 10 days.\n\nThis works really well for me. I'm using it for preparing my skin for intense derma roller treatments (up to 1.5mm needles) once a month to enhance collagen production. And regular peelings with salicylic acid (or other acids) helps for better absorption of the serum. After spraying the serum I let it dry and add a cream with hyaluronic acid.\n\nI just turned 45 and with this treatment my skin looks a little bit better than before every year, lol. I really couldn't be any happier with it.",

Cica](http://www.lalavesi.com/shop/shopdetail.html?branduid=301293&xcode=003&mcode=003&scode=002&type=Y&sort=manual&cur_code=003003&GfDT=bG93WA%3D%3D).\n\n\nI really like the packaging of [Eye Crown's](http://eye-crown.com/index.html) mascaras and I think it's awesome that they came with a cape and lash comb(the crown).The brand from what I've seen is pretty new like their fb and twitter posts start in like may of this year.\n\n\nI know these have been out for a long time now but I only recently came across them. *L'Herbiflore* [Home Of The Mermaid](http://www.lherboflore.com.tw/product_list.aspx?series=1&classid=11) and [Fashion Traveler](http://www.lherboflore.com.tw/product_list.aspx?series=1&classid=23) mask collections really caught my eye recently.The mermaid series has ingredients such as algae(green,red),pearl,deep ocean water,marine collagen and the fashion one has ingredients such as lupine, vit A,shea butter, arbutin, tranexamic acid,mulberry,olive,royal jelly,iris,mushroom.\n\n\n[Cosme Recipe](https://cosmerecipe.tokyo/) has two all over gels(body,face,hair) that look nice.The *Aloe+Lemon* has ingredients such as  Hydrolyzed Avocado Protein, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Lemon Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Witch Hazel Extract, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Ceramide NP, Tea Tree Leaf Oil and the *Grapefruit+Cucumber* has ingredients such as Punica Granatum Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Royal Jelly Extract, Grapefruit Fruit Extract, Cucumber Fruit Extract, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Ceramide NP, Kale Leaf Extract.\n\n\n\n*DNACLAIR* has a nice looking mosturizer [Premium Cream](http://dgmp.jp/ec/products/detail.html?id=72).It has ingredients such as squalane, shea butter, ceramide NG, ceramide NP, ceramide AP, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, hydrolyzed collagen, succinoyle atelocollagen, phytosphingosine, hydrolyzed elastin, placenta extract, sodium hyaluronate, soluble proteoglycan, mortierella oil, trifluoroacetyl tripeptide-2, oligopeptide-68, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, ascorbyl tetraisopalmitate, cerebrosides, oligopeptide-24, acetyl decapeptide-3, palmitoyl

Neosolue™-Aqulio.\n\n\n*&fute'le* has a stick cheek & lip tint that has some cute shades called [Watery W Tint](https://www.andfutele.com).\n\n\n*Shimizu* is a brand that I recently came across and if you are a fan of placenta they are def worth a look.From what I've seen the majority of their products are fragrance free and don't have any EO or fragrant plant extracts(their anti-aging line(the with brown packaging) does have some flower and citrus extracts)). They products have ingredients such as placenta extract, ubiquinone,dif froms of HA, ceramides, hydrolyzed collagen, royal jelly extract, phytosphingosine,  Neosolue™-Aqulio, retinyl palmitate, tripeptide F, oil soluble licorice extract, ascorbyl tetraisopalmitate,etc.\n\n\n\nAlso I checked this out yesterday for someone  and even thought they made a post about it afterwards in case you guys haven't seen it the Rosette Ceramide Gel has been discontinued.According to [cosme](http://www.cosme.net/product/product_id/289770/top) - \"This product has ended production or renewal. (However, some stores may still be on sale.)\" . From what I could get from some comments the gel has stopped production this april while the lotions from the line have stopped been produced since last fall.The entire Ceramide line is gone from the lineup on the Rosette's site.",

    "body": "Hey guys, I have a few questions for you all about whitening ingredients. So far, I've read that you should wait 20 min, or apply at different times (morning VS night) when using L-AA and Niacinamide in your routine (the two ingredients = flushing). I'm currently using [Mentholatum Melano CC Intensive Anti-Spot Essence](http://www.ratzillacosme.com/skin/melanocc-essence/) and CeraVe PM Moisturizing Lotion (4% Niacinamide):\n\n1) Is there a difference between L-AA and AA? Would I still need to wait?\n\n2) If I want to add Arbutin to my routine (Hada Labo Shirojyun Lotion), how will it play with my AA and Niacinamide? How does Arbutin react to AHA/BHA/Water?\n\n3) Finally, is there a point where I should draw a line when using whitening ingredients? Would I be going overboard?\n\nThanks guys!!\n\nedit: One more question, I noticed that Hada Labo Shirojyun Lotion also contains Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, does that mean that I would be stacking on Vitamin C? I'm not sure how well they would go together in a routine ._. ",

        "body": "1) The two are chemically identical. The L- prefix is a designation that isn't important to anyone but biochemists (it has to do with atom configuration). As for other forms of vitamin C, you would still need to wait. All other forms of vitamin c must convert into L-ascorbic acid in order to have an effect on the skin, so you would need to wait with them as well.\n\n2) Arbutin seems to do fine with those ingredients.\n\n3) I would personally draw the line at arbutin. The European Commission wrote an [official opinion](http://ec.europa.eu/health/archive/ph_risk/committees/04_sccp/docs/sccp_o_134.pdf) on the safety of arbutin. While arbutin may be safe in its own right, the commission concluded that arbutin's conversion to hydroquinone in the skin when applied for extended periods makes it unsafe for cosmetic use. Vitamin C, niacinamide, sunscreen, and AHAs/retinoids should do a fine enough job. I would say that if you aren't satisfied after a few months of that routine, maybe you could add in the arbutin? That's just my opinion though!\n\nAs for the magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, yes you'd be stacking on vitamin c. They'll go together just fine.",

        "body": "Like other people said LAA and AA are the same chemically, they have the same molecular formula.  Basically certain chemicals have mirror images of each other.  L is one isomer, D is the other.  L is the \"biologically active\" form, as enzymes in the skin can only use LAA for synthesis.  LAA can be natural or synthetic, but all natural vitamin c is the L form.  Only the L isomer is found in nature, but when vitamin C is synthesized, you can get both forms.  It depends on the synthesis.   The D form has antioxidant activity, but is not able to be used in synthetic reactions (i.e. collagen synthesis).\nSo basically L is better, but a product may just say ascorbic acid, but it may contain only the L form, or both forms.  The L form does not covert to D form, but the other, more stable forms like  MAP do convert to ascorbic acid.\n So basically, it makes no difference to your application, but the more stable forms (like MAP) are not pH dependent for their activity and may not react with [niacinamide](https://www.futurederm.com/should-niacinamide-and-l-ascorbic-acid-be-used-together/).  There is some data out there that niacinamide should not be used with acids.  I am not sure what the popular opinion on this subject is(feel free to discuss), but I personally am going to consider this as I put my routine together.  I currently use a MAP product after acids but before niacinamide cream product(s).  I don't wait after the ~~MAP~~ SAP product.",

    "body": "Illdiko (from Hungary) asks.. I really love vitamin C serums, but I would like to use them properly. Do vitamin C products really need a special low pH? And what about their derivatives, like Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate and others? Which vitamin C ingredient is the best?”\n\n**What’s the deal with Vitamin C?**\n\nVitamin C is a chemical called ascorbic acid that is naturally occurring in skin. It is known to play a role in collagen production. In addition, when topically applied it is thought to help heal acne, increase the barrier function of skin to decrease moisture loss, protect from UV radiation, and prevent age spots.\n\nSounds too good to be true, huh? Well there is a downside – it’s difficult to deliver vitamin C to skin in a form that is stable, effective and non-irritating.\n\nThere are something like 7 or 8 different forms of vitamin C that are used in cosmetics and there’s a LOT of noise out there about how the different versions work, how much to use, what kind of formula is required to deliver the ingredient, and so forth.\n\nSo, today, we’re going to try to get to the bottom of that mess by reviewing the best scientific data available on each ingredient. And we’ll do that using the three Kligman questions format that we’ve used before. Randy, want to describe that again for our readers?\n\n**How to prove an anti-aging ingredient works – the Kligman questions**\n\n1. Based on the chemistry of the ingredient, is there any scientific mechanism that could explain why it would work?\n2. Does it penetrate to the part of the skin where it needs to be in order to work?\n3. Are there peer reviewed, double blind, placebo controlled studies demonstrating the ingredient really works when applied to real people?\n\nOur assessment is based primarily on a paper which reviews the technical literature on Vitamin C through 2012: “Stability, transdermal penetration and cutaneous effects of ascorbic acid and its derivatives” from the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology, 2012.\n\nLet’s start by discussion the mechanism. Remember the active form is ascorbic acid so all the derivatives must be converted to ascorbic acid on the skin.\n\n**Is there a mechanism that explains how Vitamin C works?**\n\nRemember that unlike many other anti aging ingredients, Vitamin C is naturally found in skin (mostly in the epidermis, some in the dermis) and it’s role in skin biology is well documented. For example…\n\n**Protecting from UV damage**\n\nAlthough vitamin C is NOT a sunscreen but it protects skin from the free radicals that are caused by UV exposure. It’s been shown to reduce lipid peroxidation, limit the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, protect against apoptosis (or cell death) and to reduce redox-sensitive cell signaling. All this means that vitamin C reduces many of the nasty effects of sun exposure.\n\n**Increasing collagen to reduce wrinkles**\n\nAs you know collagen collapse is a major cause of wrinkles. Vitamin C regulates the synthesis of collagen and it does this by hydroxylating collagen which makes it more stable and improves the way it supports the epidermis.\n\n**Reducing skin pigmentation**\n\nVitamin C not only reduces melanin production but it also reduces oxidation of the melanin that is produced. It’s also thought to reverse the conversion of DOPA to o-DOPA quinone (which is a skin pigment).\n\nSo, as you can see, the effects of vitamin C in the skin are well understood. Now let’s look at the other properties of each ingredient and what kind of data is available to prove that they work.\n\n---\n\n**Ascorbic Acid (AA)**\n\n**Is it stable?** Stable at pH less than 3.5 in aqueous solution and it’s stable in anhydrous systems\n\n**Does it penetrate?** Ex vivo testing proves it penetrates as a solution or micro particles\n\n**Does it convert to Ascorbic Acid?** No conversion required.\n\n**Protects from UV damage:** Yes, human in vivo testing.\n\n**Increases collagen synthesis:** Yes, human in vivo testing.\n\n**Reduces skin pigmentation:** Yes, human in vivo testing.\n\nSo this ingredient is the gold standard for Vitamin C. However because it’s often used at very low pH it can be harsh to skin which has lead to the development of other versions of AA. For example….\n\n---\n\n**Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (SAP)**\n\n**Is it stable?** Stable at pH 7\n\n**Does it penetrate?** There is limited ex vivo animal testing which shows it penetrates.\n\n**Does it convert to Ascorbic Acid?** There is no data showing it converts to AA.\n\n**Protects from UV damage:** Yes, human in vivo testing shows is protects but less effective than AA.\n\n**Increases collagen synthesis:** Yes, in vitro testing only and it’s less effective than MAP.\n\n**Reduces skin pigmentation:** Yes, human in vivo testing (but from trade journal only so the data may be less robust.)\n\n--- \n\n**Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (MAP)**\n\n**Is it stable?**  Stable at pH 7\n\n**Does it penetrate?** Yes it penetrates, but data is limited to ex vivo animal testing.\n\n**Does it convert to Ascorbic Acid?** In vitro testing indicates it converts to AA.\n\n**Protects from UV damage:** No data.\n\n**Increases collagen synthesis:** Yes but only in vitro testing. Apparently equally as effective as AA.\n\n**Reduces skin pigmentation:** Yes, human in vivo testing.\n\n---\n\n**Ascorbyl Palmitate (AA-PAL)**\n\n**Is it stable?** Same stability issues as AA (requires low pH or anhydrous system.)\n\n**Does it penetrate?** In vivo animal testing shows it penetrates but it’s very dependent upon the formula.\n\n**Does it converts to Ascorbic Acid?**  No data showing that it converts.\n\n**Protects from UV damage:** Yes, animal in vivo testing shows it protects from UV.\n\n**Increases collagen synthesis:** Yes, but in vitro testing only.\n\n**Reduces skin pigmentation:** No data showing that it works.\n\n---\n\n**Ascorbyl Tetra-Isopalmitate (VC-IP)** *(tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate)*\n\n**Is it stable?** It’s stable at pH less than 5.\n\n**Does it penetrate?** According to a trade publication, human ex vivo testing shows it penetrates better than MAP.\n\n**Does it converts to Ascorbic Acid?** In vitro testing shows it converts to AA.\n\n**Protects from UV damage:** Yes but in vitro data only.\n\n**Increases collagen synthesis:** Yes but in vitro data only.\n\n**Reduces skin pigmentation:** Yes, human in vivo testing (according to trade journal.)\n\n---\n\n**Ascorbyl Glucoside (AA-2G)**\n\n**Is it stable?** Yes, stable at a range of pH.\n\n**Does it penetrate?** In vitro testing shows it penetrates.\n\n**Does it converts to Ascorbic Acid?** In vitro testing shows it converts to AA.\n\n**Protects from UV damage:** Yes, human in vivo testing shows it protects but it’s less effective than SAP.\n\n**Increases collagen synthesis:** Yes but in vitro data only.\n\n**Reduces skin pigmentation:** In vitro testing shows it diminishes dark spots. \n\n---\n\n**Ascorbyl 2-Phosphate 6-Palmitate (APPS)**\n\n**Is it stable?** Stable at pH 7\n\n**Does it penetrate?** In vivo animal data shows it penetrates.\n\n**Does it converts to Ascorbic Acid?** In vitro data shows it converts to AA.\n\n**Protects from UV damage:** No data.\n\n**Increases collagen synthesis:** No data.\n\n**Reduces skin pigmentation:** Yes, human in vivo data shows it diminishes dark spots.\n\n---\n\n**3-O-Ethyl Ascorbate (EAC)**\n\n**Is it stable?** No published data on stability.\n\n**Does it penetrate?** Ex vivo animal testing shows it penetrates better than AA-2G.\n\n**Does it converts to Ascorbic Acid?** No published data showing it converts to AA.\n\n**Protects from UV damage:** No data.\n\n**Increases collagen synthesis:** No data.  \n\n**Reduces skin pigmentation:** Human in vivo data shows it works against dark spots.\n\n---\n\n**Tip #1 for finding the best product: Ask for Ascorbic Acid**\n\nThis much is clear: of all the Vitamin C derivatives, Ascorbic Acid has the best data to prove that it really works for all three main functions. So, if possible, why wouldn’t you use AA?\n\nThat doesn’t mean that ANY product with AA on the label will be best. There are other factors at play…Which brings us to tip #2…\n\n**Tip #2 for finding the best product: Concentrate on the concentration**\n\nSo how much AA should a product contain?\n\nAccording to the Pauling Inst. the maximum skin absorption occurs at 20%. Higher concentrations actually have less absorption. Which is good since high concentrations are also more irritating.\n\nShould you go lower? Paula Begoun says that a proven range for vitamin C effectiveness is generally between 0.3% and 10%. 0.3 is a LONG way from the maximum absorption of 20% so that seems low.\n\nIf you can stand the irritation, 10% or even 15% should give better absorption.\n\n**Tip #3 for finding the best product: Watch out for water**\n\nAA can begin to oxide (which causes it to be used up) as soon as it’s dissolved in water. Look for products where water is NOT one of the first ingredients. That gives you a better chance of finding a product that will really work. That means looks for serums instead of cream based products.\n\nAlso, if water is present, look for products that use stabilizing agents – Paula’s Choice is good for this.\n\n**Tip #4 for finding the best product: Look for low pH**\n\nAs we noted, AA is unstable above 3.5 or so. Look for low pH products. Of course pH is only meaningful if water is present so it’s less of an issue in the kinds of water free formulas we just discussed.\n\n**Tip #5 for finding the best product: Purchase proper packaging**\n\nAny Vitamin C ingredient must be properly packaged to protect it from excess light and air.\n\nLook for pump packaging (or individually sealed single use capsules) to protect from air. I would even avoid products in plastic tubes unless you know they’re used some kind of laminate to act as a barrier to oxygen transmission.\n\nAvoid clear packages to protect from light. If it’s a glass jar make it dark.\n\n**Bonus tips:**\n\nWatch out for irritation\n\nAs we said, AA can cause redness and stinging. Be prepared to switch to another type if irritation is to great. The alternative may be less effective but you’ll be likely to use it more often if it’s gentle to your skin.\n\n**Don’t rush it!**\n\nAfter applying a vitamin C product you should wait a while before applying any other products.\n\nThat’s because other ingredients can trigger oxidation and if they’re applied on top of the AA before it can be absorbed into your skin it could become inactive.\n\n**The Beauty Brains bottom line**\n\nSo based on the data we’ve seen, ascorbic acid is the best version of  Vitamin C to use in an anti-aging product.\n\nBut, just having ascorbic acid on the ingredient list doesn’t make a product “the best.” A well formulated product based on other derivatives could be better than a poorly formulated product based on ascorbic acid.\n\nYou need to keep in mind that the efficacy of any vitamin C based product depends on not only the type of Vitamin C, but also the concentration, the other ingredients in the formula and the packaging.\n\nBut following our 5 tips should help you pick a product that’s more likely to work at a price you can afford.\n\n**SOURCE:** [The Beauty Brains](http://thebeautybrains.com/2014/05/which-kind-of-vitamin-c-is-best-for-skin-the-beauty-brains-show-episode-31/)\n\n*/u/Asideofstyle, thank you for the link!*",

    "body": "I‘ve been waiting on another yesstyle order but ran out of cleanser and moisturizer faster than i thought i would, so ended up pulling the trigger on these two! disclaimer that I’ve only used these twice now, but they’re simple enough products that I’m not waiting to see any dramatic results and am mostly looking at skin compatibility and how well they do their basic functions.   \n\n\n**Skin type**: oily/combo and acne prone. Temperate climate with cold winters and very humid summers. Seasonal allergies kick my ass and make my eyelids and nose dry and itchy. I’m on tret and have been experiencing some mild dryness and irritation from it, so I’m trying to adjust my skincare routine to more gentle, anti-inflammatory products that just let the tret do the heavy lifting. \n\n**Rovectin Aqua Gel Cleanser** (formerly conditioning cleanser): \n\nOrdered this when I ran out of my cerave foaming cleanser per recommendation by another user on here (thanks 🫶). The texture is a moderately thick, almost jiggly clear gel that glides onto your skin with little friction. It’s almost completely odorless. The surfactants in this cleanser are very mild, so don’t expect it to foam up much at all - it just kind of turns milky with water. I was impressed with how easily it rinses off and leaves zero dryness or residue - almost every cleanser on the market makes this claim, and I thought that cerave was pretty gentle, but then i used this and realized that my skin just felt soft, neutral, and matte - even my cerave would often leave behind that sort of stripped, tight shine. I could probably comfortably skip a moisturizer if i was feeling lazy or in a hurry. I don’t wear makeup so I have no idea how well it does with removing makeup, but most people here double cleanse anyway. Overall I’m really liking this and it’s a decent value for the size ($17 on iherb for 175ml). \n\n**Beauty of Joseon Red Bean Water Gel**:\n\nI wanted a gentle, super lightweight moisturizer that would be unlikely to cause breakouts and didn’t contain niacinamide (I can use it, but I’m starting to suspect my skin reacts to high concentrations of it and it’s in SO many things). For people with oily skin that want a more matte/weightless finish moisturizer I think this would be a great option. It sinks in really quickly and doesn’t really give your skin “more than it needs”. For my skin type I think this would probably be fine on its own in the summer, especially under sunscreen. Otherwise I’d probably layer it over my iUNIK vitamin hyaluronic acid toner. This gel contains magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, but it’s pretty far down the ingredients list so I don’t think it’s likely to cause issues in combination with other actives. It also has some good anti-inflammatory ingredients (panthenol, allantoin, betaine) and peptides. my eye cream didn’t sting at all when I applied this first, either. It’s fragrance and essential oil free and doesn’t really have much of a smell to me. Also quite affordable, I paid $14.40 for a 100ml tube.\n\n&#x200B;\n\noverall I can see both of these becoming staples in my routine. it can be hard to find products that suit my skin type and being on tret a lot of ingredients that weren’t necessarily an issue before are now potential irritants, so I love that both of these are gentle enough for me to use.

Personally I find arbutin to be more effective than tranexamic acid, but the main reason I'm wary of picking up the new formulation is the addition of ferments which may trigger fungal acne. Sidmool Whitening Power Ampoule also combines arbutin with magnesium ascorbyl phosphate (except without Job's Tears), but it's an ampoule and only 12ml. The other promising product I've seen is the arbutin lotion by Biyougeneki, although I doubt the placenta has any effect.",

        "body": "I don’t know if this is due to a recent regulation, but I noticed a ton of Japanese skincare products that were formulated with arbutin have been discontinued. I remember reading something about cases of contact dermatitis developing with arbutin products- I’m not sure if it was specific to a particular product or concentration but I imagine that’s why it hasn’t been included in the reformulation. The long-term use of arbutin products hasn’t been completely vetted for safety; we are just assuming since it doesn’t deliver as much active hydroquinone to the skin at once it’s less likely to cause the same complications as long term use of hydroquinone itself. That’s at least part of the reason that alpha arbutin can’t be formulated above 2% in the EU and US.\n\nIt’s not quite as popular in Korean skincare so I’m not sure there is a comparable product to the Shirojyun lotion- but I think a couple of Tiam products do contain arbutin. There’s always 2% arbutin from The Ordinary (non-AB) as well if it’s available where you live; that’s one of the most minimal formulations I know of.",

    "body": "As a consumer, unless the company states it on the package, it’s impossible to know the exact percentage of a certain ingredient.\n\nHowever, with a little bit of reasoning, you can estimate it.\n\nThe first thing you need to know is that ingredients are listed in descending order and that usually water is more than 50%. You also need to know that ingredients below 1% don’t need to be listed in descending order.\n\nLet's say we want to estimate the % of niacinamide in a serum.\n\nSo here’s what you can do.\n\nIt is safe to assume that niacinamide below 1% won’t do much to your skin considering that not all of it penetrates the skin. This means that the key to solve this issue is to find where the 1% or below starts. If niacinamide is after this point, it is present at less than 1% meaning the product is of very poor quality. Viceversa. more than 1%, the product is promising.\n\nLet’s use this serum from True Botanical as an example. From their website, the ingredients list is:\n\nCamellia Sinensis (Green And White Tea) Leaf Extract, True Botanicals Bioferment™ \\[Water, Alaria (Seaweed), Sodium Chloride\\], Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Water, Glycerin ,Cucurbita Pepo (Pumpkin) Seed Oil, Squalane Glucosamine ,Tocopherol ,Algin ,Niacinamide , Phenethyl Alcohol, Salix Nigra (Black Willow) Bark Extract, Helichrysum Stoechas (Helichrysum) Extract, Olea Europea (Olive) Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate Ethylhexglycerin, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Xanthan Gum, Propanediol, Lavendula Hybrida (Lavender) Oil.\n\nI have highlighted the Pumpkin seed oil because, in my opinion, is where the 1% starts. I came to this conclusion knowing that usually glycerin is never higher than 4% and tocopherol is rarely higher than 1%.\n\nIn this case, Niacinamide follows the pumpkin seed oil meaning that it’s definitely below 1%.\n\nThis product retails for $160. Definitely overpriced. You see, the majority of ingredients are just fancy names for water…\n\nMy suggestion is to always opt for products that clearly state the amount of active ingredients.\n\nFor example, in the Ordinary niacinamide serum, niacinamide is at 10%.",

I tried a Garnier gel and it was just *okay* (nice but like 1/10^th the moisture I needed), then tried a Garnier anti-oxidant bomb and it was also just okay (kinda burned, didn't actually have SPF but was greasy and shiny like it sure did). Made [this post looking for recs](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/71u80s/routine_help_canadians_andor_americans_very_very/), proceeded to not listen to any of them and tried out a [L'Oreal Hydra Genius](https://i.imgur.com/7fvTs5H.jpg) mostly because the glass bottle looked great and the ingredients seemed alright?\n Holy shit, the Hydra Genius made my skin freak out - for the few weeks I used it, it burned every time I put it on and I broke out in a load of cystic acne.\n\nSo as I wandered around the Real Canadian Superstore feeling pretty garbage, I actually spotted one of the recs from the rec post. The [Gold Bond Eczema Relief Cream with 2% colloidal oatmeal](http://www.goldbond.ca/en/products/eczema-relief-skin-proctectant-cream#tab=TabIngredients) that /u/nolancamp2 recommended. Putting Gold Bond on my face seemed a little sketch, but damn - the ingredients list looked *fiiiine*. It has a boatload of the moisturizers I like, vitamins, aloe, shea, whatever. And a giant tube of the cream was $8.\n\nGuys. GUYS. I've been using this for months now and the first application literally calmed redness leftover from the Hydra (Evil) Genius. It dries more matte than most of the moisturizers I've used. I have had zero issues with tight skin, dry patches, whatever - even as I've been testing other skincare products and adding in harsher treatments. The cream itself is a pale beige, thick with a very slight silicone feel but nothing slick or primer-like about it (I'm not a huge fan of moisturizers that are heavy with silicones, glycerin has long been my fave but I do appreciate that silicones do alright as a barrier). \n\nMy cysts have all healed up, my skin is looking glowier, and anytime I do something stupid (overexfoliate, try out a new product that makes me red, scrub my face too much, whatever) this $8 *Gold Bond* cream has saved me. (Note: I used CeraVe Cream for ages and while it moisturized beautifully sometimes it seemed to irritate my skin - I feel like the Gold Bond Cream is on par for moisture level but for me it's calming instead of irritating)\n\nI've been adding a couple products from The Ordinary into my routine that are notorious for pilling - with this moisturizer I found that rubbing may cause pilling but patting it in has resulted in zero pilling, even when I've layered several products on pretty thick. \n\n**Note:** ingredients are likely not up everyone's alleys, but if you're struggling to find an all-purpose moisturizer and don't necessarily have allergies or issues that you know of, give this a try.\n\n**Full ingredients list:** water, glycerin, dimethicone, petrolatum, propanediol, hydroxyehtyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, jojoba esters, cetyl alcohol, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, glyceryl stearate, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter extract, isohexadecane, avena sativa (oat) kernel extract, bisabolol, zingiber officinale (ginger) root extract, C10-30 cholesterol/lanosterol esters, ceramide 2, hydrolyzed jojoba esters, tocopheryl acetate, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, panthenol, ethylhexylglycerin, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, tribehenin, dipotassium EDTA, phenoxyethanol, PEG-10 rapeseed sterol, methylparaben, polysorbate 60, palmitoyl oligopeptide",

Just another thing to think about before purchasing the foundation, especially in the \"hydrating\" formula.\n\nHere are the ingredient lists from Tarte's site:\nporcelain, fair beige, light-medium sand, medium sand, medium-tan sand, mahogany, deep honey, chestnut Ingredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, dimethicone, glycerin, PEG/PPG-18/18 dimethicone, octyldodecyl neopentanoate, butylene glycol, SD alcohol 40-B (alcohol denat.), aluminum hydroxide, stearic acid, alcohol, acrylates crosspolymer, atelocollagen, caprylic/capric triglyceride, caprylyl glycol, dextrin palmitate, disodium EDTA, disteardimonium hectorite, ethyl menthane carboxamide, ethylhexylglycerin, glyceryl polyacrylate, glycosphingolipids, hexylene glycol, hordeum vulgare extract, hydrated silica, hydrolyzed corn starch, hydrolyzed corn starch octenylsuccinate, kaolin, lauryl laurate, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, menthyl lactate, methicone, methyl diisopropyl propionamide, mica, nylon-12, palmitic acid, pentaerythrityl tetraisostearate, pentylene glycol, phenoxyethanol, rosa canina fruit extract, silica dimethyl silylate, sodium chloride, sodium chondroitin sulfate, sodium dehydroacetate, sodium hyaluronate, sodium hyaluronate crosspolymer, triethoxycaprylylsilane, xanthan gum, zea mays (corn) starch.

I know some basic routine rules like water products before oils and, like toner > exfoliating acids > treatment > moisturizer > sunscreen > primer.\n\nI'm wondering how many products I can use and still have things be effective though, like when layering and such. I know Korean routines have like 10 steps, but that's extreme and I doubt things even do anything after that many layers. The Ordinary recommends \"3 serum formulations in a single regimen\" but do they mean treatments like Vitamin C or Retinoids, or 3 products max? What are your experiences?\n\nHere is what I have, in addition to my previous products:\n\n* 100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil\n* 100% Plant-Derived Squalane \n* Advanced Retinoid 2%\n* AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution\n* Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% \n* Azelaic Acid Suspension 10% \n* \"Buffet\" (will probably give this away as a gift though, probably should have bought 2 lol)\n* Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG\n* Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5\n* Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% \n* Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate 10% \n* Matrixyl 10% + HA (I give this to somebody but they may stop using it and give it to me)\n* Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA \n* Salicylic Acid 2% Solution\n* Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2%",

An example, my morning routine (designed for very oily, acne prone skin with ageing concerns as I turn 31 this year):\n\n\nAM: Cleanse with PC Skin Balancing Cleanser, apply PC Clear Regular Strength BHA, apply Clear Regular Strength BP treatment, apply PC Resist Skin Firming Line Minimizer (water based) to forehead and under eye area, mix 2-3 drops each of PC Resist Ultra Light Antioxidant serum & PC Resist 10% Niacinamide Booster and apply all over face. Apply PC Resist Anti-Ageing Eye Cream to under eye area. Apply PC Resist Super Light SPF all over face. Apply The Ordinary High Adherence Silicone Primer all over face, avoiding under eye area. \n\n\nPM: Remove makeup with Garnier Micellar Water (original formula, pink cap), cleanse with PC Skin Balancing Cleanser, apply PC Resist 10% AHA, apply The Ordinary Advanced Retinoid 2%, apply The Ordinary Vitamin C 23% Suspension, apply PC Resist Anti-Ageing Eye cream to under eye area, apply PC Resist Barrier Repair Moisturiser.\n\n\nMy AM routine addresses my acne concerns with a back seat to anti-ageing. All my serums are water based and thin in the AM, which is why I feel confident layering so many of them. My PM routine is focused on anti-ageing, and the formulas are slightly thicker so I use fewer of them. My skin is too oily to apply an oil to my face so I don't use one.\n\n\nIf you let me know your skin type and concerns, I would be happy to put your haul in order and explain which should come first, AM or PM and why. But there are so many you may not be able to use them all.",

It just got indicates a sequence...\n\nWhen applying things, most sink in pretty fast so there is no theoretical limit to how many you can layer on top of each other.\n\nAs long as you are following thin-to-thick, water based ones first and oil based ones second it should be fine.\n\nOf course, it also depends on ingredients and skin sensitivity...for me niacinamide with vitamin c has never caused a problem or flush or whatever so I happily layer things...I also layer AHA BHA and epiduo...that may not hold true for somebody else hence ymmv. Going all out takes a heck lot of time though and I vary my routine depending on the weather and how it is feeling.\n\nP.S. For me how many am going to layer depends on the time available...night at times I have layered on 2 acids, 1-2 toner, 3-4 watery serums, 2 emulsions, 1 facial oil, 1-3 creams of different thickness (plus blended with epiduo)...with rose water misting in between every layer.",

I'd say stick to using 3 serums for now - don't include cream or oil formulations in that number. I also wouldn't include in that number anything thats for a targeted area, e.g the Caffeine Solution is for around the eyes.\n\nSo, this would be how I personally would use the products listed (I have very dry skin, so obviously this could be slightly different for yourself).\n\n**AM:**\n\n* Cleanse\n\n* Acid toner\n\n* Hydrating toner\n\n* Salicylic Acid 2%\n\n* Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12%\n\n* Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5\n\n* Spritz toner\n\n* Caffeine Solution 5%\n\n* Rosehip Seed Oil\n\n* Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%\n\n* Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA\n\n* Sunscreen\n\n\n**PM:**\n\n* First cleanse\n\n* Second cleanse\n\n* Acid toner\n\n* Hydrating toner\n\n* Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2%\n\n* Buffet / Matrixyl 10% + HA\n\n* Hyaluronic Acid 2% + 5%\n\n* Spritz\n\n* Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate 10%\n\n* Squalane\n\n* Azelaic Acid Suspension 10% or Advanced Retinoid 2% (2 or 3 times a week)\n\n* Natural Moisturizing Factors with Vitamin C Suspension 23% mixed in\n\nAs you can see, both those regimes are more than a little OTT, but thats just how I would use all the products you listed (and to be fair, I can't really say anything with how my current regime is).\n\nI would only use the Peeling Solution once a week, and I would remove any other actives (including acid toners) apart from the Hyaluronic Acid.\n\nAnyway - sorry this post is so long, and I hope this has helped in some way; by no means do you **have** to use the routine above, its just a rough idea.\n\nOh, and patch test *everything*!",

I'm very verbose, sorry \\^\\^;;\n\n##Some background on me (Iz long, feel free to skip):\n\nI'm very new to AB (this is my first product, and I got it unintentionally!),  I've been lurking for a few months, but I'm not new to layering products for moisture. I've had severe eczema for 20+ years, since I was 4, and it's full body. My face actually only had eczema for a couple of years, and besides that has only been dry. The rest of my body has been bad enough that there have been times where I would *need* to apply 3 layers of stuff full body 3+ times a day [if you have any morbid curiousity, googling severe eczema yield images that describe what my body was like for years]. My eczema has been really good the past few years because the external factors that triggered it the most are under control/lessened, I've found a routine that does a good job for hydration/maintaining my skin, and my skin is getting stronger from staying decent and having minimal flare ups.\n\n\nMy routine for both my face and body right now is: Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream followed by [pure shea butter](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D7MB55C/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), once or twice a day. On the weakest/most damaged areas of skin I'll add CeraVe before the shea.  Sometimes I'll use a prescribed medicated ointment rather than shea butter, and if I'm out of shea butter I'll use vaseline. The third layer I used to use would always be a cream (always changed, but recently it's been CeraVe after I learned more about the skin barrier. I'd tried it before but tried to replace Cetaphil with it and found it worthless as a moisturizer for my body, but it works wonderfully on top of Cetaphil), but that's too heavy for me now. \n\n\nWhile the layers are good enough, I feel like my body would prefer a water-y layer  before hand, and western body lotions don't fit the role my skin wants. I came to this routine after lots of trial and error with western products and finding that while no single product worked great; the ones  mentioned were the best for my sensitivity, dryness, and healing, and more so when used together. My discovery of AB gives me hope I'll find a product that fits my skin's needs (I'm eyeing some of the Japanese lotions like Kikumasamune).\n\n##Product Info:\n\nAdvanced formula + skin Brightening Serum for Clear and Brighter Complexion with a Healthy Glow\n\n- Advanced melanin care brightening serum with a-Bisbolol, helping to even out dark spots, age spots and freckles.\n\n- Optimized fusion of kojic acid and stabilized vitamin C makes your skin clear and brighter with a healthy glow.\n\n- Fast-absorbing and intensive hydrating serum for all skin types, giving smoother texture and long-lasting moisture.\n\n- Synergistic effect on brightening skin complexion if used with DONGSUNG RANNCE CREAM.\n\n\n*Active Ingredients*:  a-Bisabolol, Kojic Acid, Hydrolyzed Placental Extract, Stabilized Vitamin C (Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate)\n\nThe product is watery in consistency, and the color is sort of milky. There wasn't a smell that I noticed, but I'm not known or my keen sense of smell.\n\n##Review:\n\nSo this is the first AB product I've tried, and first product that I've used that had any claims besides basic moisture. So I have no experience with other AB products, or serums at all.\n\n[images of Dong Sung Rannce C-Serum](https://imgur.com/a/tLDjK)\n\n\nBoth my mom and I used this product. While I only have dry and dehydrated skin (on my face anyway), my mother has dry, aged and damaged skin, with some really dark age spots on her cheeks. We've used it now for about 1.5 months, and used it as the first layer before using our regular routine. My mom uses whatever random moisturizer she's using that month and shea butter on top.\n\n\nI really love it. My skin feels more hydrated, and stays that way all day long. It feels like my skin's thirst is quenched, if you will. I also noticed that my skin looks brighter and more glowy (dewy?). \n\n\nMy mother's noticed the same things, and her dark spots are less pronounced than they used to be.\n\n\nWe both really like it and are considering purchasing it despite its price ($45) and our cheap ass-ness. My friend said she found it in the K-Beauty section at her local H-Mart. My mom especially wants to purchase it because she was working 60-70hrs for the majority of her life as a single mom, and skincare wasn't even a consideration. Now she has the time and energy, but the damage has been done (yes, she uses sunscreen and stuff now, but she didn't know about this stuff when it would've been a preventative step).\n\n\n**TL;DR** Iz good. Yay hydration. Yay brightening and evening of skin tone.\n",

    "body": "Good Skin Days - C’s The Day Serum\n\nIt feels like just a few days ago when I was sitting in on a Zoom call hosted by Charlotte Cho...where she revealed/announced the Good Skin Days line. \n\nI was so happy and excited for her and this next step in the Soko Glam journey. Needless to say, I picked up the three initial product launches as soon as I could and got my hands on the fourth (the Prime Time Cleansing Toner) last week.\n\nBut, I’ll save my thoughts on the new line as a whole for the full brand review. Right now I want to focus on one product (the first that I’ve incorporated into my routine)...the C’s The Day Serum.\n\nWhen Charlotte first brought this serum up during her presentation I thought “Wait, you already have a vitamin c serum...and it’s one of my favorites!” The Cosrx Triple C Lightning Liquid was one of the very first K-Beauty products I purchased and it was the one that kind of sold me on vitamin c.\n\nThat product contained a powerful concentration of L-Ascorbic Acid that, for the first time, really started to fade my hyperpigmentation and acne scars. Issues I had been dealing with for literal decades finally started to show improvement and I was hooked. At that point, Soko Glam and Charlotte Cho could do no wrong in my eyes (I guess that is still the case LOL)!\n\nNow that the Triple C Lightning Liquid has been discontinued (which hurts my heart but I understand given some of the stability and storing issues) we have this new serum to take its place...to a certain extent. Let’s dive in.\n\nThe C’s The Day Serum is a lightweight/fluid product featuring 10% Ascorbic Acid, Camu Camu Fruit Extract (for added vitamin c power), Licorice Root Extract, Niacinamide, Japanese Goldthread Extract, Ginseng Berry Extract, Hibiscus Flower Extract, and Cocoa Extract.\n\nThis blend of ingredients claims to not only provide the brightening/antioxidant boost of vitamin c but the other extracts heighten the antioxidant abilities even more. These ingredients can be great to fight against free radicals and block potential damage from sun exposure (not in a sunscreen protection manner however).\n\nI love the clean/simplistic packaging and printed testimonials on the boxes. I’ll cover packaging and marketing in the brand review but let’s just say I’m left feeling impressed by Good Skin Days in an aesthetic and “purpose” perspective.\n\nThe actual serum comes out in a dropper format and applies/smoothes onto the skin really easily. It’s not quite as fluid as the Cosrx Lightening Liquid meaning you have a few seconds of “play” before the product drips off of the face. However, I found it to be easier to just apply a few drops to my hands...and then pat the product into my skin.\n\nIt had been quite some time since I had a vitamin c product in my routine...so I did experience some slight tingling on my skin. This was a bit more intense on areas that I shave (jawline and cheeks). But, after a few uses (I use this every AM) this effect totally went away and the C’s The Day Serum was just as comfortable as any other serum in my routine.\n\nOne of the things I really appreciated about this formula was the lack of tackiness or sticky feeling after application. This was something I had come to accept with concentrated vitamin c serums but this one was much more comfortable/approachable. I’ve never found it to be a real issue as I am usually applying several “steps” over my vitamin c...but those that dislike the feeling have little to worry about here.\n\nAfter the first week or so of use I really noticed an improvement in overall skin brightness and tone-evening. While this serum wasn’t quite as potent as to really diminish specific acne marks...it did a really nice job with general “maintenance mode” brightening. I’d have to say this is probably the biggest difference between it and the Triple C Lightning Liquid.\n\nThose that are hoping to find a direct replacement to that classic vitamin c serum from Cosrx...I really don’t think this is it. Don't get me wrong, I really like the C’s The Day Serum. But, it just doesn't have that super high concentration (and the volatility that comes with it) to really get in there and lighten the darkest of hyperpigmentation. \n\nFor me, the C’s The Day Serum is something that is more geared towards those just starting with vitamin c or who have previously experienced sensitivity to the ingredient. It does the job of moderate/overall brightening really well...but would point to the By Wishtrend Vitamin C 21.5% Advanced Serum as a more direct replacement for the Cosrx Triple C Lightning Liquid. That one is much more “intense” and suited for spot treatment use.\n\nBut, what is lost in regards to potency over the Cosrx product is made up for by how easy it is to “care” for this vitamin c. No refrigeration, no clogged pipettes, no off color (at least in the month that I’ve had mine open) are to be seen here. This is a really well formulated and stabilized vitamin c in my opinion that once again lends itself to a wider customer base (aka people like me that dont want the hassle).\n\nI wouldn’t be providing a proper comparison without mentioning my all-time favorite vitamin c serum...the Glow Recipe Pineapple-C Bright Serum. That product uses a blend of Ascorbic Acid alongside Pineapple Fruit Extract and Lactic Acid to not only brighten the skin long-term...but also give an immediate “glow”. I love the versatility and instant results of that product so, so much. \n\nThe C’s The Day Serum offers similar results over time but is missing that instant “hit” of brightening and glow. But, coming in at nearly half the cost...it is a fine and affordable option that I think so many people are going to fall in love with (I certainly have)!\n\nThis is a total win from the Good Skin Days line and one that is worth picking up if you are in the market for a nice, easy to get along with, easy to care for, relatively affordable, and effective vitamin c serum. I can’t wait to get the rest of the line into my routine!\n\nFull Ingredients List: Aqua (Water, Eau), Butylene Glycol, Ascorbic Acid, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Bicarbonate, Myrciaria Dubia Fruit Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Niacinamide, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Arbutin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Coptis Japonica Extract, Panax Ginseng Berry Extract, Crocus Sativus Flower Extract, Tuber Magnatum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Glycereth-25 PCA Isostearate, Hydroxydecyl Ubiquinone, Sodium Metabisulfite, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Dextrin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Hydrogenated Lecithin\n\nWhere To Buy ($26.00 USD on Soko Glam): https://sokoglam.com/products/good-skin-days-cs-the-day-serum\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1nr2age9kue51.jpg?width=3524&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ace06607c81b775d90d641e684200f1ddc1681ed",

Then went to their site and was AMAZED at the price. No fragrance added, or essential oils and extra crap like that. Just really bare-bones. MAP, or with other anti aging actives if you want them, and hyaluronic acid and water or something.\n\nIs the MAP concentration at an effective %? I want to buy the biggest size (8 oz) of the matrixyl 3000 + vitamin c serum and use it all over my face and body but wanted to check with SCA first. \n\nEdit: Does anyone know what \"20% (2% solution) Vitamin C (Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate)\" in the ingredient list mean? Does that mean it's 20% MAP or 2% MAP??? I'm so confused.\n\nEdit 2: Okay, they emailed me back again and said it means 2% MAP! That's a teeny bit low for me (I think optimal MAP serums use 3.5% right? And 5.5% MAP = 20% L-AA, simplisticly speaking.) But it seems really gentle for ultra sensitive skinned folks and i'm gonna buy it cuz i'm cheap, til I earn enough money to afford a regular l-aa serum.\n\nEDIT 3:  Erm,,,, so.. I'm not sure if i [mathed right](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4t31rl/anyone_know_about_or_have_tried_asterwood/d5k93sp), but if I did, then there are extremely small amounts of vitamin c and hylauronic acid in this serum.. It's like you're paying for water and preservatives.. Please correct me if I am wrong, but if it's true, dun't buy",

Even if not as a serum, add it as a moisturiser. The ponds super light gel is great as it has niacinamide, hyaluronic acid and vitamin e. Use it on damp skin for deep hydration. This would be your AM moisturiser and let it dry for a minute before using primer. \n\nFor PM, either use a ceramide serum or moisturiser to protect your skin barrier. This will ensure good hydration in your skin and make it more manageable. \n\nAs oily skin can be oily due to lack of moisture (mine was) using these would help it become more normal. \n\nComing to makeup, try a better primer. I swear by smashbox but I only use it for occasions. My everyday primer is actually my sunscreen. I use reequil blue with maybelline fit me loose powder and it lasts amazing all day. \n\nMaybe try reequil blue sunscreen (ultramatte dry touch), skip primer and use only setting powder all over face. Skip setting spray too as the oils from your face will interact with the powder and make it more skin like. I have not used the kay powder so cannot comment about performance. Also, let the sunscreen be for 5 mins before you apply any product on top. It will help with the film forming process and absorption. I have seen much better results this way. \n\nIf you have any specific questions, please do ask. I used to have very oily skin and not it’s normal to combination so I can understand your situation.",

        "body": "Hi OP. I have a few questions. \n\n1- how old are you? Did a derm prescribe you tret or you started it on your own? Tret can be extremely irritating and drying so that can really affect your make up and skin condition. It can start purging around the 3-4 month (90-120 days) mark and that's what may be happening with you. \n\nAlso, tea tree oil in any form is extremely drying. I use a spray and then top up with untreated shae butter on damp skin and even then I feel the dryness. So combining two extremely drying and possibly irritating ingredients may not be the best course. I don't recommend tea tree oil while using tret instead opt for a 2% salicylic acid treatment (serum) once a week only. It's much more gentle on the skin. \n\nAlso, always apply tret or even retinol using sandwich method - moisturizer - tret - moisturizer or use any barrier repair cream or simply Vaseline around your eye,corners of nose and corners of mouth before going in with tret to avoid any irritation.\n\n2- you have mentioned a bunch of products but haven't mentioned the base product you use. Most foundations oxidise, same for your bb and cc creams and some can take over an hour to oxidise. So if you notice your makeup looking not your shade or too grey, more often than not it's the incorrect shade of your base product/foundation. Swatch a bunch of shades closer to your skintone onto your face and neck, blend them a bit and let them oxidise for a 2-3 hours before you decide what shade(s) suit the best to your skintone. This is one way to eliminate the graying of base make up and choosing a tone that will work for you. Go for mini samples one or two times lighter than your skin tone so that post oxidation you get your perfect match.",

        "body": "I have quite different advice than everyone else. It’s based on the work of Paula Belgoun and Wayne Goss.\n\n1) your skin’s oiliness is natural moisturizer. Use sunscreen, but more other than that, the more silicone/dimethicone on the skin, the more quickly your makeup will melt.\n\n2) after sunscreen, dust your face with a tiny bit of banana powder. Then foundation. This will absorb oil and prevent oxidation.\n\n3) if #2 doesn’t work, you’re going to have to do as others suggested and wait 2-3 before making a decision on shade matching foundation.\n\n4) do use a bha soliton and benzoyl peroxide for oil control and acne.\n\nSo my morning routine is bha, benzoyl peroxide—let dry—then sunscreen—let dry—then banana powder, foundation, etc.\n\nI hope this helps!",

I have started following a skincare routine 11 days ago. It was a joyous Thursday for my face that, over the course of past 30 years, has been exposed to the winds, low temperatures, a late onslaught of chicken pox, persistent hormonal acne, and results of a poor diet. I also happen to have PCOS, which makes the challenge to have clear skin extra challenging.\n\nThis is our starting point. After reading through [the Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index) on r/SkincareAddiction, I had come up with the following routine to improve the condition of my skin:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# ROUTINE\n\n**MORNING**\n\n* Cleanser \\(Step I\\): **Bioderma Sensibio H2O micellar water** \\(applied with a cotton pad\\)\n   * *Ingredients:* Water, PEG\\-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Propylene Glycol, Cucumis Sativus \\(Cucumber\\) Fruit Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Disodium EDTA, Cetrimonium Bromide.\n* *Moisturiser \\(Step I\\):* **Lumene Hydration Recovery Oxygenation** **gel** **mask**\n   * *Ingredients:* Water, Propanediol, Betula Alba \\(Birch\\) Juice, Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth\\-20, Phenoxyethanol, Rubus Chamaemorus \\(Cloudberry\\) Seed Extract, Acrylates/c10\\-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Peg\\-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Trehalose, Urea, Eriophorum Spissum Flower/Stem Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium Edta, Copper Gluconate, Magnesium Aspartate, Zinc Gluconate, Pentylene Glycol, Serine, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Algin, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium Phosphate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Pullulan, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sorbic Acid, Potassium Phosphate, Linalool, Benzyl Salicylate, Alpha\\-Isomethyl Ionone, Limonene, Citronellol, Parfum \\(Fragrance\\), \\(Ci 42090\\) Blue 1, \\(Ci 60730\\) Ext.

Other concerns include enlarged pores, rosacea in the nose area, closed comedones, and a selection of pimples.\n\nI have come to the conclusion that my face must be as dehydrated as Gobi desert out of rain season, and so my first action was to moisturise, moisturise, moisturise! At the same time, I wanted to include products meant for sensitive skin, to decrease the risk of a breakout or adverse reaction. I also tend to avoid perfumed skincare, and that was another factor when I was picking the jars and bottles.\n\nAny critique of my routine would be most welcome! Do these products work together? Is there something crucial missing? \\(I am planning on incorporating exfoliation and sunscreen next. Also, please, don't panic — I have not seen the sun in months. Years. Or so it feels.\\) Is there something I should stop using? Am I truly a happy victim of clever marketing and a corporate\\-friendly whore? \\(You betcha.\\)\n\nSo far, the result has been a more even \\(texture, not colour\\) skin with smaller pores, but, of course, this is early days.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# QUESTION\n\nA crucial point of my morning routine, and not something normally suggested for beginners, is a mask. I apply it just before I sit down to meditate. It makes sense that, while I imagine 'a steady stream of liquid sunlight' pouring through my body, I am also using that time to take care of my skin. I have found that one action triggers the other and, altogether, that is a very happy combination.\n\nI have been using the Lumene Hydration Recovery mask for the past few days, and I want to hear your suggestions for alternatives. While I did not dislike that mask, I did not feel like it was doing much for me either. Plus, it was a gift from Finland and I am in Britain, and that does not work very easily. Lastly, I would like to try a number of masks \\(and continue to discover new awesome products\\), rather than settle on a single 'meh' option.\n\nCan you help me find the mask\\(s\\)? To sum it up, I'm looking for a mask that...\n\n* Has a 10\\-15 minute application period\n* Comes in a tube or a jar \\(i.e. not a sheet mask\\)\n* Is suitable for frequent use\n* Fits my routine \\(see above\\)\n\nSuggestions of mask combinations \\(alternating masks\\) are also welcome!",

        "body": "Maskholic here, checking in. \n\nI usually do a mask everyday, it’s my favorite part of my routine. My love for masks makes me always be on the lookout for a new one and I’ve tried many out there. \n\nI’m not really a fan of sheet masks, or I haven’t tried any that has impressed me so I won’t mention those. They feel nice and are relaxing, but that’s about it. \n\nI really love Freeman’s Apple Cider Vinegar Clay mask. You can use it as a cleanser scrub or use it as a mask, I’ve only used it as a mask. I think it can be used about 2-3 times per week, so it can be used to alternate with other masks. What I like: it’s inexpensive, makes my skin feel extra soft and clean, my skin tone looks brighter even after just one use. \n\nI got this face mask kit from [Fresh at Sephora] (https://m.sephora.com/product/picture-perfect-mask-set-P424612?SKUID=1998459&om_mmc=ppc-GG_1165716881_53825939660_pla-420369839425_1998459_257731947998_9007386_m&country_switch=us&lang=en&gclid=CKnR1YzD3toCFYPIswodzf8JcQ&gclsrc=ds) and I absolutely love every mask that comes in it. \n\nThe Umbrian Clay Mask I find really improves the appearance of pores, blackheads/white heads. It feels good and relaxing to have it on. It says to use for up to 5 minutes, but I always start doing stuff and end up using it for longer. I find this mask is nice to use as a “premask” for the Rose or Black Tea mask. I only do this about once a week, when I’m feeling fancy. \n\nThe Rose mask feels like heaven on your skin. It has this nice cooling feeling and I find it to be very hydrating, and it makes my skin look supple and radiant. \n\nThe Black Tea mask says to use 2-3 times per week. It tingles very intensely for the first minute, but after that it feels fine.  I find this mask seems to even the texture of my skin somewhat (I’ve only used it once so far). \n\nI’ve also tried FAB Ginger Turmeric Jelly Mask. I like this one better as I love the cooling jelly on my skin. I find that it gives my skin a nice radiant glow. You can use it up to 3 times per week. I tried FAB’s bouncy mask too (a sample) and I wouldn’t buy it because I didn’t see any difference and it didn’t feel as good as the other masks I love. \n\nClinique Pep Start Bubble Mask. This is a fun mask to use in the morning as you don’t have to leave it on for long. I like the bubbling effect, it makes my skin feel extra clean and revitalized. I’ve only used this 2 times in some samples I got. \n\nBoscia Luminizing black masks. I really love this one as I find it to be very clarifying, and helps with the appearance of pores. I love peeling it off, it’s so fun and i feel like it takes so much with it. \n\nI have a few others in my cabinet that I haven’t tried yet, but I’ll report back when I do.",

I'm looking for whichever one can absorb fairly well for daytime use, possibly even have a matte finish? I like that the Ceramidin Cream has cholesterol, something I've been meaning to try ever since I read that's part of the moisture barrier and can help go towards repairing it. On the other hand, [this review](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/6ycpsa/review_dr_jart_cicapair_tiger_grass_cream/) almost sold me on the Cicapair Tiger Grass Cream by itself, since it seems to help more with calming the skin. I'm hoping someone here has tried both and can give me an idea of how they compare-- their characteristics; how they go on and if you felt either one helped whatever skin type you have.\n\nMy skin is dehydrated and red due to chronic inflammation. I feel like I have a lot of hydration, but within hours, my skin feels dry and tight. I work a regular 9-5 Mon-Fri in extremely dry air (as in-- I brought some succulents and they dried up within a week!), and unfortunately I'm unable to get a humidifier for my desk because of regulations (I work in a lab). My routine:\n\n* CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser\n\n* Hylamide Hyrdra-Density Mist\n\n* Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5\n\n* Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%\n\n* Kiehl's Hydro-Plumping Re-Texturizing Serum Concentrate\n\n* Azelaic Acid 10%\n\n* CeraVe Moisturizing Cream\n\n(PM only-- CeraVe Healing Ointment)\n\n(AM only-- TO NMF+HA with Squalane, CeraVe SPF if I'm going to be out a lot)\n\n\nAdditionally, I also alternate between:\n\n* Day 1 PM - Lactic Acid 10% (after cleansing)\n\n* Day 2 AM - Granactive Retinoid 2% in Squalane (instead of plain Squalane)\n\n* Day 3 PM - Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate 10% mixed with Resveratrol + Ferulic Acid (before AzA)\n\n* Day 4 - nothing extra\n\n\nThank you!!! :)",

I have large pores and the product absorbed well into my skin except for on my nose, each pore filled up with the clay colored cream and so I had noticeable clay colored “dots” all over my nose. I hope that makes sense- it was really weird. \nI also have the Ceramidin Cream in the tube.  I like it well enough, not sure yet if I would repurchase.

The Ceramidin cream is a really nice moisturiser, I don't find it as thick as the poster above though, strictly day time for me as it sinks in nicely and not heavy enough for night. Maybe I'm just skimping to make it last longer! I didn't like the Tiger Grass colour corrector as it was waaay too orange for me.

I have PCOS which complicates things a bit.\n- oily skin\n- sensitive/inflamed/red skin\n- mainly blackheads and tons of sebaceous filaments\n- ingrown facial hair, causing pimples, and damage from hair removal (this is really the biggest problem)\n- broken capillaries\n\nI've picked a few The Ordinary products as they​ are affordable.\nUsually I wash my face with water, or if it's dirty or covered in make up I use a L'Occitane oil cleanser. I tone with either a Simple toner or a L'occitane angelica toner.\n\nI got niaciamide for spots and general skin condition. Magnesium ascorbyl phosphate for vitamin c. Azelaic acid for redness and to help ingrown hairs come out. I've just started using the niacinamide twice a day, followed by vitamin c (a.m.) or the acid (p.m.).\nThe texture of my skin feels nice but it also feels really hot/red. Is this normal? I did patch test each product and got no reaction.\nAlso the acid says to use sunscreen if it's being used in the daytime, but I'm only using it at night, so am I safe?\nIs there anything I can do about broken capillaries, or at least to prevent new ones?\nI work outdoors and there's no way I could apply and reapply enough sunscreen every day.\n\nAny thoughts appreciated, thanks.",

Maybe start with the niacinamide for a while and see how that goes, make sure it doesn't irritate your skin, then add the azelaic acid a few times per week and work up to every day. You should still try to find a sunscreen that works for you, your skin will be more exfoliated from the acid and more sensitive to the sun.",

I used it once in the morning and once at night.\n\n\nNow, I have relatively sensitive, yet strange skin. Tea tree oil makes me itch, but I can tolerate retin-a and aha almost daily. Certain lotions and washes make me break out as well. I have extremely mild acne that is influenced a lot by the environment (water especially.) I typically only need a gentle wash containing either SA or BP, some light moisturizer, and some jojoba oil to dislodge any clogged pores and I'm golden. AHA and tea tree oil for spot treatments helps me out as well.\n\n\nI desperately wanted to like this wash. I really enjoyed it for the first month, and it did keep everything on my face relatively neutral. No extreme breakouts or anything. Unfortunately, it didn't do much for any of the closed comedones that the cerave PM moisturizer gave me, or even just regular pimples I had before I started using it.\n\n\nIt also seemed to inhibit the clearing/fading of dark marks. I'm not sure, but it seems to have actually made them worse. I had popped a medium-ish pimple about a month and a half ago, in early july. It was on my cheek and left a decent sized dark mark. I had just gotten this face wash around that time. Now, normally my dark marks fade really quickly, lasting only a week or two at the most. I use AHA on them and that really seems to help. This time around, nothing was helping. It seemed to spread and get bigger too, if you can believe that. Once one portion of it decided to go away, the other part would get bigger. So strange. Anyways, I switched to a different cleanser, and the mark that had started out at less than the size of a watch battery, but that had progressed to 3 or 4 spots about the size of half of a dime each, is finally going away. The wash also made my skin look faintly red in spots, something I had never noticed with any other wash. After I'd wash and dry off, my cheeks, skin to this side of my eyes, forehead, and neck would look flushed in spots. My face didn't feel irritated at all, but I'm so glad I switched, because the redness doesn't happen anymore. It didn't hurt, sting, or itch, and it even went away after about half an hour, but it was a bit unsightly right after I washed my face. \n\n\nI have no idea what was in that cleanser that made my skin behave so strangely, but I'm just issuing a heads-up to this sub. Don't be afraid to change something if it isn't working!\n\n\n4/10 cleanser, would not bang.",

I love the Ordinary and have nearly all the products you just ordered :) Secondly, my advice would be to add in each product one at a time, just so you can see exactly which ones work for you.

Lactic acid (I use it everyday, but if you haven't used AHAs before or if this is quite a bit stronger than others you have used, I would say do it every other day or even just twice a week until you get used to it)\n\n4. Toner\n\n5. Niacinamide\n\n6. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (I have the Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate, and I don't know how similar the two are, but I cannot stand the smell of this stuff. It smells like gasoline. BUT I find with layering liquids over Niacinamide, it helps to pat and not rub them in)\n\n7. Hyaluronic acid\n\n8. Moisturiser\n\n\nThats just an example though, I know some people like using Hyaluronic Acid early in their routine, but I would definitely at least use it after your toner. In the AM I would just go with cleanse, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate (depending on how well it absorbs), moisturiser then sunscreen. Its all very flexible of course, but I always like at least using my vit c treatments at least in the morning, because they do provide some uv protection. It really is a YMMV thing though, see what works and doesn't, and go from there. E.g. I really only incorporate my niacinamide when I am recovering from a hormonal breakout, because it helps with my scarring. Hope this helps!\n\nEdit: you could probably flip the lactic acid and toner stages if you wanted as well, I'm not 100% on what would work best as I normally use a spritz after my exfoliator and don't use toner at all :)",

I now use the following routine(s):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**AM:**\n\nCetaphil wash w/o water (really dry skin + Michigan winters = sad, dry skin)\n\nTO Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA (3x a week, never more than that)\n\nCeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion\n\nCeraVe Eye Repair Cream\n\nsometimes I'll throw on another moisturizer to layer if my skin is particularly dry that day\n\nTO Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate 10%\n\nMake-up\n\n**PM:** (I have a couple of variations)\n\nCeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser\n\nremove any remaining eye make-up with coconut oil or olive oil or whatever oil I have on hand (make-up removers burn my skin)\n\nTO Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA (3x a week)\n\n*OR*\n\nTO Granactive Retinoid 5% in Squalan (no more than 2x a week)\n\nTO Mandelic Acid 10% + HA (NOT on evenings when I use the Retinoid...not reason for this other than I'm a creature of habit and I didn't do it the first time so I stuck with it)\n\nCeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion\n\nsometimes an extra Moisturizer if it's been a particularly cold day and my skin is extra dry (currently I turn to my Drunk Elephant sample and I dont' know which one it is...white tub with a green lid)\n\nTO 100% Organic Cold Pressed Moroccan Argan Oil (everynight - this stuff is amazing)\n\nSo my questions are the following:\n\n**1)** What should i replace my retinoid with?\n\n**2)** Are there any other products I need to eliminate?\n\n**3)** For any potential pregnany mask problems or the expected stretch marks, what do you all recommend I use as a preventative? I didn't get much for my first two, but I'm older now and it's my 3rd so I'm not going to place any bets on that trend continuing.\n\n**4)** Any recs on products you really loved during your ever changing skin during pregnancy and beyond?\n\nTL/DR: I'm pregnant with my 3rd, HALP!\n\nThank you!",

        "body": "It’s so annoying that they discontinued it. I let the company know several times that it’s the only spf I can use and how grateful I was that it existed and to please not change the ingredients. I’ve recommended Paula’s Choice to so many people… I still have a bit left but have no idea what I’m going to do when it runs out - I burn really easily and the dermatologist said I can’t go out without spf because it will make my skin problems even worse. It took a lot of experimentation and wasted money before I found the old version Calm spf. Even the hospital-prescribed “sensitive skin” spf felt like I had put burning hot oil on my face and I had to remove it straight away. I explained to PC that every time I have a bad reaction it makes my skin more sensitive so it’s really difficult to try a new spf knowing that it will almost definitely set off a painful inflammatory reaction and make my skin permanently worse. The thing is for those of us who have really intolerant skin, we don’t have the choice to easily switch brands. Some people didn’t like how it looked on their skin - I’m not bothered about this - it’s a medical necessity for me to wear spf if I want to go out - but actually it looked fine. I was holed up in my house for months before I found the old calm spf. It’s so upsetting that the company ignored feedback. The new formulation has had terrible reviews and a lot of their existing customers have stopped buying from them. I wish they would just bring the old formulation back. It’s comforting to know I’m not alone in this.",

I have some lines around my eyes and a fairly deep horizontal line in the center of my forehead, and my skin isn't as even looking as it used to be, especially in my cheeks and chin area - I have a lot of redness and irregularities in tone. Also of note, I am currently breastfeeding and plan to continue for at least another year, possibly longer or until I’m pregnant again, so retinoids are not an option for me right now. \n\nCurrent routine:\n\nAM\n\n* Rinse with water / occasionally wash with dove sensitive skin bar soap in the shower\n* Cerave moisturizing cream \\*I switch to the lotion during summer months\n* Biore watery gel SPF 50\n\nPM\n\n* Cerave SA Renewing cleanser (don’t love this, will likely go back to the foaming facial cleanser once it’s out)\n* Alpha Intensive Renewal Serum 14% glycolic AHA \n* Cerave moisturizing cream \\*I switch to the lotion during summer months\n\nI was recommended to try these products by users here:\n\n* Niacinamide (considering the Ordinary’s [Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%](https://theordinary.com/product/rdn-niacinamide-10pct-zinc-1pct-30ml) )\n* azelaic acid (considering the Ordinary’s [Azelaic Acid Suspension 10%](https://theordinary.com/product/rdn-azelaic-acid-suspension-10pct-30ml) )\n\nand I was recommended to try these products when I inquired about an anti-aging routine with retinoid alternatives through the Ordinary:\n\n* [100% Organic Cold Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil](https://theordinary.com/product/rdn-100pct-organic-cold-pressed-rose-hip-seed-oil-30ml)\n* [Buffet](https://theordinary.com/product/rdn-buffet-30ml)\n* [Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate 10%](https://theordinary.com/product/rdn-magnesium-ascorbyl-phosphate-10pct-30ml)\n\nI am planning to order them all, but will incorporate one at a time, after patch testing, and allowing time for my skin to adjust to each product. \n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Are any of these products redundant?\n2. Which order would best to incorporate, given my main skin care concern?\n3. Of these products, are there certain ones that should be applied am/pm, or both?\n4. Once I’ve worked up to using all the products, what order should I be applying them? Are there some that should not be used together, or on the same day/nights?\n5. re: the Alpha AHA - I've used this for years but don't really feel like it's doing anything for me anymore. Would it be a good idea to stop using it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

It can be used in conjunction with MAP 10% since I believe MAP 10% does      not contain L-Ascorbic Acid. Niacinamide & L-Ascorbic acid shouldn’t be used at the same time so if you ever switch to a vit c product that contains LAA then use vit C in the morning and niacinamide at night. \n* If the horizontal line across your forehead bugs you enough then possibly look into Botox after breastfeeding      because that’s the only way to get rid of the line. No cream/serum/acid is as effective as Botox in terms of getting rid of an established wrinkle. Retinol is an option but you also have to put up with skin   sensitivity/peeling/redness/purging that lasts for weeks-months whereas Botox for 1 wrinkle/region can be done for a decent price.",

        "body": "This is the routine I gave my breastfeeding sister...\n\nAM routine (exfoliation and moisture balance)\n\n* A hydrating cleanser to remove sweat and impurities from the pillow, etc through the night\n* Ascorbic acid like the Timeless Vitamin C\n* AHA - there's many different types to choose from based on your skin tolerance.  I highly recommend keeping AHA in your routine as it helps with anti-aging and removing dead skin cells to reveal a glowy complexion\n* BHA - add if you need help with pores or acne\n* I usually apply a hydrating serum after the acids... I look for hyaluronic acid, niacinimide, fermented ingredients, and peptides.  Maybe some caffeine around the eyes if they appear puffy that morning.  If using hyaluronic acid, spritz some extra water/rose spray if you are in a dry climate.\n* Immediately apply a heavy moisturizer to lock all the moisture and goodies in. Alternatively if you have time, you can use a face mask on top and wait for all of the water soluble ingredients to penetrate.  If my face needs extra moisture I use, La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5 Multi-Purpose Balm.  Otherwise, Olay regenerist does just fine (it has niacinimide and peptides to boot!)\n* Add mineral SPF\n* If your skin is on the dry side, you may add some squalene or facial oil on top.\n\nPM routine (oil balance)\n\nMy PM routine involves retinoids, peptides and oil... But since you cannot use that, try to use growth factors, peptides, and acids (as much as your skin tolerates) from a water (first) to oil (last) consistency.  If you have issues with facial movement and wrinkes, consider ingredients that mimic botox like bee venom, etc.  Check out the personalized product finder on [truthinaging.com](https://truthinaging.com).  \n\n&#x200B;",

I'm not getting enough sleep, and my skin is just looking dull. I've also been breaking out on my forehead more lately, and occasionally on my cheeks. The photos do not show the sebaceous filaments, but they're there!\n\nDECIEM PRODUCTS YOU ARE CURRENTLY USING: none\n\nSKIN ALLERGIES / INTOLERANCES: none\n\nWHICH BRANDS ARE YOU INTERESTED IN?: The Ordinary\n\nOTHER: I typically use CVS brand witch hazel as a toner, and I've been using Botanics Softening Cleanser, as well as Botanics 100% Nourishing Facial Oil. For moisturizer, I typically use whatever is on hand because I've acquired a lot of samples. But I usually reach for something like Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion\n\nI sent 3 pictures of my bare face as well, and this was their suggested routine:\n\n\n\nAM\n**The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5**\n*A multi-depth hydration support serum that contains 3 hyaluronic acid complexes at multiple molecular weights and Vitamin B5.*\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n*A high-strength vitamin and mineral formula that visibly targets the look of blemishes and signs of congestion. Niacinamide has also been shown to have a visible brightening effect. *\n\n*If topical Vitamin C is used as part of skincare, it should be applied at alternate times with Niacinamide (ideally Vitamin C in the PM and Niacinamide in the AM). Otherwise, Niacinamide can affect the integrity of pure-form Vitamin C (L-Ascorbic Acid) and Ethylated Ascorbic Acid.*\n\n**The Ordinary Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate 10%**\n*A brightening and hydrating cream formula with stabilized Vitamin C derivative to visibly target uneven tone, dullness and signs of ageing. *\n\n**The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA**\n*A cream formula that offers non-greasy surface hydration that acts as a direct topical supplement of impaired NMF components; NMF are elements that keep the outer layer of the skin protected and well-hydrated.*\n\nPM\n**The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n**The Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension 10%**\n*A multifunctional brightening formula that visibly targets uneven tone, textural irregularities and the look of blemishes.* \n\nSo I did do some reading on each product, but can anyone tell me from experience if any of these products will be effective in regards to the sebaceous filaments? \n\nAnd if you’ve emailed them and followed through with their suggested routine, how has it worked out for you?\n",

        "body": "That's a lot of actives/acids. You posted several products that were the same kind of active as well. Here is everything you listed:\n\n* Glycolic Acid toner (AHA 1)\n* Lactic Acid (AHA 2)\n* AHA 30% Peel (AHA 3)\n* Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate Solution 20% in Vitamin F (Vitamin C 1)\n* Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate 10% (Vitamin C 2)\n* Azelaic Acid Suspension\n* Retinol 1% in Squalane\n* Salicylic acid 2% solution\n\nYou do not need three AHA products and two Vitamin C products. You definitely do not need to be using 5 actives all at the same time. A dozen actives does not a routine make.\n\nFor hyperpigmentation and scarring from acne, this is more what you should be looking at\n\n* First Cleanser (PM): Micellar water or an oil cleanser/balm. It's to remove sunscreen\n* Second Cleanser: Face wash\n* Vitamin C (AM): Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate Solution 20%. If you're searching an alternative here are some others\n   * Klairs Vitamin Drop\n   * COSRX Triple C Lightning\n   * Timeless\n   * Murad\n* Niacinamide serum\n* Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA\n* Retinol (PM): Do NOT start with 1%. You always start low. When being prescribed Retinol doctors will start you at 0.025% strength. Start with Retinol 0.2% in Squalane OR Granactive Retinoid 5% in Squalane. The Granactive Retinoid is a less irritating derivative but still incredibly effective.\n* Moisturizer: I think you're going to need a heavier moisturizer :-/ Get one with a lot of ceramides. Here's a couple\n   * Zeroid oint cream\n   * COSRX Honey Ceramide\n   * Cerave PM (can be used AM and PM ignore the name)\n* Sunscreen (AM): You need to wear sunscreen while using actives. This also keeps scarring from getting darker.\n* AHA 30% Peeling solution (PM) This is really strong. Use this once a week or every other week and do not use any other actives/acids the same day you use it.\n\nWhen starting actives for the first time do not use them all at once. Use one every other day for a week before you add the next. Give your skin an off day 1-2x a week. Wear sunscreen.\n\nYes, it is okay to spray water over Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate Solution 20% in Vitamin F and Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%. As long as the Ascorbyl has soaked in for a minute or two. No, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate 10% and Azelaic Acid Suspension 10% are not moisturizers. But, Azelaic acid contains silicone so it might work better by putting it after the moisturizer.\n\nMy HGs\n\n* COSRX Snail Mucin essence - really great for hydration, soothing, and healing\n* Squalane or Marula oil mixed with face moisturizer adds nourishment and hydration/moisture",

I was doing fantastic with my Timeless vitamin c serum (oh god I look like A TOTAL HAG without it T-T I'm sorry I took you for granted, baby!!), but unfortunately ran into some life crap and can't afford to pay for one every month and a half or whatever. So I went looking for cheaper alternatives while I wait til I can afford Timeless again or afford DIY stuff.\n\nAs long as I have lurked, I don't understand how exactly to submit a link post with a description so.. \n****************************\nHere is the link to the site:\nhttp://www.asterwoodnaturals.com/#!vitamin-c/aoup8\n\nI found them while looking for vitamin c serums on amazon.. Then went to their site and was AMAZED at the price. AND THE FREE SHIPPING. No fragrance added, or essential oils and extra crap like that. Just really bare-bones. MAP, or with other anti aging actives if you want them (matrixyl 3000 or some other one), and hyaluronic acid and water or something.\n\nIs the MAP concentration at an effective %? I want to buy the biggest size (8 oz) of the matrixyl 3000 + vitamin c serum and use it all over my face and body (and force my spouse to, too) but wanted to check with SCA/AB first. \n\nEdit: Does anyone know what \"20% (2% solution) Vitamin C (Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate)\" in the ingredient list mean? Does that mean it's 20% MAP or 2% MAP??? I'm so confused.\n\nEdit 2: Okay, they emailed me back again and said it means 2% MAP! That's a teeny bit low for me (I think optimal MAP serums use 3.5% right? And 5.5% MAP = 20% L-AA, simplisticly speaking, I believe. Someone correct me if I'm wrong) But it seems really gentle for ultra sensitive skinned folks and i'm gonna buy it cuz i'm cheap, til I earn enough money to afford a regular l-aa serum.\n**************\npH = 6.7, according to a SCAer who sent them the question. Optimal pH range for MAP and SAP serums is 6-7.\n\nLink to SCA post: https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/4ss78v/product_question_anyone_try_asterwood_naturals/\n\n**************\nEDIT 3: Erm,,,, so.. I'm not sure if i mathed right, but if I did, then there are extremely small amounts of vitamin c and hylauronic acid in this serum.. It's like you're paying for water and preservatives.. Please correct me if I am wrong, but if it's true, dun't buy",

    "body": "Hey everyone, I've been struggling with skincare for years and this quarantine situation finally pushed me to get it started and experiment with an actual routine lol. I have quite oily skin... but it can be pretty dry sometimes (have had multiple cycles of high potency accutane/epuris), which often ends up coming back. I also have pretty uneven skin in terms of texture and colour, due to acne scarring. I used to get cystic acne but I don't really break out anymore. This routine for me is mainly to keep my skin moisturized without looking greasy, even out any texture/colour differences due to scarring, and help with skin aging/wrinkles.\n\nHere is my current routine I am planning to use:\n\n**AM**\n\n1. Hyaluronic Acid (when skin is damp)\n2. Alpha Arbutin (few drops)\n3. Niacinamide (2 drops)\n4. Magnesium ascorbyl phosphate\n5. Hip seed oil\n6. Azelaic acid -> apply when dry\n7. Moisturizer\n8. Sunscreen\n\n**PM**\n\n1. Hyaluronic Acid (when skin is damp)\n2. Alpha Arbutin (few drops)\n3. Niancinamide (2 drops)\n4. Retinol\n5. Magnesium ascorbyl phosphate\n6. Moisturizer\n\n**Extra:**\n\n1. AHA/BHA (2x a week in PM and don’t use retinol on those nights)\n\nAre there any suggestions or comments for this routine? I've spent countless hours researching, and compiling information. But it just seems like there is so much information out there and that there is often not a whole lot of consistency (I guess because everyone's skin is different and the research isn't present/conclusive). I feel like I have the basics figured out, in terms of layering order and how the active ingredients affect me, but I still am pretty new to this. I have been questioning how I used to apply (in terms of the specific amount, if I rub/pat, and how hard I rub it in) any products as I probably have a lot of bad habits I'm not even aware of. Another concern I have is if this routine is too much. I about introducing everything slowly, but I'm not sure if having this many products in my routine would kind of just not really do anything and if there are certain steps that are unnecessary. Let me know what yall think and thanks a lot in advance for helping a newbie like me out :)",

        "body": "I personally wouldn’t add so many products into my regimen all at once. One or two at a time works great. That way if there’s any irritation or adverse effects, I can find out the cause easier. On the other hand, I can also figure out what works. My suggestion would be to pick out two or three products that address your biggest or multiple concerns and start with that.\n\nAlso I noticed you have an oil in your AM routine as well as before your moisturiser. I usually prefer to use an oil in my PM routine and either after or mixed in with my moisturiser. \n\nAlso you may not have to use each product both in the morning and night especially given that most products cover some of the functions of another. For example, the Alpha Arbutin also has HA so I’d use one in the morning and one at night. Vitamin C is a great antioxidant so I like to use it in the morning to boost the effect of my sunscreen. At night, I use Niacinamide.\n\nHere’s the routine I would suggest:\n\nAM\nHyaluronic Acid (on damp skin)\nMAP\nAzelaic Acid (personally didn’t get any results from this btw)\nMoisturiser \nSunscreen \n\nPM\nAlpha Arbutin\nNiacinamide \nRetinoid \nMoisturiser \nOil\n\nAHA/BHA once a week. Start with 3-4 minutes and slowly up to 10 minutes if you’re new to acids. \n\nAs a side note, have you considered the Ascorbic Acid + Alpha Arbutin serum? That’s what has given me the best results for skin brightening and hyperpigmentation. Since it’s two products in one, it helps to further streamline my routine. I would also suggest the buffet for your anti-aging concerns.\n\nRegarding your other questions: Amount? a few drops of each serum is great. I use 5 on my face and 3 on my neck and décolletage. Even that might be too much.\n\nRub/pat? doesn’t matter to me. I prefer to gently rub with my middle and fourth finger.\n\nToo much? To me, yes. (Sorry) I prefer a streamlined routine so you know what works and can stick with it long term.\n\nSorry for the essay lol.\n\nHope this helps!!!",

And I would use your serum at night. Your skin works best at night and repairs easier when you are resting. And mixing everything together can dilute the SPF but if it is for incidental sun exposure and not a two hour outdoor session then I'd say you'd be fine.

Maybe you might want to try a water based one to help seal everything in? Or you could try the seven skin method with a hydrating toner. \n\nYou also might want to try cutting everything and going to just cleansing and moisturizing to see if that helps. Sometimes too many products can irritate your skin.\n\nI hope this helps some or gives you some ideas. If you really can’t figure it out and you have the money you could also try going to an esthetician.",

Unfortunately it was too late and I have pretty large blobs of hazel brown in my formally green/blue eyes and they seem to be continuing to grow throughout the years 😞\n\nI read somewhere after I stopped using it that rapidlash had some sort of penalty placed on them for selling products that contained that medicated ingredient over the counter so they changed their formula to comply with regulations but continued to sell it over the counter in the exact same packaging (and from what I've read it isn't as effective).\n\nSo while I agree with a lot of the other posters here that the ingredient to change eye colour is intended to be reserved for prescription formulas, it absolutely can be in over the counter products too (via a lack in regulatory oversight in the beauty industry). I recommend to do some more research to make sure it doesn't contain any ingredients associated with side-effects that you don't want to risk.\n\nSorry, I don't remember off the top of my head what the ingredient was named though. I've seen many articles online about rapidlash and that specific ingredient over the years though so it shouldn't be hard to locate.",

Here's my current routine:\n\n\nAM:\n\n-CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser\n\n-Cosrx 96 Snail Mucin Essence\n\n-CeraVe Moisturizing Facial Cream (very similar to the PM formulation, but it's not the exact same- I live in Europe and it seems unique to the region  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ )\n\n\n\nPM:\n\n-CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser\n\n-Dr. G Brightening Peeling Gel (the single best physical exfoliator I've ever used- it uses cellulose to super gently slough off dead skin. I don't need to double cleanse when I use it, even with make up on)\n\n-TO Salicylic Acid 2%\n\nOR\n\n-TO Granactive Retinoid 2% in Squalane (I alternate nights, and if I use the the retinoid I apply the snail essence first)\n\n-Cosrx 96 Snail Mucin Essence\n\n-CeraVe Moisturizing Facial Cream\n\n-RAAW in a Jar Rosehip Seed Oil\n\n\nAnd once or twice a week I use the StriVectin Instant Revitalizing Mask (pretty much just a bentonite clay mask with AHA) followed by a sheet mask.\n\n\nSo, I guess my questions are\n\n1) Would adding Vit C into my routine be too many actives? I'm not trying to burn my face off here, but I imagine there must be some way to use SA, a retinoid, and Vit C. Should I alternate days? Or use waiting times? I was thinking maybe switching the SA to my AM routine and alternating Vit C and the retinoid in the PM. My skin isn't terribly sensitive and it's probably the healthiest it's ever been.\n\n2) If it is safe to incorporate, which kind should I use? I'm looking at TO (because $), but they have so many different kinds! I've read that because of the pH, some are more effective than others. I guess I'd just like to hear which kinds worked for y'all. At this point the Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate 10% seems like it would jive, but it's hard to tell.\n\nAnyway thanks so much!",

May contain: Iron Oxides, Manganese Violet, Titanium Dioxide, FD&C Red 40, D&C Red 7, D&C Red 21, FD&C Yellow 6, FD&C Blue 1.\n\nMPZ Dirty: mica, iron oxide, ultramarine blue, ultramarine violet, magnesium myristrate\n\nMPZ Pasty Ass: mica, Titanium dioxide, iron oxide, magnesium myristrate\n\nFoundation: zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, mica, magnesium stearate, iron oxides, allantoin, Apple Poly® polyphenols, trans-resveratrol, green coffee bean extract, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate.\n\n\nAny sort of help is most appreciated! Thank you <3.",

So, after a quick Google search, I find out that these three serums are the same as the Supers. However, they all have a kind of high pH, ranging from 5.50-7.50. I know that 5.50 isn't too bad, as it's still pretty close to skin's natural pH, but the Hyaluronic Acid and Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate both range from 6.50-7.50.

I suffer from sensitive skin, which, when using the wrong products, breaks out in red patches and dry, flaky skin on my eyelids and sometimes on my cheeks. Sadly I have not been able to identify why this happens, so I tend to use hypoallergenic products / for sensitive skin.\n\nDuring lockdown, I've dedicated quite some time to look more into skincare and what products I should be using to improve my skin dry, sensitive, and probably quite dehydrated skin. I am feeling completely overwhelmed with information, and I could really do with some guidance and advice to establish a better routine. \n\n**My routine at the moment is:**\n\nAM \n\n1. Rinse with water\n2. Superdrug Simply Pure Hydrating Serum\n3. [Ziaja Olive Cream](https://taniekosmetyki.co.uk/product-eng-3640-Ziaja-Olive-natural-cream-dry-and-normal-skin-50ml.html?utm_source=iai_ads&utm_medium=google_shopping&curr=GBP) (click [here](https://imgur.com/rmzFKgw) for photo with list of ingredients)\n4.

Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser\n2. Superdrug Simply Pure Calming Cleanser (I use this for removing make-up which I rarely wear at the moment)\n3. Ziaja Olive Cream, as above\n\n[Photo](https://imgur.com/a/7MvqUfc) of my skin\n\nFrom all the reading I’ve done so far, I’ve gathered that it might be beneficial for me to start using **Hyaluronic Acid** (I’ve been looking at The Ordinary’s HA 2% + B5) and **Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate 10%** (also looking at The Ordinary’s [product](https://theordinary.deciem.com/product/rdn-magnesium-ascorbyl-phosphate-10pct-30ml?redir=1&ccvis=1), as supposedly it’s kinder to dry and sensitive skin than Vitamin C L-ascorbic acid)... but I might be completely missing the trick here. \n\nI would be very grateful for any recommendations you might have for me. \n\nThanks so much!",

I've heard Simple has a good oil cleanser (I haven't tried it before tho), so you'd use that before either the Cetaphil or Simply Pure cleanser in the PM. I double cleanse even when not wearing makeup since the oil helps unclog my pores and properly wash off sunscreen. \n\nThe olive cream looks like it has a lot of fragrances in it which might be making your skin more sensitive, but if it works for you then I'd just keep using it. \n\nHyaluronic Acid is pretty low risk to use and is great for hydration, so I'd incorporate it if you're having problems with dryness!",

My acne is minor and without keratolytics would include plugged pores and pimples, but even the plugged pores are a struggle requiring lots of keratolytics. \n\nI've been using tret for awhile and have been unable to get up to more than twice weekly without major irritation. \n\nCurology offered me 4 formulas. I am not interested in using the ones containing clindamycin (and frankly I am really troubled that the Curology NP thinks that this is not a valid concern because topical clindamycin doesn't get to my gut; I'm concerned more about the effects of antibiotic overuse creating resistant bacteria and the impact on the environment.) So here are my two options, cut and pasted:\n\n– tretinoin 0.017% (prevents and treats blocked pores and improves fine lines and skin texture)\n– zinc pyrithione 0.25% (antimicrobial with dual action against bacteria and fungus)\n– azelaic acid 4% (reduces bacteria, helps to keep pores clear and also fights redness and hyperpigmentation) \n\nOR \n\n- tretinoin 0.012% (unclogs pores, improves fine lines, skin tone, texture and firmness)\n– vitamin C (magnesium ascorbyl phosphate) 5% (an antioxidant that improves inflammation and skin firmness)\n– niacinamide 4% (a form of vitamin B3 that fights inflammation and hyperpigmentation)\n\nI'm torn. I don't know anything about zinc pyrithione. I do love Vitamin C but I can get that in a different product, I think. I was hoping for Azelaic acid to treat my melasma, but the niacinamide might do also (though when I used a sunscreen with it several years ago I developed rosacea.) Your thoughts?",

I'm not a chemist, so I have no idea.\n\nBut, pH balanced to what? The pH of the solution they tested was not given. Any evidence they claim is based on the solution as described, and alterations were not tested.\n\nLonger critical opinion:\n\nIt is a bad study which at best shows what happens when you depilate a number of male mice and photograph them as their hair grows back in. There was no objective measure of hair growth and condition, so it isn't good evidence and it isn't repeatable. And if anyone has repeated this study, they don't seem to have published it anywhere.\n\nIf this actually worked in humans, well, first off there would be a lot of women with fully hairy faces, given the increasing popularity of use of penetration enhanced MAP products. MSM isn't magical either. Over 40 years of repeated studies using MSM for everything one can think of, and even the better ones haven't found much evidence that it does anything better than a placebo.\n\nIt isn't a cosmetic and it doesn't really lead to one. They didn't test the solutions and combinations for stability. They didn't make any stable products, as they made fresh solution every day. If they tested for pH or anything else, they did not include it or I missed it in either that study or the Korean patent application based on it. Since they were doing *Does this work for what I think it might do* science instead of *How can I make this into a functional and stable product* science, and there's no tested formulations in the patent application, you'd need to find stability data elsewhere.\n\nThe only substance with repeatable evidence for improving hair growth and retention is minoxidil. Given the potential market for hair growth products that work that are not minoxidil and the lack of available hair miracle products with high percentage MAP and MSM, I suspect that there's no good reason to make this or expect it to work. Cosmetics companies love money, so either the solution doesn't provide any benefit in humans, or it is too unstable in formulation for any cosmetic company to bother with and marketing an add your own water version would be unprofitable. The old US patents have expired, so it isn't concern over lawsuits.\n\nTangentially: The guy who drove research into MSM as magic cure-all (and DMSO before that) also had a bunch of patents for production of paper products. It makes me think that all of the bad stuff I know about DMSO is a bit worse and more sketchy, somehow.",

I believe I read it’s oil soluble, so it’s supposed to penetrate deeper. I think using two varieties of vitamin C is what made this tolerable for my skin. Plus they include glutathione and superoxide dismutase. If you can’t tell I really love this product lol",

    "body": "i've been contemplating and over thinking this post for far too long now, i'm new to SCA and i have plenty of unrelated questions but i didn't want to spam the community, so for now i've decided to focus on this topic. i know i've procrastinated far too long but my birthday is next week and its my goal to start a skincare routine by then and to have the best skin i can have by then. here's my issues:\n\ni'm a 16 (soon to be 17) year old girl without a job and living in a low income family. i've been on SCA long enough to know that good skincare isnt cheap,  i don't have the money to but a $15 cleanser. idk why but i've been hesitant about starting a SCR probably because i'm fearful i'll do it wrong or the purging & potential for a product not agreeing with me will be too much to handle. i have a lot of new mini kits that i got for christmas and i thought i'd ask for your guy's reviews on these products (because i haven't seen anyone post on most of these yet) and your recommendations for me on creating a routine with what i currently have instead of going out and buying some the the HG products of this community. \n\nfirst, here's some history of my skin:\ni've known about skincare since i was about 11 from watching yt, before that i had did nothing but let water hit my face in the shower. at first i went to walmart and target trying any product that interested me and was cheap. i never stuck to a routine and to this day i've never consecutively washed my face for more than 5 days. the good news is in the last couple of years i've been educating myself more and watching out for certain ingredients and staying away from harmful products. i know i probably sound crazy to you all but i've never even used sunscreen. thankfully, it seems as if i'm crazy blessed because i've never had bad skin issues or a lot of acne, in the last 2 years though my skin has been the worst i've seen it, i don't really know how to rate it because sometimes i look at my skin and think \"ah its not that bad it's practically clear\" and other times, especially when i'm wearing makeup or in good lighting i'm thinking \"goodness, my skin is awful\". my main issue are blackheads on my nose, texture all over my face especially on my forehead (but pretty much unnoticeable unless you're up close or in good/dim lighting), whiteheads on my chin, and a few persistent zits on my cheeks and a few others that pop up here and there. \n\nnow to the products. i'm going to list all of the products i've accumulated and not used recently, most of them are sample sizes from gift sets. my request is for you to give me a mini review on any of the products you've tried and from the skin issues i've relayed for you to tell me what you'd suggest my routine to be with the products i have. if you need anymore information please let me know, and i apologize if i've one anything wrong or worded things weird i'm new to this site and new to skincare at this level.

Skincare actually doesn’t have to be expensive to be effective.

Here, you could alternate and  use The Ordinarys Salicylic Acid 2% Solution.\n\nMoisturizer \n\nSunscreen daily \n\nPm: \n\nCleanse with same gentle cleanser\n\nExfoliate 2-3 times per week - I’d recommend The Ordinary  Glycolic Acid 7% Toner \n\nSerums/Acids: Here you can use either the salicylic acid or Niacinamide again. Or you can use one of these in the morning and one at night but don’t mix them together. \n\nMoisturize",

This makes my skin really moisturized and glowy. \n- plain yogurt or milk makes my skin look brighter and less dull\n- honey + green tea leaves\n- Turmeric powder. Add this to any of the above masks for a nice glow to your skin. (Skip if you're very pale because it might be too yellow) \n\n**Products to Try in the future**\n\n- Stridex pads in red box. It's ~$7 and the salicylic acid will help with your minor acne problems. \n- Sunscreen   \nI would highly recommend getting sunscreen or start wearing ball caps if you're out in the sun.

I learned from this experience that I scar and pigment like a motherfucker, though that's probably to be expected since I tan easily. So now my skintone is super uneven from all the scarring and inflammation. As of mid-last year I lurked on this subreddit and figured out a rudimentary routine for myself that I still use more or less. It is:\n\nAM-\n*wash face w/ lukewarm water\n* apply Petunia Organics magnesium ascorbyl phosphate serum (this thing also helped get rid of acne on my forehead weirdly enough)\n*(during the winter, now it's too humid) Cerave in the jar cream\n*sunblock: used to be a Neutrogena anti-aging something, now Paula's Choice Resist spf30 with zinc oxide\n\nPM-\n*wash face w/ Cerave hydrating cleanser\n*apply Alpha Hydrox 10% glycolic acid lotion (I stopped recently)\n*apply Alpha Hydrox spot-light treatment (2% hydroquinone and glycolic) on dark spots/scarring etc (stopped using this recently too)\n*Cerave in the jar (not recently cause it's too warm, looking for a gel-based moisturizer)\n*Neem oil as spot treatment\n\nThe glycolic and hydroquinone helped quite a bit, there was a dramatic reduction in pigmentation on my cheeks. But it only did so much and after 6-8 weeks of using the Spot Light treatment there was no more improvement. Went to see a derm yesterday, told her pretty much all of this, she gave me an RX for 0.1% tretinoin, 4% hydroquinone cream for the pigmentation issue and Acenya gel (clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide) for spot treatment as needed. She said that the acenya can be used in the morning and the retinoid at night, and that I can put the 4% hydroquinone cream on any dark spots on top of the retinoid. I haven't started any of this yet, just put some of the tretinoin on the underside of my jaw as a patch-test to observe in the morning.\n\nSo! I looked at the info on retinoids and there are side effects, the peeling, the purging etc. I'm scared of the latter. How long would the purging last normally if it happens? Does it happen more to some people than others or is it seen in all patients that use topical retinoids? And would oily skin help offset the drying effect of the treatment? And since I don't have crazy acne right now, would I still purge?\n\nAnother thing: I work in a cosmetic product development lab. I have access to pretty much any ingredient you can think of. If I was to make a lightweight summery lotion with lots of skin-beneficial ingredients, what would be good things to put in it? I wrote a rudimentary formula with some glycerin, vitamin E in a solubilizer, allantoin, panthenol, and niacinamide (and water, thickener, preservative etc). Any other ingredient I can stick in there?\n\nAny advice is appreciated, sorry for the wall of text! :)",

They indicate that the active form, ascorbic acid, is able to reach significant levels in the skin, but they go bad easily due to reaction with air in their container. On the other hand, you have other more stable forms of vitamin C (magnesium ascorbyl phosphate and ascorbyl palmitate), but these failed to increase levels of ascorbic acid in the skin.\n\nWhat do you think? Are there any stabilized, air/light protected formulations or products out there that you know of?\n",
