The allergy testing is kind of a pain not being able to shower, having this itchy stuff on your back, etc.  so if you can pinpoint the allergy without going through all that it's better but you have to completely eliminate the ingredient, see if you have an improvement and then use the ingredient once and you should see an almost immediate reaction.

Then recently, I've been feeling that the skin on my face is ANGRY. Like, it's not just acne, it's something else. It's red, dry, itchy, and new pimples keep appearing. It's painful.\n\nIt turns out that all the products my skin reacted too are:\n1. 3 different shower gels (2 have Cocamidopropyl Betaine, 1 contains lauric acid)\n2. 2 different facial gel cleansers (all have Cocamidopropyl Betaine)\n3. My current gel shampoo (contains Cocamidopropyl Betaine)\n4. My current gel-like serum (contains polysorbate-20 and Acrylate/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate)\n5. My past roll-on gel deodorant (contains C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate)\n\nAll gels! Before diving into my real question, Do you think I wasn't really allergic to my past deodorant and was actually allergic to my shower gel instead? OR Is it possible that I'm also allergic to Acrylates that create the soft gel texture in personal care products? Because I am currently using a spray antiperspirant that also has Alumunium Chlorohydrate and I'm fine.\n\nAnd I think it's already clear that I'm allergic to Cocamidopropyl Betaine. My serum and 1 of my shower gel didn't contain it yet my skin becomes a sandpaper because of them. However, I heard that polysorbate-20 and lauric acid are coconut derivatives.\n\nSo, do you think I should avoid coconut derivatives too? I'm sorry for my long question. Thank you soooo much.",

I'm not allergic to coconut or other coconut derivatives and many of the products I use include them. \n\nIt took me a while to figure out what was causing my reactions because I'd phase out one product but cocoamidropropyl betaine is so ubiquitous that it would be in other products I was still using.

But it's in many stores, so it's a good fallback for emergencies. It comes out slippery like aloe vera gel, so you have to lather it/distribute it quickly before it falls out of your hands.  \n\n-Bath and Body Works Foaming Hand Soap (gifted to me, not my first choice due to the very strong fragrance): I think this brand is known for their fragrances, luckily they have many to choose from.

If you have fragrance allergies, which are super common, you shouldn't use things with essential oils.

They are skin sensitizing ingredients, so you can develop an allergy to them the more you're exposed to them.

I definitely don‚Äôt agree with anti vaxxers that every disorder that has increased in prevalence since the pandemic began is a result of covid vaccines (when it‚Äôs much more likely that these conditions are brought about by the covid virus itself, and there is lots of evidence to support this.) But I‚Äôve had adverse vaccine reactions before (not to any covid vaccines, though.) And I know quite a few people whose chronic illnesses were worsened by vaccines. I think we all just need to acknowledge that while vaccines play their part in preventing disease and are safe for the most part, people do have real and devastating adverse reactions! This is one reason I fully support wearing masks to prevent the spread of Covid (in addition to vaccines.)

Proposition 65 is a law in California that's notorious for being so incredibly cautious in its risk assessment that it winds up labelling essentially everything as potentially harmful, and thus becomes basically useless.   \n\n\nJust as an example, I bought a jar of \"all-natural\" (which I put in quotes because I kind of hate the term \"natural\", at least the way it's often used) bentonite clay a while ago. Like it's... pretty much dirt, got dug out of the ground somewhere, right? Well it's got a Proposition 65 label on it because clay (like basically all dirt, and basically the entire environment) has naturally-occurring traces of heavy metals and other potentially harmful substances. Which.... ok, I guess it's cool that I know that now. But putting warnings on products that just.... literally provide baseline environmental exposure to hazardous substances, because it's impossible to avoid all hazardous substances, isn't helpful. There's no magical alternative \"clean\" clay that you could even use. This is why Proposition 65 has been accused of being over-used and becoming meaningless. So whenever I see any kind of \"clean\" brand trying to drum up controversy over an ingredient and they only cite Prop 65, it's a bit of a red flag for me.",

I‚Äôm also somewhat interested in DIY/natural/zero waste, but in an intelligent way. \n\nBody wash History :\n\nI‚Äôve made the most of my life until around 23 years old by cleaning my body and face with the most cheap milk & honey laureth sulfate soap in the store (they even sold it in dollar stores), and I had a very soft skin and not much completions, a zit here and there. I had absolutely no interest in skincare and was really minimalist, so only body/face wash without anything else. Then, at around 23, I developed super hyper dry skin and had to change it. \n\nI was in the no-SLS fad at that time with my shampoo, so I picked a body cleanser of the same brand (the LiveClean Argan Oil body wash) without SLS that in organic, filled with beneficial oils for the skin and based on cocamidopropyl betaine (Ingredients here : http://imgur.com/a/0p6P0 ). It was absolutely fantastic for my skin. I used it for two years, even on my face, and it made moisturizing optional. On the other hand, I developed keratosis pilaris on my forearms, had some zits here and there on my shoulders, and began to have some cystic acne problems on my face. I since changed to  a face cleanser on my face (Effaclar, then Marcelle Vitamin-C), but my cystic acnea seems to be hormonal. I took Epiduo last year and it worked fine, but I have a recrudescence now. \n\nAround that time I shortly used an almond oil soap bar (I think it was from ¬´Le Petit Olivier¬ª for my body, and it was also a really good choice for my skin. No squeaky or residus, no dryness. I returned to my Liveclean cleanser after my roommate stolen and finished my bar soap, and I couln‚Äôt find it again in pharmacies. \n\nRecently I decided to try Dr Bronner‚Äôs liquid castile soap, even as I knew about saponification process and read about the drying effect of it, since my roommate as severe eczema and is very content with hers. As I expected, it was as drying or even worse than my old cheap SLS product, I am feeling ¬´squeaky clean¬ª when using it and starded to see again patch of dried flacky skin on my legs. But, surprisingly, my keratosis pilaris almost disappeared in only 4 days. I had not that result with the almond oil soap bar. I also seems to have less zits on my shoulders, but I didn‚Äôt pay enough attention to be sure. \n\nMoisturiser:\n\nI usually don‚Äôt put any moisturiser since two years, except for my hands that need some heavy duty shea or hemp butter (The Body shop) in the winter. I used to apply this butter on my legs too before, when I was about to make the transition from SLS to the Live clean soap. \nIn my face I use the Earth Sourced from Paula‚Äôs Choice occasionally since 1 year, as I transitioned from my body wash to a face cleanser (Effaclar, then the Marcelle Vitamin-C), but I didn‚Äôt need it when I was using the argan oil body wash on my face. \n\nI don‚Äôt use anything else on my body as part of my routine. \n\nDo you think there's a way to dilute my Dr Bronner soap to make it more moisturizing and keeping it low on the irritating additives? I saw some interesting recipes that dilute it with almond or jojoba oil and raw honey : does it make some sense or is it another sketchy Pinterest recipe? I'm trying to make some balance between my desire to have a more minimalist and organic list of ingredients in my skincare products, and plain common sense. is there some brands that are more on the minimalist and natural side, but also with a good result on sensitive and seasonal combination skin?\n\nThanks!\n",

        "body": "This has exactly been my experience. I developed kp when I switched to gentle cleanser, not just on my body, but also my face. Years of visiting dermatologists who asked me to use glycolic regularly to exfoliate. Worked for a while especially in hot weather, in winter my skin couldn‚Äôt handle the regular glycolic application. I also found my skin getting dry and itchy and bumpy when using gentle cleansers.long story short over the last few years the Kp on my face got worse. My bf at the time, now husband swears by Nivea cream soap , he showered with it. I would use my gentle body cleanser as recommended by my dermatologist. One day I ran out and decided to use his soap, especially cause he raves about it and refuses to use anything else. Nivea cream soap is like a Castile soap made of plant oils and lanolin. No detergents , just natural saponification to make the soap. I used it on my body for a couple of days and started noticing that my skin was peeling, so I used my shower glove to gently rub the dead skin away. Couple of weeks later mu eczema and kp gone, completely!! It was insane! Years of struggle gone in weeks. I searched Reddit to see if anyone had a similar experience and just found u. I am gonna switch my face cleanser to the soap and see ig it clears the kp on my cheeks. I feel brave enough to do it now. But yes , Castile soap had worked on my body, completely cleared the kp . I don‚Äôt like moisturising, I am one of those ppl who hates the way it feels on my skin. So I moisturise my legs only once in a while, but I have realised using silicone free moisturiser on wet skin is a game changer. Something about the feel of silicone I can‚Äôt stand. Long story short Castile soap has been the only thing that cleared my body and it‚Äôs cheap and cheerful. Hoping it will work it‚Äôs magic on my face too.",

Yes, it's in many shampoos, but there are lots of shampoos without it, and they use other coconut-derived ingredients instead. If you cannot use any other coconut-derived ingredients either, the options get limited.\n\nThe vast majority of shampoos and conditioners contain coco betaine, including the ones that are sulfate-free, natural, organic, etc. There are a few that do not, plus a few methods of cleaning your hair that might work, which I'll list. If you're allergic to coconut-derived ingredients, you'll have to check the following carefully because some products are made with coconut oil, palm, or babassu, even when they're labeled as, for example, \"olive oil soap\".\n\n* Olive oil-based liquid shampoos and shampoo bars: I bought the Chagrin Valley Olive Oil & Babassu shampoo bar, though I haven't tried it yet. I assume there are also palm and babassu-based shampoos out there, too, but I haven't paid much attention.\n* I recently discovered [Eucerin Dermo Capillaire Calming Urea Shampoo ](http://www.amazon.com/Eucerin-Dermo-Capillaire-Calming-Shampoo/dp/B009P0V9UQ) has sulfates but doesn't have coco betaine, so it can be used to remove silicones from hair if you need. There are no other shampoos I've found that has sulfates but no coco betaine.\n* I tried [Clean Kids Naturally Shampoo](http://gabrielcosmeticsinc.com/shop/clean-kids-naturally-shampoo/). I thought it gave me acne but I might have been wrong. They also have a [hand soap](http://gabrielcosmeticsinc.com/shop/clean-kids-naturally-germ-busting-soap/).\n* I found [California Baby \nSuper Sensitive \nShampoo & Bodywash](http://www.californiababy.com/super-sensitive-shampoo-bodywash-8-5-oz.html) through Google recently (I think an allergy clinic somewhere recommended it). I haven't tried it.\n* [Face Naturals](https://facenaturals.com/product-category/body/organic-hair-care_1_2_3/organic-shampoos/) sells shampoos and other products with coconut but without coco betaine. They have an excellent (sourced) page about how coco betaine is an irritant and contact allergen.\n* Commercial dry shampoos haven't contained coco betaine, in my experience (because it lathers?). However, I've found that they tend to contain products that build up in hair. I was using Suave Professionals Dry Shampoo until I discovered it was causing me acne and contained silicones and silica! Bleh!\n* Arrowroot or cornstarch dry shampoo might work for you. I had planned on trying arrowroot after giving up on the cornstarch, but I just got tired of it all. Right now, I'm just doing water-only on my hair and it's going surprisingly well.\n* You can try making your own shampoo.\n\n* I do not co-wash because I haven't found a conditioner without coco betaine.\n* [Jane Carter Nourish & Shine](http://www.janecartersolution.com/Nourish-Shine-4oz.html) I have used as a leave-in conditioner a couple of times, but I wasn't sure if it was giving me acne and greasy hair so I stopped. It smells *amazing* and the problems were probably due to the Suave dry shampoo or my current laundry detergent, so I've kept it and will probably try it again in the future.\n\nOther names for coco betaine are Tegobetaine L7, Cocoyl amide propyldimethyl glycine, coconut oil amidopropyl betaine, N-cocamidopropyl-N, N-dimethlglycine hydroxide inner salt, and lauramidopropyl betaine. I saw yesterday in Sephora that Bumble and Bumble listed lauramidopropyl betaine in their ingredients :/\n\nAnd I know you didn't ask this, but remember to check your toothpaste and other products!!! Awhile back, I switched from Sensodyne (contains coco betaine) to [Hello](http://hello-products.com) (contains SLS) and it fixed so much stuff in my mouth!!\n\nedit: fixing a link",

    "body": "\nI have a very extreme cocamidopropyl betaine allergy and am also irritated by many coconut derivatives so I have done my best to cut out coconut from my routine. I struggled most to find a shampoo and conditioner and after a long search ended up finding ‚Äúthe ordinary‚Äù sulfate 4% cleanser for body and hair and the behentrimonium chloride 2% conditioner. The shampoo does not really sud and definitely takes some getting used to but it works and the conditioner is absolutely amazing. I have noticed my hair get much healthier since using these to that‚Äôs an extra plus. As far as soap I only use ivory bar soap. This does not have cocamidopropyl betaine in it but might have some coconut derivatives, it works for me might not work for you (open to any suggestions you may have for soap). I also only use soap on the areas I really need it. I have stopped using soap on my arms and legs and my skin has improved so much. For lotion I use CeraVe and the Working Hands body lotion. I also use Vaseline for breakout spots and lip balm. For checking products like makeup, hair care, and more I have found the SkinSAFE app to be extremely helpful. Just scan the barcode on products and it will show you what is and isn‚Äôt in the ingredients, if it is coconut free it will show something saying ‚ÄúCOC FREE‚Äù. While I am still trying to figure out exactly what works for me this routine has helped my allergy breakouts immensely. Remember to keep it simple, when I first found my allergy I was using way too many products and cutting it down to just the basics also made a big difference for my skin. This allergy can be so frustrating and isolating and it can become really hard to remember that recovery and healing is possible. Keep pushing. ",

    "body": "Six months or so ago I was reading posts in an effort to figure out why the 'natural' shampoos I've always used for my sensitive scalp would work for a few days then trigger my eczema. I've been ultra careful to steer clear of SLS, parabens, etc etc for years, it made no sense to me.\n\n I happened to stumble on a post about cocamidopropyl betaine and my brain promptly exploded. I ran to my bathroom and read the ingredient list on all 6 bottles sitting in my shower - all 6 had CAPB listed in the top 4 ingredients. Leaving the bathroom, I saw my toothpaste and just stared at it for a minute. There...listed as number six, was the same ingredient.\n\nI was tentatively diagnosed with OLP in the summer of 2021 by my oral medicine doc - I have lacy white patches on my outer gums and inner cheeks which is the result of peeling skin. She sent a biopsy to the pathologist asking for a differential between OLP, MMP, or an allergy, and the pathologist said \"Yes\". The doc leans more towards an allergy, and after switching to a CAPB free toothpaste, I've seen some significant improvement with my gums!\n\nAnd! because I am always a little extra, I decided that maybe it's not just a CAPB allergy but a coconut allergy and went on the hunt for coco-free products. These are the products I found, it's by no means a definitive list but I hope it helps. Note: I am an every day washer and likely won't change, it's my preference. Some of these products may not work well for daily washing and it's not a knock to the product, it just doesn't work for me, so I am still on the hunt for my holy grail. Here is what I've tried so far and in order:\n\n* Clean Kids Naturally Tropical Orange Burst - Was really hopeful this was going to be the answer for me as it did not contain any coconut, but sadly my scalp still felt irritated and inflamed after using the third time. Taking a closer look, I think I may be sensitive to jojoba as well. Smelled amazing.\n* Chagrin Valley Olive Oil and Babassu bar - Eczema wise, this bar was pretty good until I realized it was leaving behind a very thick, waxy type residue. My scalp irritation went completely away but I did still have some minute patches above my ears. For the residue, it seems like this might be a common complaint as there are instructions on the site about how to use/getting used to a shampoo bar. I did all the recommended things: rinsed \\*extremely\\* well, used an ACV rinse, brush through my hair while rinsing but after a month it still felt like build up so I stopped using.\n* Exederm Exczema Care Daily Shampoo - definitely helped reduced any scalp inflammation and the spots above my ears healed up. However, it has a very chemical, man made smell and it made my hair feel very flat and sad.\n* Puracy Daily Shampoo - I wondered if I went overboard with the \"if I'm allergic to CAPB, maybe I\"m allergic to all things coconut\" so I tried this. Nope, my instinct was right - this made my scalp hurt as soon as I started washing my hair. \n* Alodia Nourish & Heal Black Soap Wash - A little went a long way, and again this poo did a good job until I noticed it too started to leave behind a residue. \n* Pectolite Harmony Shampoo - having learned my lesson, I bought a trial size and used all of it. The smell is interesting, you can smell the fermented quality to it. I plan to buy another trial size once I run out of the Ayurvita I've been using. I remember having some minimal spots above my ears but none of the intense itching I would have prior to this journey.\n* Ayurvita Ultra Nourishing Shampoo with Neem & Reetha - has a really nice spice smell and is only slightly irritating to the spots above my ears. I've consistently used this shampoo the most with the exception of the Exederm. Still not 100% perfect.\n\nBest thing about all of this experimentation I've done - I don't lose even 1/4 of the hair I used to. My hair is past my shoulders, almost to my bra line. I've always brushed/combed through my hair in the shower with conditioner and thought that the amount of hair that would come away in the brush was normal. Even dry, my hair was constantly shedding and every where. Now, I have a ton of regrowth  coming in and I haven't had a clogged drain in 6 months. \n\nIf you have any suggestions for coconut free shampoo/conditioner that aren't listed here, I'd love to hear about them so I can add to my list to try.",

Does anyone know where to buy toothpaste that's both SLS and cocamidopropyl betaine free in the UK?",

I've been making shampoo bars for fine hair with Plantapon TF instead of CAPB, but discovered yesterday that it has been discontinued. Does anybody have any experience or opinions regarding Sodium laurylglucosides hydroxypropylsulfonate as a possible replacement? \n\nThis is my current formula:\n\nSodium cocoyl isethionate (SCI) Powder (32%)  \nPlantapon TF (18%)  \nSodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate (SLSa) (35%)  \nSodium lactate (5%)  \nHydrolyzed Oat Protein (1.5%)  \nPolyquat 7 (3%)  \nPropanediol 1,3 (3%)  \nFragrance (1%)  \nPanthenol (1%)  \nGermall Plus (.5%)\n\nAs an aside, I'm planning to reduce the SLSa by 3% and adding 3% cetyl alcohol to make the bars harder.\n\nThanks!\n\n# ",

    "body": "Hi guys, I‚Äôve posted on here previously about getting sore pimples only on my jawline. Well, after scrolling through several threads and some self reflection, I think it could be my toothpaste and/or shampoo. Specifically, because my shampoo contains both cocamidopropyl betaine and sls and my toothpaste contains just cocamidopropyl betaine. The reason I think these could be my culprit is when I wear my hair down, it touches the areas of my chin where I‚Äôm getting spots, and I sometimes get bumps on my hairline and upper back AFTER showering. So, my question to you lovely folk is, do you know where I could get cocamidopropyl betaine and sls free shampoo and toothpaste? ",

    "body": "Hi guys, I‚Äôve posted on here previously about getting sore pimples only on my jawline. Well, after scrolling through several threads and some self reflection, I think it could be my toothpaste and/or shampoo. Specifically, because my shampoo contains both cocamidopropyl betaine and sls and my toothpaste contains just cocamidopropyl betaine. The reason I think these could be my culprit is when I wear my hair down, it touches the areas of my chin where I‚Äôm getting spots, and I sometimes get bumps on my hairline and upper back AFTER showering. So, my question to you lovely folk is, do you know where I could get cocamidopropyl betaine and sls free shampoo and toothpaste? ",

I was looking at a new hair product and saw it has cocamidopropyl betaine, which I learned is a coconut derivative. I don‚Äôt quite understand the derivation process, and was wondering if anyone could let me know if there would be any coconut protein (the allergen) left in the refined cocamidopropyl betaine.

        "body": "It's actually possible for it to not even be from coconuts, but from palm oil. Generally speaking, oils are very low in protein content in the first place, and then it's treated with various chemicals which have a good chance of denaturing any residual proteins. So I would say the chance of any intact protein is quite low, but it's hard to know for sure. The Wikipedia article goes over the process and also has a comment on allergic/sensitivity reactions, which seem to be related to the post-treatments and not the oil feedstock.\n\n[Cocamidopropyl betaine - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocamidopropyl_betaine)\n\nIf your allergic reaction isn't anaphylactic, then my guess is you will have no issue but just stay on the lookout for any signs of irritation. If the allergy is very serious, you should double check the issue with your allergist and I might just avoid that ingredient to be safe.",
