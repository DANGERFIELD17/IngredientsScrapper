    "body": "Nursing student here..... So after talking to my doctor and other doctors, it is confirmed that the most misguided information with T  is discarding \"single use\" vials. The term \"single use\" is labeled for hospitals/clinics. You should be using your vials until they're empty. If you have a 1ml vial and are on .25 you should be getting 4 injections from that vial. Ofc this is going to cause a mini stockpile at some point but that is beneficial to you. Especially when and if your dosages are increasing. Always remember to check your seals before each use,, clean the seals with alcohol before use, check the oil for and type of discoloration or particles in the vial! Make sure you're also checking the expiration dates in your vials and not the pharmacy labels. For any other clarifications you can also check the manufacturer website for the brand you get. \n\nEDIT: The vials I am referring to are the rubber \"Self-healing\" vials the vial should also say it contains benzyl alcohol which is a preservative! These vials are safe to use until they are empty! If you would like me to check the manufacturer guidelines for expiration for you just send me a message with the brand and I will reply since we can't upload photos in this group! ",

    "body": "Hey everyone! Due to a recent posting of misinformation being spread on here, excessive worrying over ingredients, and people PMing me for advice I figured I would just make a post about this to help other people with similar questions\n\nFor background, I am a chemist- in particular a biochemist. I used to work in a research area that focused on mineral/ion- skin absorption. I'll try to hit the ones that aren't in the side bar already and separate them out by category for easy viewing. Let me know if I missed any big ones!\n\n**Emulsifiers - keep oil/water based chemicals from separating in products**\n\nMost common products I see contain polysorbates, laureth-4, glyceryl monostearate (also pearlescent agent)\nlauramide DEA (also foam booster), or potassium cetyl sulfate. There's also stearic acid that also helps with cleansing. These aren't necessarily bad for you nor are they good for you. They're kinda meh ingredients that exist to make the product work \n\n**Preservatives- extend their shelf life and are anti microbial**\n \nparabens- these get a lot of flack but there isn't that much research confirming their 'toxicity'. The [original study] (http://www.dr-baumann.ca/science/Concentrations%20of%20Parabens%20in%20Human%20Breast.pdf) that brought them into the spotlight was over hyped by the media and dozens of other studies done afterwards have yet to find a definite link to cancer or other diseases. These are however very great preservatives\n\nBenzyl alcohol containing products has been known to dry some people out due to it's status as an alcohol. Aside from a preservative it's also used as a ph balancer\n\nformaldehyde- if you see this in a product, you may want to be wary. The World Health Organization has determined this to be a carcinogen; however whether trace amounts are as bad for you is still unknown\n\n tetrasodium EDTA/ disodium EDTA- normally these are used to draw metals out of the blood, but in terms of skincare, both work to stabilize the product by binding other chemicals. Only concern with this one is that it's an environmental hazard \n\nPhenoxyethanol -  an antimicrobial \n\nethylhexylglycerin - helps with eczema and also works for some people with rosacea \n\n**Moisturizers : Lipid thickeners - give product it's creamy consistency**\n\ncetyl alcohol, stearic acid and carnauba wax are the big ones- aren't bad, rarely cause things like breakouts for most people. These are also good at protecting the moisture barrier from water loss by forming a 'seal' \n\n**Moisturizers : Natural thickeners - come from nature, usually work as humectants (think hyaluronic acid)**\n\nhydroxyethyl cellulose, guar gum, xanthan gum and gelatin are the most popular\n\n**Moisturizers: Mineral thickeners - also natural, absorb both oils and retain water**\n\nmagnesium aluminium silicate, silica and bentonite are the big ones here. A lot of clay masks and some silicone based (neutrogena) sunscreens are apart of this category. Silicone based sunscreens are great for those who's skin can handle them since they keep oils/shine in check while also preventing your skin from overdrying\n\n**Moisturizers: synthetic thickeners - used in a lot of gel type products and some of the rich/smooth white creams**\n\ncarbomer, cetyl palmitate, and ammonium acryloyldimethyltaurate are common ones\n\n**Emollients - soften the skin by preventing water loss, work as humectants,  definetly want these in your routine**\n\nbeeswax, olive oil, coconut oil and lanolin, petroleum jelly, mineral oil, glycerin, zinc oxide, butyl stearate and diglycol laurate , urea, glycerol, propylene glycol or lactic acid are big ones here.\n\nSome of these are termed 'comedogenic' like coconut oil but many many people don't break out from them so that's a pretty arbitrary rating imo\n\n**Edit- here’s a couple more I forgot to add that are sunscreen relevant**\n\n**Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate-** protects against UVB and not UVA rays. It is not very stable either, when exposed to sunlight, it kind of breaks down and loses its effectiveness (not instantly, but over time - it loses 10% of its SPF protection ability within 35 mins)\n\n**Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane-**  famous Avobenzone. It is the only globally available chemical sunscreen agent that protects against UVA. It is the global gold standard of UVA protection and is the most used UVA sunscreen in the world. Suprisingly it’s in moisturizers too.The problem with it, though, is that it is not photostable and degrades in the sunlight. Wikipedia says that avobenzone loses 36% of its UV-absorption capacity after just one hour of sunlight",

    "body": "Hello and welcome back to SAR! If there is one infectious disease that people know about, but may not *know* about, is Rabies. This viral disease is 100% fatal and while there are case reports of people surviving their Rabies infection they still had to die in order to survive—if you are confused so am I. Seriously, we really don’t know a lot about how the Rabies virus works and how it is so effective at killing the host. Generally the goal of any bacteria or virus is to keep the host alive long enough to spread it to other hosts; killing the person quickly and violently doesn’t really increase the spreadability of the virus. Regardless, Rabies is a special disease that deserves to be talked about for all the people and pets that have been killed by the virus. So let’s dive in!\n\n# A Virus is not Alive\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/co2rt4uwi02a1.png?width=814&format=png&auto=webp&s=4da7ff9fe1cea97294ab92a19282f68b4659557c\n\nDespite seeing it in movies, TV shows, and the news, Rabies is not a very common infection among living things. Now this map is a little bit misleading because it makes it seem like Africa and Asia are hotbeds for Rabies but this map is showing which regions have more fatal infections of Rabies. Remember, it's 100% fatal so it's not like people are less likely to die from Rabies in the Congo than they are in Los Angeles BUT there is a difference in the number of animals who are infected. More developed nations have a more robust eradication system for animals infected with Rabies virus and so have a lower *spread* than less developed countries. Likewise more developed nations have access to the **Rabies Vaccine** which mitigates many of the Rabies infection cases that would arise. This divide is stark: about 3 people die each year in the United States from Rabies while there are about 70,000 cases of Rabies worldwide each year.\n\n* When we think of Rabies we generally have a very specific mental image: a foaming mouth dog runs up out of the woods and bites you on the arm. BAM, you got the Rabies and that’s not too far off. Dogs represent the most common reservoir for Rabies worldwide (>90%) but in the United States and Europe you are more likely to get Rabies from bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes. The ultimate question becomes: how does rabies spread before it gets to the human?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/embcnobyi02a1.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d45d9d69b78f598d2845d66cfd0f3c415a5f8e1\n\n* Rabies is caused by the ***Rabies lyssavirus***, a kind of neurotropic virus (one that infects nerve tissues) which includes other more…common? famous? More infamous viruses like Polio, Hand-Foot-Mouth Disease, and Coronavirus. Unlike our cells which use a double-stranded helix of DNA to store genetic information, the Rabies virus is a single strand of RNA tightly wound around viral nucleoproteins. In fact the entire Rabies genome is just five genes which take over our cells’ protein factories like a—well, a virus to produce more viral components. Now this should seem weird: our cells only know how to use DNA for making proteins, so how does a virus turn its viral RNA into DNA so it can be made into proteins? Well that’s where a special enzyme called **RNA Reverse Transcriptase** comes in! RNA Reverse Transcriptase has a very specific pathway: turn viral RNA (vRNA) into viral DNA (vDNA) so it can be incorporated into the human DNA and cause them to make viral proteins. But we are getting ahead of ourselves, let’s look at how the virus reproduces:\n   * A) Firstly the virus needs to infect the host and then get to the kind of cell that it will infect. Polio infects the nerve cells found in the brain stem which is why it is so devastating to movement and breathing. Coronavirus is known to infect the outside layer of throat cells and lung cells while HIV infects specific white blood cells called CD4 cells. In order to bind, the virus **Adsorbs** (1), or sticks tightly, to the surface of the cell and then waits for the cell to curiously internalize the virus. Since most cells are lower in pH (more acidic), the cell allows the virus to penetrate into the cell where the outside coating of the virus peels off. The virus has now **Penetrated** (2) into the cell.\n   * B) Once inside the cell, the outside coating of the cell **Uncoats** (3) leaving just the viral RNA and the Reverse Transcriptase enzyme. The enzyme then runs over to the vRNA and uses the cell’s resources to form a double strand of viral DNA through **Transcription** (4). \n   * C) Now that we have the vDNA inside the cell, the cell gets to work processing that information. Think of DNA like baking instructions—it tells the cell exactly how to build new proteins from the vDNA. The 5 genes inside the vDNA encode for 5 proteins (N P M G L) which take over the protein making ability of the cell. Instead of producing the protein the cell needs to do its job, the cell switches to only **Translating** (5) the viral DNA into viral proteins effectively becoming a virus making machine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/likwm2tzi02a1.png?width=668&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3dffd6f2b2cfd9c79c1c91ba548f80aab714066\n\n* D) One of the cleverest parts of those 5 proteins is that they know how to spontaneously assemble once a critical amount of them has been made. After generating a few hundred thousand proteins, the 5 proteins come together (6, 8) to form baby viruses ready to be expelled and infect other cells. The viruses then **Bud** on the outside of the cell and are released (9). Scary eh?\n\n# You must destroy the head to stop them from coming back\n\nIn order to be effective a parasite has to get to the cell of infection. For HIV that is easy because white blood cells circulate freely in the blood, so simple exposure to the HIV virus can almost certainly lead to infection. The Herpes virus infects skin cells which is why it is so easy to get a Herpes infection simply by rubbing up against a Herpes flare up. The Ebola virus has lots of targets: nerve cells, endothelial cells which line blood vessels and tubes, adrenal cells which produce hormones, and liver cells. This is why Ebola infections lead to such severe symptoms like major hemorrhage. Rabies’ goal however is to get to the brain, a not so easy task considering we have many defenses that prevent foreign objects from getting into the brain. But like any infection, the first step is the cell getting into the body which in this case comes from direct contact with saliva infected with the virus.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fz1obon1j02a1.png?width=519&format=png&auto=webp&s=4beddad88a09b2e48151424b7fdb514fb0878471\n\n* Let’s set it soon: you are out in the woods enjoying a walk when a raccoon comes out of nowhere and attacks you. You managed to fight it off and punt it away but it scraped your hand with a tooth before you were able to get away. You decide to head back to your car and by the time you get home to wash your hand it has been more than 2 hours. Since it's a pretty minor cut you don’t go to the hospital (first mistake!) and decide to treat it with antibiotics and a BandAid. So what happens? \n   * Well Rabies goal is to get into a nerve cell and replicate inside of it and the skin is full of many different kinds of nerve cells. Those nerves, which sense things like hot/cold, pain, and movement, all eventually lead to the spinal cord and brain via a series of **Synapses**. If the Rabies virus is able to infect one nerve cell, eventually it is able to replicate and then get released onto the next closest nerve to the brain. Then replicate and get released to the next one. Then the next, and next, and next until eventually it gets to the brain. This is not a quick process (unlike becoming a zombie) and takes about 3 to 12 weeks (shorter if closer to the brain).\n      * The initial symptoms are pretty non-specific: you’ll have some flu-like symptoms like fever, malaise, and maybe some night sweats. This’ll occur about 1 week after the initial infection and by then you’ll probably think you caught some sort of cold. A more telling **Prodromal** sign is local numbness and pain at the bite site—which you may think is soreness from the bite but the numbness is from your nerve cells being destroyed by the virus. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7c8xovl2j02a1.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=c923806eeeff920a83b23cfbccd943c543a320e7\n\n* Once the Rabies virus reaches the brain, things are pretty much over. Because the brain is so dense in Synapses, the virus is able to jump from nerve to nerve easily and infect rapidly. By this time the body knows something terrible is happening and the person will experience anxiety and agitation which may result in physically fighting those who are trying to help them. The lack of clear signals and stimulus results in confusion, hallucinations, and eventually seizures as the cells die. Intense stimuli, like light, results in **Photophobia** making the person (or animal) search for dark places to shield their eyes. Instability in the central nervous system leads to overexcitation of the **Autonomic Nervous System** which is our rest and digest drive. This is seen as the **Hypersalivation** and **Hyperhidrosis** (excessive sweating) which gives the scary stereotype of the Rabies infection. \n   * The telltale sign of a Rabies infection is **Hydrophobia** or fear of water. Literally. Rabies patients experience an involuntary, painful throat muscle spasm while trying to drink water. Later on in the disease, the sight of water alone is enough to induce vomiting, panic, and violence. Now is this actual fear of water? Well…not exactly but it is as close as it gets to a fear of water. Because the throat is spasming and the person is unable to swallow effectively, the body refuses to ingest anything that needs to go through the esophagus. The fear of swallowing is so severe that the body refuses to ingest water or **swallow the excessive saliva they are producing**. This is what creates the foaming mouth, dripping with saliva. To see an example of this fear, here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtiytblJzQc) of a 48 year old male with Rabies refusing to drink water.\n   * The cause of death for Rabies victims is usually due to prolonged seizures, respiratory failure due to the atrophy of the brain stem, or cardiac arrest. Death comes within one week of central nervous symptoms and there is almost no chance of survival (<0.0001%). \n\n# But that one girl survived Rabies!\n\nYou do not know how much editorializing I had to sift through in order to get to the *actual* protocol that this patient went through in order to survive Rabies. See, the media has this issue where it will take the most headline part of a report and cherry pick the details to fit a more accessible narrative for their audience. So how did this one person move the needle from 100% fatal to 99.99% fatal? It was a fateful night in September of 2004, “Yeah!” by Usher was probably playing and Facebook was launched. 15-year old Jeanna Giese (Gee-See) was walking in the woods near St. Patrick’s Church in her hometown of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin when she came across a bat struggling on the ground. Wanting to rehabilitate the animal, Giese picked up the bat and sustained a small bite on her left forefinger. Giese dropped the animal and went home where she treated the wound with hydrogen peroxide and her mother decided that medical attention wasn’t warranted.\n\n* Over the next thirty days Giese started to become fatigued and a tingling or numbness in her left hand. By day 32 the girl started to lose her balance and experiencing diplopia (double vision) and the next day was so nauseous she couldn’t ingest anything. Her pediatrician referred her to a neurologist who observed the double vision and partial-bilateral sixth-nerve palsy (ocular muscle paralysis). MRIs revealed that the brain wasn’t experiencing a stroke or aneurysm so she was sent home without a definite answer as to what was causing her illness. On day 34 she was admitted to her local hospital for lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to test the spinal fluid and for supportive care. On this day she was alert, un-feverish, and able to follow complex instructions but still showed an unsteady gait, double vision and the sixth nerve palsy. The lumbar puncture revealed a high white blood cell count which would indicate some sort of infection but it would take at least a day to get cultures back for what kind of bacteria she was infected with. \n   * On day 36 the bat bite was reported to the hospital staff and Rabies was included as a possible diagnosis. By this time her speech was becoming slurred, had sustained tremors in her left arm, and her temperature rose to 102F (38.9C). Now that Rabies was considered, spinal fluid and saliva samples were sent to the CDC for Rabies testing and multiple MRIs revealed deterioration of the brain tissue. By the end of the 36th day she was presenting hypersalivation and needed to be sedated and intubated (have a breathing tube put in place) in order to manage her care. The CDC called back that Rabies antibodies were positive in her blood and Giese was infected with the virus and currently in the throes of late stage Rabies.At this point Giese was placed in a drug-induced coma and was using a ventilator to breathe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sqt3vj05j02a1.png?width=803&format=png&auto=webp&s=412fee4ee0b8b28a6f5e1b0539433bb1fbc1420b\n\n* This is when the insane part of the story jumps in. Jeanna Giese’s doctor, who I believe is Rodney E. Willoughby Jr M.D. counseled John and Ana Giese about two options: either the medical team could provide hospice care until Jeanna ultimately died or they could try an experimental and *untested* theory that would combine anti-excitatory and antiviral drugs. Despite the high risk of failure or severe disability, the Gieses decided to try the protocol and the team started to prepare for their hypothesis. The two parts of the theory were to use antiexcitatory drugs to shut down the viral replication that the virus was hijacking inside the cells and to administer antivirals to kill the virus when it burst out of the cells and tried to infect new cells. Ketamine and Midazolam was administered so that brain activity was limited to just one to two seconds every 10 seconds. \n   * On day three of her coma, the team administered the first antiviral **Ribavirin**. Ribavirin is known to work well in the periphery but has a very hard time penetrating into the brain and spinal cord from the blood, so the drug was administered directly into the spinal space. **Amantadine**, another antiviral, was added on the fourth day to synergize with the Ribavirin and because it should have anti-excitotoxic effects (reduces the toxicity of the other drugs). \n   * To maintain the burst suppression of her brian activity, Barbiturates like **Phenobarbital** were swapped with the Benzodiazepine Midazolam. This was mostly because there were no preservative free Midazolam products on the market so they had to settle for one that contained 1% Benzyl Alcohol and monitor for red blood cell breakdown and acidosis (making her blood too acidic). In addition to maintaining adequate levels of oxygen in the blood, she was constantly being transfused with oxygenated blood since her brain was not telling her heart to beat anymore (remember, they are actively suppressing her brain’s ability to control the function of the organs).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/txjxx5w6j02a1.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc66e4e0e905d774d1628f998d7a0598aed78cab\n\n* By day eight of her coma the amount of hypersalivation was decreasing and the disruption of the virus on the heart's function was decreasing. Her skin started to regain some color, bowel function returned, and liver function started to increase. A new lumbar puncture revealed that her body was producing antibodies against the virus and was starting to take over the fight against the virus. Jeanna was starting to fight back. On day 12 her fever peaked and did not respond to multiple antipyretics (anti fever) like Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen, Ketorolac, or external cooling (via an ice bath). Day 14 saw an increase in anti excitatory drugs Ketamine and Diazepam which also didn’t touch the fever. At this point her fever was staying right at 103F (39.5C) and would not go down. Luckily a reduction in the room temperature by 40F (5.5C) did result in a drop in fever temperature to 65F (18C). Yes, that is very cold. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/md51n728j02a1.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c9eb8b6339facbe5c0fd58a0967deb433d09753\n\n* Despite the scariness, her knees remained sensitive to patellar tendon reflex (when they whack your knee with the hammer to test the response) and on day 14 her eyes blinked in response to eye drops. On day 16 she opened her mouth and raised her eyebrows when she heard speaking. Three days later she was able to wiggle her toes and squeeze her hand when commanded. Day 20 saw an attention span of 10 to 30 seconds and by day 23 she was sitting up in bed with her head held upright. At the end of the week she was extubated from the ventilator and maintained 60 seconds of alertness. On day 30 she burst into tears spontaneously due to sadness rather than fear or pain and reported no numbness in her skin. On her 31st day of being hospitalized, Jeanna was declared non-transmissible and no longer kept in isolation for fear of transmitting the virus. On day 76 she was discharged and returned home. \n* By November of 2005 (\\~1 year later), Jeanna did not show any signs of significant neurological damage and was able to walk on her own, returned to school, and learned to drive. She did experience left sided weakness and has difficulty functioning and balancing with that side of her body. Despite the odds, Jeanna graduated from highschool and graduated with a degree in biology from Lakeland College in 2011. She is now married with three children in Wisconsin and is an advocate for rabies education. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/grtrb8w9j02a1.png?width=788&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3a70431c5122caec6b217463ff9462684f8c9c0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pmv4rwzaj02a1.png?width=677&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb10ca6858ccb094ef0a414ebd8dc4585d4a724f\n\n# So what does the Milwaukee Protocol teach us?\n\nI think the wild success of Jeanna Giese can be a beacon of hope for those affected by Rabies and their families—it moves the needle from a 100% fatal condition to one that, with a lot of good medicine and luck, there is a chance. When we have these radical discoveries however, I think we tend to overlook that this was experimental and since 2004 there have been 8 revisions to the Milwaukee Protocol and it isn’t always successful. Since 1998, there have only been 10 people who have died from Rabies in the United States. In May 2006, Texas doctors attempted the Protocol on 16-year old Zachary Jones who was bit by a bat that had flown into his room while he was napping. Jones caught the bat in a towel and released it. Zach returned to swimming and football the next day and didn’t think much of the strange encounter with the animal. Zach was bit on May 4th, 2006 and died on May 12, 2006—just 8 days despite the Milwaukee Protocol being attempted. In November 2006, 10-year old Shannon Carroll also died despite the Milwaukee Protocol being applied. And yes it was a bat. \n\n* So what should we get from these other examples? First off, if you get bit by a bat, GO TO THE HOSPITAL (we will talk about the vaccine soon). Secondly, if you get bit by a bat, **GO TO THE HOSPITAL DUMMY.** Okay seriously. Since Jeanna Giese there have been 36 patients treated with the Milwaukee Protocol and only 5 have survived. A 14% success rate doesn’t seem very great but remember the flip side—a 100% fatality rate—so any number above 0% is a success in my eyes. Some doctors in the infectious disease community believe that the Milwaukee Protocol is a failure and shouldn’t be applied but I haven’t found any offers of a better alternative. Some aspects have been improved upon, like which drugs to use and the timing of the drugs, but using the MP is less of a science and more of an art. Would I want it to be used on myself or a loved one? Yes. Would I use the MP on a patient that I had? Probably and if I get permission. But is the MP an end-all be-all success? No, unfortunately enough. \n\n# I will never go outside again and I now hate bats\n\nWoah there. Before you start sealing up all the bat caves you can find and destroying an important mammal in our ecosystem, we do have a treatment against Rabies that is very successful and that would be the **Rabies Vaccine**. Unlike other viral vaccines, studies have continuously shown that the Rabies Vaccine is 100% effective when it is **immediately and appropriately administered** to someone who was bitten by a suspected Rabies animal. Notice those two words: immediately and appropriately. So what should you do? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xsbb9uncj02a1.png?width=805&format=png&auto=webp&s=a81b8f0e637bc78472304007475ef95031db9bbf\n\n* First off, if you have been bit by a wild animal, go to the hospital or clinic THAT DAY and get a rabies shot (and/or tetanus). Now there are certain animals that are known not to carry Rabies like reptiles, amphibians, birds, or insects which leaves only mammals as potential suspects. Generally herbivores like ungulates (llamas, horses, pigs, deer, and cows) do not transmit Rabies due to running from humans rather than seeking them out in their Rabies agitation. Carnivores however do seek out prey and if you get bit by a carnivore (wild or domesticated), you should go to the hospital immediately, THAT DAY. **Do. Not. Wait**. If you do wait and develop a fever within a few days of getting bit, **GO TO THE HOSPITAL AND GET A RABIES SHOT.** Please?\n   * The Rabies Vaccine can take on two different forms. Passive Immunization is done by injecting the site of infection with viral antibodies to teach the body and scare it into thinking there is a Rabies infection and produce antibodies. Now this passive immunization is good for the immediate time—it will provide immunity for a few weeks to a couple of months. But sometimes Rabies can incubate for up to a year which is why we give the next vaccine: active immunity. This consists of 4 intramuscular Rabies shots given on day 0, 3, 7, and 14. Yes it’s not fun to get 4 shots but it’s LESS fun to get full blown Rabies, so pick your battles. On day 14 we take a blood sample to make sure there are sufficient anti-Rabies antibodies in the blood. This 4 shot series gives about 2 years of exposure prevention but could be as little as six months. So don’t think that getting one earlier in the year will prevent another bite later in the year. \n\nSo take this as a big warning: even the smallest bites and scratches can be incredibly deadly.

    "body": "Du skal bruge en solcreme og der er 445 produkter at vælge imellem, så hvad hulen skal man vælge? Til at løse dette problem har jeg konstrueret et lille program der kan læse ingredienslisterne på Matas hjemmeside og efter lidt manuel oprydning i data er jeg nået frem til en lidt mindre liste og tænkte jeg ville dele mine resultater her.\n\nJeg har været ret striks i mine krav, da jeg er af den opfattelse at solcremer o.l. bør beskytte mod solen og derfor ikke bør indeholde parfume, farve, smag(!?) og lignende skrammel der ikke tilfører nogen værdi.\n\nI alt var der 445 produkter på det tidspunkt jeg hentede data (mindre end 2 uger siden).\n\nAf disse havde 103 ikke opført ingredienser og er derfor ikke med.\n\nAf de resterende havde 135 hormonforstyrende stoffer, mere specifikt er produkter med følgende ingredienser sorteret fra:\n\n* avobenzone\n* octocrylene\n* lavendel\n* benzophenone-3\n* benzyl salicylate\n* bht\n* bha\n* butylparaben\n* methylparaben\n* propylparaben\n* ethylparaben\n* homosalate\n\nAf de resterende 207 produkter havde 73 opført parfume/fragrance/aroma o.l. som vitterligt kan dække over hvad som helst inklusiv skadelige stoffer og er derfor sorteret fra.\n\nAf de resterende 134 produkter havde 2 opført parfume blot under deres kemiske betegnelse, mere specifikt:\n\n* limonene\n* linalool\n* citronellol\n* geraniol\n\nAf de resterende 132 produkter havde 42 opført ingredienser som jeg vil betegne \"problematiske\". Der er ikke helt enighed om de er skadelige eller ej, men jeg valgte at eksludere produkter med:\n\n* sodium lauryl sulfate\n* sodium laureth sulfate\n* methylisothiazoline\n* denatureret alcohol\n* propylene glycol\n* benzyl alcohol\n* benzyl alcohol citral\n* benzyl benzoate\n\nAf de resterende 90 produkter havde 12 farver i. Dvs. enhver ingrediens der starter med CI efterfulgt af et nummer, dog ikke zink og titanium dioxid da de fungerer som solfiltre.\n\nHerefter sorterede jeg alle produkter fra med en SPF værdi mindre end 30 og så er der 66 tilbage fordelt på følgende 4 kategorier sorteret efter billigste pris pr. liter/kg:\n\n**SOLCREMER/OILER:**\n\n|Produkt|Pris pr. liter/kg|Url|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Matas Striber

På denne tid af året bliver jeg nemt solskoldet, resten af året er det for min huds skyld + jeg bruger hudpleje der gør huden endnu mere sensitiv overfor solen (glykolsyre). \n\nDet mest vigtige for mig er at det er behageligt at bruge, hvis det ikke er det så får jeg det ikke taget på... I den forbindelse er jeg glad for Niveas ansigts solcremer bl.a. deres spf 50 face til sensitive hud (dog er den dårlig under makeup) og dem fra Garnier til ansigtet, de har bl.a. en tyndtflydende solcrememælk der tørrer mat på huden. \n\nJeg har prøvet Matas egen solcreme, men jeg kan slet ikke deres konsistenser! \n\nTil kroppen er enten et apoteksmærke, som f.eks. La Roche Posay, Bioderma, Avene osv. gode og ellers så laver Garnier og Nivea hæderlige solcremer til gode priser. \n\nI forhold til din liste af ingredienser du valgte også at ekskludere, synes jeg især det er interessant at sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, denatured alcohol og propylene glycol er inkluderet. De er alle fire totalt almindelige ingredienser i hudpleje (Dog er sodium lauryl sulfate og sodium laureth sulfate mest almindelige i sæber og renseprodukter) og jeg forstår ikke hvorfor du har skåret dem væk? Denatureret sprit fordamper efter applikation (og kan hjælpe med at solcremen tørrer ind) og ja det kan være udtørrende i nogle formularer, men ved hudpleje er det altid vigtigt at tage højde for formularen og ikke de individuelle ingredienser kun. Du kender jo selv at du kan bruge vand, mel, sukker og æg til at lave en del forskellige opskrifter, hvis du varierer metode og forhold... \n\nPropylene glycol i solcreme kan hjælpe solcremen med at sprede sig bedre på huden og hjælper med at opløse andre ingredienser i solcremen, da det er er godt solvent til mere hydrofobe stoffer. Det eneste jeg ved til kan være problematisk ved propylene alcohol er at det kan være irriterende for huden i høje koncentrationer (50% eller mere), men du vil sjældent se det brugt så koncentreret :p\n\nMichelle Wong, som er kosmetisk kemiker og har en PhD i kemi har skrevet på hendes blog om både [propylene glycol](https://labmuffin.com/what-are-propylene-and-butylene-glycol-and-are-they-safe/) og [SLS](https://labmuffin.com/whats-wrong-with-sls/).",

The scent, made with safe ingredients, is packaged in a handy case resembling the smooth curves and texture of an egg, giving you a pleasant feeling anytime, anywhere.”\n\nhttps://www.tamburins.com/en/item/1695801896/\n\n\nI love eggs so the adorable container is instantly appealing, i love drinking milk tea and it smells like one, i could always use more lip balms, so i decided to get one when i saw it at ICN.\n\n \nBought for USD19 duty-free at ICN airport.\n\n\nMy lips are okay, doesnt get dry or crack often that i need lip balm everyday but they’re nice to layer under my lip colour or gloss.\n\n\nPackaging & Application:\n * Egg-shaped tube, twist up for more product. Comes in a sturdy, fancy box. Great for gifting.\n\n\n * Material & Design:\nEgg container is most likely made out of some plastic material but textured to resemble real eggshell. Imagine the softest sandpaper. No info on website.\n\n\n * Ease of Use:\nOpen cap, apply directly. Twist up the egg for more product.\n\n\n * Portability: It’s a flat little egg and fits in \n the slimmest bags, very handy.\n\n\n * Durability: Sturdy, quality packaging. Use some caution when taking cap off and putting back on. Certain angles may cause the cap to come in contact with the balm. I accidentally scooped a tiny bit of it just now with the cap.\n\n\nIngredients & Formulation:\n * Bis-Behenyl/Isostearyl/Phytosteryl Dimer Dilinoleyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil Dimer Dilinoleate, Phytosteryl/Isostearyl/Cetyl/Stearyl/Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Wax, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Seed Oil, Phytosteryl/Behenyl/Octyldodecyl Lauroyl Glutamate, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Synthetic Wax, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Fragrance(Parfum), Benzyl Alcohol, Linalool, Lecithin, Geraniol, Limonene, Tocopherol\n\n\nManufactured by Cosmax Co. Ltd.\n\n\n * feels oily, smooth and thin upon application- elegant formulation.\n\n\nScent & Flavor:\n\nTop: bergamot, lemon \nMiddle: black tea \nBase: coconut\n\nWebsite:  “based on black tea with a subtle flower smell, this scent brings you the soft scent on the tip of your nose when you drink a glass of black tea with a drop of warm milk, and the warmth gives you the comfort you feel when you take a full rest. Fresh and refreshing bergamot and lemon blend with the bittersweet feeling of black tea, adding layers for daily use. The coconut note adds a soft and sweet finish to the lingering fragrance.”\n\n\nMy thoughts:\n * subtle, pleasant fragrance of milk tea as if you just had a sip.\n * milk tea scent fades away after a while and does mot linger, good if sensitive to smell but still enjoys some fragrance.\n * unscented/unflavored version also available.\n\n\nPerformance & Effectiveness:\n * Immediate Hydration: when used in comparison with my current lip balm from hersteller and lip oil from Sampar addict, this balm is definitely more moisturizing.\n\n\n * Long-Term Hydration: one application lasts 3-4 hours without drinking/eating.\n\n\n * Healing Properties: pretty much immediate relief for chapped lips soon after application.\n\n\n * Protection: tested in a dry, airplane cabin for 7 hours. Held up well and lips remain moisturised upon disembarking.\n\n\n * Overall Comfort: feels pleasantly creamy on the lips and milk tea scent fades over time.\n\n\nLongevity & Value for Money:\n * i dont use lip balms often/everyday, only as needed.\n * Considering the price of USD19 for 5g of product, i dont think this is cost-effective.\n\n\nWho Would This Be Good For?\nGood for you if you find eggs cute, enjoys drinking milk tea,  need a quick relief for chapped lips and most importantly have USD19 laying around for fun money.\n\n\nWould You Repurchase?\n * No WNRP but only because i already bought it once and have the container now. I plan to refill it myself with a cheaper alternative. Would not pay USD19 for another lip balm.\n\n\nOverall Rating:\n * 4 out of 5, would WRP if it was USD9 and not USD19.\n\n\nTL;DR cute lil egg lip balm that smells of delicious milk tea, instant relief for chapped lips but quite pricey at USD19 for 5grams. Fun gift and souvenir.",

    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin.

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

While you might have had a bad experience, using acids with retinol will NOT cause more breakouts as you erroneously suggested, and on the contrary many dermatologists recommend using benzoyl peroxide in conjunction with retinols to stave off purging and help acne heal faster. You can say be careful using acids, but speaking so definitively about something that is completely not true and unfounded (especially about it somehow causing more breakouts) is something that needs to be editing or removed.",

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

I sure hope people are buying it so it doesn't get discontinued. I got it for maybe 6000 KRW for the 50 ml tube and it's such a nice moisturizing vehicle with Tinosorb S and Uvinul A Plus. So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea?

        "body": "My Mom had subtype 3, with thickened skin. She had it really badly her whole life. I have some rosacea but have done my best to try to not wind up like her.  Sadly, I gave up on facial sunscreen a number of times because they irritated me or made my eyes swell shut. I currently use Dermologica which is really spendy and I am not sure it's coverage is that great, but it's the only thing I can use on my whole face so far.\n\n\nTwo things than help me a lot were cutting out black pepper and using more foundation. Environmental irritants wreck me, it seems. I used to wear moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, power, liquid, more powder and then setting spray. Very heavy coverage, but I realized that pretty much sealing my cheeks off from the world made them finally calm down, or maybe it was something in the primer. I kept at it for a long time, but now use lighter coverage. My cheeks are red, but not nearly as bad. Between that and two laser treatments I think of my problem as under control, but can't go out barefaced. And since age is a trigger I could be unknowingly doomed to the burning sensation and painful cysts Mom had, but try to live like that isn't lurking around the corner. \n\n\n\nI've never been able to use anything anti-aging, so the ideal that a retinol might actually help me is very intriguing. All my current doc will prescribe me is metrolotion, which never helped in the slightest. I might go talk to a derm at my own cost and see if that or rhofade might be good for me.",

    "body": "Edit: title should be fatty alcohols not fatty acids but autocorrect thinks for me and sees me type acids a lot so naturally I must’ve meant acids. SIGH. \n\n**WARNING: LONG BUT I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE IT WORTH.**\n\nHey all!\n\nSoooo, years ago, I was a big advocate for the [idea that some people cannot use fatty alcohols](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1y3ql7/simple_tip_for_those_of_us_who_cant_use_fatty/). This was due to my experiences with CeraVe Cream, CeraVe Lotion, Cetaphil Cream, and Cetaphil Lotion, primarily. More, I was using Ziana (.025% tretinoin + clindamycin), which I have a strong suspicion in retrospect was the cause of a form of folliculitis for me (perhaps chemical folliculitis -- there are several types of folliculitis but in this case, acne that is not \"acne,\" but rather born of continuous irritation of the hair follicles). Of course, like *everyone* going through acne, I blamed every skin product I was using except the prescription active that was *designed* to make my acne better. After all, a doctor gave it to me, and a doctor wouldn't give me something that would make me \"sicker.\" \n\nUnfortunately, it turns out that by the time I started to figure this out, it was all way too late. To this day, I have light pitted scarring in places from an 8 month moderate-to-severe zit explosion on my face that never ceased. It has taught me a lot and pressed me to learn a lot about how skin *actually* functions. I was told the entire time I was breaking out that it was just \"purging,\" only to realize what a misnomer \"purging\" kind of is -- implying the skin is holding onto infections waiting to churn out of it's layers rather than comedones -- open or closed -- that are visible, as well as microcomedones that are the beginning of an acne spot but invisible to the naked eye. At the time, purging to me implied that there were acne spots in the deeper layers of my skin waiting to come out. \n\nSo in the process of me flailing, I felt like this class of ingredients that are otherwise harmless were my bane: fatty alcohols. These are stearyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, and cetyl alcohol. After all, they turned up in *everything* that was breaking me out, including the cleansers, so surely it had to be them, right? \n\nFor example, at one point, I was using Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser + CeraVe Cream. What do these products have in common?\n\n**Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser**\n&amp;gt; Water, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, **Stearyl Alcohol**, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben.\n\n**CeraVe Cream**\n&amp;gt;Purified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20 And **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauryl Lactylate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n\n---\n\nSo being the ingredient hound I am, I connected the dots to \"must be fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives.\" After all, everything else I used had had these ingredients too.\n\n**CeraVe Lotion**\n&amp;gt; Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceteareth-20 and** Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\n**Cetaphil Cream**\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Petrolatum, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, PEG-30 Stearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Propylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n**Cetaphil Lotion** *note - I believe this used to have macadamia nut oil in it when I used it and has since been reformulated. \n\n&amp;gt; Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ceteareth-20, **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Dimethicone, Sodium Levulinate, Sodium Anisate,Caprylyl Glycol, Benzyl Alcohol, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Citric Acid, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer\n\nHappy, I thought, \"This must be it! I solved it!\" So I cut out fatty alcohol products (which, as I am sure many of you know, is a *massive* pain in the ass) and [tried to facilitate others in doing the same](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1ufvym/megalisting_products_without_cetylcetearylstearyl/). In fact, I feel like I was the primary champion of \"it might be fatty alcohols!\" back when this sub was only 25k people, and being as we were all learning from eachother and trusted eachother, many people trusted me in that assumption. After all, I had the proof (supposedly) to back it up.\n\nSo I used the lightest products, such as EltaMD PM (which is a wonderful product, don't get me wrong!). Unfortunately, my skin was parched *all of the time.* It was just sick. It kept breaking out for years after, bottle after bottle of EltaMD PM. Life happened, I was removed from the mod group for inactivity, and I just kept on with it - disappearing from this sub for a long-ass time.\n\nAnd then I started thinking... *what did I use before my skin started down this road?*\n\nBefore I knew jack-all about skin, I used Olay pretty religiously. Olay Regenerist, in the pot, with the fragrance. Yep. This stuff:\n\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Isohexadecane, Niacinamide, Isopropyl Isostearate, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Nylon-12, Dimethicone, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Sodium Peg-7 Olive Oil Carboxylate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ceratonia Siliqua (Carob) Fruit Extract, ** Stearyl Alcohol**, Polyethylene, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Benzyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Dimethiconol, Polyacrylamide, Fragrance, Peg-100 Stearate, Propylparaben, Cetearyl Glucoside, **Cetearyl Alcohol,** C13-14 Isoparaffin, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, C12-13 Pareth-3, Laureth-7, Sodium Hydroxide, Mica.\n\n*\"[Wait a fucking minute](https://media.giphy.com/media/iAYupOdWXQy5a4nVGk/giphy.gif),\"* she thought. \"That shit has cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol and coconut derivatives all the shit I am avoiding. How the fuck did my face not explode then?\"\n\nSo I did something insane: I tried a cream with fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives that was being recommended on this sub at the time (lol). Some of you may recognize this:\n\n**Cheryl Lee MD Ceramide+**\n&amp;gt;Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Coconut), Petrolatum, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Polyglyceryl -10 Pentastearate, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Isostearyl Isostearate, Cetyl Alcohol, 1,3 Propanediol (from Corn), C10-30 Cholesterol/Lanosterol Esters, Ceramide 3, Phytosphingosine, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Niacinamide, Glycyrrhetinic Acid (Licorice Root), 1,2 -Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Gluconolactone.\n\nAnd you want to know something?\n\n90% of my acne healed in a week. 90% of the acne that had been causing me scars and *ruining my fucking life for years* healed in a fucking **week**. I looked back at all the ingredients for all the products that I had avoided and all the ones I had just been able to use fine as a teenager and by fucking god, what did I miss? **Ceteareth-fucking-20** (sans the cleansers -- I still don't know why my skin hated Cetaphil Gentle, but it turns out that it has broken out with every creamy, non-sudsy cleanser ever, so I've resigned myself to using gentle SLES cleansers for life).\n\nI felt like such a massive asshole. \n\nSo that brings me to now, when I decided on a train on a vacation in NYC to start a skin blog. I had spent those years researching my ass off about skin not to even see what a massive fuckup I had made. I had been able to help my BF bring his eczema 80% into control with bleach bath washes and solve my mom's chronically dry skin and my friend's weird case of eczema on his ring finger, but not my own skin. \n\nI came back to this sub after ~5 fucking years (4 of them AFK) and I still see a lot of people avoiding *all fatty alcohols*. I'm making this post to tell you that it might not be all fatty alcohols. It may be cet-20, like me, or it may be those fatty alcohols in combination with other ingredients (combinations of some ingredients can change molecular sizes, some manufacturers use different sources or molecular sized products, like larger or smaller hyaluronic acid, for example). There's so much complexity with skincare, skin, and ingredients that it usually isn't *one whole class of ingredients*. In short: **your mileage may vary**. This is why spot testing is important, one product isn't for everyone, and while ingredient labels are important for weeding out culprits, you also need to do a bit of research on how ingredients work with others to change how they interact on the skin. \n\nSince then, I've spot tested many of the products I flat-out ruled out and 1. it turns out everything with cet-20 does explode my face, 2. it turns out macadamia nut oil also explodes my face (in the cet lotion), and 3. turns out I can use 50% of the things I thought I couldn't (like jojoba oil!).\n\nI'm so happy that many of you have found this sub educational, but **please** consider what you've used in the past (skincare for face, makeup, EVERYTHING) and don't neglect those products when cross-identifying culprits. It changed my life and it might change yours.\n\nSome takeaways, with bullet points because I love bullet points:\n\n* Don't rule out entire classes of ingredients. Skin is super individual and it may be one stupid ingredient.\n* Don't take all of your skincare advice from the Internet, and if you do, try to diversify. Reddit, acne.org, MakeupAlley, medical journals -- get in there and become your own advocate.\n* Sometimes, skin is just an asshole and you won't be able to figure out what it hates. Example: My skin has issues with CeraVe healing ointment and foaming wash, despite them lacking cet-20. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n* Sometimes, what is considered \"good\" or \"best\" for skin isn't good or best for your skin. Example for me: creamy cleansers. They're definitely recommended *everywhere* for *every* skin condition, esp rosacea (which I have), but my skin fucking loathes them all. No idea why, and that's okay.\n* Just because an ingredient is \"good\" for skin doesn't mean it is good for your skin. Example: Me and high % niacinamide = zits. Me and low % niacinamide = k.\n* Just because it's a prescription doesn't mean it can't fuck you up, fam. I thought prescription = good, no problems here, won't cause issues. I have literal scars to prove me wrong. Instead of assuming all is well, **TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR IF SHIT IS UP AND IF YOUR DOCTOR IS LIKE HEY SHIT IS FINE BUT YOU STILL THINK SHIT IS FUCKED, GO TO ANOTHER DOCTOR**. I wish I had done this. Instead, my doc kept urging me to use it every single night. Went to a new doc and he was like, \"Oh no, your skin is very sensitive, that is wayyyy too harsh.\" Listen to your gut.\n* Almost alll skin rules are more like guidelines (except the baking soda, lemon juice, harsh harsh scrubs stuff - that's all still true since they can all throw your skin very out of whack). Example: I do better with light physical exfoliation once a week than AHA any day.\n\nThanks, and I'm sorry for being such a massive, incorrect asshole. I'm doing my best to correct my errors now (and hopefully go to esthetics school though BF is pushing me to do dermatology).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n",

        "body": "Please do dermatology.... or fuck it both!! There needs to be someone on the medical side who can vouch for us not being complete loons about our skin. \n\nYes I have to agree with the sentiment of your post.... over the last few years my skin has been freaking out over every little thing. Too hot, too cold, aha, bha, B3, HA, phenoxyethanol the list goes on. \n\nFor 7months I used Tretinoin 0.025% and built up slowly (I thought), the purge happened. Traumatic. Then just unhappy skin.... but it is gold standard for my issues right? My face said no. \n\nAfter becoming ill last year, severely for 6+ months, all skincare and Tret use went down the drain. Just SS once a day, used as moisturiser. Rarely even washed my face in the evening I was too exhausted. \n\nWhat this did, apart from giving me Cc's and what have you. Was a chance for my skin to repair my moisture barrier on my face. Since medication has helped with the symptoms of my illness,  I have been able to use 1 product in my routine with phenoxyethanol as the main preservative, without it giving me painful pustles and nodules everywhere I experienced before. \n\nI have realised that the rash of whiteheads where ever I use a product with HA in and determined was the HA also happens with high levels of BG. So now planning to test a large molecular weight HA serum to see if I have the same issue without the BG. PG is fine... Propanidol is great. \n\nB3 🤔 causes flushing in my skin. And I'm not really interested in trying again.... \n\nBHA, again let me try again at some point. But method of application might be the issue here. \n\nSo vitamin c seemed out of the lexicon for my skin. I now have a silicone based C vit lined up to trial. \n\nFragerance/ essential oils can still mess me up doh. \n\nMoral of this story for me? Concentrate on keeping healthy skin barrier. The rest comes after.... so cleanse (favourite step), treat (calming, hydrating, emollient and then the acne/PIH target), protect. This approach has been working for me so far.",

Most products that claim to mend split ends don’t have these two ingredients. Also, both ingredients are required for the mending to work and withstand other stresses like combing. \n\n#Here’s the study done on these two ingredients showing the semi permanent mending effects: \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/6111412_Semi-permanent_split_end_mending_with_a_polyelectrolyte_complex\n\n##Brief explanation:\n\nThe cationic, anti static ingredient **polyquaternium-28** is attracted to the anionic ingredient **PVM/MA copolymer**. The idea is that damage and split ends are anionic so the polyquaternium-28 is attracted to them and will bind them together until it is washed out. In the study, these two ingredients were shown to bind together split ends and also withstood the stress of combing.\n\n#Here are some products I FINALLY found that have these two ingredients:\n\n#[Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum 4 oz ($20)](https://www.frendsbeauty.com/kim-kimble-healed-ends-serum-4oz.html)\n\nIngredients: \n\nWater (Aqua), **Polyquaternium-28**, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Arctium Majus Root (Burdock) Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail Extract, Malva Sylvestris (Mallow) Flower Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Saccharum Officinaru (Sugarcane) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Lactic Acid, Ethylhexyglycerin, Betaine, Hexylene Glycol, **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Dimethicone PEG-8 Meadowfoamate, Hexapeptide-11, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nThis one has **polyquaternium-28** as the 2nd ingredient, then some oils, a bunch of extracts, then the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 17th ingredient. Phenoxyethanol as the preservative is fine here since it is being used on the ends, not on the scalp.\n\n#[Color Proof SuperRich Split Ends Mender 3.4 oz ($11)](https://www.beautyplussalon.com/color-proof-superrich-split-ends-mender)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Glycerin, **Polyquaternium-28**, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum, Fragrance (Parfum), **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxypropyl Cyclodextrin, Polysorbate 80, Caprylyl Glycol, Linalool, Citric Acid, Limonene, Sorbitan Oleate, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Citronellol, Citral, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Quaternium-95, Propanediol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Extract, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Hydrolyzed Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Lentinus Edodes Extract, Tocopherol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Benzoate, BHT, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate.\n\nThis ingredients list is interesting, **polyquaternium-28** as the 3rd ingredient is awesome, but the 4th, 5th, and 6th ingredients are two preservatives and a fragrance. That’s fine, as xanthan gum is also a thickener. Then the 7th ingredient is the **PVM/MA copolymer**. Then there’s a bunch of emollients and extracts and another preservative that is annoying to see in products. \n\n##This one contains Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, a **formaldehyde releasing preservative**. This is fine, as the formaldehyde is how it preserves the product, but it is always good to be aware of these things, so you don’t let the bottle sit for a very long time, as this ingredient **releases formaldehyde slowly over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[White Sands The Cure 24/7 Serum 3.38 oz ($20)](https://sleekshop.com/products/white-sands-the-cure-24-7-serum.html?sku=whs09-3-38-oz)\n\nIngredients:\n\nDeionized Water, **Polyaualerium-28**, **PVMMA Copolymer**, Xanthan Gum, Caprylic/Capric Acid, Triglyceride, Cyrribidium Grandilorioum Flower, Propylene Glycol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate, Fragrance.\n\nThis one has a much more simple ingredients list! **Polyquaternium-28** is the second ingredient and the **PVM/MA** copolymer is the third ingredient. Then there is xanthan gum to thicken and preserve. \n\n##However, again, at the end of this list we have **formaldehyde releasing preservatives**: **Diazolidinyl Urea and Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate.** Again, this is fine, but good to be aware of so you don’t let the bottle sit for a year, as these preservatives **slowly release formaldehyde over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[OGX Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream 6 oz ($9)](https://www.ulta.com/p/locking-coconut-curls-air-dry-cream-pimprod2005306)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater (Aqua), Tapioca Starch, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Polyquaternium-37, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Polyquaternium-28**, **PVM/VA Copolymer**, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Lecithin, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nHere we have tapioca starch to reduce any heavy oily feel. Then some emollients and oils. Then **polyquaternium-28** as the 7th ingredient and the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 8th ingredient. Then there’s some more emollients and then the preservative and a fragrance. Phenoxyethanol is a fine because this is for use on the end of the hair, not the scalp. \n\nSo there you have it. You can semi-permanently mend your split ends. It took a LONG time for me to find products that actually had the *combitnation* of BOTH of these ingredients. \n#So if anyone else finds more products that contain polyquaternium-28 and PVM/MA copolymer, please share here!\n\nAlso, for those that can’t tell, the links are imbedded in the title of the product. So, for example, you can click on the title Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum at the top of the post and it will take you to the website. The links are imbedded in every title",

    "body": "Companies sometimes share the percentage retinol they use, but it's good to realize this is sometimes not the percentage of the pure retinol, but of a mixture.\n\nPhrases like \"1% coated retinol\" , \"a 1% retinol complex serum\" or we use \"0.5% slow release retinol\" are indicications they could be referring to a mixture/complex. Percentages like 2.5% or 3% are very unlikely pure retinol. There are also products that mention retinol in the product name, while the products doesn't contain retinol, but a derivative like Retinyl Palmitate.\n\nCompanies may list everything below 1% in random order, so often they try to get that 1% line high up on the ingredient list, and then list the actives first to make it look more potent. You could try to spot that 1% line, it can be helpful to determine wether the % is referring to a mixture or to the actual pure retinol. You can also look for ingredients on the inci list that are used in these standard retinol mixtures, commonly used coated/mixture forms can for example be found here:\n\n[https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1)\n\nSome ingredients that are commonly used at or below 1%:  Phenoxyethanol, Parabens, Levulinic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, EDTA's, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Carbomer,  Hyaluronic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Ubiquinone, Peptides, Retinoids, Ceramides, Fragrance, most plant extracts in powder form etc.\n\n\n\n**First example, M. Asam Retinol 1% Intense:**\n\n* Claim: 1% retinol in encapsulated form\n* Indications it's not 1%: Retinyl Palmitate is usually used below 0.3%. Polyurethane Crosspolymer-1 and Glycine Soja Oil are part of RetiCap PF, most likely this serum contains 0.08% Retinol.\n* Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, **Retinyl Palmitate, Retinol,** Panthenol, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, **Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil**, Tocopherol, Lauroyl Lysine, Dipentaerythrityl Pentaisononanoate, Carbomer, Polyglyceryl- 10 Laurate, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, **Polyurethane Crosspolymer- 1,** Caprylyl Glycol, Bht, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Second example, Inkey List Retinol Serum:**\n\n* Claim: 1% stable retinol and 0.5% granactive retinoid\n* Indications it's not 1%: Tocopherol, Carbomer in general are not used above 1%. Caprylyl Glycol in combination with other preservatives is in general not used above 1%, this means there's less than 1% Dimethyl Isosorbide (part of) Granactive Retinoid, which contains 10% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, so 0.05% in this formula. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (and) Sodium Ascorbate (and) Tocopherol (and) retinol is called RetiSTAR. This contains 5% Retinol, so at 1%, there's 0.05% retinol in this formula. So 1.5% total retinoid, no not really, more likely it's 0.1% max.\n* Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Caprylyl Glycol,** Phospholipids, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Squalane, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Extract, **Carbomer**, Sodium Ascorbate, **Tocopherol,** Polysorbate 60, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycolipids, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol,** Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Third example,**[Dr Brandt 2% Retinol serum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26OFz0DakQc&t=0m13s)**:**\n\n* claim 2% Retinol Complex\n* Why it's not 2%: Tocopherol and Phenoxyethanol are not used above 1%. Could be  \"Retinol C50 by Amcol\" or \"Iuvenesens® B-15\". So most likely 0.3% at most. Think about how the fancy packaging and marketing makes you think this is really worth $70. With all the fragrance ingredients lie Limonene, Grapefruit Oil and Lavender Oil it's best to skip this product.\n* Water, Glycerine, Dicaprylylcarbonaat, Isoamyl Lauraat, Cyclopentasiloxaan, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Boter, Shea Butter Cetyl Esters, Triheptanoin, **Tocoferol, Phenoxyethanol,** Behenyl Alcohol, Methylpropaandiol, Glycerylstearaatcitraat, Polysorbaat 20, Natriumacrylaten Copolymeer, **Retinol,** Glycerylstearaat , Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Limonene, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, etc...\n\n**Fourth example, Sunday Riley A+ High Dose 6.5% Retinoid :**\n\n* Claim: 5% retinoid ester, 1% liposomal-encapsulated retinol, 0.5% blue-green algea\n* Probably the 5% refers to Granactive Retinoid, you can't use 50% of this, so that means there's 0.5% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Which seems correct since the 1% line is around Diheptyl Succinate, and Dimethyl Isosorbide is the 3th ingredient. The Retinol is less than 1%, it's liposomal encapsulated, so this could be \"Iuvenesens® B-15\" as well, probably this means there's about 0.2% Retinol at most. So instead of the claimed 6.5% Retinoid, for $85 you are actually getting 0.2% retinol, 0.5% HPR with no indepedant studies on it's anti aging properties, and some unproven plant extract.\n* Water/Eau/Agua, Propanediol, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Triheptanoin, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Hexyldecanol, Disiloxane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Diheptyl Succinate, Propylene Carbonate, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate**, PPG-24-Glycereth-24, Phenyl Trimethicone, **Retinol, Ubiquinone (CoQ10),** Honey Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Algae Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Opuntia Ficus-indica Fruit Extract, Bisabolol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Phospholipids**, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Lecithin, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, 4-t- Butylcyclohexanol, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Helianthus Annuss (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitol, Cetylhydroxyproline Palmitamide, Polysilicone-11, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Polysorbate, Hydroxyphenyl Propamidobenzoic Acid, Stearic Acid, Brassica Campestris Sterols, PVP, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Alcohol, Potassium Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, **Tocopherol**\n\n**Fifth example: Indeed labs Retinol Reface:**\n\n* Claim 1% retinoid fluid, 1% retinol time release complex encapsulated, 3% retinol like peptides\n* Looking at the position of Dimethyl Isosorbide, there's most likely 1% Granactive Retinoid, so 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Retinol is under the 1% line, I'm not completely sure which form is used but could be Retinol 10S, so this means 0.1% final concentration. Xanthan Gum in normal viscosity products is usually something like 0.2%. Peptides at 3%, this mixture contains 100ppm and 50ppm, so 0.0003% and 0.00015% respectively. So instead of thinking to get 5% pure actives, you are getting something like 0.2%.\n* Water, Dimethicone, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Cetearyl Glucoside, Peg-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, **Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol**, Sodium Acrylate/sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, **Xanthan Gum**, Glycine **Soja (Soybean) Oil, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,** Polysorbate 80, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, **Retinol**, **Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Acacia Senegal Gum, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Tocopherol\n\n**Cerave Skin Renewing Retinol Serum**\n\n* Claim: encapsulated Retinol\n* They don't mention any percentage, but it is below 1%. They could have used ROVISOME Retinol Moist,  Water (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Alcohol (and) **Retinol** (and) Polysorbate 20 (and) Potassium Phosphate. This contains 3% retinol, most likely used at 1-2%, there's 0.03-0.06% actual retinol. So if that is correct I think this is more a beginners retinol.\n* Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, **Polysorbate 20**, Peg-40 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, **Potassium Phosphate,** **Ceramide Np**, Ceramide Ap, Ceramide Eop, Carbomer, Niacinamide, Isoceteth-10, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Triethanolamine**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cichorium Intybus Root Extract / Chicory Root Extract, **Lecithin**, **Retinol,** Silica, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, **Alcohol,** Hydroxyacetophenone, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, **Pentylene Glycol,** Xanthan Gum, Phytosphingosine, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter / Shea Butter, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**The Ordinary Granactive 2% Emulsion**\n\n* uses [InuMax Advanced Retinol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/la/PersonalCare/Detail/2163/637871/InuMax-Advanced-Retinol)\n\nAnd to add one more thing besides the vague percentage marketing, remember that Retinol is very, very unstable. It's very difficult to formulate with pure retinol. So it's understandable companies work with premixed complexes. Though even with these complexes as a consumers you can't be 100% sure it stays stable during the whole shelf life. Some products use dropper bottles or tubes that allow air in formula, and products may have been stored for months in warehouses and stores. It can be fine, but as a consumer it's difficult to know for sure. Remember that for PAO and shelf life stability, tests are done to measure things like bacterial/yeast growth, shifting, pH fluctuations. Doing a stability assay to determine the degradation of specific actives in a formula is **not** a mandatory part of that. PAO and shelf life are thus not a 100% guarantee the actual actives remain stable and effective. If you want something OTC, adapalene is much more stable and you don't have to worry wether you are getting the right percentage, it's a standardized proven formula. It doesn't bind to all receptors and is mainly proven for it's anti acne benefits, but the results for it's anti-aging benefits are promising. Other option could be a Retinaldehyde or a Retinol product that is formulated by a larger well known company, is in airless packaging, and which you store in a fridge at home. \n\n\"It can be difficult to discern the concentrations of OTC retinol and retinaldehyde in a given product as there is no labeling requirement in the  USA to list these concentrations. In general, irritation is a biomarker of efficacy, and formulations that do not produce irriation are unlikely to have significant effects. In addition it is advisable to steer patients toward larger, well-established cosmetics companies with a good reputation. Brandname products from companies that have rigorous quality control and regulations are preferred over products from small manufacturers. Because retinol is a fairly unstable compound and requires proper packaging and storage conditions to maintain efficiency, there can be great variability among preparations.[Cutaneous Photoaging, Watson,  Griffiths, 2019](https://books.google.nl/books?id=6reqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=adapalene+photo+aging&source=bl&ots=AkWsbaI5qq&sig=ACfU3U1l2wWZkLfx3P1VHkbLM_ZyfdoopQ&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjahICuw_znAhXDzaQKHS13DLI4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=adapalene%20photo%20aging&f=false)\" --> to add one thing to this, some studies also indicate that when retinol degrades it becomes more irritating to skin, so irritation is not always a good marker.\n\n\nPersonally I think if you want to be sure, go for prescription tretinoin, that is proven and effective, and often more affordable than retinol as well. Otherwise some options below. \n\n* UK: Dermatica - \"otc\" tretinoin\n\n* US: Curology - \"otc\" tretinoin or Adapalene\n\n* [Paula's Choice 1% Retinol Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice.com/clinical-1pct-retinol-treatment/801.html) - $58/30mL\n\n* [Avene RetrinAl 0.1% Retinaldehyde](https://www.aveneusa.com/retrinal-intensive-cream) - $70/30mL\n\n* [Geek&Gorgeous 0.05% Retinaldehyde](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/a-game-5) $13.50/30mL",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

I purchased three different drugstore hair oils to test and I came to the conclusion that this Pantene hair oil is just as good! It has a runny consistency similar to the Elixir oil as well. In the “dupe” scale Id give it a 9. It’s not a 10 because Kérastase is Kérastase in my opinion, but it’s definitely an amazing dupe. The ingredients aren’t similar, but the effect on the hair is.

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

    "body": "as discussed in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/5aqahi/unpopular_opinions_fall_2016_edition/), the [four-product starter haul](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4gltx6/newbies_why_your_first_haul_should_only_have_four/) that is currently subreddit gospel may not apply well to people with dry skin. herewith, after some discussion with various folks including /u/C_Chrono and /u/theCuriousAmerican, a proposed starter haul guide for dry-skinned newbies.\n\n---------------------\n\nARE YOU A DRY-SKINNED PERSON WHO IS NEW TO AB AND DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO BUY?\n\ntry these 4 (well, 5) products first, numbered in the order in which to introduce them to your skincare routine. buy samples or decants on /r/asianbeautyexchange if you can--it's cheaper than buying full-sized products that turn out not to be right for you. introduce things *one at a time*, at least a few days apart; isolating changes to your routine lets you see what's helping/hurting. (you are \"supposed\" to patch test for two weeks to see if something irritates you, especially if acne-prone.) if anything tingles, burns, or causes bumps/clogged pores, stop using it immediately: none of these ingredients are \"actives\" (i.e., chemical exfoliants) and therefore cannot cause purging, so it's irritation. now, to the products! \n\n---------------------\n\n**the tl;dr version.** if you really just want a list of stuff to try first without all the explanations and potential variations, here are some recs that may or may not work for your specific face. \n\nAM: \ndon't wash your face; spritz with water or swipe with simple brand micellar water (if the pH of your tap water is high--more on this in the comments)\n\napply kikumasamune lotion high moist (via spray bottle or with your hands--it's a thin liquid despite the name)\n\napply cerave cream in the tub or dr. jart+ceramidin cream\n\napply canmake mermaid uv gel or another alcohol-free sunscreen\n\nPM: clean your sunscreen and/or makeup off with either banila co clean it zero cleanser, simple brand micellar water, or a cleansing milk/cream (see discussion in the comments)\n\nspritz with water (if the pH isn't too high)\n\napply kikumasamune lotion high moist\n\n[sheet mask if you want]\n\napply cerave/dr jart cream or (if everything else irritates you or you're really dry) vaseline\n\n---------------------\n\n**the long version: products to buy (decants of) first, and introduce one at a time, in this order***\n\n(1) A HYDRATING TONER (/\"LOTION,\" IF JAPANESE)\n\n* what? a thin liquid product containing humectants, ingredients that draw moisture to the skin. common humectants are glycerin, butylene glycol, propylene glycol, and hyaluronic acid. you will use this both morning and night.\n\n* why? to help hydrate your skin; many dry-skinned people have skin that doesn't produce much oil (\"dry\"), and many also have skin that doesn't contain much water (\"dehydrated\"). a hydrator can make your skin more comfortable quickly.\n\n* how do i choose which one(s) to buy? \n\n(a) have you ever had a bad reaction to skincare products in the past? check out the ingredient lists and see if there are ingredients in common--those might be problems for you. if you have a sensitivity to butylene glycol, your best bet may be a non-AB product: **heritage rosewater and glycerine toner.** (if someone has a glycerine-only AB product to rec, shout in the comments and i'll update!) \n\n(b) too much hyaluronic acid(/sodium hyaluronate) can make you drier, so it might be less risky to go with one that doesn't have hyaluronic acid too high in the ingredient list (higher = more of it). **kikumasamune lotion high moist** is extremely popular in this sub and is HA-free. so is the non-AB **mario badescu rosewater aloe herb spray**, which is cheap and easy to obtain in stores in the US (at ulta, for example).\n\n(c) is your skin damaged, peeling, or flaky? if so, it will benefit from ceramides+cholesterol (skin-repairing ingredients) in addition to a humectant. **rosette ceramide lotion and meishoku ceracolla lotion** have that ingredient combination--NOT the gels from the same lines, the \"lotions\" (liquids).\n\n(d) there are many other beloved potential options if you feel up for some research. if you are in europe and open to something non-AB, /u/Ronrinesu's got [an idea for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/5koy14/4product_starter_haul_dry_skin_edition/dbqj2ok/).\n\n---------------------\n\n(2) A MOISTURIZER (\"cream,\" \"emulsion\") \n* what: a thing containing some amount of oil to \"seal in\" (occlude) the moisture (water) you are adding to your face with step 1, or else it will dry right back out again. you will use this after your toner both morning *and* night. \n\n* why: dry skin is lacking oil. oil helps seal in water and make your skin soft and able to like, move around without cracking. you need oil.\n\n* how do i decide which one to buy?\n\n(a) [this awesome post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3v6yb8/psa_for_your_winter_dryness_most_oils_arent/) lists occlusive ingredients, i.e., those that help seal in moisture. you will want to look for creams that contain ingredients like this.\n\n(b) as with toners, if your skin is flaky or peely, you will want a cream with ceramides+cholesterol. many people swear by **cerave \"in the tub.\"** you may prefer the more-expensive but really wonderful **dr. jart+ ceramidin cream.**\n\nlet me explain: CREAMS ARE A MINEFIELD. a lot of ingredients in moisturizers cause sensitivities for certain people, including:\n\n(i) fatty alcohols (benzyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, etc., etc., etc.) -- if you have a sensitivity to these, you may want to try just a plant oil, since moisturizing creams without them are hard to find. people love **rosehip, argan, and camellia/green tea seed oil**, among many other possible contenders.\n(ii) beeswax (if a cream causes breakouts, this could be a contributing factor)\n(iii) plant oils, e.g., shea butter, coconut oil, sunflower oil, argan oil, rosehip oil, etc. (but a lot of people's skin LOVES one or more plant oils, so don't assume anything about yourself without experience--just be aware that if you're getting bumps, breakouts, or irritation, a plant oil could be the culprit)\n(iv) coconut derivatives like capric/caprylic triglycerides\n\nultimately, you need to obtain small amounts of various creams and oils to test on your skin to see which of these sensitivities you have. start your research on creams with [this awesome list](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4xwoe1/best_products_for_common_skin_concerns_series_dry/) from dry-skinned folks (look under \"gels, emulsions, creams, lotions...\") \n\n(c) if creams are irritating your skin and you need *something* to hold you over until you figure out which ingredients to avoid: straight-up **vaseline** is *the* gold standard for reducing trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL), and you can buy a tiny pot of it without making a big monetary commitment. yes, it is derived from petroleum; no, it is not toxic (purified for cosmetic use) or comedogenic (unlike plant oils, its molecular size is too big for it to clog pores). (only caveat is that it doesn't play well with sunscreen, so you'll need to find something else for daytime before you get to that step.) plain **mineral oil** also works pretty well (and feels less gross than vaseline); if you're in the US, snow river's wood oil is a plain, unscented mineral oil you can get for like, $4.\n\n---------------------\n\n(3) A GENTLE CLEANSER \n\n* what: a low-pH micellar water (check the original first-four post if you want a quick overview of why low pH is important), an oil-based cleanser that emulsifies (washes off) well, (ETA) or a cream or milk cleanser. (ETA:) *not* a foaming cleanser (harsh; you want to be gentle to your skin).\n\n* why? many western cleansers have a pH that is high enough to irritate skin or don't properly remove makeup and sunscreen. that basically means just washing your face stresses your skin. a cleanser that starts you off on a good footing can improve the overall situation.\n\n* how do i decide which ones to buy? if you don't mind scents and oil, i recommend you start with **banila co clean it zero** (in the US, you can buy sample/travel sizes on amazon for something like $2.50, in addition to decants available on /r/asianbeautyexchange). if mineral oil irritates your skin (rare but possible), the \"purity\" version doesn't contain it.\n\nif you want something you can buy in US drugstores, an oil-free option, or something you can swipe on with a cotton pad, **simple's micellar water** is a popular alternative (other micellar waters have high pHes--don't substitute).\n\n(ETA:) if you are ready to do some research to choose your own cleanser (highly recommended!), see the comments below for a long discussion about cream cleansers and milk cleansers (some AB, some not). as you will see, many of the more vocal dry-skinned folk seem to prefer them to oil cleansers.\n\n---------------------\n\n(4) A PROBABLY ALCOHOL-FREE SUNSCREEN \n\n* what: a sunscreen which, to be on the safe side, contains no alcohol. (as mentioned below, not all but many of us dry folks are sensitive to alcohol.) \n\n* why: it's the main way to prevent dark spots, post-blemish scarring (PIH), and signs of aging. \n\n* how do i decide which one to buy? the most oft-recommended alcohol-free one is **canmake mermaid uv gel.** here are [some other suggestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/41y5s9/are_there_sunscreens_without_alcohol/). \n\n---------------------\n\n(5) BONUS ROUND because you can't be a total monk about your first haul: SHEET MASKS, if you want 'em\n\n* what? single-use fabric masks soaked in hydrating \"essence.\" \n\n* why? the fabric sheet acts as a physical occlusive to hold water onto your skin. the single serving means you can try various ingredient combinations without a big commitment. (yes, the packaging is wasteful. yes, a lot of them are expensive. yes, it's ridiculous that they're single-use. if you're not into it, ignore this part and count your saved money!)\n\n* how do i decide which ones to buy? (make sure to isolate introductions of masks as you would other products; don't do two new things at the same time.)\n\n(a) do you mind heavily scented things? that will narrow the field a lot. (searching for unscented sheet masks should get you on the right path quickly.)\n\n(b) next, narrow your search by your other skin concerns, e.g., calming, brightening, anti-acne. or check out the favorites on beloved blogs like fifty shades of snail, vanity rex, and 35th of may, whose proprietors are members of this sub (the last two have dry skin).\n\n(c) check ingredient lists to help you avoid alcohol high in the ingredient list. (for example, innisfree it's real masks are sort of notorious for alcohol content.)\n\n(d) do you want my idiosyncratic and highly personal recommendations? here you go: **illi camellia** (contains camellia/green tea seed oil); **tosowoong dr. troubex** (a nice introduction to fermented ingredients, with lots of calming things like centella and licorice); anything **lululun** (they come in multi-packs and have less essence, which i personally prefer); **elizavecca donkey steam cream masks** (these are one of a kind--coated in thick cream, not \"essence\"). all of these are available by the box in the US on amazon, mostly for $1.50/sheet or less, or you can find some singly at memebox or /r/asianbeautyexchange.\n\n---------------------\n\nPRO TIPS FOR CARING FOR DRY SKIN:\n\n(1) you may not need to actually *wash* your face in the morning. many of us just splash with water. (ETA:) the water where you live may have a too-high pH. you might want to swipe with the micellar water (the pH of which is consistent and low enough, unlike that of tap or bottled water) instead.\n\n(2) spritz your face with a spray bottle of water as the first step in the routine. (it gives humectants something to draw into your skin.)\n\n(3) you may have a sensitivity to ethanol/\"alcohol\"/denatured alcohol/\"alcohol denat\" high on ingredient lists. not all of us do, but a lot of us do. \n\n(4) abandon any preconceptions that heavy night creams will cause breakouts. irritating ingredients will; occlusion on dry skin will not. \n\n(5) a lot of people put toner on their lips and then seal it in with lip balm. this may not be FDA approved, but it can really help with the dryness.\n\nhappy hunting!",

        "body": "This is a pretty good guide, thank you! The only thing I would suggest, is to check your water's pH level as well, especially if you are just splashing water for one of your cleansing sessions. It took me a while to figure this out. I think I was reading a review on Fiftyshadesofsnails where she mentioned being surprised how high her water's pH was, and something clicked. When I tested mine, it was in the 8-9ish range! So sometimes even just splashing water can irritate the face just as easily as those high pH cleansers. I switched to a quick swipe of Simple's micellar water in the morning instead, and the difference in my skin was astounding. So yeah, just wanted to put that out there, because your water is usually the last culprit you would expect!",

Normal is the operative word here because ain't nobody washing their face like actors in a commercial,that's clearly abnormal.\n\n🐳 **What works** : This was recommended by my dermat after a bout of eczema 2 years back and I absolutely swear by it. It's gentle,glides like a dream and doesn't make you feel taut. My ideal cleanser traits  basically match my romantic relationship requirements oof.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't**  : You can't rely solely on this to remove every last trace of makeup. Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n🐳 **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\n🐳 **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ✨ *manifestion* ✨ and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured. [I brought mine from this one.](https://instagram.com/_vivanka_chennai?igshid=5brie36vc4w2)\n\n\n\n🔵 **TONER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **DermaFique All Important Toner** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260\n\n🐳 **Application** : I got this transferred into a mist spray bottle because I quite enjoy the feeling of being spring irrigated. So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\n🐳 **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\n🔵 **SERUM** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (⚠️ensure the dropper doesn't touch your face⚠️) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n🐳 **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\n🐳 **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\n🔵 **MOISTURIZER** 🔵\n\n🔹**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice; Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\n🐳 **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\n🔹 **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\n🐳 **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔵 **SUNSCREEN** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\n🐳 **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\n🐳 **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\n🐳 **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you! Rest your eyes for a bit,it did endure quite a bit of a strain with this one :P",

    "body": "Hello! I just wanted to share my love for panthenol! It has really helped heal my moisture barrier (too much acids!). Personally, I feel like it's been a bit underrated compared to some other ingredients, along with urea. But I think it's starting to make some headway. :\\^)\n\n**Panthenol** is a derivative of Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). It's readily absorbed by our skin and converted to vitamin b5 since it is naturally produced by our bodies. It's approved by the FDA at 2% and higher for wound healing and anti-itching. It also acts as a humectant, drawing water to the skin. (It's great for hair as well!) So it's really effective for strengthening our skin barrier at 2-5%. It's also a penetration enhancer.\n\nHowever, the studies were all done on products with only little amounts of water in them, so for watery products, you may need it at a higher percentage for it to work better ([Swift Crafty Monkey blog](https://www.swiftcraftymonkey.blog/humectants-panthenol-a-closer-look/)), like at **5-10%.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease check out the Western Beauty version of this list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/fz2l58/list_of_panthenol_products_western_version/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Key**\n\nEO = Essential Oil\n\n$ -

And guess what it works on giant cystic acne that TO's bha being completely useless at treating. From what I know it's not available outside of Apac region, which is a travesty because good skincare should be had by all. \n\nBut I'm in Malaysia and Hada Labo is practically everywhere. So the only products I have repurchased so far are rhe super economical ones like Hada Labo's premium hydrating lotion (gold bottle), rich hydrating lotion (the one with 3 molecular weights of ha), premium whitening lotion (tranexamic acid), inkey list niacinamide serum, Q10 serum, bha serum, and their bha cleanser.\n\nYes, fragrance free advocate here.",

    "body": "Take a second to look through these photos. Can you tell a difference between the two sides? Which is which? The answer will be in the comments.  \n\nHopefully I got enough pictures with different lighting. These are all different stages of my routine in the morning.\n\n\nSCENT:\n\nIt has been mentioned in this sub that the DT serum smells like pee. For me it has a clean, neutral scent. I would assume those were bad batches. \n\nIf I were to compare the two, I think Kérastase smells better. It also has a pleasant scent that lingers on my hair for a couple hours. DT does not linger, probably because it’s so neutral.\n\nSecond opinion: \nI asked my boyfriend to smell it too without context, he has a more sensitive nose than me. He stated that it doesn’t smell bad, I asked him if it reminded him of anything and he said it doesn’t. I told him that it smells like a clean scent to me and he agreed. \n\nThen I explained the rumor about it on Reddit and he said:\n“No, it doesn’t smell like urine. I am well acquainted” (referencing my dogs lol)\n\nSo do with that information what you will, maybe he’s just being agreeable 😂 but rest assured, you now have two more opinions on the scent. I would say to smell yours before applying to the hair just in case. I’ll update this post if there are any changes as I use it.\n\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\nDollar Tree (from the bottle):\nWATER, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, GLYCERIN, PHENOXYETHANOL, POLYQUATERNIUM-37,\nPROPYLENE GLYCOL, CYCLOHEXASILOXANE, DIMETHICONE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, PEG-20 STEARATE, STEARTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, FRAGRANCE, C13-16 ISOPARAFFIN, TRIDECETH-6 ACOHOL, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) OIL, DIMETHYL STEARANINE, HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN, ARGANIA SPINOSA KERNEL OIL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, PANTHENOL\n\nKérastase (from their website):\nAqua / Water / Eau ● Dimethicone ● C13-16 Isoalkane ● Niacinamide ● Glycerin ● Polyacrylamide ● Phenoxyethanol ● C13-14 Isoalkane ● Laureth-7 ● Panthenol ● Ascorbyl Glucoside ● Butylene Glycol ● Linalool ● Hydroxycitronellal ● Benzyl Salicylate ● Benzyl Alcohol ● Hexyl Cinnamal ● Citronellol ● Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein ● Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone ● Coumarin ● Hydrolyzed Corn Protein ● Hydrolyzed Soy Protein ● Limonene ● Iris Florentina Root Extract ● Citric Acid ● Ci 19140 / Yellow 5 ● Ci 14700 / Red 4 ● Parfum / Fragrance\n\nOne notable difference in the ingredients is the addition of niacinamide in the Kérastase. Niacinamide is supposed to promote hair growth when used on the scalp. But if you are anything like me, I don’t apply serums all the way to the scalp, I start them from about the middle of my hair through the ends. \n\nBased on this, I do not believe niacinamide is especially helpful in the Kérastase. Niacinamide is probably more helpful in shampoos and scalp products (And now I’m tempted to use a certain DT niacinamide/squalane serum in my hair instead of on my face 🤣)\n\n\nPRICE:\n\nKérastase: $60/3.04 fluid oz, or $19/oz\n\nDollar Tree: $1.25/4 fluid oz, or 31¢/oz\n\n\nTEXTURE:\n\nI put these next to each other on the back of my hand. Kérastase has more of a serum feel, it’s clear/yellow upon application, and it has a little more of an oily texture. DT starts out a little thicker and looks white/creamy at first, then it blends out to be sheer. With both products, I rub them between my hands before applying to hair. \n\n\nMETHOD:\n\nLast night I did my normal shower routine, including a clarifying shampoo and a moisturizing conditioner. I’ve been using this particular duo of products for about 6 months. \n\nI let my hair dry for a couple of hours and applied one serum on each side, washing my hands between applications. Then I put my hair in braids for the night. I didn’t use any other leave-in products before taking pictures.\n\nIn the morning I took out the braids, hand-combed them, brushed through them, and then did some touch-ups to the ends with my curling iron, taking pictures throughout every step. \n\nSo let me know what you think and I’ll put my final thoughts in the comments!

Both sides of my hair look shiny and hydrated. The ends feel great. They are equally manageable. The dollar tree side MIGHT have a little more shine to it, or it could be the angle of my camera.\n\nI seriously can’t tell a difference besides the fragrance (I had to keep smelling each side to make sure I had them right) and the fragrance is not worth $58.25 to me. So you know where I’ll be spending my money.",

I'm not supposed to divulge all these details! \n\n**Product reviews** :\n\n*Note* : None of these products have been used by me on a strictly daily basis, except for a week (or two) in a row during vacations, as I rarely step out of the house (lockdown, duh!) and don't apply sunscreen indoors (\\*gaasp\\* 😨)   \n Rest assured, I've reapplied some when out, and have used them on and off in a span of 6 months. \n\nFrom L-R \n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/s2C99g0N/IMG-20211119-184403.jpg\n\n\n**1-  Nivea Sun Protect And Moisture, moisturising sun and collagen protection SPF 50+ PA++++** \n\n**Quantity** **- Price** : 125 ml - ₹495 MRP\n\n(bought on Amazon for ₹396)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua, Octocrylene, Glycerin, Titanium Dioxide, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Alcohol Denat, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Panthenol, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Myristyl Myristate, Silica, Cetyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Stearyl Alcohol, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Methylparaben, Dimethicone, Trisodium EDTA, Ethylparaben, Sodium Citrate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Citric Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hydroxide, Linalool, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Eugenol, Coumarin, Methyl Benzoate, Benzoic Acid, BHT, Parfum/Fragrance\n\n**Texture** : White - Chalky Color. Medium - Thick Consistency   \n , you have to rub it in for a while for it to get completely absorbed, medium drying speed. Kinda greasy, semi matte finish. Leaves a moderate white cast, not a ghastly one though. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. Smells mostly of Alcohol! (it's one of the ingredients, so obviously..), fragrance is definitely not unnoticeable, but I don't mind it for my body, lingers around for a while. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : Hell yeah! It won't wear off unless you bathe, it survives water splashes and friction from clothes. Be careful while applying it on your feet though, I slip a lot while walking, esp when there's a rush and I put on sandals right after applying it. Give it ample time to dry before stepping out. \n\n**Reapplication** : Since the lotion sits thick on the skin, reapplication is not a bliss, the white cast becomes more noticeable after reapplication, and if you sweat after, oh god it feels a heavy /sticky mess lol, also tends to attract dust, but it's for the body, so I can compromise. 🤷‍♀️\n\n**Overall experience** : It's the best body sunscreen I've tried so far, with the highest protection and I think the brand can be trusted for its spf claims. \n\nI tried using it on my face once, oh nooo, I will never do that again! it kept moving around and just wouldn't get absorbed, plus it stung like hell because of the alcohol, and I literally felt like I was applying fevicol!   \n For my body, yep a thumbs up! \n\n\\*But\\*, if you get acne on your arms  (my arms have a tendency to break out / get textured if I use the wrong product) it wouldn't be the best choice, it seals and chokes the pores, I'd prefer something lighter. I usually wear tops/suits with long sleeves, so not much of the arm is exposed. below the elbow it feels comfortable enough. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WRP**, Hit! (for the body) \n\n**2- Iba Halal Invisible Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++**   \n **Quantity - Price** : 80 ml - ₹395 MRP\n\n(I bought it on Amazon for ₹ 337)\n\n**Ingredients** : WATER CONTAINING EXTRACTS OF ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) EXTRACT & HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) WATER, WATER & ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE & BENZOPHENONE-3 & BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE & PHOSPHOLIPIDS & 1,3-BUTYLENE GLYCOL & PHENOXYETHANOL, GLYCERINE, AMMONIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE/BEHENETH-25 METHACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL AND TRIETHYLENE GLYCOL, ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE, ALUMINIUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE, NIACINAMIDE (VITAMIN B3), TITANIUM DIOXIDE, PERFUME, DISODIUM EDTA, SODIUM HYDROXIDE\n\n**Texture** : White color. Light lotion - cream consistency, very lightweight and water like, kind of runny, it trickles down when you place a dallop on the palm and tilt it.   \n The Best consistency of a sunscreen I've used so far! Not at all heavy, takes some time to dry, esp when using larger amounts (I use 2-3 finger lengths) and still it doesn't feel too much on my face, easy to work with, requires a lot of gentle massaging because it's watery and takes some time to dry and settle in. High dry time.   \n It contains no silicones! My oily skin loves it! Doesn't give a matte finish though, on the glossy (satin?) side, but nothing bothersome.  \n Doesn't leave a white cast! On the Low I'd say, because of the presence of Titanium Dioxide. Absolutely love the texture. Skin feels very hydrated and plump and non greasy. (taaza nikhaar 😆) \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Has a \"fresh\" smell, (bamboo room freshener? idk something like that), moderate level, doesn't linger a lot. I haven't found a \\*good\\* fragrance free budget (\\*my\\* budget) friendly sunscreen yet. So I'm okay with this for now. Sometimes I'm guilty of enjoying the fragrance 😅 because all other products I use are strictly fragrance free. \n\n**Water Resistant?** :  Nope, doesn't survive water splashes or sweat (it won't come off completely in a single splash though, will wash off when sweating profusely) white colored droplets roll down the face if out in the sun for long. (the survival time is slightly more than the La Shield urban protection mineral sunscreen gel though) \n\n**Reapplication** : Breezy! Since it's lightweight, although, you might experience some moving around if there's a \\*lot\\* of product, I'd suggest applying pea by pea instead of taking a finger length at one go, I squeezed out a good amount once while in the car and kept massaging it in for a couple minutes (or more) and felt embarrassed at the weird looks my family and people outside the car gave me.. So yeah.. lol.  It doesn't feel uncomfortable after layers have been built up. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I love it! Although I'm not sure if the sunscreen has undergone the required tests to justify the actual sun protection claims, but that's all I got so far, it fits my requirements of no silicones, negligible white cast, high declared protection, non oily texture, and most importantly budget! \n\nOne important point, it stings when used after physical / chemical exfoliation. So you may want to avoid it after threading / waxing / scrubbing / masking / exfoliating.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Hit! **WRP** (for face) \n\n**3- La Shield Pollution Protect Mineral Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹280 MRP\n\n(bought it on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Purified Water, Octinoxate, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Caprylyl Methicone, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Diisopropyl Adipate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetearyl Alcohol, Brassica Campestris/Aleurites Fordi Oil Copolymer, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Phenoxyethanol, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, C20-22 Alcohols, Isohexadecane, Fragrances, Aluminium Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 60, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trolamine, Disodium Edetate, Sorbitan Isostearate\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Light - Medium gel - cream consistency. Lightweight. Doesn't require a lot of rubbing in. Doesn't move around a lot. Leaves a Low- Moderate white cast. Not the kind typical to mineral sunscreens, but more than the Iba Halal sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Lingers.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Naah, it melts away almost instantly if you happen to sweat while applying it, just a spray (accidental rain drop for example) on the face and it wears off from that spot, minor sweating and it rolls down the cheeks, doesn't adhere to the skin. \n\n**Reapplication** : Medium ease. Moves around, kind of sticky when built up. Medium White cast (visibly noticeable) after reapplication. \n\n**Overall Experience** : Um, I had expected a better performance from this one, looking at the ingredients and all, but it stings around the eyes, and on the face, makes my face somewhat tacky, my face becomes oily by afternoon (if applied in the morning). Personally I didn't like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Miss. **WNRP**.\n\n**4-  La Shield Fisico Matte Sunscreen Gel SPF 50+ PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹630 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹441)\n\n**Ingredients** : Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate\n\n**Texture** : White color, pasty. Very thick, \\*very\\* silicone-y (it's silicone based.. So), chokes the skin, spreadability is good, doesn't require a lot of massaging in, quick dry time. Moderate - slightly high white cast. Makes my face sweat! \n\n**Fragrance** : No. Silicone like.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Definitely. Strong staying power. Survives sweating and water splashes too well. Requires double cleanse or a heavy duty face wash to remove. \n\n**Reapplication** : Hahaha! Go ahead and try it if you want to look like a freshly frosted cake! Don't even \\*think\\* about it. Unless you plan to scare people with your literal white walker look. Been there, done that. I'm forever terrified, and will \\*never\\* do it again.\n\n**Overall Experience** : It's a thick paste, Stings around the eyes, which was surprising it being a physical sunscreen (probably because the zinc is micronized? idk) Reapplication is painful, can't apply more than 2 pea sized amount in the first application. Attracts dirt, Chokes my pores, I can't afford to apply something so pore clogging and then strip my facial skin away to remove it.   \n For me, it's not worth the price performance wise.   \n I'm finishing it off as a primer for occasions, smoothes out the face surface, my face gleamed during diwali :P\n\n**Repurchase status** : Miss! **WNRP**.\n\n**5- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Mineral Sunscreen, SPF 50+ PA++++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹295 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹236)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Silica, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Sodium Chloride, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Perfume, Magnesium Sulphate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Thick cream. Low - medium effort required for blending in the skin. Doesn't move around a lot. Medium - High Dry time. Low white cast (for a mineral sunscreen), medium matte finish. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : No, doesn't survive low- medium sweating. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I haven't used this sunscreen much. My mom used it a few times, and the moment I saw it melting down her face I didn't want to use it. Could have been a great affordable mineral sunscreen, but it's not even mildly water resistant, so I instantly passed on it. Might give it a try in the future. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WNRP**. \n\n**6- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Sunblock and Anti Tan Lotion Tinted Sunscreen, SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 60 ml - ₹245 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water,Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Propylene Glycol, Glyceryl Monostearate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Kaolin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Sodium Sulfite, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Extract, Saxifraga Sarmentosa Extract, Acetyl Tyrosine, Arbutin, Glutathione, Aminopropyl Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dimethiconol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Triethanolamine, Perfume, Disodium EDTA, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Ci 77492, Ci 77491, Ci 77499\n\n**Texture** : Orange color (literally). Medium consistency lotion like. Lightweight. Medium matte finish. Easy application. Doesn't require much effort to blend in. But the color is a literal disaster, it's impossible to apply a full finger length of this sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. On the Higher side. \n\n**Water Resistant** : Maybe a bit more than the mineral sunscreen variant? Not sure, rubs off on the mask \\*very\\* readily. Haven't noticed orange sweat yet, maybe because I haven't worn it enough. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. But I'm pretty sure it's not possible provided the intense color. \n\n**Overall Experience** : It could have been a good,  affordable tinted sunscreen, but the tint is just a disaster.. It dulls my face overall, and it doesn't even work as a bb cream (or sorts) although I don't expect to provide any coverage as per se (which it doesn't anyhow), but I can't find a way to finish it off other than applying it on my hands. Maybe color corrector?? Omg what'd I just come up with 😃💡. Let's see lol \n\n**Repurchase status** : Nope. **WNRP**. \n\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/RVccCB01/IMG-20211119-173651.jpg\n\n**7-** **Malibu LipCare Balm, SPF 30, UVA/UVB** (watermelon variant) \n\n**Quantity - Price** : 5 gm - ₹249-₹299\n\n(bought 2 on amazon for ₹199 each )\n\n**Ingredients** (watermelon) : Petrolatum, Paraffinum Liquidum (Mineral Oil), Paraffin Wax, Ozokerite Wax, Homosalate, Octocrylene, Carnauba Wax, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Flavor  \n May Contain: Limonene, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Citral, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol\n\n**Texture** : Ultra Rich, stiff stick, application is not smooth and breezy, tugs and pulls on the lips if you rush it, tightly press it against the surface, let the balm melt and glide on slowly. Makes lips very soft though. Staying power is great! \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Watermelon. Strong. \n\n**Taste** : Bitter Af! Avoid applying it on the insides and corners to keep it from seeping in. \n\n**Water resistant?** : Definitely! Survives liquids (tea, water, juice for me) not very heavy meals. Apply a thick layer to fight the mask rubbing off. Stays on for hours, afternoon - evening, for example. Keeps lips very soft and supple, no stinging sensation. \n\n**Overall Experience** : The only lip balm with spf 30 (plus uva/uvb protection) that has all the ingredients disclosed. Can't ask for more.   \n The only issue is, I can't use it with my waterproof /transferproof matte lipsticks. It makes them water loving and easily transferable, need to figure something out for that.. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : Unless I find some other lip balm with spf 30 mentioning all the ingredients, in a more affordable range, with no bitter taste, and better sunscreen filters. I **WRP** this. \n\nThats about it! Congrats for making it this far! Thanks!\n\n*Edited to add links to images, since I couldn't upload them with the post*",

I had to test the products adequately before making my mind about them. Other than the products in the picture, I purchased the Milk Protein Shampoo Bar as well. Overall I am very angry at myself for trying these products out.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **0.5% FERULIC ACID, 15% VITAMIN C, 1% VITAMIN E MULTIVITAMIN AGE DEFENSE SERUM**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Distilled Water, L-Ascorbic Acid Vitamin C, Alpha Tocopherol Vitamin E, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, D Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate)\n\n***My experience:***  This is the product I was the most excited about. Vitamin C is a powerhouse of an antioxidant and has many proven skin benefits. L-Ascorbic Acid is the most potent and studied form of Vitamin C, notorious for being highly unstable. I have used a bunch of Vitamin C serums but it can be really hard to find a well-formulated one, especially in India. I so wanted this to work out. Unfortunately, this serum broke my blemish-free skin-so-good spell (or Copper Peptide - will explain later). My skin was perfect right before the ER haul. After trying these products my skin started to break out left right and center. So after being frustrated with my new breakouts, I decided to check the PH of this serum. To my surprise, the PH came out to be PH 6-7. Vitamin C's work best between PH 2-3.5. I contacted the brand to know what they claim for the PH to be. They informed me the PH for the product is \"PH 2.5-3.2\" on their Instagram handle. I took it up further and after a lot of back and forth. [This](https://imgur.com/a/ihKkY6T) is the reply I received from the brand owner.  The preservatives & PH stabilizers that reacted were not mentioned in the ingredients list. I asked her later why they were not mentioned? I was told that the PH stabilizers and preservatives were less than 0.5% and anything less than 0.5% was not required to be mentioned. I, personally cannot understand that L-AA (15% and highly acidic PH 1-2) could turn a PH of 6-7 with just 0.01% of Ph stabilizers (As per what she claimed).\n\n***Texture:*** Thick goopy. I could sort of see/feel the ascorbic acid particles in the serum. It was clear when it arrived but has turned slightly yellow now.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** All in all, the product was unstable and breaking me out (maybe).

It was clear when it arrived.](https://preview.redd.it/a5ikili8bjg51.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd81bcb46e515122c37d2f0c79d1440712e1a2f0)\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **COPPER TRIPEPTIDE + PHYTO CERAMIDE SERUM**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Distilled Water, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Phospholipids (and Sphingolipids, Copper tripeptide-1, Tocopherol, Benzyl Alcohol & Glycerin & Sorbic Acid.))\n\n***My experience:*** I wanted to include copper-peptides in my routine after Gothamista raved about them. I haven't been able to get my hands on the TO/Niod ones. Let's copy-paste everything about my excitement and the sadness in what really happened with Vitamin C, here, as well. Basically, PH came out to be PH 2-3. The brand claimed it to be around PH 6-7. The owner admitted something went wrong. I discontinued usage. I received this product 2-3 days earlier to the Vitamin C serum. I broke out 2 days after introducing the Vitamin C & the Bakuchiol. I thought it was vitamin C that broke me out but in afterthought, it could be this serum as well. Maybe my skin barrier was ducked because of these, maybe it was an ingredient. Who knows? Interestingly this product mentions the preservatives. Not sure if it is because they are in a % above 0.05% or the brand just decided to put these in the ingredients list on the website.\n\n***Texture:*** Watery liquid, blue in color. Did not sting after application, slightly irritated my eyelids.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** All in all, the product was unstable and breaking me out (maybe). I will not be repurchasing unless I find out the changed and fixed the formula.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **SKIN SMOOTHENING SERUM - BAKUCHIOL EXTRACT**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Vitus vinifera \\[Grape seed oil\\], Psoralea corylifolia \\[Bakuchiol Extract7%\\], Vitamin E \\[Tocopheryl Acetate\\], Tanacetum annum \\[Tansy Essential Oil\\])\n\n***My experience:*** I had read a lot about Bakuchiol and wanted to give it a try. Bakuchiol can have anti-acne and anti-aging benefits very comparable to tretinoin as per primary studies. However, Bakuchiol is not the same as Babchi oil. A lot of brands claim to be using Babchi oil and that can actually have some side effects. This [article](https://bakuchiol.net/2019/10/14/babchi-oil-versus-bakuchiol/) explains the difference well. Thus I had contacted ER before purchasing to ensure they were using Bakuchiol and not Babchi extract. They claimed they were indeed using Bakuchiol. On the first experience, it had the typical essential oil smell. The fragrance is toooooo much and it lingers. As per the ingredients list on site, it seems like it could be the Tansy oil, which I have no clue a to why it was added. Essential oils provide no benefit other than fragrance. Since I was breaking out I thought it must be this oil at first. So I just used it once and did not use it again till I found out it could be the products mentioned above. After that, I have tried two attempts to use this product. I tried to use it at night as a face oil. The smell lingers and it can be a good thing or a bad thing(depending on your preference). It is definitely not good for the skin. I didn't experience any breakouts but it did not give me any benefits in the short period I tried to use it. The smell was just too much for me. Thus, I tried to use it as a massage oil, pre-cleansing. It worked well initially. However, I started to notice my face getting red and sensitive after a few days so I stopped. I haven't use the oil ever since. I may give it another attempt but the fragrance is a huge turn-off.\n\n***Texture:*** Lightweight, nonsticky, oily.\n\n***Another issue:*** The ingredients list [on the ](https://imgur.com/a/cQdPBJY)[pack](https://imgur.com/a/cQdPBJY) was different than the one online. I mentioned this issue to the owner as well. She did not respond to this issue. Not sure if this was just another error or if this is the correct one actually.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** Please remove the essential oil from this product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **MILK PROTEIN SHAMPOO BAR**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Cocos Nucifera \\[Coconut Oil\\], Hydrolysed Milk Protein, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, and Cetyl Alcohol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium PEG-7 Olive Oil Carboxylate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Tocopheryl Acetate \\[Vitamin E\\], Benzyl Alcohol & Salicylic Acid & Glycerin & Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My Hair type:*** Low porosity 1c-2a, scalp prone to dermatitis, was experiencing heavy hormonal hair fall during that period.\n\n***My experience:*** I purchased this after hearing a lot of hype around their shampoo bars. This did not increase my hair fall and when it arrived it looked really small but I think a little goes a long way with this one. I think it felt it was really gentle but not suitable for my hair type. It made my hair frizzier and slick at the same time although my scalp and hair both felt clean.\n\n***Status:*** May try another bar better suited for my hair type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **MOIST REPAIR HAIR CONDITIONER**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Distilled water, Glycerine and Water and Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Organic Glycerine, Quaternium-91, and Cetrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetyl Alcohol, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Water & Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit/Leaf Extract & Saccharum Officinarum \\[Sugar Cane\\] Extract & Citrus Aurantium Dulcis \\[Orange\\] Fruit Extract & Citrus Limon \\[Lemon\\] Fruit Extract & Acer Saccharum \\[Sugar Maple\\] Extract, dl-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, Benzyl Alcohol, and Salicylic Acid and Glycerin and Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My Hair type:*** Low porosity 1c-2a, scalp prone to dermatitis, was experiencing heavy hormonal hairfall during that period.\n\n***My experience:*** On the website, they claim that this can be used on the roots as well. I tried that a few times.  It felt like it left a film on my hair and my hair looked greasy like that, thus I just started applying this on my ends. It does help detangle hair in the shower and it makes hair softer. However once dry, my hair becomes frizzier and tangled after wash. Again, I feel it may not be suited for my hair type. I think people which thick hair might like this.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **DEEP CONDITIONER HAIR BUTTER WITH HIBISCUS, SHIKKAKAI & ARNICA EXTRACT**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Butyrospermum Parkii \\[Shea Butter\\], Theobroma Cacao \\[Cocoa Seed Butter\\], Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Ricinus communist \\[Castor\\] Seed Oil, Cocos Nucifera \\[Coconut\\] Oil, Aloe vera Juice, Arnica Montana \\[Arnica flower\\]extract, Water, Glycerin, Persea Gratissima \\[Avocado\\] Fruit Extract, Acacia Concinna Fruit Extract, Tamarindus Indica Fruit Extract, Hibiscus Rosa-Senensis Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis \\[Rosemary\\] leaf extract, Tocopheryl Acetate \\[Vitamin E\\], Olea Europaea \\[Olive\\] Leaf Extract, Water \\[aqua\\].Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol and Salicylic Acid and Glycerin and Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My experience:*** The website claims that this can be used as a leave-in cream as well but I just used it as a hair mask and washed after 1-2 hrs. It left my hair extremely nourished and soft but really greasy. Even after washing it with a sulfate shampoo by hair were pretty much weighed down. I think this would be good for those with thick hair. I liked it for extra nourishment. I will use this up. I didn't notice my hair falling excessively while using this. The quantity is really little though and I am not sure how many uses you can get if you have very thick voluminous hair.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **ORGANIC LIP** **~~SCRUB~~** **STICK**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Organic Cocos nucifera (Coconut Oil, Ricinus communis (Castor Seed Oil, Beeswax \\[Cera Alba\\], Hydrogenated Olive Oil and Olea Europaea \\[Olive\\] Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii \\[Shea Butter\\] and Organic Brown Sugar)\n\n***My experience:*** This product was a complete dud. Maybe I received a lip balm instead of a scrub. Maybe the sugar particles melted. Maybe my product did not have any sugar particles. I rubbed half the product to ensure that they were not buried deep inside. This was just a hard thick balm, not moisturizing at all. It has no scrub particles. This was a major disappointment. I had to contact ER for several days to get this fixed. I have no clue what went wrong with this product.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***OVERALL BRAND REVIEW:***\n\nI appreciate how candid the owner was in admitting what could have gone wrong. Her responses seemed genuine. After much discussion about the unstable formulation, I had to wait a long while before the refund was processed for the defective items. I left reminder emails for the refund which was just very embarrassing. The owner, however, provided me a complete refund for all my purchases which is kind & generous.\n\n***I hate that they did not announce the issues in their batches on their Instagram/website. A batch can have anywhere around 500-20,000 units(approx). If the whole batch was bad, I feel those customers deserve a refund/new product.***\n\nI think the brand is still in the learning stage. I think their hair products may be nice. I can see them working out for some people. The skin care products were a major no-no.  I had a lot of expectations from the brand as they position themselves to be aware and first movers in the Indian skincare industry. I was gravely disappointed to know that the formulas are not well researched and; even though the brand is big on disclosure, they are not purposely going out of their way to list the complete ingredients list. No dyes, colors, preservatives, and ph stabilizers below 0.5% will be mentioned. Their sunscreen has no PA/PPD ratings.\n\nTheir packaging for both the lip scrub and the glass dropper bottle sucks. The bamboo exterior in the packaging is lined with a plastic interior. It makes the caps and sticks bulkier and thus hard to open and close. The brand heavily advertises and markets itself to be a clean/green brand. The bamboo cap packaging just looks like a gimmick though. It serves no real purpose. I appreciate the glass containers and the aluminum pump bottles although. They feel lux. Also, all products are packaged with a lot of newspaper stuffing, which I prefer over bubble wraps. Points for that.\n\nBy their brand marketing, they are trying to cater to both scientific and natural skincare consumers. The owner in a later email claimed that they aren't running the brand for-profit and are very motivated to reinvent the skincare industry. I can see that they are motivated but I cannot see how the brand is not focused on profits. Their products aren't cheap and they have invested heavily in marketing and influencer codes. I can see ER becoming the next JC. I am just sad that my experience was not nice. I hope the brand does try to take feedback and focuses more on quality and formulation. I think the brand has a lot of potential. They have a good marketing team and are developing products that are needed in the Indian market today. All their products look very interesting. I wish they ace their formulations as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: **The brand owner contacted me that they have been getting a lot of hate since my post. I want to shout it out that it's ok to voice your criticism but any kind of bullying is NOT ok. Everyone is welcome to make purchase decisions based on what they seem fit but all our personal thoughts do not need to be aired.** **We are all human.** **Please don't send any hate to the owner. This does not mean I want to stop you from sharing your views/experiences. Just be careful of your words.**\n\n**She also let me know the steps and changes they have made following the event.** [Here](https://imgur.com/X5vr0sn) **is a screenshot of our conversation.**\n\n&#x200B;",

It seems like most of them aren’t even hiring proper chemists and cosmetic formulators but rather reading up on what’s popular abroad and DIYing in their kitchen because they believe the Indian consumer isn’t educated enough to check PH. so thanks for doing that. Also if one batches PH went wrong I hope they weren’t being cheap and informed the other people who purchased from that batch and refunded them. Or else they’re literally endangering those customers skin",

And the bottle of sunscreen was swapped with a bottle of deep ceramide moisturser .\n\nThey even went on saying that they haven't got any single negative review about copper tripeptide and phyto fuse moisturser and i hence I should continue using those two.\nI agreed...as I trusted them...( Another mistake)\n\nAll this communication started on July 28th.2020\n\nFew days back this post on reddit went viral where the owner admitted to the fact that their copper tripeptide serum was unstable . And they will recall the product. The person who wrote that post got refunded in full...\n\nSo now alarmed ...I again sent them emails...but never got any response.\nFinally I sent them DM s on instagram...\n\nWhere after much contemplation they agreed to refund me only for the copper tripeptide serum and not other two products. \n\nBut they still refused to refund me for sunscreen and phyto fuse moisturser stating some internal policies.\n\nI even asked them to arrange for a pick up of all their products from my place and refund me in full...but the owner cut me short amd asked me bluntly if they could go ahead with the refund of only copper tripeptide serum or not. I agreed for the partial refund fearing even that might get stuck.\n\nI am sad,angry , frustrated and feeling a little agitatedand cheated ..\n\n\nDone with the brand EARTH RHYTHM for ever....\nAnd yes I lost 1100 bucks of my hard earned money in the pursuit..\n\nI might be labelled as a hater or someone trying to bring down the brand.trust me I never wanted to do this on a public platform .\nI sent them dms and emails...but the double standards of that brand left me with no choice..they sold me faulty products very well knowing their own shortcomings and then deny me full refund to which I m entitled for as a customer.",

    "body": "No this is not clickbait. for 16 years I had allergic contact dermatitis misdiagnosed as atopic (chronic) eczema all over my eyes, neck, body… it was a really tough blow for my self confidence. well, last year I finally got a dermatological allergy test. turns out I was allergic to fragrance (including essential oils) and benzyl alcohol. after simply switching to products without those two ingredients, my eczema is GONE besides the odd (extremely mild) itchy or pink spot. to think that I was considering elimination diets, dupixent, etc etc etc…\n\nNow I’m not saying this will eliminate the problem for everybody. some people really do have true, chronic atopic dermatitis. but even if that is the case for you, it could rule out allergy as the cause of your inflammation or reduce your symptoms to make them more manageable. \n\nand if you live somewhere without affordable healthcare and are not able to get professional testing right now, I strongly recommend switching your products (bath & body products, detergents, makeup, hair products, cleaning products, avoiding perfume) to hypoallergenic formulas without fragrance (a suuuuper common irritant) - start reading labels. try it for a while, patch testing everything before use, and see if you notice any improvement. moral of the story, us sensitive skinned folks need to be careful what we put on our skin.

        "body": "{26F}  I agree. I think everyone should get an allergy test done at least once so they are aware of what can trigger an allergic reaction. However, I’ve gotten a full panel test once every 2-4 months since I was 3 months old and nothing comes back other than the usual mold and dust (and those are only slightly raised levels). I have stayed away from fragrance since I was about 10 years old. But other than that, I’m still on injections biweekly and I break out into hives right before my next injection. I feel like I’m just making ends meet with my treatment and I don’t see any signs of this ending anytime soon. I’ve tried ALL the topicals, elimination diets, dupixent, Rinvoq and now I’m on Adbry. Like you said, it won’t eliminate the problem for everybody. But I definitely think it’s worth taking an allergy test either way. Not to mention, you can develop new allergies at any given point.

Virgin hair, never been chemically treated, I don't do any heat styling, no blow-drying. Only Air-drying\n\n[Pic 1, Im turning away from camera](https://imgur.com/a/3YQDuew.jpg). Hair is so hard so photograph properly, If I get more accurate pictures, I'll edit to add.\n\nSo life's pretty bad right now, so I'm not able to do the elaborate hair care routine I used to. Nowadays, I don't even get time to oil my hair and if you've read any of my old posts, I'd have mentioned how I never ever wash my hair without oiling. But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/​Vinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This is an anti-dandruff shampoo and the best I've used so far.\n\nOther than the usual supermarket brands I've used Bioderma Node Ds (Excellent but pricey. Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles. Bottle looks super tiny and the plastic waste bothers me.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Re'equil Anti-Hairfall Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:   [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-c14-16-olefin-sulfonate), [Cocamidopropyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-hydroxysultaine), [Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-cocoyl-isethionate), [Decyl Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/decyl-glucoside), [Coco-Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/coco-glucoside), [Dexpanthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Glyceryl Oleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-oleate), [Biotin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/biotin), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Nasturtium Officinale Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/nasturtium-officinale-extract), [Tropaeolum Majus Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tropaeolum-majus-extract), [Polyquaternium-22](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-22), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Glycol Monostearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycol-stearate), [Disodium EDTA](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Methylchloroisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylchloroisothiazolinone), [Methylisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylisothiazolinone), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Ci 45100](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-45100), [Ci 42090](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-42090)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.450 for 250 ml. Max discount 30%.\n\nUsage Timeline: 2 months\n\nConsistency: It's a pink liquid. Normal shampoo consistency\n\nUsage:  I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: Oh my god, you guys. Best find of this year. This gives super shiny, sleek looking hair. I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember. I used up the entire bottle. I think 9ish months?? or more.\n\nConsistency: Normal shampoo consistency, HEAVILY fragranced. It's marketed towards Men, I think, so it smells of Men's aftershave.\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above. Forever Repurchase. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Oriental Botanics Red Onion Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients: This has an ingredients list a mile long. Will update soon.\n\nPrice: MRP 449 for 300 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years and I'm only done with half the bottle\n\nConsistency: Normal Shampoo\n\nUsage: I take a lot and apply it from shoulders to ends, if I've not oiled my hair.\n\nReview: I literally had to go and check what the name of this product was to type this review and I've been using it for 2+ years. I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it.

Was MRP 490 for 500 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years. I'm on my second tub\n\nConsistency: White cream.\n\nUsage: I take one big spoonful, add it to half a mug of water, swirl it around till it mixes with the water, dip my hair in and leave it. I'm not sure why this works since leaving hair in water isn't good, but it does. Between just straight up applying it and doing this, this works better. I leave it on for 5 minutes and then rinse it off.\n\nReview: This is a cult favourite  around here and for very good reason. I use this in the place of a conditioner. This conditions. I get nice, shiny frizz free hair. The cost - benefit was insane and this was HG. Not going to say anything else, because it's not available and it's pointless.  I paid higher than MRP to get my hands on a tub, when I realised it was going to be rEfORmuLAted and I've had no regrets so far.

Plum has a 100 million sales throughout. You can get it for around 450ish.\n\nUsage Timeline: No clue. I'm on my third tub.\n\nConsistency: Thick white cream\n\nUsage: This works both ways. Straight up applying and mixing it with water, both works equally well. You might use up more if straight up applying it.\n\nReview: This is brilliant protein conditioner. If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

Just because it takes the # of reviews into account. You can find lots of good reviews vouching for very good products with lesser amount of reviews. It doesn't necessarily mean that just because a product is extremely popular, there can't be lesser known amazing products as well. For some categories, like toners and creams, I feel that it's worth to look all the way down towards the 40s and 50s. I think I will make certain categories longer if you guys don't mind my spamming, lol.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm thinking doing creams or gels next. =) Thank you everybody for the comments, glad to see the time I spent making these posts is helping some of you!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Oils & Gels](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6dqq7/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing_oils_gels/)\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Balms/Milks/Creams & Foams](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6fso3/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing/)",

    "body": "The **51st Amendment of the International Fragrance Association (IFRA)** introduced stricter regulations on various fragrance components to ensure safety and sustainability. While these changes aim to protect consumers, they pose significant challenges for perfumers, especially when reformulating iconic classics and beloved contemporary creations.\n***\n**Compliance Deadlines**\n\n**New Formulas:**\n\n* Prohibited ingredients: *August 30, 2023*\n* Full compliance: *March 30, 2024*\n\n**Existing Formulas:**\n\n* Prohibited ingredients: *July 30, 2024*\n* Full compliance: *October 30, 2025*\n***\n\n**Key Ingredient Changes and Impacts on Perfumes**\n\n**1. Hydroperoxides from Linalool and Limonene**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Linalool\n* Limonene\n\n**What Changed:**  \nStricter limits have been imposed on the hydroperoxides formed when Linalool and Limonene oxidize. These allergens are prevalent in floral and citrus accords.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Guerlain Shalimar* \\- The bergamot-heavy opening will feel less sparkling and effervescent, softening its characteristic freshness.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Dior Sauvage EDT* \\- The bright citrus freshness in the top notes may lose its zesty impact, muting the fragrance's immediate vibrancy.\n***\n\n**2. Synthetic Musks**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Musk Xylene\n* Musk Ketone\n* Musk Ambrette\n\n**Alternatives:** Ambrettolide, Cashmeran\n\n**What Changed:**  \nRestrictions on synthetic musks promote the use of safer alternatives.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Chanel No. 5* \\- The iconic musky dry-down may lose its sensual depth, becoming cleaner and woodier.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Narciso Rodriguez for Her* \\- The plush, velvety musk might feel less enveloping, replaced by a more modern and airy quality.\n***\n\n**3. Oakmoss and Tree Moss**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Oakmoss (Evernia Prunastri)\n* Tree Moss (Evernia Furfuracea)\n* Atranol, Chloroatranol\n\n**What Changed:**  \nTighter restrictions on moss-derived allergens have led to increased reliance on synthetic substitutes.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Guerlain Mitsouko* \\- The deep, mossy chypre base will lose some of its earthy richness.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Tom Ford Beau de Jour* \\- The green, mossy accords will feel less vibrant, with synthetic alternatives offering a cleaner profile.\n***\n\n**4. Iso-E Super**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Iso-E Super\n\n**What Changed:**  \nNew thresholds limit the use of this cornerstone of woody and amber notes.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Terre d’Hermes* \\- The woody-mineral dry-down will feel less pronounced, softening the fragrance's overall impact.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Escentric Molecules Molecule 01* \\- Reduced levels will make the scent less warm and smooth, affecting its minimalist charm.\n***\n\n**5. Aldehydes**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* C10 Aldehyde (Decanal)\n* C12 Aldehyde (Dodecanal)\n* C16 Aldehyde (Hexadecanal)\n* C18 Aldehyde (Octadecanal)\n\n**What Changed:**  \nStricter allergen limits have been introduced for aldehydes, which lend crispness and sparkle to fragrances.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Chanel No. 5* \\- The iconic soapy and powdery opening will feel softer and less effervescent.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Lancome La Vie Est Belle* \\- The fresh, clean aldehydic top notes will be dialled back, making the fragrance warmer and heavier.\n***\n\n**6. Phthalates**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Diethyl Phthalate (DEP)\n* Dibutyl Phthalate (DBP)\n* Dioctyl Phthalate (DOP)\n\n**What Changed:**  \nPhthalates, used as fixatives, face stricter regulations due to potential endocrine-disrupting effects.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Dior Poison* \\- Reduced fixatives may result in diminished lasting power and projection.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Viktor & Rolf Flowerbomb* \\- Sweetness and warmth may become less intense, making the fragrance feel lighter.\n***\n\n**7. Coumarin**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Coumarin (Tonka bean extract)\n\n**What Changed:**  \nCoumarin restrictions aim to reduce allergenic risks.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Guerlain Jicky* \\- The powdery, sweet tonka note will be less pronounced, resulting in a more herbal composition.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Armani Si* \\- The powdery sweetness will soften, making the fragrance feel drier.\n***\n\n**8. Cinnamaldehyde**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Cinnamaldehyde (Cinnamon extract)\n\n**What Changed:**  \nCinnamon’s spicy warmth is now more restricted due to its allergenic potential.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Estee Lauder Youth Dew* \\- The fragrance’s spicy intensity will soften.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Jo Malone Cinnamon and Tonka* \\- Cinnamon will feel less spicy, leaning towards a smoother profile.\n***\n\n**9. Geraniol and Citronellol**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Geraniol\n* Citronellol\n\n**What Changed:**  \nTighter thresholds aim to reduce allergenic reactions in floral fragrances.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Yves Saint Laurent Paris* \\- The rose note will become less vibrant.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Chloe Eau de Parfum* \\- The fresh floral opening may feel subtler.\n***\n\n**10. Benzyl Alcohol and Benzyl Salicylate**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Benzyl Alcohol\n* Benzyl Salicylate\n\n**What Changed:**  \nBoth are restricted to reduce allergenic risks.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Guerlain Shalimar* \\- The powdery floral aspect will feel lighter.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue* \\- The floral accords will diminish slightly.\n***\n\n**Commercial and Consumer Implications**\n\n**For Perfume Enthusiasts:**\n\n* Iconic fragrances may feel less familiar as reformulations result in lighter, less impactful experiences.\n* Vintage batches of popular fragrances may gain value due to perceptible differences.\n\n**For the Industry:**\n\n* Niche brands face greater challenges due to cost pressures and limited resources for R&D on synthetic alternatives.\n* Innovation in synthetic molecules will accelerate as brands strive to balance compliance with olfactory quality.\n\n**Winners:** Clean, minimalist fragrances that align with these regulatory changes.\n\n**Losers:** Classic, mossy chypres and musky orientals reliant on restricted ingredients.\n***\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe IFRA 51st Amendment continues to raise the bar for safety and sustainability in perfumery. However, its restrictions challenge brands to balance regulatory compliance with preserving olfactory artistry. As the fragrance landscape evolves, the industry is likely to witness a renaissance of synthetic innovation, while consumers adjust to a lighter, cleaner fragrance experience.\n***\n\n*I’ve tried to break this down to the best of my abilities and understanding. Apologies if I’ve overlooked or missed anything. The example of perfumes changing is just a hypothesis, if companies manage to find like-for-like alternatives, you wouldn’t notice the difference. However, that has never been the case in the past.*\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE** - The intent here is simply to inform you, please, I repeat, **DO NOT** take this as some alarmist message designed to pressure you into buying something you don’t need. Perfumes are not a necessity. If you don’t get that vintage 1940s batch of Guerlain Vetiver, life will go on, and nothing will change.\n",

From a perfume experience perspective, manufacturers may comply with limitations by reducing levels of certain ingredients or substituting them with alternatives to meet regulatory requirements. This might affect the perfume experience positively, negatively, or not at all. However, manufacturers will likely prioritize maintaining the user experience, even with necessary reformulations.\n\n3. What should consumers do—use newly reformulated perfumes or stick to older ones? In my view, safety should always take precedence over the perfume experience.",

From perfumery and through the use of perfumes, the risk of any type is practically 0! The only reason why they were put aside is that there was a need for a scapegoat and they were no longer profitable as there were no more patents to protect them... their dangerousness is the same as that of modern musks, in fact in some cases lower and then we do not consider the infinite benefits. Look, they have been used for over 100 years even in the food industry and life has also lengthened.

    "body": "***My skin type***: Oily\n\n***Climatic conditions while using the product:*** I live in Mumbai and have been using it for the past 5 weeks, so its been mostly humid\n\n***Routine at the time of using the product:*** I use a cleanser (Minimalist’s 2% SA Cleanser) + Toner (TonyMoly Ceramide Toner) + the Plum 5% Niacinamide Serum + Moisturiser (Isntree Acid Aqua Gel) with UV Doux sunscreen, both AM and PM.\n\n***Age***: mid-20’s\n\n***Usage timeline***: past 5 weeks\n\n***Ingredient list***: Aqua, Glycerin, Niacinamide (5%), Propanediol, Lysine, Histidine, Arginine, Aspartic Acid, Threonine, Serine, Glutamic Acid, Proline, Glycine, Alanine, Valine, Methionine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Tyrosine, Phenylalanine, Cysteine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water, Ethoxydiglycol, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Extract, Sodium PCA, Diglycerin, Urea, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Sorbitol, PCA, Allantoin, Lactic Acid, Methyl Gluceth-20, Benzyl Alcohol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Caprylyl Glycol, Cyclodextrin, Xanthan Gum, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Gluconate\n\n***Texture/Consistency***: The serum has a *slightly* slimy consistency which ensures that you need to use less product. I use 2 drops each for each cheek and 1 for my forehead and thats more than enough. The serum absorbs fairly quickly so there’s no sticky feeling afterwards.\n\n***Fragrance***: no fragrance\n\n***Experience and thoughts in detail***: This is my first review on this sub and the only reason I was motivated to write it is because this is genuinely the first product I’ve used after years of skin care that *actually* feels like a Holy Grail product. I was slightly suspicious of Plum as a brand, thinking that its another Mamaearth type company which relies too heavily on marketing. But after reading some reviews in the comments here I decided to give it a shot after getting a good deal for it on Foxy.\n\nI bought the product to mainly combat 3 issues: large pores, dull skin, and closed comedones. Within just 2 uses, there was a noticeable difference in all three aspects. My pores were much less visible, my skin was brighter, and closed comedones also became less prominent (although the effect on them was more muted as compared to brightness and pores).\n\nSeeing these results, I started using the serum every single day in the AM, and it genuinely feels like the serum has been repairing my face because a lot of minor issues that plagued me felt like they were being slowly and gradually fixed. Razor bumps, CCs, fine lines, all were less visible, my skin felt smoother, it really felt like an all-round improvement.\n\nOne thing I specifically wanted to test about the product was how my skin looks on days that I DON’T use the product. I don’t want to use things that are only effective so long as you keep using them. I feel like a genuinely good product should be improving your skin organically and that those effects should not be dependent on you constantly using the product to maintain the look. So I took small breaks where I wouldn’t use the serum for 1 or 2 days. This may be too short of a break, but in those 1-2 days I didn’t find myself looking in the mirror and thinking “I wish I’d worn the serum today”. My skin looked just fine even without it, which made me even happier with the product.\n\nAfter using it almost every day for the past 5 weeks (the first week I went slightly slow), I’m still left with a little more than half of the bottle, so it should comfortably last me for another 5-7 weeks. I was lucky to get the whole bottle for 390, which seems like a great price in hindsight for a serum that has helped so drastically improve my skin.\n\n***Holy Grail/Will Re-Purchase/Will Not Repurchase/Holy Fail Status***: Any guesses? It’s absolutely an HG product for me, although I’m now considering trying Plum’s 10% Niacinamide serum next",

The oil is MCT oil (medium chain triglycerides) \n\nThis is available to everyone, you do not have to be a patient of my office. \n\nEC is superior to EV in that EV has a half life of 3-4 days whereas EC lasts about 8-10 days before being halved. \n\nThis means you can use EC for once a week dosing without worrying about having a major level drop. Some patients may even be able to go 10 days to 14 days without having to do another injection. \n\nRegardless, anybody currently on EV can switch to EC without a dose change. You will be prescribed the same dosage, but the interval will be increased or even doubled.\n\nPatients interested in making the switch, a bottle of the new Dr. Powers brand 40mg/ml Compounded Estradiol Cypionate is now available through superior compounding. Each bottle will cost $100 which due to the fact that it lasts much longer than estradiol valerate will end up being actually slightly cheaper than it is to get bottles of estradiol valerate from Empower or Anazao in the long run. You can pick it up for free or it can be delivered to your house for $10. \n\nObviously this works perfect for everybody in Michigan but if you would like to obtain this and you live in a different state, these are the states that Superior compounding currently services:\n\nhttps://www.superiorcompounding.com/contact-spc/\n\nIf you would like to make the switch to the new doubled duration of efficacy Cypionate estradiol, simply send us a message on the patient portal and we'll send in the prescription for you.\n\nI'm hopeful that for those who can't afford pellets, this at least can give them much smoother levels than they've previously been experiencing along with the benefits to a more stable mood /psychiatric state.\n\nAs always, Powers Family Medicine is exceptionally grateful to Superior compounding who continues to work with us and help us invent new products to better service our patients.",

    "body": "Hello folks! So my Physicians Formula booster and Olay Luminous booster came in the mail today!\n\nI'm just really excited to share because I searched HIGH AND LOW for affordable niacinamide products that have a high % of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLINK TO MY PICTURES:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/7ab5NZ8](https://imgur.com/a/7ab5NZ8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe PF I have not used before. But it's the FIRST affordable product that I came across that has high % of niacinamide AND  Acetyl glucosamine ---- not just those, but a small amount of supposedly the most powerful vitamin c derivative!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Niacinamide and NAG work synergistically together](https://lotioncrafter.com/products/n-acetyl-glucosamine-nag) to be a brightening powerhouse as well as repairing your skin barrier. They help boost your ceramide production and NAG is skin-identical.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**PHYSICIANS FORMULA SKIN BOOSTER - BRIGHTENING**](https://www.target.com/p/physicians-formula-skin-booster-vitamin-shot-brightening-1-fl-oz/-/A-75569193)  **$7.99/1 oz or 30ml**\n\n*Water, Butylene Glycol,* ***Niacinamide***\\*, Glycerin,\\* ***Acetyl Glucosamine***\\*, Pentylene Glycol, 1, 2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Disodium Edta, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Phenylethyl Resorcinol, Caesalpinia Spinosa Fruit Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Sodium Benzotriazolyl Butylphenol Sulfonate,\\* ***3-0-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid***\\*, Iron Oxides (Ci 77492), Tocopheryl Acetate, Phenoxyethanol, Vegetable Collagen, Agar, Calcium Alginate, Xanthan Gum, Kappaphycus Alvarezii Extract, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tropolone, Gluconolactone, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cynara Scolymus (Artichoke) Leaf Extract, Red 30 (Ci 73360), Sodium Benzoate.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like it's an \"inspired\" product of [**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**](https://www.paulaschoice.com/10pct-niacinamide-booster/798.html)**:**\n\n*Water (Aqua),* ***Niacinamide*** *(vitamin B3, skin-restoring ),* ***Acetyl Glucosamine*** *(skin replenishing/antioxidant),* ***Ascorbyl Glucoside*** *(vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative).*\n\nThe Paula's Choice obviously has more beneficial ingredients and higher % but still, it's **$44 for 0.67oz/20ml**.

Probably because Olay developed it. But it works great on its own as a brightener, and even better combined with vitamin c (which is why you see ascorbyl glucoside here, a stable derivative of ascorbic acid). The miracle boost USED to contain n-acetyl glucosamine (which is the one I used) as well the other ones listed here. But I guess it got too expensive or whatever.\n\nThis also has some other great ingredients, like xylitol, gylcerin, panthenol, zinc and copper gluconate for soothing and healing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used this booster in conjunction with the Luminous cream, which has niacinamide and NAG. My skin looked so much brighter and prettier. The texture was really smoothed out and my skin started getting a more like.. translucent ?? quality? You DO need to give brightening ingredients *at least 3 months* to work their magic though, especially for things like arbutin/hydroquinone. (Arbutin breaks down into hydroquinone.) But for niacinamide, I saw results for skin texture/overall brightening before that.\n\nI honestly couldn't believe the price Target was selling it for, because I got it for a much higher price elsewhere before. I couldn't keep affording it so I let it go, sadly. :'(\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe [**Luminous Tone Perfecting Treatment ($24.99)**](https://www.olay.com/en-us/skin-care-products/regenerist-luminous-tone-perfecting-treatment) is a simpler formula, but still has the same active ingredients.\n\n*Water,* ***Niacinamide\\*****, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Dimethicone,* ***Undecylenoyl Phenylalanine***\\*, Silica, Boron Nitride,\\* ***Ascorbyl Glucoside***\\*, Polyglyceryl-2 Oleate, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Dimethiconol, Aminomethyl Propanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Oleate, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium EDTA, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, \\*Vitamin B3\\*\n\nBut ironically, it costs more than the more complex booster if you purchase at Target online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DIY:**\n\nI have made DIY niacinamide NAG serums before. But because I'm too lazy to make it properly, they really lack penetration power. I'm really into cosmetic science and have read from professional cosmetic chemists that a simple DIY isn't effective if you don't do it right. You gotta keep the powders dissolved right and STAY dissolved instead of them recrystallizing on your skin and not penetrating your skin/being useless. I experimented for months with the DIY but I DEFINITELY noticed a difference as soon as I started using well-formulated, commercially available niacinamide serums.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy personal experience with certain products:\n\n\\- [**Eva Naturals 5% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-Niacinamide-Serum-Eva-Naturals/dp/B0147PDMYY/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=eva+naturals+niacinamide&amp;qid=1561763684&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-3)**:** Pretty awesome, works well, you get 2 oz. But it has avocado oil and such, and may break some people out. (This is definitely a private-label product and you can find the same exact formula for cheaper on DIY sites - which is why you see like 324982394 bottles of the same formula of everything from niacinamide to vitamin c serums on amazon.) I get the same sort of overall brightening and translucency I get with Olay. Better results with my other products, Benton 0.5% salicylic acid (very gentle) aloe BHA toner, Purito green level centella buffet serum (also has niacinamide, like 2%), and Naturie Hatomugi gel essence. Bright, translucent skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Cerave PM:** Supposedly has 4% niacinamide. Loved this as a lightweight moisturizer, but did NOT see the results I got with other niacinamide products. Makes me feel skeptical. Or perhaps there's a pretty big difference for my skin with 4% and 5%. I doubt it, but you know. Maybe it's just cuz it's formulated for skin-replenishing and not for brightening. But you'd think same ingredient will have same effects, y'know?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- [**Skinlex 10% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.skinlex.com/product/10-niacinamide-serum-60ml/)**:** Ingredient list looks GREAT and some others seem to love it, but I saw absolutely zero niacinamide benefits for my skin. Penetration issue?\n\nI have other products I've used with niacinamide, but these are the main ones I can remember on the top of my head. La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+ baume has it as well, but I do not know the %. Very good moisturizer for the body.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther commercial products you can find SEPIWHITE in:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- [**Black Opal skin care products**](https://blackopalbeauty.com/collections/skincare): They have multiple.

Personally I don't believe in preformulated water based ascorbic acid products. Even when it's fresh the amount of studies that prove that vitamin c really works topically is quite limited. Vitamin c penetrates skin rather poorly. There simply is no standardization to prove the effectiveness of a specific formula, unlike sunscreens and retinoic acid.

I've been debating with myself wether to put this on the good or bad list. In my opinion there are a lot of uncertainties about the stability of diy formulas, especially if you start mixing it through existing products. Even destilled water contains impurities that will react with ascorbic Acid, and many people don't use water reducing agents, or stabilizers like propyl gallate, sodium metabisulfite, chelators etc. A low pH, vitamin E, Ferulic acid help of course, but I don't think many people really understand the exact chemical reactions going on and don't have analyzers like they do in labs, so how certain can you be about your own creation. Most often DIY formulas also just recrystallize on skin. Formulating an ascorbic acid serum really is difficult, it is more than just dissolving some ingredients in water. Dissolving in TO Ferulic Acid will be difficult since maximum solubility in Propanediol is just 5%, in contrast to 33% in water. The key here is to make it fresh every 1-3 days I guess.\n  * [€5.80/20g TO Powder](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-100pct-l-ascorbic-acid-powder-20g?redir=1)\n  * [€89 /20mL Philosophy Turbo C booster](https://www.sephora.com/product/turbo-booster-c-powder-P204606)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Anhydrous formulas**: best stability, but not much research on penetration\n\n* [€9.60/50mL - The Ordinary C23](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-vitamin-c-suspension-23pct-ha-spheres-2pct-30ml?redir=1)\n  * **Pros:** Cheap, anhydrous (stable), together with TO Ferulic+Resveratrol a very affordable good combo\n  * **Cons:** No other actives,  no vitamin E, relatively unpleasant texture, stinging, for me too thick/greasy for daytime use.

They claim that the THD ascorbate is 50x more powerful than traditional vitamin c (I am skeptical and what are they referring to with “traditional vit c”).  Also has 3% vitamin E and 2% ferulic acid. The only negative I read in the reviews is people saying it was not ideal for dry skin types. Do you have any experience with this? \n\nPS- thank you so much for your comprehensive list, it is much appreciated!!

It doesn't use a dropper, I have a bottle and it's an airless pump.\n____\n\nAlso about The Ordinary, I have information about its penetration ability if you'd like:\n\n\nA quote from Brandon Truaxe:\n> In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.\n\nThat means that with TO Vit C 23%, your skin is only using about 2%, while L-AA's max absorption rate is 20%.",

Only experience will tell how it works in your hair\"\n\n\"That particular silicone is designed to attach to damaged areas in your hair - little chipped cuticle edges, broken cuticles. It doesn't prevent moisture from entering the hair strands. It acts like a conditioning ingredient. It will wash out with almost any detergent. The only detergent that does not remove it very well is Decyl glucoside or Lauryl glucoside - and that only applies when one of those is the *only* detergent in a shampoo\"\n\n-Science-y hair blog.\n\nMeaning, in theory you won't be experiencing buildup but also get the silicone effect. This silicone can be washed off with cocoamidopropyl betaine Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Sodium lauroyl glutamate, Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate all of these can wash out the silicone and all of these are cg approved. \n\nSo, in theory and from a logical point of view, this could be a budget friendly conditioner suitable for curly hair! \n\nAlso if you've used this conditioner please share your experience!",

I started experimenting with combination of products over the last year and realised my hair needs medium level of conditioning and protein makes it very dry. So I stick to a normal routine of washing my hair with SebaMed Anti-dry shampoo(prescribed by my derm) and WOW Morrocan Argan Oil Conditioner. I use a few drops of Nature's Tattva Sweet Almond oil as my leave in and WOW aloe vera gel. This seemed to work for my hair but I still wasn't happy with my hair. \n\nSaw your post and thought of giving the pantene conditioner, Silky Smooth variant in Advanced haircare series a try. And OMG, IT IS CGM FRIENDLY. Still waited a month to be able to judge the conditioner and it works wonders without breaking the pocket. It doesn't have as much slip as a heavy condioner would have though, maybe the damage protection variant might, so I don't recommend it for extremely dry hair. I mainly use it to detangle and am planning to dilute it to use as a leave-in as well.",

There are no copays, coupon cards, or need for reimbursement. You simply pay around $115 for your prescription, which lasts about 3 months.”\n\nOh my gosh no more of the hassle of my insurance helping to pay for my prescriptions!? All I have to do is fork over $115 quick as lightning? Thank you Altreno! /s\n\nOkay all joking aside. I know not everyone gets their retinoids covered by insurance. So if you’re paying out of pocket anyway, some ppl may choose to pay a little more for the better formulation. \n\nI’m gonna stick with my generic tretinoin cream.

    "body": "You want to know if it worked...I'm burying the lede here. Stay with me though.\n\nI have not had a chance to read the papers K18's team wrote in the last 10 years, so I decided to do this \"part 1\" with current results, then a part 2 with paper/patent comments plus how my hair fared in an upcoming bleaching service.\n\nK18 is a post-wash leave-in treatment applied on towel-dried hair. The claim is \"...molecular breakthrough clinically proven to reverse hair damage in 4 minutes\" from bleach, dyeing, heat, other chemical services like perms.\n\nAnd\n\n>Traveling into the inner-most layers of hair to reach the core polypeptide chains (keratin chains), our revolutionary K18Peptide™ is just the right size and makeup to fit in and reconnect broken chains.\n\nIngredients as of this writing:\n\nWater, Alcohol Denat., Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Ether, Cetyl Esters, Behentrimonium Chloride, Polysorbate 20, sh-Oligopeptide-78 (K18Peptide™), Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Starch, Isopropyl Alcohol, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Fragrance, Geraniol, Linalool, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Alcohol.\n\nIt is sold in 5 ml sample sizes or 50 ml full size. The pump pushes out about 1ml of product and anywhere from 1 to 4+ pumps is needed for the treatment depending on hair length, volume, & strand thickness. The lotion goes over clean but not conditioned towel-dried hair. Once applied, it needs to sit on hair for 4 minutes before using any other product.\n\nThe instructions are to use every time you wash your hair for 4 to 6 washes. If using a lot of product (no explanation on how 'heavy product use' is defined), the website text recommends a clarifying shampoo before application. After the initial 4-6 applications, the rate is 1 application every 3 to 4 washes.\n\nPros (and DOES IT WORK?):\n\nK18 improved the look and feel of my bleached hair ends, and the hair ends curled with no coaxing needed and felt soft/shiny again. The time my hair takes to dry without products shortened by 1.5 hours. Frizz diminished. Squishing my hair after washing produced less water. And I got to day 4 curly hair, which had not happened to me, ever.\n\nI saw significant change after application #4. I had committed to doing 6 washes/applications, so I continued. Areas of my hair that had been bleached more than the rest showed improvement last.\n\nLike Olaplex, K18 does something good, but I cannot state that it does what it claims (insert peptide chain in cortex, have peptide chain chemically link up bits and pieces in cortex). I did not test elasticity.\n\nK18 significantly improved hydrophobicity. Based on the list of ingredients I bet there is heavy adsorbtion of cationics going on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLess pro, but not cons:\n\n1. The amount to apply is tiny, and spreading it throughout the hair is challenging because one cannot see where product has been applied versus where it has not, plus the product is all over your palms, so cannot feel, either. For my hair I needed 4-5 pumps (4-5 ml), so I applied in sections, ends first, and hoped for the best.\n2. For people whose curly hair routine includes putting styling products in sopping wet hair, or not touching curls, using K18 requires rethinking all that as it is applied on clean towel dried hair, and must  be applied before any other hair product.\n3. If you co-wash, I would suggest using a shampoo that does not deposit much of anything on the hair prior to using K18\n4. The dosing chart is hidden on the product page (you must select the accordion chevron--the arrow pointing down-- to the right of \"how to use\"  to see the text)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAssorted: If buying the 50 ml product in the US, your cost is $1.50/pump. The 5 ml sample cost is $2.40/pump. Also, their customer service answered my questions pretty fast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWill I buy again? \n\nEDITED 5 /8 / 2022: Link to Part 2: [https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/ule42z/k18\\_my\\_experience\\_part\\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/ule42z/k18_my_experience_part_2/)",

But here I talk only about the OG Viktor & Rolf Bon Bon.\n\n#VIKTOR & ROLF BONBON\n\n###Released in 2014\n###Concentration : Eau de parfum\n\n\n##Packing & Presentation \n\n🎁The outer packaging is just like any other designers, has some gift ribbon like design elements on it.\n\n🎁The bottle is absolutely freakin adorable, a cute bow-ribbon 🎀 lookin bottle, I got the 50ml version. *(the 50ml bow-ribbon looks even cuter than 90ml versions, IMO)*\n\n##Perfumers \n\n###☀️Cecile Matton\n###☀️Serge Majoullier\n\nYou may see both of their names in several other Bonbon flankers. Cecile may also be known for her other creations like OG Stronger with you , SWY Leather & SWY Oud versions. The duo is created an absolute belter when they made this fragrance.\n\n##Fragrance Profile\n\nThis is a **Fruity—Gourmand** fragrance. Leans more on the gourmand side than fruity.\n\n##Notes Here \n\n###- [x] Peach \n###- [x] Mandarin orange \n###- [x] Orange \n###- [x] Caramel \n###- [x] Orange blossom \n###- [x] Jasmine \n###- [x] Amber \n###- [x] Sandalwood \n###- [x] Guaiac wood \n###- [x] Cedar\n\n#How it smells ?\n\n🎀 It opens up with a fleshy **Peach accord** , you can discern its synthetic most commonly Benzyl alcohol, aldehydes & ketones. The peach note is not my favourite in perfumery cuz it may come off cheap, but not here, it’s absolutely beautiful in this fragrance. \n\n🎀 The peach accord is tamed down & its just about there, not interfering with any other elements of this fragrance. \n\n🎀 The **caramel is the star of the show** , the sweet ,sticky & sugary caramel smells absolutely delectable & bring a sensual silky smoothness to this fragrance.\n\n🎀 The caramel here is **not as sugary / Candy floss like in BR540** , at the same time its **not a burnt caramel situation like in Viva La Juicy Gold Couture** . \n\n🎀 The base, its pretty much an amalgamation of basic supportive elements for this gourmand to thrive. \n\n##Undecorated Breakdown \n\nThis smells like you made some **Tanghulu with peach & poured some hot caramel over it** . \nAlthough you may not get over the synthetic designer-ish sweetness, it smells freakin delicious, you can’t deny that.\n\n#Performance \n\n##Longevity \n🌕🌕🌕🌘🌑\n\n##Projection \n🌕🌕🌕🌑🌑\n\n##Compliment-factor \n🌕🌕🌕🌘🌑\n\nI sampled it before getting this as a gift & I even stole few sprays occasionally from her. I tested this on my skin, it has a tight bubble of projection , but thats a plus in my books.\n\n##When & Where, For Whom? \n\n⭐️This is an all seasoner fragrance, but can be cloying in high heats, so evening/night outs are  a perfect setting for this fragrance.\n\n⭐️This smells youthful & also mature enough, this may appeal to a wide demography of people, I can a see an enchanting college girl to a level headed lady in her 35 pull this off with ease.\n\n##Similarities with other fragrances \n\n🧐 I wouldn’t say similarity but only the sticky caramel will definitely remind you of **Viva La Juicy Gold Couture** .\n\n🧐 I can also draw similarities with **Mancera Instant Crush** . *(but its very faint resemblance, nothing worth talking about)*\n\n##Verdict\n\nAn absolute belter of a fragrance, a sensual youthful, delicious caramel fragrance. If you can get a sample/decant of it, do try this out. I believe this is discontinued, its no longer listed in V&R’s website anymore. If you can get it for a good deal its a banger, & its not worth overpaying also have that in mind too.",

    "body": "Hello. The recall that happened a few months ago was really depressing, however limited the exposure may have been. I am not making excuses for it. I just want to prove that I am dead-set on preventing anything of that nature from occurring ever again. And I want to continue offering quality peptides.\n\nFirst of all, Sodium Benzoate won't be used anymore; going forward, I'll be adding Benzyl Alcohol to all peptide products. The UVC sterilization chamber I spoke about previously has been built. This will help with avoiding any potential microbiota spore contamination from bottle suppliers, which is likely what happened with the square bottles.\n\n[\\(The purple isn't from the UVC - I'd probably go blind if I turned that thing on out in the open\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xv0x7r3xsslc1.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be8aa07a1b0dbbc98b148770a9af2fc64c8a7214)\n\nI thought it over, and made some adjustments. Now whenever we're dealing with an open peptide solution, everyone needs to wear a mask instead of just gloves. And instead of just cleaning solution, it's cleaning solution and then pure ethanol when using the bottle filling machine. And I make my employees use hand sanitizer before putting on gloves.\n\nThe work and storage rooms have long since been shut off from the outside, and from the office. But I also installed a dedicated AC system, dehumidifier and air purifier for that space. Florida is a swampland, so I'm aware that I have to be extra careful about this.\n\nPeptide leaks kept happening last year, so I've tested the Pinealon bottles in a vacuum chamber before listing them. None leaked. Fingers crossed. If a leak happens again, I swear the bottle manufacturer will see me outside their house at 2 AM (for all intents and purposes, this is a Minecraft reference).\n\n[Pinealon bottles in a vacuum chamber \\(none leaked\\)](https://preview.redd.it/nex1ycdlsslc1.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=257831ff68a04ee4c5f2921796b0a800c8f4d305)\n\nI've explored the tamper seal machines, and aluminum induction. I own the machines, but more needs to be done before I can use them during production. Which is easier said than done, but I'm getting closer to it.\n\nAlso wasn't happy with the quality of labels, so I've been putting a lot of effort into perfecting that process. They're more chemical resistant now, but I'm not quite there with them yet. \n\n[Finally using the label applicator after like a year of trying to get it to work](https://reddit.com/link/1b48nvb/video/vrr9kosyoslc1/player)\n\nA lot of you have been incredibly patient and understanding with me during this all, and for that you have my utmost respect. If it weren't for the good people this community has to offer, I definitely would've quit some time last year - the r/Nootropics moderators, their affiliated businesses, and whoever else are playing extra dirty, constantly trying to sabotage my projects through mass reports.\n\nAnyways, just wanted to talk about the progress/ changes we've made and give another big thanks to everyone who continues to show support, I'll prove that I deserve it in time.",

    "body": "They released an article a few weeks ago about farm-to-face beauty products. My feelings about the movement towards \"natural\" aside, the writer recommended a $60 cleansing oil, and included this following line:\n\n> [It's paraben-, preservative- and chemical-free, and smells divine.] (https://www.refinery29.com/2018/01/189611/natural-ethical-beauty-products-farm-to-face#slide-1) \n\nI am taking offense at the preservative-free claim. This is not only factually wrong, this is extremely dangerous.\n\nLet me make this clear: the marketing copy for this product doesn't claim to be preservative-free. The copy brags about having AHA and plant extracts, but they don't claim to be [preservative-free] (https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/african-botanics-pure-marula-cleansing-oil.html). If the company did, they would have been wrong. \n\nThis is the ingredient list: \n\n>Glycerin, Capric/Caprylic Triglycerides, Aqua, Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Diisopropyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Sorbitan Oleate, Sclerocarya Birrea (Marula) Seed Oil\\*\\*, Moringa Pterygosperma (Moringa) Seed Oil\\*\\*, Adansonia Digitata (Baobab) Seed Oil\\*\\*, Isoamyl Laurate, Lauryl Glucoside, Coco Glucoside, Eriocephalus punctulatus (Chamomile Cape) Essential Oil, Citrus Paradisi (Pink Grapefruit) Essential Oil, Vaccinium Myrtillus (Bilberry) Extract, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugar Cane) Extract, Acer Saccahrinum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Extract, Tocopherol Acetate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Benzyl Benzoate\\*, Citral\\*, Citronellal\\*, Geraniol\\*, Limonene\\*, Linalool\\*. \\*Constituents Of Natural Essential Oils Used. \\*\\*Certified Organic. 100% Vegan. Gluten-free.\n\nGuess what? Both dehydroacetic acid and benzyl alcohol are used as preservatives. So the writer's claim about preservative-free is factually wrong.\n\nHere's the bigger issue, though: cosmetic products need preservative systems. \n\nYou cannot sell an unsafe product. Cosmetics are often a mixture of oils and water, which is perfect breeding ground for disease agents like mold and bacteria and viruses and fungi. This means that you cannot sell a product without an adequate preservative system. These germs need to be killed, or you will sicken someone, if not kill them. \n\nEven if you did your best to disinfect the manufacturing equipment, and even if all of the employees involved in manufacture practice safe manufactory practices, bacteria and mold can still get in. Plus, as a consumer uses the product, it will accumulate bacteria, fungi and mold over time. If these are allowed to grow unimpeded, this can change the color, scent, texture, etc of the product. Consumers like having a product that lasts as long as possible. As such, it is very important to have a system in place to preserve the product, not only to preserve human health, but to keep a product usable for as long as possible. \n\nTherefore, suggesting that a product 100% lacks preservatives, and implying that this is a good thing, is extremely irresponsible. By suggesting that having no system in place is more ethical, natural, or safe, you are endangering people's lives. Additionally, you are forcing your readers to spend more money on products than they need to, simply because preservative systems are necessary for it to last long enough for it to be used up. \n\n(I will note that there are products that claim to be self-preserving; these products don't use traditional preservatives, but they still have a system in place. Whether these are adequate is outside the scope of this post, but even the natural cosmetic lines agree that preserving products is a good thing.)\n\nAlso, the chemical-free line is just wrong. All matter is chemical. Oil is a chemical, extracts are chemicals, water is a chemical... ",

I hope it's okay to post about it again, since summer is very soon.\n\n\nI also kind of want more people to buy it. It feels sad that not many people know about it, when in my opinion it's really good. I have tried la Roche posay, nivea uv face, and I really think this one is better. But of course be careful and check the ingredient list!\n\n\nHere was my comment:\n\n\nI really like the asda sun cream which I have been using for 2 years now since discovering it one day - ASDA Protect SPF 50+ Face Q10 Anti-Age Sun Cream. I have the most sensitive skin, probably one of the most sensitive skin types you will ever meet due to my chronic eczema, and this one doesn't irritate me at all. To be honest, in the last year my eczema has been under control, and I was using this, so I can't say that it worsened my skin.\n\n\nIts only £2.40 so I think it's worth a try, and its UVA rating is very high- more than my nivea face uv sunscreen for £15ish (which burns my eyes). The only issue is that it's not matte. For me that's ok, as it covers my cracked and flaky skin. But you might want to try their matte version, which is the same price. If you want to try this one I am happy to take a picture/video of its consistency for you?\n\n\nHere are its ingredients:\nAqua, Octocrylene, Glycerin, Alcohol Denat., C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Titanium Dioxide (Nano), Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Tapioca Starch, Coco-Caprylate, Undecane, Tocopheryl Acetate, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Silica, Panthenol, Caprylyl Glycol, Parfum, Tridecane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Xanthan Gum, Dimethicone, Disodium EDTA, Ubiquinone, Sodium Hydroxide, Carbomer, Benzyl Alcohol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Citronellol, Limonene, Tocopherol, Linalool, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil\n\n\n\nI hope this helps, and good luck.",

I have dry-normal sensitive skin and wanted to give it a try considering the great price. Only been using it today so its only a first impression but so far, so good! \n\nNo cast, sinks in nicely though it did leave me a bit greasy initially but after 10 mins or so it faded and looked normal, can barely tell I even had it on. I cut out my morning moisturizer as I figured it would be rich enough to cover that as well and I was right. I definitely wouldn't moisturize then apply this, the SPF is all I need. \n\nI have notoriously sensitive eyes so admittedly I haven't tried it in that area yet as I had to go out and didn't want to risk burning eyes so I used my usual SPF (the bondi sands one) and then applied the ASDA one everywhere else and I've had no issues. \n\nI will be trying it around the eyes tomorrow though as I'm not going anywhere. You may have just saved me a lot of future money OP so thanks! Even if it doesn't work around the eyes I can at least apply it to the rest of the face and use my usual in that area meaning it will last longer so its win/win really.\n\nUPDATE: So I've now tried it around the eyes and it felt fine for the first couple of hours, however after that I did experience some very mild burning in the eye area. Having said that, when I say \"very mild\" I mean really, really mild. If I was out and about I probably wouldn't even notice it as it only lasted a couple of minutes and then stopped. \n\nI would still class this as a success. Mild for me is still an improvement over most SPF's I've tried since my eyes are so sensitive. I will continue to use this and possibly just use my usual SPF around my eyes and the ASDA one on the rest of my face. Which will make my more expensive one last a lot longer since its only going to be used in the eye area.",

    "body": "Hi there! I am a pharmacist who does peptide and drug testing for purity and strength as well as for contaminants such as bacteria, fungus, and endotoxins. One of my clients asked this question today, and I thought it was a good topic to share with the community. Here were some of my thoughts about what occurs when a vial looks cloudy:\n\n**The BAC Water:** The BAC water is either too low of pH or too high of pH. The BAC water is old, has been exposed to too much air oxidation, or there's air bubbles in the water from drawing up the solution too quickly. Easy fix for this is just make sure to use a new BAC bottle if you're experience cloudiness and use BAC Water that that you know has worked well in the past. When we test products in the lab, we are actually using sterile water that is free of the other additives like the benzyl alcohol that can potentially damage peptides and cause irritation. If you are using a peptide for a one-time injection, I highly recommend using sterile water instead of BAC water! For example if it's a tirzepatide 15mg bottle that's going to be completely used in one go, there's no need to use BAC water if it doesn't need to be stored. \n\n**Injection Technique:** Injecting the BAC water/sterile water too quickly onto the peptide can cause damage of the peptide chains as well. It's recommended to inject the reconstitution solution at an angle so it drips down the side of the bottle or inject slowly into the bottle...don't blast it in! Same thing with shaking the bottle, you don't want to shake the bottle to mix it, it should be a gentle swirl. If the peptides are disturbed too much, they can aggregate (clump together) which will create that cloudy look on appearance. \n\n**Temperature Changes:** If the peptides were coming out of the freezer or refrigerator and then reconstituted without reaching room temperature, it can also damage the peptide chains and lead to cloudiness. Both the peptide and reconstitution solution should be at room temperature before mixing them together. \n\n**Mixing Peptides:** Mixing peptides together, especially GLP-1's with other peptides tend to cause cloudiness as well. What is happening is the proteins are aggregating (clumping) together and causing a milky like look. Generally, you want to avoid this, so I always recommend to just keep products such as GLP-1s and Human Growth Hormone as separate injections instead of trying to mix them with other peptides.\n\n**Potential contamination:** It's recommended to get peptides tested on a regular basis to check for purity, strength, and microbial contamination. Microbes are all around us and it's so easy to get contaminants even in the cleanest of labs. Regular quality control is a great way to ensure that bacteria, fungus, or endotoxins are not the culprits of cloudiness as well as knowing that your products are free and clear of potential harmful impurities. The way I see it, it's worth spending some money on these tests since these peptides are coming to us at such an affordable cost through foreign countries. \n\nFeel free to reach out to me if you have any questions about peptides or testing!",

If the people in the tutorial videos I did  mention that post, it wasn’t stated plainly enough that I noticed. I’ve been reconstituting at about 40*F instead of letting both sit out for an hour or two to raise their temp to room level. How bad is it, for the sake of argument, that I prepped several vials of different peptides with bac water and the peptides  straight out of the fridge? Did I wreck them for sure or are they usable? It was Ipamorelin and Tesamorelin and a vial of blended BPC/Tb500 that I reconstituted cold. Bac water also same temp. I really hope I didn’t fubar them as they are not cheaper but hot “cheap” by my budget….\n\nThanks  again this was an awesome breakdown of both the process and the issues that can occur along the way.",

This can also occur from moisturizer.\n* No issues with acne, except a few whiteheads around my menstrual cycle\n* Most cleansers I have tried are either a) not strong enough or b) too strong\n* Main skin concerns: Oil control, reducing appearance of giant nose pores, preventing CCs, even skin tone, healthy aging\n* Slowly trying to reduce the number of products I use for all the things (not just skin care) that contain fragrances\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser](https://imgur.com/a/uAvebDj)\n\n***Product Type:*** Cleanser; specifically purchased because it is **sulfate free** (my body hates sulfates)\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Juice, Coco-Betaine, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Peg-50 Shea Butter, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Lycium Barbarum Fruit Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Morinda Citrifolia Fruit Extract, Punica Granatum Juice Extract, Garcinia Mangostana Fruit Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Fragrance, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Benzoic Acid, Sorbic Acid, Red 33\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance free**; **Sulfate free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; AM: use with konjac sponge; Fragrance is actually pleasant, doesn’t linger; consistency starts off creamy, but foams very easily\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is amazing, and has been a major game-changer for me when it comes to cleansers. I’ve never found a cleanser that worked long-term before this one. A little goes a long way with this stuff – it is a very efficient clean. My face feels so soft afterwards. While it is strong enough to get rid of all my oil, it’s not so harsh that it makes my skin tight.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** In terms of function, none that I can think of. Only downfall (IMO) is it is not fragrance-free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4.5/5 stars, I’ve gone through over 4-5 bottles of this stuff and I will keep it in rotation until I can find a functionally similar product that is fragrance-free\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Thayer’s Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner](https://imgur.com/a/OwCREGs)\n\n***Product Type:*** Toner; purchased because of how many people liked it on ScA\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~0.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Purified Water, Certified Organic Witch Hazel Ext Blend (Hamamelis Virginiana Extract (Witch Hazel*), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (Filet of Aloe Vera*)), Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Water, Fragrance (Natural Rose), Citric Acid, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Seed Extract\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** ***Not fragrance-free***; Liquid consistency; potentially irritating, depending on your skins relationship with witch hazel\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Despite the smell (see below), this stuff works pretty well. I always feel like this enhances my *clean* feel following my cleanse, but it also leaves my skin feeling refreshed and moisturized. I always follow-up with moisturizer, but I can definitely tell when I don’t use it, especially in my dry areas.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** **I HATE THE SMELL OF THIS STUFF!** Come to find out, I hate the smell of roses (I’m weird, I know…) but seriously. This stuff smells like a rose pooped in some water and then sold it on the side of the road on a hot sunny day. It’s terrible. If you are remotely disinterested in the smell of rose, do not buy this.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5 due to smell. Will repurchase the fragrance-free version in the future\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%](https://imgur.com/a/Tuo5otO)\n\n***Product Type:*** Purchased to reduce redness/even skin tone and to control oil; side-benefits: helps prevent CCs\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mild medicinal smell**, doesn’t linger; Somewhat-sticky consistency; Absorbs quickly\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** I keep this in rotation mainly because it helps control my oil. Even if I use this stuff without my mattifying moisturizer, it helps prevent the massive amounts of oil that my skin normally produces. It helps keep my skin an even texture and tone, as well. I’m not 100% sure if this is solely responsible for preventing my CC (doubt it, since I use BHA), but I’m almost certain it’s contributing at the least. This product has been one that I have been most consistent with besides my cleanser and what little redness I sometimes develop (mainly due to allergies or weather) has been under control.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Functionally, none. This stuff does what it’s supposed to. I just hate the dropper packaging, personally, of most TO products. It’s hard to get the little bits out of the bottom!!\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, have repurchased 2+ times; will be replacing with skinlex’s version to avoid buying more products from Deciem.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG](https://imgur.com/a/roT93Vy)\n\n***Product Type:*** Active for reducing appearance of eye contour pigmentation\n\n***Cost:*** **$* - ~$7.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Caffeine, Maltodextrin, Glycerin, Propanediol, Epigallocatechin Gallatyl Glucoside, Gallyl Glucoside, Hyaluronic Acid, Oxidized Glutathione, Melanin, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Seed Extract, Urea, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Xanthan gum, Lactic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Propyl Gallate, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Benzyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; Watery-to-thick consistency (from the glycerin, probably); no noticeable smell; yellow-ish in color\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I’ve been using this stuff for a little over a year, and honestly it does absolutely nothing for my eye contour. I don’t have much puffiness, but I do have decent enough under eye darkness where I wanted something to help. This does not. It does help reduce the appearance with some small, visible blood vessels around my nose, but it’s only a temporary effect thereby reducing redness. \n\n***Bad stuff:*** It doesn’t really work for what I wanted it to work for.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 1/5, WNRP.\n\n*Does anyone have any suggestions of what I can do with what I have leftover? I’d love to use it for something else if it’s functional!*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free Mattifying Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/rQeCSUV)\n\n***Product Type:*** Daytime moisturizer; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Propylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethicone, Ceteareth-20, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Silica Silylate, Behenyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Salicylic Acid, Panthenol, Fragrance, Boron Nitride, Bambusa Arundinacea (Bamboo) Stem Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Maltodextrin, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance-free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; very thick consistency; absorbs quickly; powdery/soft finish\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** Another game-changer with my oily skin. Using this moisturizer during the day saves my face from producing oil. Even if I sweat a little bit, it controls oil. Normally, without it, I’ll start producing oil within a few hours of cleansing. If I use this moisturizer, I’m relatively oil-free all day, except around my nostrils. This is also a strong enough moisturizer to keep my dryness at bay, even during the wintertime (and where I live gets very cold during the winter).\n\n***Bad stuff:*** The smell is pretty bad (probably the bamboo), but honestly I get used to it and the smell goes away quickly. My friend said it smells like wet dog... haha but I don't notice it anymore since I've been using it for so long.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, only because it’s not fragrance-free. Will continue to repurchase until I can find a fragrance-free alternative.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish Sun Milk SPF50+/PA+++](https://imgur.com/a/kXZLXCa)\n\n***Product Type:*** Sunscreen; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.40 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dipropylene Glycol, Titanium Dioxide, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Viscum Album (Mistletoe) Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Carex Humillis Root Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Pinus Sylvestris Leaf Oil, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Malpighia Emarginata (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract, Echium Plantagineum Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Peg-10 Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Magnesium Sulfate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Methicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Aluminum Hydroxide, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Octyldodecanol, Dimethicone, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate, Polyglyceryl-6 Polyricinoleate, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Butylene Glycol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Cellulose Gum\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mineral sunscreen**; **Not fragrance-free**; **Mild whitecast**, but absorbs well; **Drying**; mattifying/oil-control like a boss; pleasant scent; not waterproof\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Due to drying my skin out, I only use this product when I have to. I don’t wear SPF most days (work inside, very little exposure to sun during the day), but I do wear this when I’m running errands and/or trying to control my oil more than I can with the moisturizer mentioned previously. This stuff works really well to control oil – the best of any product I’ve tried so far. Wears well under makeup, as long as my dry skin is kept controlled. Some minor white cast, but with my skin it absorbs and isn’t visible (even when I’m tanner) – but may not be the same on someone with a darker than medium skin tone.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** This product is very drying. It works SO WELL on controlling oil, but it zaps any amount of moisture out of my dry spots. To the point where I have to counteract the dryness in my PM routine. Do not recommend for people with sensitive skin, or dry skin.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 3/5, due to drying and not being fragrance-free; Will continue to repurchase until I find an alternative that controls my oil as well as this does, if ever.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Paula’s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Gel Exfoliant](https://imgur.com/a/X9YEexN)\n\n***Product Type:*** Chemical exfoliant; meant to prevent/reduce CCs and help with overall skin texture\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$8.80 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, (hydration), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Phytosphingosine (skin-renewing), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Vitis Vinifera Seed Extract (grape extract/antioxidant), Camellia Sinensis Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (green tea/antioxidant) Epilobium Angustifolium Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (willow herb/skin-soothing), Bisabolol (skin-soothing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH-adjusting), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; **BHA**; thick consistency, absorbs slowly\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is AMAZING! It attacks any signs of CCs overnight, and can easily clear my CC-prone forehead within a day or two. I use it almost every day as a preventative. My face has been noticeably clearer and smoother thanks to this product. Also, it visibly reduces the appearances of pores - this combined with the retinol I use has been an amazing in reducing their appearance.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Smells chemical, so may be off-putting to some people. Absorbs slowly, so you should leave room in your routine for that.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, WRP. I am going to be trying to the liquid version (I got it on sale), but if this works better for me over the liquid I will come back to it\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/BDGVfpd)\n\n***Product Type:*** PM moisturizer; light-weight\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$9.50 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Dimethicone/vinyl Dimenticone Crosspolymer, Phenoxyethaqnol, Polyacrylamide, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Dimethiconol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Laureth-7, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, C12-14 Pareth -12, Sodium Hydroxide, Blue 1\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **NOT Fragrance-free**; **Contains silicones**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; **Contains hyaluronic acid**; Very light-weight moisturizer.\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I love this product. It was the first moisturizer I tried when I embarked on my skincare journey, and I am so thankful I found it. This is the first moisturizer I used every in my life that didn’t break me out or lead to a forehead full of CCs. I’m in love with this stuff! It is light enough for my super oily spots (which is not due to being dry, it’s just oily…) and is strong enough for my dry spots. In the winter I use a little extra HA serum over my whole face and it works like a charm. I’ve been dabbling with some oils as well, but so far I haven’t found it necessary in the summer because this moisturizer works so well!\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Nothing, just that it’s not fragrance free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, because of fragrance. Will continue to RP until I can find an alternative that I can afford and is fragrance free.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading, everyone! I hope this is helpful, as I use some products that you don't see a lot around here (as well as some you do...). This is definitely a more simplified version of my routine, but that may be a good thing, as I'm noticing the same effects as to what I was seeing before despite reducing the number of products I use!",

    "body": "Ex homebrewer here btw, I never used this exact guide but I did something very similar to this on my first brew. Personally I would never sell these vials and later used a much better method *but*, if shit hits the fan it’s good to have a backup\n\n# Homebrew E, the cheap and dirty way\n\nThis is not a good way to make estrogen, straight up. I would not recommend this unless you've tried everything else or as a backup. My current (well, before I retied at least) process is much better than this but it also costs about 10x more so I've come up with this instead for people who want a backup option.\n\nSeriously, don't do this unless you have to, but if you do, do this instead of one of the shittier guides (like Lena's). Compounding injectable drugs is very dangerous. I've tried to make this as cheap as possible and have sacrificed quality but I would still trust this as a *last resort* option. I consider this more as something to do if things get *really* bad or in an apocalypse situation. Most of the things here have a pretty long shelf life and theoretically you can switch out the carrier oil for something easier to get.\n\n# Ingredients\n\nI've put together a list of things you'll need including places to buy them. It's not required that you use the sources I've linked and they may not be the cheapest options but they should be pretty good.\n\nMedical and lab supplies\n\n* [50ml MCT oil](https://www.medical-and-lab-supplies.com/mct-oil-60-40-caprylic-c8-capric-c10-pharmaceutical-grade-hexane-free.html)\n* [50ml benzyl benzoate](https://www.medical-and-lab-supplies.com/benzyl-benzoate-usp-nf-50ml-1-7-oz.html)\n* [50ml benzyl alcohol](https://www.medical-and-lab-supplies.com/benzyl-alcohol-usp-nf-pure-grade-50ml-1-7oz.html)\n* [1x 0.22 micron sterile PVDF syringe filter](https://www.medical-and-lab-supplies.com/whatman-gd-x-25mm-sterile-pvdf-syringe-filter-0-2-um-qty-1.html)\n* [5x sealed 10ml sealed sterile evacuated vials](https://www.medical-and-lab-supplies.com/10ml-clear-sealed-sterile-evacuated-vial-qty-1.html)\n* [Box of 100 1\" 25g sterile needles + box of 100 1\" 18g sterile needles](https://www.medical-and-lab-supplies.com/bd-precisionglide-hypodermic-needles-box-of-100.html)\n\nAmazon\n\n* [100ml beaker](https://www.medical-and-lab-supplies.com/united-scientific-150ml-glass-beaker-low-form.html)\n* [Glass stir rod](https://www.amazon.com/Glass-Stirring-Rod-Long-Diameter/dp/B009RQX5AU/)\n* [60ml sterile syringes](https://www.amazon.com/Syringe-Plastic-Syringes-Measurement-Dispensing/dp/B0C3RD7WRJ/)\n* [3ml sterile syringes](https://www.amazon.com/3ml-Syringe-Sterile-Luer-Lock/dp/B091FRW71C/)\n* [100g/0.001g scale](https://www.amazon.com/KUBEI-Milligram-rechargeability-Precision-Calibration/dp/B0CM1W2TGG/)\n\nDragon Ordnance\n\n* [3g EEn](https://dragonordnance.com/goods?code=08101305637)\n\nIn total this comes out to under $200 USD not including shipping from Medical and Lab Supplies and Amazon. You will also need some latex/nitrile gloves and a medical mask (ideally n95) but I'm not including those in the price cause they're easy to get and most people already have them. Also gonna need aluminum foil and isopropyl alcohol.\n\n# Process\n\nThis is definitely cutting a few corners and hoping that any contaminants are filtered out but I've tried something very similar to this before and it worked. This process is to make 5x10ml vials of 40mg/ml EEn in MCT oil. I've added an extra 5% to account for transfer loss and stuff. \\~4 % EEn | 2% BA | 20% BB | \\~74% oil\n\n* Wash down the beaker and stir rid with soap and water. Wash a bowl with soap and water then fill with isopropyl alcohol and soak the stir rod and beaker in there. Remove and leave them to dry on some sort of drying rack.\n* Make a weighing boat out of aluminum foil and place on the scale then tare. Weigh out 2.1 grams of estradiol enanthate and pour into the beaker.\n* Draw up 1.05ml of benzyl alcohol into a 3ml syringe. If using the benzyl alcohol linked above it comes in a vial with a stopper so you'll need to use a 18g needle to draw it up. Empty the syringe into the beaker\n* Using a 60ml syringe, draw up 10.5ml of benzyl benzoate, also comes in a via if you're using the option linked above. Empty the syringe into the beaker.\n* Draw up 39ml of MCT oil into a 60ml syringe and empty into the beaker.\n* Stir with a glass stirring rod until everything is dissolved. Once you think it's dissolved, stir for another 5 minutes.\n* Attach an 18g needle to a 50ml syringe and draw up the entire mixture. Remove the needle, attach the syringe filter, then attach a 25g needle to the syringe filter.\n\nNow for the annoying part, filtering.\n\n* Pierce the stopper of one of the vials and begin emptying the syringe into it until its filled with 10ml of liquid. It's possible you may need to pierce the vial with an additional needle to prevent over pressurization of the vial but using evacuated vials should prevent the need for this.\n* This is gonna fucking suck. Like really fucking suck. The amount of pressure you have to exert for such a long period of time is genuinely horrible if you're doing it by hand. There's a few options you can do like using a caulk gun or this crazy thing [I rigged up](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/350021767764639746/1261780291094057050/IMG_9629.jpg?ex=669433f8&is=6692e278&hm=018667754821779c280f40ac7c29f39acc1b7679e883e7cced02014d95bdf85d&=&format=webp&width=682&height=910) (25lbs weight plate) but this is gonna be really annoying to do no matter what.\n* Usually the next step would be to autoclave the vial but according to compounding textbooks this isn't strictly necessary since we're filtering directly into pre sterilized vials vials and 0.22 micron filtration *should* take care of anything we'd have to worry about. If you have a good pressure cooker you can autoclave the vials at 15 psi for 20 minutes but since this would cost an extra $100-200 I've skipped it for this guide. I've heard that piecing the stopper can lead to water getting in but I don't believe it tbh, otherwise vials wouldn't be able to maintain long term sterility (I think, also water might get through the sides under the stopper if it could penetrate through areas that small).\n\nSo yeah, once you're done filtering you should have 5x10ml vials of 40mg/ml EEn, or a bit over 9 years worth at 4mg a week. This is already *really* pushing the shelf life of MCT based injections so I wouldn't recommend doing more unless you have people to share it with. Ideal storage conditions are at either at room temperature in as dark a container as possible or at below -18C in the dark. Freezing shouldn't have any negative effects on the vial.\n\nI hope this was informative but more than that I hope it's never needed. If you do decide to use it, good luck. Personally I wouldn't if there were other options ( like buying from a real homebrewer) but I say that from a place of privilege. If anyone who actually knows about homebrewing properly sees it they're probably gonna flame me for bad practices which says something to the quality of this, but it's not meant to be top of the line compounding advice, it's meant to be a backup option when everything else fails.\n\nAlso I have a [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/internet_toast) now for donations as well as the [crypto donation link on my website](https://grayoasis.com/donate/) if you like what I do and feel like supporting me.\n\nAs usual this post is also available on my [blog](https://grayoasis.com/blog-index), if I've made any mistakes or overlooked anything please let me know.",

    "body": "Hi all!  \n\n\nI am back with another skin conditions post. This one is on perioral dermatitis.   \n\n\nAdmittedly, when I began researching this, I knew zilch about PD except that it was acne-like breakouts around the mouth,  and as I began to research it, it seems that there isn't a whole lot that is known about it. Fortunately, it is a highly treatable condition that seems to overlap to a degree with rosacea (earning it the earlier name  of \"steroid rosacea\") and even seborrheic dermatitis.  \n\n\n**As always, please feel free to correct or inform me of anything wrong, and also feel free to post/discuss what helps your PD.**\n\n# What is Perioral Dermatitis\n\nPerioral dermatitis (PD) is a chronic, recurrant inflammatory disease that most commonly occurs in the perioral region of the face (the area around the mouth). It can also affect the area around the nose, and in roughly 20&#37; of cases, it can manifest around the eyes (though it goes by another name if around the eyes: peri-orificial dermatitis).   \n\n\nIt afflicts around 1&#37; of the population of the United States, particularly those with fair skin, and predominately occurs in women between 18-45, with 20s and 30s having peak incidence.   \n\n\nIt presents as small, red, tender, sometimes itchy bumps that can flake and burn. While commonly mistaken for acne, it is distinct from acne in that it only presents in specific locations, spares the small area around the lips, and lacks pustules (whiteheads).\n\n# Causes of Perioral Dermatitis\n\nThe causes of perioral dermatitis are unclear. It is a relatively \"young\" disease that was only first described as a distinct condition in 1964. It is first and foremost an inflammatory condition, and is aggravated by ingredients and habits that can create inflammation either in the skin or in the body. \n\nWhile I was researching PD, the one constant that showed up again and again is that it is aggravated by corticosteroid use -- both topical and inhaled. To specify, that means not just creams like kenalog, triamcinolone, and over-the-counter hydrocortisone, but also asthma inhalers (including Advair, Flovent, and ProAir aka Albuterol) and nasal allergy mists like Beconase, Flonase, Nasonex, Omnaris, and Veramyst. \n\nLess commonly, but still a factor to consider are hormones, where monthly shifts can put the condition into overdrive. More frustrating is that oral contraceptives can worsen PD in some. \n\nOther causes can be fluoridated toothpaste, high SPF value sunscreens¹, sunscreens with the filters zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, the ingredient \"isopropyl myristate,\" improperly removing makeup or sleeping in makeup, occlusive ointments (Vaseline, Aquaphor, and oils, for example), heavy creams with occlusive ingredients, and cold creams (wipe-off cleansing creams that leave a residue, like Pond's). In one case, a woman's favorite lip balm (containing the ingredient propyl gallate) caused her PD.⁶\n\n# Treatment\n\nPD can look like many other conditions, such as acne, angular cheilitis, rosacea, or seborrheic dermatitis, and requires treatment of a professional due to the inflammatory nature of the condition. \n\nThe most important thing for anyone suffering from PD is to discontinue steroid use - whether cold-turkey or weened off with the management of a healthcare professional. While topical steroids can seem to improve the condition, they frequently create a rebound effect, which can make the condition worse. \n\nOnce steroids are removed, the skin will get worse before getting better. This is the toughest part of PD for most people. Topical antibiotics or topical immunosuppresants (such as Pimecrolimus or Elidel) are frequently prescribed due to their tremendously  helpful anti-inflammatory effects on PD, and azelaic acid can prove useful in some cases. In very severe cases, oral antibiotics can be prescribed in addition to topicals. \n\nWhile healing from PD, the skin should not be cleansed with any cleanser, and makeup and skincare products should be avoided completely until the condition resolves. And no matter how tempting, PD should never be scrubbed, as this worsens the inflammation. \n\nOnce treated, it is encouraged to use liquid or gel sunscreens as well as soap-free cleansers that do not dry out the skin, as TEWL (trans-epidermal water loss) is significant in people who suffer from PD.\n\n# Long-Term Care\n\nSome people have PD once in their lives, while others may combat it on and off for several years. If you fall into the latter, it is important to try to avoid triggers that can cause the condition to reoccur (particularly steroid use). That means cleansing your skin each day with gentle cleansers, always removing makeup (removing it with a wipe does *NOT* count - you need to cleanse it away thoroughly with an oil cleanser that rinses cleanly), and using light products, particularly around the areas typically affected. \n\nPrescriptions like azelaic acid and over-the-counter .1&#37; adapalene (Differin)² may  also help to manage the condition in the long-term. \n\nI've put together a list below of some cleansers and moisturizers that are recommended for people suffering from PD.

        "body": "I’ve been diagnosed with Peri-orbital Dermatitis by my dermatologist. I’ve had it for at least 10 years. Peri-orbital means it presents around my eyes, nose and mouth. My worst flare ups cover all three areas, my most frequent flare ups present just around my nostrils. \n\nYes, you’re correct that causes are basically unknown. Successful treatments can vary wildly. \n\n(personally, I’m convinced it has a fungal element, specially related to candida imbalance. That’s just my opinion. I have used OTC topicalS and been prescribed anti-fungal topicals and pills, none of that worked. I believe it is related to gut microbiome health. Our skin is a direct reflection of what’s going on intrinsically in our bodies) \n\nI want chime in here about Zinc Oxide. You mention it as a possible cause. I want others out here to know that high concentration Zinc Oxide Cream is the ONLY thing that stops my flare ups. So if you have PD, I recommend patch testing a high ZO cream on one or two of the papules and see if it helps you. Incidentally, I’ve found recently that micronized ZO particles actually work faster for my than larger particles. So I stopped using Desitin Max strength and started using Neutrogena Sheer Zinc for face with 22% ZO. It stops my flare ups completely in a matter of a day or so, versus 4+ days with the Desitin. \n\nI’ll list below everything I’ve tried in case it’s helpful. The other product I find helpful is daily probiotic pills containing Lactobacillus Acidophilus. I get less flare ups when I take daily probiotics. \n\nDIDN’T WORK: \nAntibacterial Rx creams, I believe I had both Erythromycin and Dapsone. OTC antifungal creams, clotrimazole, miconazole and terbinafine. I also had an oral Rx for Lamisil, it was generic and I can’t recall the generic name. OTC topical steroids, hydrocortisone. Violet extract. Cutting out SLS from from my toothpaste and hair products. (I never cleansed with SLS, always either soap or oil) Changing my diet to an acne safe diet. Getting sun. Staying out of sun. Sulphur washes. Leaving it alone.",

        "body": "I didn’t have a severe case and it largely consisted of redness and small closed comedones with some inflamed ones. I had no idea what perioral dermatitis was and assumed all this redness was broken capillaries from a Clarisonic. \n\nIt wasn’t until I went to a dermatologist and asked her about it that she said it looked like perioral dermatitis. I was prescribed Finacea and in one month the results have been astounding. Redness has significantly reduced and no closed comedones or inflamed pimples anywhere. Again mine wasn’t severe but for anyone who has it I think azelaic acid is a great choice. \n\nI should point out I never use steroids, I’m 30F and I think this was due to over moisturizing after over exfoliating. I also think the occlusive nature of aquaphor made it much worse. My routine now consists of nothing but cleanser, moisturizer and Finacea. Drastic change from what I was doing before. \n\nThank you for taking the time to post this very informative breakdown of perioral dermatitis.",

    "body": "Here’s a comment I posted about Avant:\n\nAvant’s Deluxe Hyaluronic Acid Vivifying Face & Eye Night Cream (this was being sold in the FFF edit sale last week), we were suppose to get this last December for premium box but instead we got the Pro-Intense Hyaluronic Acid Illuminating Day Cream instead, it’s the same RV $134 and has equally crappy ingredients, I’ve seen hand creams/body creams with better/actual effective formulas.\n\nIngredients for the Avant Face & Eye Cream: aqua (water), Butyrospermum Parkii (shea) butter, glycerin (humectant) cetyl alcohol (texture enhancer, emollient), glyceryl stearate (emulsifying agent), dicaprylyl ether (emollient), propylheptyl caprylate (emollient), dimethicone (type of silicone occlusive), sodium hyaluronate (salt form of hyaluronic acid), niacinamide (Vitamin B3, excellent antioxidant has many beneficial properties), maris aqua (sea water, has more minerals than tap water), Prunus Amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil (emollient which contains lots of skin nourishing fatty acids), allantoin (skin soothing), tocopheryl acetate (vitamin e), peg-75 stearate (texture enhancer, emulsifier), ceteth-20 (texture enhancer), steareth-20 (emulsifier) propylene glycol (humectant, texture enhancers), disodium edta (too lazy to explain this one) sodium polyacrylate (thickening agent, texture enhancer), xanthan gum (thickening agent), lactic acid (when used at this kind of low concentration most likely it’s being used as a pH adjuster), parfum (fragrance), potassium sorbate (preservative), ethylhexylglycerin (preservatives) CI 15985 (orange dye) (FD&C Yellow No. 6), CI 17200 (red dye) (D&C Red No. 33).\n\nHere’s the ingredients for a $134 moisturizer.  It doesn’t take Einstein to figure out all the products from Avant are crap, even if this were $5 it would still be crap. There’s nothing wrong with the ingredients, its just the formulation and ingredients for the moisturizer isn’t worth more than $5, it has no high levels of any active ingredients/patented technology (almost all moisturizers at that price point has patents). If this were ingredients for a dollar store hand cream, then i would buy it, unfortunately it’s $134.  Avant products AREN’T EVEN WORTH the $12 Boxycharm add on/pop up price.\n\nLook at the ingredients for Acure Radically Rejuvenating Whipped Night Cream ($15.99 on iherb.com) \n\nWATER/AQUA/EAU, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CETEARYL OLIVATE, SORBITAN OLIVATE, SCLEROCARYA BIRREA (MARULA) SEED OIL, NYMPHAEA ALBA ROOT EXTRACT, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-1, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-2, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-1, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-9, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-11, COPPER PALMITOYL HEPTAPEPTIDE-14, HEPTAPEPTIDE-15 PALMITATE, PALMITOYL TETRAPEPTIDE-7, PALMITOYL TRIPEPTIDE-1 (PEPTIDE BLEND), FERULIC ACID, ASCORBIC GLUCOSIDE (VITAMIN C), COCONUT ALKANES, PSEUDOALTEROMONAS FERMENT EXTRACT (GLACIAL GLYCOPROTEINS), SALICYLIC ACID COCO-CAPRYLATE/CAPRATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ASPARTIC ACID, LINOLEIC ACID, LINOLENIC ACID, LECITHIN, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, LACTIC ACID/GLYCOLIC ACID COPOLYMER, CURCUMA LONGA (TURMERIC) ROOT EXTRACT, SYMPHYTUM OFFICINALE CALLUS CULTURE EXTRACT.\n\nBesides the fact that this has way more antioxidants/age prevention/hydrating ingredients.  This ingredients list for a $16 moisturizer might look familiar to some people because it’s like 95% the same as a certain Drunk Elephant Moisturizer(it’s just missing a few amino acids at the end of the ingredients list but all the important ingredients are exactly the same, even the peptides are the same).  Looks a thousand times better than all the crappy $130 Avant Moisturizers, and this is just one example, there’s CeraVe, Elf, tons of Korean brand moisturizers, all around or under $20. \n\nDECIEM’s hand cream $16 for 100ML\nAqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Propanediol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Copper Lysinate/Prolinate, Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Methylglucoside Phosphate, Proline, Alanine, Serine, Pseudoalteromonas Ferment Extract, Tremella Fuciformis Sporocarp Extract, Tocopherol, Betaine, Cellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Sodium Phosphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Parfum (Fragrance), Limonene, Linalool.\n\nThere’s copper peptide (the next big thing in anti aging), snow mushrooms, amino acids, algae ferment, and Plantago Lanceolata which can reduce dark spots, all this from a hand cream, people were using this as a facial moisturizer cos it’s that good. \n\nMoisturizers which are around $134\n\n- Guerlain’s Abeille Royale Creams (has patent on formulas and also the frigging jar the moisturizer comes in) \n\n* Sisley Black Rose Cream Mask (really this needs no introduction) \n\n* Charlotte Tilbury’s Night Cream\n\n* Dior Capture Totale Firming and Wrinkle Correcting Cream (Again patented formula, with a lot of research and clinical trials)\n\n* Lancer Skincare the Nourish (Dr. Lancer dermatologists for Hollywood Stars) \n\n* Fresh Creme Ancienne Moisturizer (Literally made by hand in a Monastery in Europe) \n\n* Chanel Le Lift Restorative Cream (clinical and in vitro testing, patented formula) \n\n* Caudalie Premium Cru Rich/Normal Cream (again patented formula, developed with Harvard Medical School) \n\n* If you check out CultBeauty the Eve Lom holiday set (the one with the Moisture Cream and cleanser (all full size) are basically the same RV as the stupid Avant moisturizer. \n\nThe list can go on forever, also Anti pollution micellar water from Chanel only costs $45. If you take a look at the ingredients for Avant’s Micellar Water it’s missing a very crucial ingredient that the majority of “high end/effective” micellar water contain, PEG-6 Caprylic/ Capric Glycerides.  Seriously this is not even worth $1. \nLastly someone from this subreddit did some research on this company, I think she concluded it was being used to launder money. But the fact that they’re selling you crap for $100+ is enough proof for me.\n\nNow the 111skin products we get from boxycharm or Ipsy are NOT the same as the ones sold in retail stores or 111skin’s online site.  The hydra gel moisturizer that came from Ipsy for example has a completely different ingredients list from the “real” moisturizer.\n\nIngredients from 111skin Cryo Activating Hydra Gel Ipsy version: \nAloe Barbadensis Gel, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Butylene Glycol, Isohexadecane, Dipropylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond / Amande Douce) Oil, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Betaine, Lecithin, Pyrus Malus (Apple / Pomme) Fruit Water, Allantoin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Hydroxyacetophenone, Trehalose, Propanediol, Glyceryl Caprylate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Aluminium Dicetyl Phosphate, BHT, Tetrasodium EDTA, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol, Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow / Achillée) Extract, Xanthan Gum, Menthol, Menthyl Lactate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Fragrance / Parfum, Limonene, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Linalool.\n\nIngredients from 111skin’s site for the Hydra Gel:\nAQUA / WATER / EAU, NELUMBO NUCIFERA (LOTUS) ROOT WATER, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, GLYCERIN, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND / AMANDE DOUCE) OIL, SODIUM ACRYLATES COPOLYMER, CARBOMER, TETRAHEXYLDECYL ASCORBATE, ETHYLHEXYL PALMITATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, BETAINE, LECITHIN, PROPANEDIOL, BENZYL ALCOHOL, HORDEUM VULGARE (BARLEY / ORGE) SEED EXTRACT, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PRUNUS PERSICA (PEACH / PÊCHE) JUICE, PYRUS MALUS (APPLE / POMME) JUICE, TRITICUM VULGARE (WHEAT / BLÉ) SEED EXTRACT, DISODIUM EDTA, PANAX GINSENG ROOT EXTRACT, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, TRIHYDROXYSTEARIN, ACHILLEA MILLEFOLIUM (YARROW / ACHILÉE) EXTRACT, SODIUM HYALURONATE, MENTHOL, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, ALOE VERA LEAF EXTRACT, GLYCERYL UNDECYLENATE, MENTHYL LACTATE, XANTHAN GUM, GLUCOMANNAN, FRAGRANCE / PARFUM, BENZYL SALICYLATE, LIMONENE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL.\n\nSee the difference? The Ipsy one although it advertises that it’s made with lotus water, there’s no lotus anything in the ingredients. It’s full of texture enhancers and solvents, IMO they were mainly trying to copy the “gel texture” of the real moisturizer.  The real moisturizer that’s $200 isn’t that much better. No expensive ingredients or actives....Check out the Rovectin Lotus Water Cream, made from 75% lotus flower extract (I’m assuming extracts holds a lot more nutrients than lotus root water), and it’s $20 but it goes on sale for $10, has similar light texture etc etc.  Usually the “made for beauty boxes 111skin products” will have “Made in China for 111skin” on the packaging. The real products use to be made in Bulgaria and now I think it’s made in UK, and some are made in the US.  Even if the ingredients line up like the 111skin vitamin c serum from Ipsy and the old formula of the vitamin c from 111skin’s site, the texture, colour, smell are completely different.  The real one had a serum like texture, transparent, had some kind of smell (I forgot the smell, I compared the products like a year ago).  The Ipsy version has the texture of water, yellow tint, no smell I think. Even the real products from 111skin are total ripoffs...what the hell does that say about the “fake” ones? \n\nTL:DR - both Avant and 111skin products are crap, 111skin sends out fakes to beauty boxes but even the real products are crap.  Avant is a sketchy company and their products aren’t even worth the $12 add on price.  It doesn’t matter if Avant’s website looks legitimate, every MLM website looks a thousand times more legitimate than Avant but it’s still a scam.",

Since then I’ve found some products that work really well for me and which haven’t been mentioned on this sub before, so I decided to share my shelfie and write some reviews.\n\nI'm happy to hear your opinion about the products or my routine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Skin type**\n\nDry and sensitive, some general redness, not acne-prone.\n\nMy skin reacts to most artificial fragrances and some essential oils. \n\nI also prefer to use products with “natural” ingredients and try to avoid parabens, PEGs, micro plastic and mineral oil as much as possible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Products (from left to right):**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch** \n\nINCI: AQUA, CENTAUREA CYANUS FLOWER WATER, DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS HYBRID OIL, CETEARYL WHEAT STRAW GLYCOSIDES, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM BENZOATE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, STEARIC ACID, XANTHAN GUM, TOCOPHEROL, LACTIC ACID\n\nPrice 11 € for 200ml, available at Müller drugstore in Germany\n\nThis gentle cleansing milk is one of my holy grail products. All other cleansers that I’ve tried before where either super drying and/or made me break out. This one isn’t drying at all and yet leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. Only on days when I wear a lot of makeup I need to do an additional oil cleanse. I like that the formulation is not too watery, so it’s easy to spread on my face. It doesn’t have a noticeable smell. The bottle lasts a long time for me, usually over 6 months even with daily use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme**\n\nINCI: HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL, ETHYLHEXYL STEARATE, CERA ALBA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, KAOLIN, ZINC OXIDE, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND) OIL, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice 2 € for 50ml, available at Rossmann drugstore \n\nThis water free balm with oils and beeswax is a thick and oily formulation, similar to a cold cream. I sometimes use it on cold and dry winter days as a thin layer between my daytime moisturizer and sunscreen. I’m not sure if it truly qualifies as an occlusive cream, but in my experience it does help with preventing moisture loss in dry weather. It takes a while to get absorbed into the skin. A little goes a long way and when you apply too much your face is going to shine like crazy. I noticed that when I use this cream several days in a row my skin texture starts to feel a bit smoother than usual. The beeswax smell is nice too. It works well under makeup as long as you give it enough time to dry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dermaveel  (OTC pharmacy cream, made by HEEL)**\n\nINCI: ECTOIN\\*, AQUA, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PANTHENOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, SQUALANE, TOCOPHEROL, OLEA EUROPAEA FRUIT OIL, HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, VANILLA PLANIFOLIA FRUIT EXTRACT, ALCOHOL DENAT., CARBOMER, SODIUM CARBOMER, RHIZOBIAN GUM, CORYLUS AVELLANA BARK EXTRACT, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, C12-16 ALCOHOLS, PALMITIC ACID, CERAMIDE 3\n\n\\*Since this cream is a medical product, its active ingredient (Ectoin) is listed first, even though it’s not the main ingredient.\n\nPrice about 10 € for 30ml in online pharmacies \n\nSo this is a medical product for people with neurodermatitis that was recommended to me by my dermatologist. It has a thick, slightly oily consistency but doesn’t take too long to get absorbed into skin. The smell is slightly chemical. Its active ingredient, Ectoin, is supposed to protect skin cells from environmental stress factors and help with skin barrier restoration. It is also used in other products such as eye drops and nasal sprays.\n\nNow I don’t know enough about skincare to judge how solid the research behind this patented molecule is. When my skin was a bit over exfoliated a few months ago, my experience was that Dermaveel was in fact better at repairing my damaged skin barrier than other moisturizers that I tried.\n\nI only use this cream during the winter months; it’s too heavy for warm summer days, even for my dry skin. I use it as a daytime moisturizer a few times per week; I find it a bit too pricey for everyday use. Unfortunately it does sometimes pill up under my makeup foundation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Manuka Repair Creme/Miel de Manuka Crème Réparatrice (OTC pharmacy cream, made by French brand Comptoirs & Compagnies)**\n\nINCI: MEL, AQUA, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, MACADAMIA TERNIFOLIA SEED OIL, GLYCERYL STEARATE, SQUALANE,SODIUM STEAROYL GLUTAMATE, LEVULINIC ACID, PHENETHYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, BISABOLOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM LEVULINATE, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice about 10 € for 40ml in online pharmacies\n\nThe reason why I bought this was simply that I really wanted to try a Manuka product. It contains 40% GMO 300 Manuka Honey. This isn’t exactly the highest GMO rating, but it’s the best price-performance ratio I could find. Despite its 40% honey content it has an average moisturizer consistency, not sticky, dries fast. The smell is amazing! Very sweet, smells of honey and beeswax.\n\nWith my dry skin I found it not hydrating enough as standalone moisturizer, though it might work for normal to oily skin. I apply this in the evening (few times a week) in combination with my usual moisturizer (TO NMF). On the next morning my skin is smooth and soft; feels slightly exfoliated and overall texture seems to be improved. Manuka honey, or honey in general, is said to have exfoliating properties. Manuka also has anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial effects though I can’t really comment on that since I luckily don’t have any breakouts at the moment.\n\nOnce or twice I made the mistake to use the Manuka repair cream on the same evening as my AHA exfoliator- which resulted in slightly flakey skin on the next morning. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dado Sens Sun - Sonnencreme SPF 30**\n\nINCI: AQUA \\[WATER\\], DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE (UVINUL A PLUS) , ALCOHOL, ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE (UVINUL T 150), BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE (TINOSORB S), GLYCERIN, ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE (OCTISALATE), SUCROSE PALMITATE, DISTARCH PHOSPHATE, PANTHENOL, TITANIUM DIOXIDE (NON-NANO), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CANDELILLA/JOJOBA/RICE BRAN POLYGLYCERYL-3 ESTERS, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM STEAROYL LACTYLATE, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, BENZYLIDENE DIMETHOXYDIMETHYLINDANONE, ALLANTOIN, POLYHYDROXYSTEARIC ACID, SODIUM ALGINATE, CALCIUM ALGINATE, GLYCINE SOJA OIL \\[SOYBEAN\\], ALUMINA, STEARIC ACID, ECTOIN, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, LECITHIN, TOCOPHEROL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE\n\nPrice 20 € for 125ml, available at Müller, Douglas\n\nThis is my favourite sunscreen ever! Definitely a holy grail candidate. Sunscreens have always been a bit problematic for me, for two reasons: 1: I need to use a product without acrylates, which unfortunately are an ingredient in nearly every sunscreen formulation ever.  2: I’m a bit picky about sunscreen filters; I’d rather not use problematic filters like Octocrylene, Octinoxate, Oxybenzone and Homosalate. And now I finally found something that works for me!\n\nDado Sens Sonnencreme SPF 30 has a thick, creamy consistency, perfect for my dry skin but it is probably too much for oily skin. There is no noticeable white cast, however I’m pale as ghost anyway, so results might be different for darker skin tones. It leaves a small amount of shine but I’m not too bothered by this. Smell is slightly chemical (different from usual sunscreen smell) but not very strong.\n\nThe downsides are that it has only SPF 30 and contains alcohol. I don’t find it drying though. What I like best about it is that it has great filters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETYL ALCOHOL, PROPANEDIOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ARGININE, ASPARTIC ACID, GLYCINE, ALANINE, SERINE, VALINE, ISOLEUCINE, PROLINE, THREONINE, HISTIDINE, PHENYLALANINE, GLUCOSE, MALTOSE, FRUCTOSE, TREHALOSE, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SODIUM LACTATE, UREA, ALLANTOIN, LINOLEIC ACID, OLEIC ACID, PHYTOSTERYL CANOLA GLYCERIDES, PALMITIC ACID, STEARIC ACID, LECITHIN, TRIOLEIN, TOCOPHEROL, CARBOMER, ISOCETETH-20, POLYSORBATE 60, SODIUM CHLORIDE, CITRIC ACID, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, TRIETHANOLAMINE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, PHENOXYETHANOL, CHLORPHENESIN\n\nPrice 10 € for 100ml, available at Douglas\n\nI actually don’t want to write too much about this one, there are already tons of reviews on this sub. It has fairly good INCIs, doesn’t dry or break me out and is cheap – that’s all that I want in a moisturizer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), LACTIC ACID, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PROPANEDIOL, SODIUM HYALURONATE CROSSPOLYMER, TASMANNIA LANCEOLATA FRUIT/LEAF EXTRACT, ACACIA SENEGAL GUM, XANTHAN GUM, ISOCETETH-20, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL\n\nPrice 7 € for 30ml, available at Douglas\n\nThis is the first acid exfoliator I ever bought, so I can’t really compare it to other products. After a short purging period it got rid of the tiny closed comedones I had all over my face within about 6 weeks.  I like it a lot and use it about twice per week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Timeless Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin C Serum**\n\nINCI: WATER, MAGNESIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE, ALOE BARBADENSIS, GLYCERIN, HYALURONIC ACID, MATRIXYL 3000™, BENZYLALCOHOL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID\n\nThis is usually not available in Europe. I found it at my local TK Maxx store for 10 €. Bought it because I wanted to try Vitamin C. The lightweight, watery formulation is nice. It doesn’t have any noticeable smell.\n\nI’ve been using this for 8 weeks now and don’t really see any difference. When it’s empty I’m probably going to replace it with a more potent Vitamin C product from The Ordinary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Salthouse Totes Meer Therapie - Beruhigende Maske Akut** (Picture only shows lower half of sachet)\n\nINCI: AQUA, CELLULOSE GUM, GLYCERIN, PANTHENOL, PROPANEDIOL, MARIS SAL (DEAD SEA SALT), PROPYLENE GLYCOL, MAYTENUS MACROCARPA (CHUCHUHUASI) BARK EXTRACT, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE POWDER, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) LEAF EXTRACT, CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA FLOWER EXTRACT, PHENOXYETHANOL, CITRIC ACID, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL ALCOHOL\n\nPrice 1.25€ for 2x7ml, available at DM drugstore\n\nThis is a gel mask with Dead Sea salt and other calming ingredients. It calms down irritated skin and reduces redness. Most of the time it doesn’t completely get rid of the redness, but there is a visible difference. A hydrating, oil free formulation which I think is suitable for all skin types. The smell is slightly sweet but otherwise neutral. As usual, one of those “single-use” sachets is enough for at least three applications. It’s currently not a permanent part of my routine, but I use it whenever my skin gets irritated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Schaebens Augen & Lippen Maske**\n\nINCI: AQUA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, DIISOSTEAROYL POLYGLYCERYL-3 DIMER DILINOLEATE, GLYCERIN, CERA ALBA, ZINC STEARATE, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, CITRUS LIMON PEEL OIL, GLYCINE SOJA OIL, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA WATER, PANTHENOL, RETINYL PALMITATE, TOCOPHEROL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, UBIQUINONE, ALCOHOL, BENZOIC ACID, CITRAL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE, LACTIC ACID, LIMONENE, MAGNESIUM SULFATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, SORBIC ACID\n\nPrice 0.60€ for 4x1.5ml, available at DM, Rossmann\n\nThis is the only product with essential oils that I put on my face. It works surprisingly well for my sensitive skin. Even though it is advertised as an eye-and–lip mask and the instructions say to take it off after 10 mins., I use it as an overnight leave on mask for my whole face.\n\nIn the morning my skin feels plump and well hydrated. The mask reduces very fine lines overnight. Not permanently of course, but the effect does last at least a day for me.\n\nWhen I use this mask everyday my pores start to clog up after a while, so I make sure to not use it too frequently. 2 or 3 times a week is completely fine though. It’s also super cheap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Current Routine**\n\n**AM**\n\n\\-wash face with water\n\n\\- moisturizer: either TO NMF or Dermaveel\n\n\\- on cold days:  Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme\n\n\\- sunscreen: Dado Sens  Sun Sonnencreme SPF 30\n\n**PM**\n\n\\- Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch\n\n\\- one of the following:\n\n* TO NMF\n* TO LA 5% + TO NMF\n* Timeless HAC Serum + TO NMF\n* Manuka Repair Creme + TO NMF\n* Schaebens Augen und Lippen Maske as leave on overnight mask on whole face",

        "body": ">Conventional shampoo technology using anionic surfactants and cationic conditioners results in charge interaction and complexing of he ingredients. Neither shampoo nor conditioner achieves the desired result. The successful solution was to incorporate charge neutral dimethicone conditioning ingredients, suspended as microfine droplets within complex crystal lattices, into anionic surfactant shampoo technology. The same solultion has also been applied to amphoteric surfactant systems. This provides complete cleaning, and hair conditioning fully equal to separate conditioners without the problems of build-up. This was achieved by keeping the dimethicone in suspension throughout the shampoo process. During rinsing, excess water breaks the crystalline lattice and allows deposition of the dimethicone droplets onto the hair. Full cleaning and conditioning are, therefore, achieved in one application. Dimethicone build-up is not encountered as subsequent washes first remove soil and previously deposited dimethicone. Neither do neutral dimethicones show any interactions with sebum. \n\n[(Rushton, Gummer & Flasch, 1994)](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/211278)\n\nOne of the authors is affiliated with Proctor and Gamble.\n\nAs to why it doesn't appear to leave build up, the same article states that \"no significant shift compared to untreated hair was found showing that dimethicone does not build-up on the hair surface with continued washing\" and that \"the level of dimethicone deposited onto virgin hair was found to plateau after 5 washes...and remained constant for in excess of 50 washes.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> since shampoo is primarily focused on the scalp does the silicone deposit on it? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure, but I would guess that it might. Silicones are used in skincare though, so I am not sure why that would be a concern:\n\n>The major drawback to pure petrolatum as a moisturizer is its greasiness, which most patients find unaesthetic. This can be minimized by lowering the petrolatum concentration and adding dimethicone, known as an astringent moisturizer,to improve product aesthetics. **Dimethicone is the second most common active agent in moisturizers today** because it too is hypoallergenic, noncomedogenic, and nonacnegenic.4 Dimethicone is one of a family of silicones that form the basis of all oil-free moisturizers and facial foundations......Dimethicone can provide many other skin benefits as an active agent besides moisturization. It can function as an emollient, making the skin smooth and soft to the touch by filling in spaces between the desquamating corneocytes.\n\n(emphasis mine)\n\n[(Draelos, 2010)](https://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/Abstract/2010/02000/Active_Agents_in_Common_Skin_Care_Products.38.aspx)",

    "body": "*(Pc: It was me, Dio)*\n\n—Viktor & Rolf for me is one of few designer brands, that actually puts out some higher quality fragrances in comparison to most others. \n\n—This fragrance has an insanely long list of more than 14 flankers, its easy to get lost in this line. But here I talk only about the OG Viktor & Rolf Bon Bon.\n\n#VIKTOR & ROLF BONBON\n\n###Released in 2014\n###Concentration : Eau de parfum\n\n\n##Packing & Presentation \n\n🎁The outer packaging is just like any other designers, has some gift ribbon like design elements on it.\n\n🎁The bottle is absolutely freakin adorable, a cute bow-ribbon 🎀 lookin bottle, I got the 50ml version. *(the 50ml bow-ribbon looks even cuter than 90ml versions, IMO)*\n\n##Perfumers \n\n###☀️Cecile Matton\n###☀️Serge Majoullier\n\nYou may see both of their names in several other Bonbon flankers. Cecile may also be known for her other creations like OG Stronger with you , SWY Leather & SWY Oud versions. The duo is created an absolute belter when they made this fragrance.\n\n##Fragrance Profile\n\nThis is a **Fruity—Gourmand** fragrance. Leans more on the gourmand side than fruity.\n\n##Notes Here \n\n###- [x] Peach \n###- [x] Mandarin orange \n###- [x] Orange \n###- [x] Caramel \n###- [x] Orange blossom \n###- [x] Jasmine \n###- [x] Amber \n###- [x] Sandalwood \n###- [x] Guaiac wood \n###- [x] Cedar\n\n#How it smells ?\n\n🎀 It opens up with a fleshy **Peach accord** , you can discern its synthetic most commonly Benzyl alcohol, aldehydes & ketones. The peach note is not my favourite in perfumery cuz it may come off cheap, but not here, it’s absolutely beautiful in this fragrance. \n\n🎀 The peach accord is tamed down & its just about there, not interfering with any other elements of this fragrance. \n\n🎀 The **caramel is the star of the show** , the sweet ,sticky & sugary caramel smells absolutely delectable & bring a sensual silky smoothness to this fragrance.\n\n🎀 The caramel here is **not as sugary / Candy floss like in BR540** , at the same time its **not a burnt caramel situation like in Viva La Juicy Gold Couture** . \n\n🎀 The base, its pretty much an amalgamation of basic supportive elements for this gourmand to thrive. \n\n##Undecorated Breakdown \n\nThis smells like you made some **Tanghulu with peach & poured some hot caramel over it** . \nAlthough you may not get over the synthetic designer-ish sweetness, it smells freakin delicious, you can’t deny that.\n\n#Performance \n\n##Longevity \n🌕🌕🌕🌘🌑\n\n##Projection \n🌕🌕🌕🌑🌑\n\n##Compliment-factor \n🌕🌕🌕🌘🌑\n\nI sampled it before getting this as a gift & I even stole few sprays occasionally from her. I tested this on my skin, it has a tight bubble of projection , but thats a plus in my books.\n\n##When & Where, For Whom? \n\n⭐️This is an all seasoner fragrance, but can be cloying in high heats, so evening/night outs are  a perfect setting for this fragrance.\n\n⭐️This smells youthful & also mature enough, this may appeal to a wide demography of people, I can a see an enchanting college girl to a level headed lady in her 35 pull this off with ease.\n\n##Similarities with other fragrances \n\n🧐 I wouldn’t say similarity but only the sticky caramel will definitely remind you of **Viva La Juicy Gold Couture** .\n\n🧐 I can also draw similarities with **Mancera Instant Crush** . *(but its very faint resemblance, nothing worth talking about)*\n\n##Verdict\n\nAn absolute belter of a fragrance, a sensual youthful, delicious caramel fragrance. If you can get a sample/decant of it, do try this out. I believe this is discontinued, its no longer listed in V&R’s website anymore. If you can get it for a good deal its a banger, & its not worth overpaying also have that in mind too.",

Winters means dryness & cracked lips for me.\n\n[LIPPSSSSS](https://preview.redd.it/5phvc72etx661.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8a379572e84286d26fce0b36539b61233412ec8)\n\nThe prime way to fix dry lips is to increase your water intake. Lips are an extension of the throat and if you tend to often lick your lips subconsciously, it is your body's indication that it needs more water. Take my advice, I don't listen to it anyway. It is not easy to increase your water intake overnight. I struggle with drinking an adequate amount of water. A good lip product is my saviour from Sahara lips.\n\nI am ranking these lip products in order of preference.\n\n***1. Bakson's Sunny Lip Balm - ₹40***\n\nThank you @ for introducing me to this small wonder.\n\nDon't be misguided by the packaging. This lip balm is much more than your basic vaseline; It's the vaseline killer. This inexpensive lip balm provides the ideal balance of moisturisation, emollience and occlusiveness. The ingredient list is stellar. This lip balm does not just sit on my lips and lock moisture, but it also conditions my lips. It glides on my lips in a thin layer and you can immediately feel it emollize my lips. It keeps my lips hydrated for longer. I definitely need to reapply during the day but it provides immediate comfort to dry and cracked lips. Within 2-3 days of religious use, my lips are completely healed. This is the perfect lip balm to throw - in your bathroom, car, pocket, bag, and at your *'Sun yaar lip balm denaa?'* friends.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Petrolatum, Lanolin Anhydrous, Shea Butter, Souabran Glycerides, Bees Wax, Almond Oil, Vitamin E, Distillates of Aloe vera & Calendula, B.H.T., Sorbic Acid, Perfume.*\n\nAdditional tip: Lanolin makes for a great nipple balm. It is prescribed to pregnant & lactating mothers. If you suffer from dry nipples, you can use this lip balm to perk 'em up to life.\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WRP**\n\n***2. Unpa Bubi Bubi Lip Ampule - $6***\n\nIt would be on the top of my list had its competitor not been 1/10th of its price. Its name can certainly raise eyebrows, but this one packs a punch. I was pleasantly surprised by this random buy. The texture is like honey, but it is not at all sticky or goopy. It is very comfortable to apply during the day or at night. It goes on in a thin layer and adheres well to your lips. It does not just stay put and form an occlusive barrier, but a part of it descends into my lips and makes my lips moisturised & naturally plump. It helps deeply condition my lips, repairing flaky and dry skin. I had recently cut my lip, and this one helped to repair my lips overnight. I feel I do not need to reapply during the day, and it keeps my lips hydrated through the night as well. Love the tube packaging. A little goes a long way with this one, and it truly gives me baby lips. I want to repurchase this again.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Diisostearyl Malate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Castor Oil Isostearate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Microcrystalline Wax, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Dehydroacetic Acid, Ceramide NP, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Water, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hyaluronic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter*\n\n**Rating: 4.5/5, WRP**\n\n***3.  Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula - with SPF 15 - Dark Chocolate & Mint ₹130***\n\nThis lip balm has the perfect shape for a lip balm in a stick & the texture is like that of a stick of butter. It does not have the typically waxy feeling. It is highly emollient and moisturising. SPF is an added benefit as lips also need sun protection to protect from ageing, especially if you are heading outside in the sun. Perfect for throwing in your purse. The smell and flavour are surprisingly nice. Ideal for all mint chocolate lovers out there. Even though it has some chemical filters, it doesn't have an unpleasant smell or aftertaste. I feel the need to reapply during the day, but it is an enjoyable feeling due to flavour and scent. Overall I quite enjoyed this lip balm. I will repurchase.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Dimethicone 1.5%, Octinoxate 7.5%, Oxybenzone 4.5%. Inactive ingredients: mineral oil (paraffinum liquidum), microcrystalline wax (cera microcristallina ), copernicia cerifera (carnauba) wax, theobroma cacao (cocoa) seed butter, fragrance (parfum), tocopherol, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, isopropyl myristate, beta carotenex0003(CI 40800), zea mays (corn) oil, benzyl alcohol.*\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WRP**\n\n***4. The Body Shop Strawberry Lip Balm ₹250***\n\nThis used to be one of my favourite lip balms before I tried the ones above it. There is a theme here. This lip balm too adds emollience to your lips. The artificial strawberry flavour and the smell are intense and quite enjoyable in my 15-year-old brain. This lip balm has been intended for your partner to enjoy. I'm not too fond of the pot packaging, but there is enough product here to last you months. The flavours are interesting and mood uplifting. Overall it is a nice lip balm but I won't be repurchasing it because I can get something similar in a better packaging for 1/5th the price.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Ricinus Communis Seed Oil, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax, Lanolin, Parfum, Cera Alba, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Silica \\[NANO\\], Tocopheryl Acetate, Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Ammonium Glycyrrhizate, Aroma, Fragaria Vesca Fruit Extract, Tocopherol, Benzyl Benzoate, BHT, CI 15850, CI 15850.*\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WNRP**\n\n***5. Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask - Choco Mint ₹1150***\n\nThis popular pick used to be my holy grail lip mask two years ago. This innovative product was one of the first of its descent and ahead of its time. Its thick and goopy texture catches eyeballs. This is my second tub of this product, and if you have tried one of these you know, this lasts a lifetime. Sadly, this queen has been dethroned by Bubi Bubi Lip Ampule. I do not find myself reaching for it anymore. My relationship with this product was like a young romance. I went in starry-eyed and fell fast for the bling, but now I find myself looking for more material suitors. The texture of this is very thick & goopy, but my issue with the product is that it never truly sinks in. It stays sticky, thick and wet on your lips and once you remove it (because it won't sink in), your lips won't feel much different than when you first put it on. The feeling on your lips is not particularly pleasant. This is why you cannot use it in the day. It is a good sleeping mask for the night if you put something underneath it as works well for locking in moisture. If you are curious to try this, I recommend getting a smaller sample size as that would last you 6 months and be more pocket friendly. The mint flavour quite nice and not overpowering. The tingle is not intense. I will not be repurchasing this.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Diisostearyl Malate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytosteryl/Isostearyl/Cetyl/Stearyl/Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polybutene, Microcrystalline Wax/Cera Microcristallina/Cire Microcristalline, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Synthetic Wax, Ethylene/Propylene/Styrene Copolymer, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Mica, Butylene/Ethylene/Styrene Copolymer, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax/Candelilla Cera Hydrocarbons/Cire De Candelilla, Candelilla Wax Esters, Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891), Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax/Copernicia Cerifera Cera/Cire De Carnauba, Dehydroacetic Acid, Methicone, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Blue 1 Lake (Ci 42090), Limonene, Yellow 10 Lake (Ci 47005), Water/Aqua/Eau, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Linalool, Potassium Alginate, Glycerin, Propanediol, BHT, Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Sapindus Mukorossi Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Chamaemorus Seed Extract, Chenopodium Quinoa Seed Extract, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Beta-Glucan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Manganese Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Disodium Edta, Ascorbyl Glucoside*\n\n***Rating: 3/5, WNRP***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***RiRe Bubble Bubble Mask: - Bubbling mask that does nothing. DO NOT wish to review even. Total Gimmick. I fell for it. Waste of money. STAY AWAY.***",

    "body": "I had my top surgery 10 days ago, drains removed 3 days ago.  I developed an EXTREME itch, like itching to the point of bleeding and being unable to rest or sleep.  I got bath rags with soap in them to keep clean because my shower setup isn't the best to safely use yet and I kept itching so bad.  I read about post surgical itch, tried benadryl, tried anti itch meds, nothing worked.\n\nIt wasn't until I scrubbed my scalp and got sudden irritating itches that I sat down and checked the ingredient list on the bath rags and cross checked with something I know I'm allergic to, being makeup removing wipes.  Botb products had something in common; Benzyl Alcohol.  I looked up other things it's in, which is a VERY large amount of hygiene and cosmetic products, including hair dyes that leave my scalp itchy for days.  I looked further into it and found its in my Testosterone, too, which leaves the injection site swollen and itchy (but it's at least not nearly as bad).  I showered with my bar soap and scrubbed extensively and almost all the itch went away soon after.\n\nSo if you develop a really bad itch all over, check whatever you're using for cleaning yourself, be it bath wipes, baby wipes, etc for benzyl alcohol.",

We understand your concerns, which is why we have recently reformulated our Dish Soap and it will be available later this year. We are in the final testing of the formula.

This was my first sunscreen I bought after leaning about photoaging! My first baby! And we were off to a good start. It’s a white watery gel-like texture, light weight, invisible, but quite shiny (some might call this a dewy finish, but I prefer a skin-like finish). A good poster child for the typical Asian sunscreen, I guess. It is not water resistant, and you'll notice this as you sweat throughout the day: It’s like your sweat becomes heavier since it mixes with the sunscreen (you can’t see this of course, but it sure feels like it). I was also worried about touching my face throughout the day, because I felt I might rub the sunscreen off. I can’t remember it ever stinging my eyes, but I’m not entirely sure. The biggest drawback for me was the prize and how inaccessible it is in my country. At this point in time, I also hadn’t learnt about the proper amount of sunscreen you have to use, so I was probably underapplying, and the sunscreen can therefore have appeared lighter-textured in my memory. It contains a lot of fragrance and many ingredients, in general, so that could be irritating. A little bit of science: If you look at the UV filters, there are several UVB filters; many UVB (290-320 wavelength/nm) filters also “bleed into” and filter some UVA II (320-340) as well. The Uvinul A plus filters both UVA II and I (340-400), but it’s also the only UVA filter in this sunscreen, and it’s also the last ranking UV filter on the ingredient list, even though I’ve read that the upper limit for Uvinul A plus is 10% (of the total product). So, is there enough UVA protection? I don’t know, but it’s probably okay since the Pa is four pluses, so I wouldn’t worry too much about it. Packaging is nice and it has a pump, and you get 75 ml, not only the standard 50 ml.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Avène Hydrance OPTIMALE UV RICHE Rich hydrating cream**\n\n* \\- **SPF 20, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **40 ml/1.35 Fl.OZ**\n* \\- **Probably suitable for darker skin tones**\n* \\- **France**\n* \\- **Ingredients:** AVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA).

It does not have high enough UV protection, and it is not designed to be used as a sunscreen, and therefore you will end up underapplying. I bought it because I was looking for a day cream at the time. I wanted something for my dry skin and this day cream worked in that regard. But never did I ever apply close to the amount of sunscreen you have to apply to get the labelled SPF and UVA protection. It is on the heavier side, so applying a quarter teaspoon to your face would not feel nice. Trust me. And even then, you’d only get SPF 20. I would not recommend anyone to use this product as a daily SPF product. It also contains fragrance even though it says it’s suitable for sensitive skin.\n* \\- **Score:** 2/5\n\n**NIVEA SUN UV FACE ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS SPF 30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

I must have gone though three of these. It has a lot in common with the MAKE P:REM one, and it also shares some of the same problems. It has a similar texture: white watery-gel, which turns translucent on top of the skin. It’s like a glycerine-rich moisturiser. I think it’s less shiny as well – more skin-like finish. The problem arises when you sweat: your sweat starts feeling even heavier than normal. I think I experienced some eye stinging with this sunscreen (nothing major), largely caused by it not being water resistant. It’s important to note that the reason it is so cosmetically elegant is also why it’s not water resistant. I was also scared to touch my face and accidently rub it off while wearing this one, too. It’s smells like sunscreen. If you’ve ever purchased a NIVEA sunscreen, you’ll know what I mean. And the fragrance doesn’t go away immediately either. My biggest problem at the time, was also that I wanted to find a SPF 50 sunscreen, and this one is only SPF 30. I think I’ve recently seen a SPF 50 version of this since, so if you live in Europe, I guess it’s worth giving it a shot. Looking at the ingredient list now, I see that it contains a lot of avobenzone. Avobenzone has a bad rep, but you cannot deny how effectively it protects against UVA when photostable. Avobenzone on its own is not photostable and will start degrading (and be used up) when exposed to the sun or UV light. In this sunscreen, however, (and most non-American sunscreens) it has been stabilised by another UV filter: In this case by Tinosorb S. I think this sunscreen might have much higher UVA protection than the EU requirement, which makes sense since it’s advertised as “ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS”.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Piz Buin Ultra Light Dry Touch Face Fluid SPF 30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Sweat and water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

This sunscreen survived me walking all around Madrid for a week in the middle of summer. Boom. What a trooper. The texture is a thick liquid, not a cream, so the opening is narrow so you can pour some into your hand or tilt your head backwards and pour it directly on your face. It dries to an almost powdery finish – it truly is dry touch. If you have dry skin, you should probably moisturise beforehand. It was also easy enough to reapply when I was out and about in Madrid; So, layering it wasn’t a chore. If you don’t apply it evenly it might dry down with some flakes even – that’s how dry it is. But I didn’t feel like it dried out my skin in the process, but that is of course a very personal observation. I would have been perfect if it was SPF 50, a little less expensive, and fragrance free. If you’ve ever tried a Piz Buin sunscreen, you’ll recognise their trademark fragrance at once: masculine and sunscreen-like. It does bring back good memories of summer and beaches for me personally, though.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**THE BODY SHOP Vitamin E Day Lotion SPF30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

And it’s not water-resistant, so it will on glide on your face as you sweat. But the absolute worst thing about this is how much it stings your eyes. I could barely open them in broad daylight, and I had to go back home and wash my face to get it off. Do not, under any circumstances apply this close to your eyes. I don’t know what caused it: maybe all the perfume, or the UV filters? Also, the way this product smells, is absolutely abhorrent. Old lady perfume, and it’s so strong.

I have very pale skin (and am therefore really scared of “universal tints”), but it blended perfectly into my skin tone, perhaps with the slightest bit of coverage. Since it’s a mineral sunscreen, I’m sceptical if it’ll blend into darker skin, even with the tint, so that’s something to keep in mind. It might also have photo flashback, you have been warned. Even though it is silicone based, I wouldn’t describe it as “silicone-y”, if you know what I mean; it has a skin like finish. However, I don’t think I ever applied enough of it to truly know what its finish is like… First and foremost: the packaging. When I bought it, they still used a dropper – I repeat a dropper. This did not work, as the product would spill over, clump up at the inner edges of the bottle’s mouth, etc. And since it clumped up at the sides, I honestly don’t know if I’ve lost some of the UV protection of the product, since it’s no longer a completely homogenous liquid. They later changed the dropper to a pump, but it’s still embarrassing that they ever sold it with a dropper. What were they thinking? You also spend quite a bit of time applying it evenly on your skin, due to its consistency and tint. You kind of have to apply it like a foundation. Since it’s only 30 ml, it means that you should be finishing one of these in less than a month – and only if you’re just applying it to your face. At least it doesn’t have any fragrance! It does have an iffy smell to it, which goes away. Taking into consideration the cost, the packaging (even though it has improved) the fact that it’s not a SPF 50, PA++++ product, you’re left with a very mediocre sunscreen. It could however serve as a daily serum on top of your sunscreen, if you’re very extra.\n* \\- **Score:** 3/5\n\n**Altruist Dermatologist Sunscreen SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I had really high expectations for Altruist, same as many others, and I was let down. It isn’t that bad of a sunscreen, but it’s also not that good. At this point in my quest for the Holy grail sunscreen, I realised I had to up my UV game. SPF 30 wasn’t enough, and I wanted as high of an UVA protection as possible. With the EU’s regulation of UVA protection (in a nutshell the UVA protection has to be 1/3 of the SPF), you could, in theory, end up with SPF 30 sunscreens that had higher UVA protection than your SPF 50 sunscreen. And as a consumer, you simply wouldn’t know the difference. Anyway, Altruist SPF 50, has perfect UV protection, and no fragrance and such. In theory it’s the perfect sunscreen. I mean, look at all those filters (seriously why are there so many, did the chemists make a bet or something?) But in practice? Not so much. First and foremost, if you have darker skin, this might leave a white cast due to the titanium dioxide. Some people have mentioned this in their reviews and some people have also mentioned it stinging their eyes (I can’t remember noticing this). Secondly, the reason I didn’t like it, is because of the texture. It’s the same sort of texture as the MAKE P:REM and NIVEA mentioned above, just less cosmetically elegant. I thought it would dry down or sink into my face, but it never did. I would wait for 20 minutes, and I would still be sticky and a little bit shiny. What worked was putting a lot of translucent powder on top, then I would finally achieve a more skin like finish. Pro tip: Translucent powder can actually make most sunscreens bearable. Since it didn’t dry down, I felt as I would rub it off if my face touched anything. Maybe this sunscreen would work for people with dry skin? Since applying this sunscreen, waiting, applying powder, would take such a long time, I ended up just using a different sunscreen. And I guess that says it all. It also has a “chemical” smell to it, but that didn’t bother me. It might not have worked for my face, but it’s still a good sunscreen for the rest of the body.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Skinnies Sungel SPF30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, broad spectrum, PA++++ (PPD 16+)**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

This sunscreen utilises a new technology called Organogel™. It contains no water, and thus it doesn’t have to dry down, and you only need 1/5 the amount of a normal sunscreen. You heard that right: 1/5! So, you only need a pea-sized amount for your entire face! But I used a little bit more than that, because real peas are actually very small, so when people say pea-sized, they usually mean 2-3 real peas. A photo from their website illustrating what they meant by pea-sized confirmed my suspicion. But it’s still a very small amount! The texture is that of a see-through slightly orange-y gel. It’s oily, but it doesn’t move on your skin (also when you sweat). And it’s completely see-though so I can with confidence say it’ll suit every skin tone. It doesn’t completely dry down, though, but it does seem to sink into your skin a little bit, if you wait a couple of minutes. You can feel the gel on your skin when you touch it, but you wouldn’t notice you had anything on otherwise. Since it isn’t water based it also feels sturdier than the others I’ve tried, so I wasn’t as scared of it rubbing off when touching my skin. I think it might work very well as a primer. It has a slight “chemical” smell, it also doesn’t contain any perfume or any nonsense like that. It’s on the pricier side, but one 100ml bottle is actually the equivalent of 500ml of normal sunscreen, when you think about it, so I think the prize is justifiable. This was the sunscreen I kept on using when the Altruist one wasn’t working for me, by the way. It’s definitely the quickest sunscreen to apply of all the sunscreens I’ve ever used. A con is that is a little bit difficult to gauge if you are using enough, and that you’ve applied it evenly. Turns out there are two versions of this sunscreen: An American one and a New Zealand one. I somehow ended up with the American one, and it has worked just fine for me. The NZ version uses non-FDA approved filters, but it still has the same UVB and UVA protection listed, but I would still recommend you buy the NZ version, since there must be a reason why they chose to not just use the same formulation as the American one, right? Since I bought my bottle, they have also released many new products, like an SPF 50+. If the SPF 50+ behaves the same way as this one, I think I might have given it a score of 5/5. But keep in mind that it does not have a dry-touch finish (more of an immovable oily finish), but at least it has a sturdy one.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**The Balm BALMSHELTER TINTED MOISTURIZER (Shade: Lighter Than Light)**\n\n* \\- **SPF 18, broad spectrum**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **64 ml/ 2.15 Fl.

Note that this tinted moisturiser is much lighter than any of The Balm’s other products labelled “Lighter Than Light”. It’s really is a pale shade (it appears darker before you spread it over your skin), and it blends perfectly into my skin: I’ve never seen a tinted moisturiser or BB cream this fair before. However, it is so sheer, that the tint almost doesn’t matter. A little goes a long way, and that’s why you shouldn’t really use BB creams, tinted moisturisers and foundation as UV shields. I intended on using this on top of my sunscreen, but since it has next to none coverage, I never find myself reaching for it.

This sunscreen was bought in Europe. America/Canada/Australia/Asia might have a different version of this sunscreen, because of the country’s different restrictions on UV filters and sunscreen criteria (especially American sunscreens). These versions are not always equal, both in UV protection and cosmetic elegance. It also turns out that I have bought two versions of this sunscreen: A new and an older version. I actually bought the newest version first – and I loved it. I couldn’t understand how people hated it (the skincare community is very split when it comes to the Shaka fluid). Of course, everyone’s skin is difference and can have a lot to say on how a sunscreen feels and behaves on the skin. It’s a fluid, so you have to shake it thoroughly. It takes a little bit longer to apply, since it’s a fluid. It dries down matte, and you can’t see that you’re wearing anything. Easy peasy. Its biggest downfall is the prize (I bought it on sale) and that it only comes in a tiny 50ml, so you can’t buy it in bulk, so to speak. But this was the newest version (as of this year)… and then I ended up accidently buying the older version online (which might still be in production?), and oh boy, was that a different experience! Not dry-touch, but oily! They looked so similar, but I instantly felt the difference on my face, because it didn’t dry down. Absolutely horrible in comparison, I felt so gross. You can tell the new version from the old from the packaging: The newest version has “ANTI-OXYDANT” written underneath the “UVB + UVA” text. It has a similar texture as the Piz Buin mentioned above, but I personally think the Piz Buin is superior in texture: even more dry-touch. But the shaka outshines almost all sunscreens in terms of UVB and UVA protection, and it doesn’t have any irritating fragrance to boot. I thought this would be my final HG sunscreen, because it couldn’t get any better in terms of UV protection and cosmetic elegance.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5 (new “ANTI-OXYDANT” version, 2019) (old version: 4/5, because it still has great UV protection, okay?)\n\n**EVY TECHNOLOGY SUNSCREEN MOUSSE SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I found it. Perfect texture, high UV protection, and relatively affordable. It also comes in a 100 ml bottle, not a 50 ml, which I appreciate. According to EVY, their sunscreens work differently than other sunscreens, because they don’t lay on top of your skin and form a film, but instead they sink into the skin (stratum corneum, I presume). Because of this, they’re very water resistant and sturdy. You shake the bottle, turn it upside down, and squeeze out a golf ball-sized blob of mousse. (This mousse holds its shape pretty well and you can play with it.) Then I just rub the mousse into my face: first it turns into a light-weight white cream… and then it disappears into the skin. After a couple of minutes, there is no trace of it, but if I’ve applied to much there might be some stickiness. It certainly feels like it sinks into the skin, because it’s very hydrating. The other sunscreens I’ve liked, I’ve liked for their dry-touch finish, but with EVY I don’t need to worry about it, because I can’t feel it on my face when I touch (well, technically my face feels like it’s been hydrated) and it doesn’t do anything when I sweat. A Youtuber reviewed EVY and said that the Boots star system is only marketing – it’s not. While we have a universal measurement of UVB: SPF, we’ve later realised that UVA also causes skin damage and cancer, but we still haven’t been able to agree on one universal measurement or requirement. The Boots Star Rating system with a maximum of 5 stars requires much higher UVA protection than the European Recommendation, where the UVA protection only needs to be 1/3 of the SPF. Gothamista, however, really liked EVY. It has no fragrance, but a light aerosol smell that goes away. Because of the packaging, no preservatives are needed. It also contains some antioxidants. I’m already on my third bottle of EVY, and I will continue to purchase it in the future.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5\n\nSome sunscreens I’ve heard good things about and might want to try one day: Anessa sunscreens, Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF 50 PA ++++, Ultrasun sunscreens, Bioderma Photoderm Max Cream SPF50+.",

You note the dry-touch finish - which is great - but does it leave any or much shine?\n\nIt's worth noting that the Face SPF30 version has a 5 star (Boots?) UVA rating so the PPA / PPD factor should be around 27.. which is higher than most SPF50s, I'm sure!

I copied this from the ingredient list given in the product packaging)\n\n**Texture/ Consistency :** I'd say it's pretty much colorless goopy water/ light serum texture, does not feel oily. But if you apply too much and try to vigorously rub it in, it kinda foams up a bit.\n\n**Fragrance:** Does not have much of fragrance, but if you reeeeally pay attention there's a very faint herbal smell to it (According to the brand website it is supposed to be fragrance free)\n\n**Product name and link :** [Dot & Key Cica+2% Salicylic Spot Correction Gel](https://www.dotandkey.com/products/cica-clear-spot-correction-gel)\n\n**Ingredients list:**  Aqua, Niacinamide, Salicylic Acid (and) Dextrin (and) Polydextrose (and) Amylopectin, Ethoxydiglycol, Glycerine, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer (and) Lecithin, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol (and) Ethylhexylglycerin, Centella Asiatica (Cica) Extract, Glycolic Acid, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA. \n\n**Texture/ Consistency :** Light weight colorless gel texture, forms a light film when used as a spot treatment. Product pills up if applied too much\n\n**Fragrance:** Does not have any fragrance that I could notice (According to the brand website it is supposed to be fragrance free)\n\n**Usage Timeline:** about 3 weeks for both products\n\n**Product Photos:** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[texture pic](https://preview.redd.it/dfcjqjj3kcyb1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b647d8ad610b5779799a65800bd7eb85f9e7359)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[spot correction gel](https://preview.redd.it/j0q7u71gkcyb1.jpg?width=922&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ef4df060ab3ec73bc6dd5f2634c9df9b475859f)\n\n**Experience with products:**\n\n*How did I use the products:* I have used the serum before as a spot treatment in the past and it had worked out fine and managed to reduce acne within a couple of days if I recall correctly. But back then I didn't actively monitor anything. So this time I thought I'd actually check if any of them work or not. \n\nIn late September/early October, because of some lifestyle choices I ended up with a bunch of acne and thought let me do a small test to see if any of these products actually work or not. Test method is as follows:\n\n1. For a couple of pimples, I just used the serum\n2. For some, I just used the spot correction gel\n3. and for the rest I applied the serum and then the spot correction gel (this is not really recommended I just did it, for science lol)\n\nand I'm aware that I should have used a control group of acne to measure how long it typically takes my skin to get rid of them to have a proper experiment. But I totally forgot to do it, so I'll just use my past experience with acne as a measure for these products. And to keep it a somewhat fair experiment I used both products as spot treatment after moisturizer (even though that's not the typical order of how a serum would be applied)\n\nFor my skin, it typically takes 2-3 weeks for bigger acnes to surface and go away on their own and they usually leave scars, and the smaller ones go away within week or so.\n\n*Results:*\n\n1. For [smaller acne with a white head (example pic)](https://images.app.goo.gl/gdYN9triZSCwpM2a8), the spot corrector managed to reduce it within a couple of hours, whereas it took the serum overnight to reduce it\n2. For [slightly bigger acne with a white top (example pic)](https://images.app.goo.gl/RYtefeHiXo4nBar49), it took the spot corrector overnight to reduce the redness, and I had to use it the next 1-2 days depending on the size to fully reduce the acne bump. Whereas, with the serum it took about 3 -4 days of twice application per day to get the same result\n3. For [slightly bigger acne under the skin (example pic)](https://images.app.goo.gl/FNk1WKTDNkd5EbSF8), the spot corrector was practically useless, but the serum managed to reduce it from inside sort of and the acne never really surfaced on the skin.\n4. For bigger painful acne under the skin (I had only 1 of this type so the sample size is veryyyy small) : Here I first used the spot  corrector for a 1.5 days and it didn't do anything visibly, but it reduced the pain a little bit. Then I used the serum for 2 days (3-4 times per day as spot treatment) which then made the pimple actually come up on the top layer of the skin and have a white head on it. And then applying the spot corrector on it for a little over a day made the white head and pain go away for the most part. \n5. With both products, for smaller acne, I didn't get any acne scarring and for the bigger acne I got minimal scarring which is a big win for me.\n\n*Conclusion:* WRP for both unless I find something better.\n\n1. The spot correction gel works better if the acne has already surfaced on the skin and has a white head on it.\n2. The serum is very useful in making the acne come out to the top layers of the skin.\n3. Both products essentially work, but if I had to choose one, I'd say it'd be the serum since it has a wider use case even though it works slower compared to the spot correction gel\n4. Both products did help in me getting lighter scars to begin with so it'd be faster for the PIH to fade.",

    "body": "I've tried quite a few vitamin c stuff. I use it to mostly improve overall brightness, fade hyperpigmentation and their antioxidant benefits. Here are some of the ones I tried most recently.\n\n- Ole Henriksen c-rush brightening gel creme: \n\nBought this on impulse in sephora. The ingredients aren't the best with some fragrances and benzyl alcohol. Personally did not irritate me at all. It contains 3 types of vit c: ascorbic acid, tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, ethyl ascorbic acid. It comes in a jar, so I'm not sure if the vitamin c will remain effective after some time since its repeatedly exposed to air and light. Also contains vitamin e, collagen, HA, panthenol and different extracts.\n\nIts an orange coloured medium thickness gel consistency. Its not the type of gel that turns very watery when you rub it in so it does okay in terms of hydration. \n\nI noticed no fading at all, but that’s a given since this cream is marketed more towards giving skin a glow, hydrating, plumping and firming. On that note I didn't notice any increase in glowiness and suppleness. The hydration part was alright, I definitely needed to layer other products before it. It wasn't enough to use at night. I can't really say anything about the firming part.\n\nIt does what a moisturizer does but I honestly did not feel it managed to do as much as it claimed. It was just an average product with a pretty heavy price tag. I still finished my jar of it but will not be repurchasing.\n\n- Laneige radian-c cream: \n\nI stumbled upon this right after finishing the ole henriksen. It looked pretty simillar from the name and packaging. This one only has 1 type of vitamin c: 8.5% ethyl ascorbic acid. This one also comes in a jar. No drying alcohol (contains cetearyl alcohol) but contains fragrances. Other notable ingredients are madecassoside and vitamin e.\n\nUnlike the ole henriksen this one does claim to fade dark spots and brighten in general. Personally can't confirm this claim since I had to stop after only a week or so. It wasn't an immediate reaction, but my skin slowly got more and more irritated and prone to breakouts the more I used it. It might have been the fragrance in this. I tried it again after a couple weeks when my skin healed, but it only got irritated again.\n\n- Youth to the people superberry hydrate and glow dream mask: \n\nProbably the one I like the most out of the creams. I use this as a sleeping mask every other day. Contains tetrahexyldecyl as vitamin c. Has fragrance in it bit no reactions. This form is stable, but the product comes in a clear jar. Other ingredients are vitamin e, squalane, HA, panthenol, allantoin and some extracts.\n\nIt definitely delivers on the hydrate and glow part. It makes my skin brighter and glowier when using it, and the hydration lasts after I've washed my face. Its supposed to help uneven skintone and be anti aging. Didn't notice any fading but its fine since it does make me look brighter and glowier.\n\nIts a yellow cream that sort of becomes a light oil when you rub it in. Reminded me of the ordinary's vitamin c suspension in texture, but much more pleasant. The oil dosen't just sit on the skin and feel heavy. I've used squalane stuff that broke me out before, but this did not. Has a fruity smell that is kinda unpleasant to me, but it usually dissapears after a bit.\n\nI'll probably try this as a morning moisturizer in the winter. I like this a lot and the only bummer about this is the price tag.\n\n- Melano cc: \n\nA good place to start, took me a month or so to see some fading, but none of it has dissapeared. Did feel some warm tingling the first few times but nothing major. Vitamin c in here is ascorbic acid and ascorbic palmiate which are both not that stable. \n\nThis serum has a light, slightly oilly texture that gave my dry skin a nice glow too. I used it morning and night until it eventually oxidised 7 months after I bought it. But honestly thats fine cause this isn't that expensive and I noticed more results when I used this generously. \n\nAlso might be my bad though cause I took this travelling a lot and didn't refrigerate it. I've heard their packaging is good though since it limits the contact the serum has with air and sunlight. Its pretty hard to squeeze it out of the tube. \n\nHas a citrus smell so it has fragrance. It dosen't irritate or break me out at all. This also has vitamin e which I heard boosts the effects of the vit c.\n\n- Innisfree brightening pore line:\n\nDelivered the fastest results. The only caveat with this is that the ingredients contain drying alcohol and fragrance pretty high up. My skin does react to those sometimes but was completely fine with this line. In just 1-2 weeks it literally lightened my entire face. The serum is mostly responsible for this.\n\nThis vit c is in the form of ethyl ascorbic acid which is very stable. The brand also mentions that the hallabong extract here is a good source of vitamin c. \n\nI was using it morning and night at first. The texture is like a light hydrating water type serum thats just a touch viscous. More pleasant to layer other products on it. Leaves just a slight residue that dissapears when I layer stuff on it. Theres an artificial orange scent but its honestly pretty pleasant and not too strong and dissapears after a while. I decreased use to night time and eventually stopped since I got a good 2 shades lighter. \n\nThis line also contains arbutin, niacinamide, HA and other nice ingredients. Really noticed no differnce with my pores with this line but pretty good at moisturizing. I still use the sleeping mask from this line every few days that is less scary whitening and more just brightening. Its not the best at hydration and I definitely need to layer other products under it or it will just dissapear into my skin.\n\nThe toner feels a bit too alcholly for my taste. My nose is pretty sensitive and I can smell it. I've tried it out a few times though and was surprisingly hydrating, it didn't dry my skin out at all. It passes as a hydrating toner and didn't irritate me. Not sure about the long term effects since I never used this regularly over a period of time.\n\nThe cleanser is just average. It stripped my skin and made it feel tight but its not the most drying cleanser out there. I did notice like a slight boost in brightening after using this, but I don't think it lasted that long.\n\n- Ti'am my signature red c serum: \n\nCurrently testing this 20% ascorbic acid. Its unstable and reviews generally say this oxidises quickly. Its been in my fridge for a while and no oxidisation for me. \n\nIts honestly not going that great right now. Just straight up using the serum from the bottle breaks me out. Surprisingly no tingling or warm sensation, although my face will look more red the next day. The only way to prevent it from breaking me out is to mix it with moisturizer, but then I don't notice any brightening with that method. I've tried mixing it with other lighter serums too but it always breaks me out the next day. \n\nThis also contains alcohol and essential oils, so my skin could either be reacting to that or the concentration of vit c is too high. Contains other nice ingredients like glutathione, niacinamide, beta-glucan. \n\nThe texture is like a thicker serum with very sticky finish and it always smells like barbeque chips in a bad way. The worst texture and scent in this list. I think we'll have to breakup soon, I don't see this working out.\n\n- Somebymi yuja niacin 30 days blemish care line: \n\nI purchased a travel set to try out first. My skin didn't agree with their aha bha line so I was a bit more cautious. I only repurchased the full version of the toner and serum.\n\nAgain, the serum seems the most effective at brightening. The star ingredients are 5% niacinamide and 82% yuja extract but still contains vit c in the form of sodium ascorbyl phosphate, which is reportedly stable since this comes in a transparent yellow bottle. \n\nThe most pleasant one in terms of texture. Had the lightest watery texture that dosen't leave any residue after I rub it in, just a slight touch of hydration. Lighter than the innisfree, but less hydration. I layer other hydrating essences/serums with this since its hydration is not enough for my dry skin. \n\nThis contains essential oils but my skin dosen't react to it though. The smell of the serum though is an issue. Really smelled like yuzu (a type of lemon) at first, but after a while the smell started changing and now it just smells like chemicals with a hint of chicken noodle soup. Haven't found any reviews criticizing the smell so far. I haven't had mine for that long yet so it can't be expired. I only have this issue with the serum, the other stuff from this line are okay.\n\nThis serum brightened my skin overall but I noticed almost no fading, although I still liked the effect it gave me. Just like the name I really liked this for the first 30 days or so, but then it stopped working halfway through the bottle. Like I noticed no more of that brightening effect.\n\nContains other fun ingredients like licorice extract, green tea extract, arbutin and many more. Really would like it if it just didn't stop working. Also marketed for wrinkle care but I can't say how effective that is. I also found out through their youtube that the vit c concentration in this is low enough to use with chemical exfoliants which can be good for people who want to mix actives, but not so much if you want that vitamin c to really shine.\n\nThe toner seemed fine to me at first. Trying out the trial version it didn't stand out to me and I mostly bought it together with the serum because there was a bundle promotion. I would always notice some redness redness after wearing this but it never caused really bad irritation or breakouts. I've only figured out recently that it might be because this contains fragrance (serum dosen't, this explains why the toner has a much more pleasant yuzu smell). Its also not good for layering since it leaves a sticky residue. I found a cotton pad worked better for this. I've since stopped using it. It didn't really do much in the brightening department. \n\nThe gel cream was the type that turns really watery when you rub it in and offered almost no hydration even when I used a lot. The sleeping mask was okay, still lacking in hydration and lost by far to the innisfree sleeping mask in terms of brightening.\n\nFinal:\n\nOut of all of these I'd probably repurchase melano again since I mostly miss it as a light hydrating oil. The others probably aren't for me. I don't think I'll be purchasing cream type products again as they haven't worked so far in lightening hyperpigmentation. The yttp cream can stay in my routine though. Personally vitamin c is good for overall brightening but it dosen't significantly improve hyperpigmentation for me.\n\nFor fast results I'd go for the innisfree but then again this will probably only work if you got tanned or sunburned since it lightens everyting. It also has a blend of different brightening ingredients, so it might not just be because of vit c.\n\nYuja niacin is pretty good for a daily morning serum if you don't have much hyperpigmentation. I really like the light texture when I want to layer more stuff. Then again its really not a \"miracle\" product. Next I might try the klairs vitamin serum, but its not a priority. There are other things I want to try more.",

Cetaphil is available in two sizes- 30gm for Rs 185 and and 100 gm for Rs 435 (often available at some off at Nykaa). Re'equil one is available in only one size, 100gm for Rs 350.\n* *Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:* DAM- HG/WRP, RE'EQUIL: WNRP.\n\n**Experience:** \n\nHello all\n\nUsually I use lighter moisturiser but winters had me looking for an apt moituriser for my skin, since it gets dry and skin tends to become flaky. I was earlier using Simple Light moisturiser and Disguise Cosmetic's Sorbet, but both of these were proving insufficient for winters, hence decided to try DAM and Re'equil.\n\nAs you can see both of them have beautiful ingredients, though Re'equil one has fragrance (it is the last ingredient, the smell is mild and nice) while DAM is fragrance free.\n\nFor my skin type, I require a small amount of both of these  moisturisers. Though Re'equil is heavier- it is a cream albeit not a thick one, while DAM is lighter comparatively and has lotion like consistency.\n\nI started with using DAM during the morning routine. Needless to say, my skin did not feel dry at all. There was no need for reapplication either. It also did not react with my skin. So overall, I am very satisfied with this. Might this be love? Probably.\n\nRe'equil one I used in my PM routine. Now this moisturiser and I go long back because back in June, I got this for my younger sibling, who has a dry-dehydrated skin which is also prone to blackheads, whiteheads and acne. I wanted her to start looking after her skin a bit so I got her a bunch of products, one of which was this. It suited her nicely, though it is another matter altogether that she was never consistent with her routine. I guess skincare enlightenment has to occur on its own to a person for one to really get invested in it. Sigh. \n\nI also would use it occasionally then, and it did feel a little heavy on my combination skin so I decided to use it during winters. Cut to November, I started applying it in my nighttime routine. However after a couple of days, I could see some acne on my forehead. It probably clogged my pores. I stopped using it for some time, and the acne receded (my skin is not acne prone). I thought I should give it a try again, and once more I could see tiny acne on my forehead. I have since then decided to cut it off my routine. It is a great moisturiser, very nourishing. As mentioned, it works for my sister, but unfortunately it is not for me. \n\nRe'equil's finish is more matte, and it can be seen and felt immediately while DAM can feel slightly greasy on immediate application but sinks in fast and also provides a nice, smooth finish.\n\n**Conclusion**: So for the past one week, I have been using DAM in my AM as well as PM routine and I am more than satisfied. I think DAM is going to be my HG for winters atleast. Not sure how it is going to fare in summers, that remains to be seen. Hope this is helpful for folks looking for winter moisturisers. :)",

    "body": "Hello! Reviewing some sunscreen/makeup removers today.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o825xixzx6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=686f4f5f086654b57e35cd8906675ccf223ed22a\n\n**My skin type:** Sensitive, very dry (Actives: tretinoin microsphere 0.04%, AHA/BHA peel)\n\n**I Wear:** Heavy-duty, waterproof sunscreen on the daily, on makeup days - heavy-duty waterproof makeup, especially waterproof eye makeup that is difficult to remove. I have hooded lids (full Korean).\n\n**Fragrance is not a deal-breaker for me in wash-off products, although I am wearier of essential oils than I am of synthetic fragrance. Will be bolding main fragrance ingredients.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kzfesai0y6251.jpg?width=425&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df6aa8bee3c981d106a4ee4e3d071a26002ea80a\n\n**Cost:** 8 oz - $24 (Ulta)\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Coco-Glucoside, Coconut Alcohol, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Glycerin, Carbomer, Isopropyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Citric Acid, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, **Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil,** Propylparaben, Triethanolamine, **Amyris Balsamifera (Amyris) Bark Oil, Bulnesia Sarmientoi Wood (Vera Wood) Oil, Cymbopogon Martini (Palmarosa) Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens (Sweet Scented Geranium) Flower Oil, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Oil, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil, Mimosa Tenuiflora Bark Extract, Ormenis Multicaulis (Wild Moroccon Chamomile) Oil, Piper Nigrum (Pepper) Fruit Oil, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Oil,** Fd&C Yellow No. 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n**Texture:** A pale yellow, milky, lightly foaming cleanser of medium thickness.\n\n**Efficacy:** Acceptable as a one-step travel cleanser. Pretty good at removing sunscreen and makeup if you take the time to massage it in. Felt like a godsend before being completely spoiled by AB first cleansers. That was when I thought a little bit of waterproof mascara being left over giving me slight raccoon eyes when I woke up in the morning was \"acceptable\" and \"as good as it's gonna get\".\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** No. Has gentle surfactants but **it also has TWELVE different essential oils.** One of which is endangered and need active conservation according to Wikipedia, which I personally don't feel comfortable using:\n\n>*Bulnesia sarmientoi* was listed as [endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species) in the 2018 publication of the [IUCN Red List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List), due to the [deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation) of [Gran Chaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Chaco#Conservation_issues) and a strong global demand for its wood, extracts, and [essential oils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil) since 2001.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulnesia_sarmientoi#cite_note-IUCN-1) IUCN estimates indicate that over three generations the global population will decline by around 50%.\n\nRequires much more massaging to remove waterproof makeup which may be harsh on sensitive skin and cause more redness.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy. Not too strong.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No, it's a 2-in-1. However, it does not always get rid of everything on the first try, so another cleanse may be necessary.\n\n**Repurchase?** No. It did not bother my sensitive skin too much, but I'm cutting out all essential oils from my skincare + not effective enough as a first cleanser.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Naive Botanical Olive Cleansing Oil 230mL / 7.8 oz\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ovky561y6251.png?width=207&format=png&auto=webp&s=fecf9195af66872bce90dabfe904de2a500678a5\n\nI found out about this [here, ranked #4](https://my-best.net/15468). I wanted something with the highest cleansing power that washed off cleanly & is affordable.\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $14 on eBay before pandemic started. A little less than $7 in Japan. Even at double the price for me in the US, I have had this since **July 2019** (June 2020 now) and I am only *halfway through* it because of how incredibly effective it is with small amounts. I would run out of other cleansing oils relatively fast because of how much it takes to remove all my layers of waterproof makeup. Am shocked tbh.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, ethylhexyl palmitate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, glyceryl tri (caprylic acid / capric acid), PEG-8 glyceryl isostearate, sorbeth tetraisostearate-30, olive leaf extract, olive fruit oil, squalane, BG Water, cyclohexane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid bisethoxy diglycol, **perfume.**\n\n**Texture:** A cleansing oil of medium thickness, not overly greasy. Smooth, spreads very easily. Not super thin like something like Kose Softymo Speedy.\n\n**Efficacy:** Not drying at all on my very dry skin. SUPER effective at removing waterproof sunscreen and makeup. Takes absolutely NO TIME AT ALL, which is very different from other cleansing oils that required me to massage it in for a while. Color me beyond impressed. This is honestly the best first cleanser I've used so far. ZERO residue of any trace of makeup after removal.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes and no. It did not bother me personally but it does contain fragrance. I'm unsure if the current ingredient list is accurate as the Japanese ranking site states it contains essential oils but the list from Yesstyle does not.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy, woodsy. Not so strong that it is super bothersome.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Absolutely. As soon as it becomes affordable again when the pandemic dies down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Moistage W Cold Cream 270g / 9.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tcxvpzp1y6251.jpg?width=249&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0996cc355ecab1a721c0c6316ef76089e89c8b6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q416df74y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd8cd5a3d8cf58c3c0822eb9da142611c5826bc\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $16 on eBay. Currently about $19 on [Yesstyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/kracie-moistage-w-cold-cream-270g/info.html/pid.1069419619). Very cost-effective bc of its huge size.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, water, polysorbate 65, microcrystalline wax, glycerin, DPG, glyceryl stearate, dimethicone, stearoyl glutamate Na, stearic acid, polysorbate 80, beeswax, xanthan gum, olive oil, squalane, hydrogenated castor oil hydroxystearate, silk extract , Ethanol, hydrolyzed collagen, cetearyl alcohol, EDTA2Na, methyl paraben, ethyl paraben\\*\\*, perfume.\\*\\*\n\n**Texture:** A rich, thick white cream.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a huge NO from me, dawg. This is terrible. It barely removes anything waterproof and leaves a heavy residue. However, if you're the type of person who doesn't mind using a more stripping cleanser afterward to wash this off, or using a washcloth, I guess I can see it as being, um. Acceptable?\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** It is gentle but slightly fragranced. No reaction from my skin other than disgust at being left in a thick film after wash off.\n\n**Scent:** Very light floral.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** YES.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter 76g / 2.7 Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/znms9m83y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45f6d28d2958c8133b26a2ab363b88bcf71d065e\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $13.65 on Amazon. Currently [$14.85 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F165210/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea  (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, **Parfum, Aqua, Linalool, Limonene,** Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Citric Acid.\n\n**Texture:** A thick, opaque white balm, not overly greasy or waxy.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a good first cleanser. Quite travel friendly but I have not traveled with it in weather that would melt it so I don't know if it would leak through. It removes everything quite well, no complaints here. It still is not as good as the Kracie botanical olive one, takes longer to break down sunscreen and makeup, and may leave behind a slight amount of waterproof mascara if you aren't thorough enough with massaging/letting it sit on the skin long enough to melt everything.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Has not bothered mine, but fragrance is pretty strong. \n\n**Scent:** Strong floral. Although not strong enough to CHOKE on like some Korean products - those of intimate with Korean skincare - you know what I'm talking about. /sideyes my mom's side of the skincare in the bathroom\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** No, I don't like the scent and the packaging. It's hard to close properly on first try. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# (Not A First Cleanser But) [Equate Eye Makeup Remover](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Beauty-Oil-Free-Eye-Makeup-Remover-5-5-oz/39139097) 5.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfnqtmh5y6251.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05638b521fa8a76a4fe2673625e2b750241a492f\n\n**Cost:** $4 \n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Chloride, Dipropylene Glycol, Poloxamer 182, Allantion, Tetrasodium Edta, Benzalkonium Chloride, Glycerin, Cucumber (Cucumis Sativus), Fruit Extract, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium Phosphate. \n\n**Texture:** You gotta shake it before use. Watery but has silicone slip and thickness. \n\n**Efficacy:** I've used this as a first cleanser with a cotton pad in a pinch on extra lazy nights. It pretty works well to remove things pretty well although it WILL leave a residue obviously that you have to wash off. Honestly can't really tell the difference between this and the Neutrogena one and it's cheaper so. I use it to remove eyelash glue and waterproof mascara that I put on them. \n\nIt doesn't magically whisk away a mess of water-resistant lash glue residue + waterproof mascara on top of THAT (i don't really think anything can) but it's adequate, cheap, fragrance-free, oil-free and prolongs the wear on my beloved Miche Bloomin falsies (Girly Flair is the most popular bc of Pony Makeup but that style is horrible for me - it's SUPER fragile and breaks so easily compared to the other styles) by 10x. \n\nI just pour some in my palm and poke the lashes in a little puddle of it for a bit till the mascara comes off and then remove the glue with my fingers afterward. I don't wash them off afterward and whatever residue it leaves behind does not interfere at all with the next coat of mascara I put on them lashes.\n\n(Gonna write a separate review, but FYI - I prefer [DUO quick drying lash glue](https://www.ulta.com/duo-quick-set-lash-adhesive-clear?productId=pimprod2003529) in the purple label more than the super famous Japanese [D-Up Eyelash Fix](https://www.amazon.co.jp/D-UP-%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A2%E3%83%83%E3%83%97-4946324013622-D-U-P-%E3%82%A2%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC/dp/B0012VQTO2/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=d-up&qid=1590969259&sr=8-5) that's touted as #1 globally. I find that it's SOOO much quicker drying than D-Up and makes the lashes stick BETTER, longer, and stands stronger to tears. Plus it's latex-free too, for sensitive eyes. And way cheaper! I regret getting extra back ups of the D-Up thinking it'll be the best thing ever. There are still some cons that D-Up has an upperhand on, but I'll talk about that in that review post.)\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell yeah. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMini-Review on the **Garnier Skin Active Micellar Cleansing Water (Pink Cap):** This was just a sample so I ran out of it pretty fast but I remember being surprised that it actually was pretty effective at removing waterproof makeup. Scent-free, I quite liked it I think. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water, For Waterproof Makeup (Blue Cap), 13.5 Fl Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4fb7kb6y6251.jpg?width=556&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b56036478b358bd5043af8f80652b63a71cb7f9f\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $6.59 on Amazon. \n\n**Ingredients:** AQUA/WATER, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, ISOHEXADECANE, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DECYL GLUCOSIDE, POLYAMINOPROPYL BIGUANIDE. F.I.L.# D178190/1 \n\n**Texture:** Watery, greasy. I hate this. I got it mainly to remove waterproof sunscreen from my neck and chest at the end of the day without taking a whole damn shower. Leave a very unpleasant, greasy residue that I cannot stand on my skin. No. \n\n**Efficacy:** I only tried removing my makeup with this several times and it was okay I think. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Definitely. \n\n**Repurchase?** No. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Sensibio H2O 500 ml / 16.7 fl oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3q1ucyc8y6251.jpg?width=443&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ffe3ed17780adf84d930a94d27ae29416decdc52\n\n**Cost:** $15 on Amazon.com\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (aqua), Peg-6 Caprylic/capric Glycerides, Cucumis Sativus (cucumber) Fruit Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Propylene Glycol, Disodium Edta, Cetrimonium Bromide. \n\n**Texture:** Watery, very light! Refreshing. Doesn't leave a greasy gross residue like above. I still splash water on top of the skin before toweling off and I still can feel a slight film. Ideally, I would like to wash it all off bc Lab Muffin says it's still not the best to leave surfactants on the skin, but most nights I can't be bothered and it shouldn't be *that* bad if people in places with harsh water just leave it on the skin, right? \n\nI guess a way to deal with that would be to wipe away using a toner/water/spray with a cotton pad or something but idk, that's more unnecessary garbage I feel. And more rubbing sensitive skin. \n\n**Efficacy:** This is fairly new. Got it for the same reason as the Garnier blue cap. It removes my waterproof sunscreen from my neck just fine with a baby wipe or cotton pad. But for everyday, I much prefer a cleansing oil to reduce the amount of tugging and rubbing on my skin as well as disposable wipes or pads. I tried it for removing waterproof mascara from my falsies like the Equate one, but it was okay, similar, but not as good and not as \"conditioning\" on my falsies to keep them soft. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** For me, yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** Yes! \n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext on my Wish List!!:\n\n\\- Muji Sensitive Cleansing Oil 400 ml\n\n\\- Muji Mild Cleansing Oil 400 ml \n\n\\- Muji Mild Milky Cleansing 200 ml \n\n\\- More cleansing gels (first cleansers NOT second cleansers) (I've tried Kikumasamune one before and I really liked that one for heavy, non-waterproof makeup days! Also Innisfree Jeju Bija cleansing gel - but this dried my skin out a bit when used as a LONE first cleanser but for some odd reason was fine when followed up with an actual second cleanser! So strange. That was years ago tho. Much earlier than Kiku.)\n\n\\- DHC Deep Cleansing Oil\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------\n\nHope that helps! \n\n(Ugh I have so many review posts and other posts I wanna write and I can't get them off my mind but I gotta wait for the big sunscreen & ceramide/pseudo-ceramide/urea creams review posts bc I'm so damn extra and gotta wait til I can take more Before & After photos months apart and compare winter vs summer performances. /eyeroll \n\nBUT I WANNA TALK ABOUT MORE SKINCARE RIGHT NOOOWWW SDKFJSD32kfd#@! But don't want to make claims or claim favs without *absolute* thorough testing either.. Sigh, the struggle!!!)",

First of all, there is so much sodium in it that it will actually over-cleanse your hair and leave it very dry — something I don’t recommend for anyone with textured hair or normal/dry skin conditions. If you have colored hair (highlights, single process, etc) DO NOT USE THIS. All the money you paid your stylist will go down the drain, as shampoos like this have pH levels way beyond the natural pH of our hair and skin, which can cause more harm than good.

    "body": "I think I've found my new favourite skincare product. It's the inkey list succinic acid treatment. It's so good and gentle. I used 2% sa from Paula's choice as a spot treatment before, and it's really good but it dried out my skin so much, this just works. I've even used this three times a day and it doesn't dry out my skin. This brings the pimple to a head so soon. I've been using this since Jan 27th and i placed the order on the cultbeauty website on 6th jan. I've gotten a lot of opportunity to use this as i get frequent hormonal acne. My skin is very sensitive, and this doesn't irritate my face at all. It's fragrance free. The price of this product is 591.18 rupees on cultbeauty and you get 15 ml of the product, which is very decent for a spot treatment. The texture is veryyy lightweight and it doesn't pill under sunscreens and absorbs very quickly. It is non greasy. The active ingredients are 1% salicylic acid and 2% sulphur and the hyaluronic acid (edit: and squalane) in it makes it non-drying i suppose. Btw don't worry, it does smell a little sulphury but it's not overpowering or noticeable. It's green out of the tube but doesn't leave a tint of any sort, it's invisible. I thought the green color was to help color correct any redness from acne, but it doesn't do that too.\n\nMy skin type: normal (sort of dry in the beginning of feb due to winters), acne prone and sensitive\n\nClimatic conditions: moderately humid (30% today)\nMy age: 18.5\n\nFull ingredients list: Water (Aqua/Eau), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Colloidal Sulfur, Glycerin, Succinic Acid, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Salicylic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Squalane, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Polysorbate 60, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dehydroacetic Acid, Malachite Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, CI 75810 (Chlorophyllin-Copper Complex).\n\nI use this after cleansing my face and before my moisturizer. I've used this on consecutive days too and no purging or irritation has occured. But please do patch test because everyone's skin is different. \n\nThis is definitely one of my favourite products ever and I'll definitely repurchase it and call it my holy grail product. I'd highly recommend it too.\n\nI think I've mentioned everything needed for a review but please mention anything that i have forgotten and feel free to ask any questions about this product.",

I haven't found any affordable Indian products with sulfur, and I'm always curious about it. \n\nIt's great that they've balanced the usual issues of dryness and stuff within the treatment.. Like, the malachite extract that makes it green is apparently a mineral that has soothing effects, and as you said, the added hyaluronic acid (Edit: and squalane!). Non-drying spot treatments FTW! \n\nI'm going to stick to my occasional zinc oxide + honey water spot treatments, since tretinoin has handled my regular acne, but I think this product is really cool!",

    "body": "I was on the search for the perfect fragrance free oil/balm cleanser for quite some time. I love to do double cleanse to make sure I remove all the sunscreen and makeup at the end of the day. Over the years, I have tried quite a few of first cleansers/cleansing balms so I thought I would do a quick review here for anyone who is interested. My standards when it comes to a good cleansing balm/oil: fragrance-free, effective, but gentle on the skin, doesn’t over-dry the skin and doesn’t sting my eyes. My skin is sensitive and acne-prone.\n\nAll the products I buy and review here completely fragrance free, contain no masking fragrance, no “natural” fragrances or essential oils, no photo-sensitizing, potentially irritating plant oil/extracts (lavender, eucalyptus, citrus). So here we go:\n\n**Versed Gentle Cycle Hydrating Milky Cleanser:**  **•**\n\n**Ingredients**: Water/Aqua/EauOlea Europaea (Olive) Fruit OilHelianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed OilPropanediolVitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed OilGlycerinCaprylic/Capric TriglycerideMusa Sapientum (Banana) ExtractMagnesium Aluminum SilicateLactobacillus Ferment LysateSclerocarya Birrea (Marula) Seed OilAvena Sativa (Oat) Kernel ExtractRubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit ExtractLeuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment FiltrateTocopherolCitric AcidSodium Lauroyl SarcosinateXanthan GumEthylhexylglycerinSodium BenzoatePotassium SorbateSodium Hydroxide\n\n**My thought:** This product has a milky texture that is easy to use, effective and also gentle on the skin and doesn’t sting my eyes, but there are a few things to note: 1/ It doesn’t spread very far on the skin so you have to use quite a lot of product to cover the entire face so the bottle doesn’t last very long. 2/Even though the product is fragrance free, there’s a light banana scent due to the banana extract in the formula. So if you’re not fond of the banana smell, you might not like it.  Overall, it’s a great , gentle formula and one that I might repurchase.\n\n**Updated review (11/10/22): I recently repurchased this product again and noticed there are little grainy particles like sand in the product. I'm not sure what they did to the product but my sensitive skin can't tolerate scrubs or any physical exfoliant so I won't be using or repurchase this product again.**\n\n**Good Molecule Instant Cleansing Balm:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Polyethylene, PEG-8 Isostearate, 1,2-hexanediol, Butyrospermum Parkii (shea) Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Caprylic/capric Triglyceride, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Citric Acid.\n\n**My thought:** This product used to be only available in the scented version (loaded with potentially irritating essential oils), but due to customer demand, they decided to make a fragrance free version (thank you very much). I’m not sure if the scented version is still out there, so make sure you check the ingredients carefully before purchasing. This product come in a tub with a small spatula that you can use to scoop up the product. I do like this cleansing balm, I think it’s very effective and a little goes a long way. You don’t need to use much to cleanse the entire face. It’s also gentle enough to use around my eyes without any irritation. One con I can think of about this product is the smell. Even though it’s fragrance free, it has a chemical smell that is quite strong which I guess comes from one of the raw ingredients in the formula (though I’m not sure which one exactly). I think some people might find it unpleasant, but it’s still better than adding fragrance or essential oils.\n\n**The Ordinary Squalene Cleanser:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Squalane, Aqua (Water), Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Glycerin, Sucrose Stearate, Ethyl Macadamiate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Sucrose Laurate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Isoceteth-20, Sodium Polyacrylate, Tocopherol, Hydroxymethoxyphenyl Decanone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Malic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Chlorphenesin.\n\n**My thought:** This product has a cream texture that is quite thick coming out of the tube, and once it’s on the skin, it does require a lot of massaging, then the texture changes to oil as you work it in. Even though it’s gentle on the skin, I find it a lot less effective than other products on this list. This is not a product I would recommend for someone that wears a lot of makeup or doesn’t like to take a long time removing makeup at the end of the day. Even if you don’t wear a lot of makeup, I think there are better products out there. Personally, I wouldn’t repurchase it because: 1/It requires too much rubbing and effort to make it work. 2/I find it does irritate my eyes a little. 3/you have to use a lot of product to cleanse the entire face and the tube doesn’t last very long.\n\n**The Inkey List Oat Cleansing Balm:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Oil, Candelilla Cera (Cire de candelilla), Silica,Sorbitan Stearate, Tribehenin, PEG-60 Almond Glycerides, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Flour, Aqua (Water/Eau), Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Lecithin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Biosaccharide Gum-4, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil.\n\n**My thought:** This product comes in a tube, similar to the packaging of the ordinary squalene cleanser, but the texture is different. It comes out of the tube like petrolatum jelly. Because it’s quite thick, it doesn’t spread very far, so you have to use quite a lot of product to cleanse the entire face. It’s gentle on the skin and eyes, and leave my skin very soft afterward, but I think it will not work well for someone that wear a lot of makeup. I consider myself a minimal makeup wearer and this product couldn’t remove my eyeshadow completely. I also notice that the texture of the cleanser is not completely smooth, it’s slightly grainy due to the small pieces of oat which I do not like. I will not be repurchasing this product.\n\n**Jordan Samuel Skin The After Show Treatment Cleanser for Sensitive Skin:**\n\n**Ingredients**: Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Glycerin, Aqua/Water, Sucrose Laurate, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobiliss Flower Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Propanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**My thought:** This has to be the worse balm cleanser I have ever tried. It has a jelly-like texture coming out of the tube, and it goes on the skin just fine, but it just doesn’t cleanse off when I rinse my face with water. It barely remove makeup and leaves my face with a layer of residue that feels oily. I feel like I have to follow up with another cleanser right away or risk breaking out. I hate wasting product but I couldn’t make myself use this one so I threw it out after trying a few times. Sadly, I cannot recommend this product to anyone.\n\n**Hada Labo Gokujun Oil Cleanser:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Triethylhexanoin, Sorbeth-30 Tetraisostearate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olive Fruit Oil, Water, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate(Super Hyaluronic Acid), Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate (Skin-adsorbed Hyaluronic Acid), Jojoba Seed Oil, Ceresin, Dextrin Palmitate/Ethylhexanoate, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, BHT\n\n**My thought:** this product is a very popular Japanese cleansing oil, and for a good reason. It’s affordable, cleanses quickly and effectively, without leaving any residue behind. 2 pumps are what needed to cleanse my entire face. If you’re someone that wear a lot of makeup and need something that can remove make up fast and effortlessly, you will love this product. Some cons about this product: 1/ it can bother my eyes sometimes if I get it too close to the eyes. I thought i just throw this out there in case anyone has super sensitive eyes. 2/ It might be hard to get in in store. You have to order it online and it might take some time to arrive.\n\n**Isnt Tree Micellar Melting Cleansing Oil:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Sap , Opuntia Ficus-Indica Seed Oil , Camellia Sinensis Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Squalane\n\n**My thought:** This is a liquidy cleansing oil that comes in a pump bottle. It’s thin in texture and gentle, but effective. It’s also non irritating to the eyes, and rinses off well. Compare to the hada labo, it’s a thinner oil, and I have to use more product than Hada Labo to cleanse my entire face. I need 3 pumps for Isnt Tree as opposed to only 2 pumps for Hada Labo. If you are deciding between the 2, I would recommend Hada Labo. It’s just as effective if not more, the bottle lasts longer, and more cost effective as well.\n\n**Purito from Green Cleansing Oil:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Glyceryl Caprylate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Vegetable Oil, Tocopherol\n\n**My thought:** This oil cleanser come in a pump bottle similar to the ones from Hada Labo and Isnt Tree, but the texture is thicker than the other 2 brands. It’s effective, but gentle and doesn’t irritate my eyes. I need about 3 pumps to cleanse my entire face. Overall, it’s a good cleanser but I still prefer the Hada Labo because it’s cheaper, works just as well, and the bottle lasts longer.\n\n**Paula’s Choice Omega + Complex Cleansing Balm:**\n\n**Ingredients**: Ethylhexyl Palmitate (emollient solvent), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (skin-replenishing), PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate (emollient cleansing agent), Diisooctyl Succinate (emollient), Olive Oil PEG-7 Esters (emollient cleansing agent/emulsifier), Trihydroxystearin (texture enhancer), Glyceryl Stearate (emulsifier), Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil (non-fragrant antioxidant/skin-softening omega fatty acid), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (non-fragrant antioxidant/skin-softening omega fatty acid), Hydrogenated Rapeseed Oil (non-fragrant antioxidant/skin-softening omega fatty acid), Tocopheryl Acetate (vitamin E/antioxidant).\n\n**My thought:** This one has a balm like texture coming out of the tube and spread easily on the skin. There’s no residue left behind after cleansing. This product is gentle on my skin, doesn’t sting my eyes and is also effective. It has no discernible smell, which is nice since some fragrance-free products can still have an unpleasant smell due to the raw ingredients used in the formula.\n\n**Beauty of Joseon Radiance Cleansing Balm** \n\n**Ingredients:** Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-10 Isostearate, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Seed Water, Avena Sativa (Oat) Meal Extract, Coix Lacryma-Jobi Ma-yuen Seed Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Water, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Glycerin, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**My thought:** This is the most recent product that I've tried and is my current favorite. If I have to choose only 1 balm/oil cleanser to use, this would be the one. It replaces my previous favorite cleansing balm from Paula's Choice. The texture is smooth and gentle on the skin. It spreads more easily than Paula's Choice's and has no detectable scent. \n\n**Other plain oil options I’ve tried that work well:** When I run out of my balm cleanser and haven’t purchased a replacement in time. I usually use plain oils to remove my makeup. But because plain oils do not contain emulsifier, they don’t come off with water, so I have to immediately follow up with a water based cleanser to rinse off the oil residue on my face. Here are 2 oils that I like to use:\n\n**Coconut oil**: thicker oil, best for people with normal to dry skin\n\n**Jojoba Oil:** thinner in texture than coconut oil, best for oily and combo skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My Top 3:** \n\n**Beauty of Joseon Radiance Cleansing Balm** \n\n**Paula’s Choice Omega + Complex Cleansing Balm**\n\n**Hada Labo Gokujun Oil Cleanser**\n\nIf you have a favorite oil/balm cleansers that are not on this list, please share with me in the comment :)\n\n&#x200B;",

        "body": "This is so cool! I love seeing people as committed to zero fragrance/irritants as I am! I'm definitely going to keep these in mind for reccing balms in the future since I don't usually mess with those.\n\nFor context, I'm dry skin and sensitive + acne prone, plus have keratosis pilaris. A cleansing oil I would highly suggest to try out is\n\nKOSE SPEEDY cleansing oil. Here is the current ingredient list https://incidecoder.com/products/kose-speedy-cleansing-oil\n\n you'll see a lot of different listings since they reformulated a lot but this is the right one. \nIt is a very light, well emulsified oil that rinses cleanly and doesn't overstrip. Spreads very well. Doesn't leave a residue. It is even good as a solo cleanse! This is my default recc for any skin type or with any condition. I have people with rosacea, eczema, and ichthyosis using it so I'm very confident in its gentleness. In the US, there's 1pack 7.8oz for $13 or 2pack with 1 full and 1 refill for $20 on Amazon. Some have mentioned being able to find it at Daiso stores in US and other countries. \n\nSo this second one I've only used for a week but I begrudgingly have been pretty into it as I'm more on the dry side. It's the Neutrogena lightweight body oil fragrance-free https://www.neutrogena.com/products/skincare/body-oil-fragrance-free/6861830.html\n\nIt's a very low-viscosity watery-freling oil and it has good spreadability. Works really well at getting into pore for that deep but gentle clean you want from oils. It's probably the gentlest one I've tried even more so than my DIY sunflower/grapeseed + Polysorbate 80 I've made. The \"problem\" is that the Neutrogena oil does not rinse well at all. However I think it might good alternative for people who have tried other oil cleanser and found the emulsifiers just made it too much for their skin but don't want to use a pure oil. It does mostly come off with the gentle second cleanse. It will leave a bit behind in your skin, but as someone dry I quite appreciate that slight buffer for the cleanser and it hasn't caused any issues or broken me out. My skin does actually feel quite a bit more comfortable and less dry since introducing this when this was the only change. It does feel decently nourishing without being overwhelming. It definitrly lives up to its claims if used this way. Normal price is $13 for 8.5oz but can be found for $9-10 on sale sometimes. I'm still not sure how I feel about it but my skin has already decided it likes this, so... 😒\n\nAs my gentle water-based cleanser, my current favorite is the Pipette baby wash and shampoo fragrance-free https://www.target.com/p/pipette-baby-shampoo-wash-fragrance-free-11-8-fl-oz/-/A-79503241. I get a lot of funny looks when I recc this but it's genuinely the best thing I've found that is on par in gentleness with some of the better non-foaming cleansers like the Aveeno calm and restore oat cleanser and is more affordable. It has amazing spreadability and you don't need a lot. I have gone through 4 bottles and am about to repurchase because I'm too hooked and it's insanely cost effective compared to most facial cleansers. Normal price is $8 for 12oz, it's commonly on sale for $6.50ish and one time I caught it for $4 so I stocked up hard. But I'd be happy paying $8. I also use it for body and hair so 😳 I felt it was worth mentioning since it's the second cleanse I follow with.\n\nI'm definitely gonna be taking a look at more of your content now as well!

    "body": "I bought the Vaseline Body Ice Cream after coming across it on this website [https://cosmeticsarenas.com/vaseline-body-ice-cream-review/](https://cosmeticsarenas.com/vaseline-body-ice-cream-review/), and discussing with a couple of people here.\n\n**Review Type:** First impressions\n\n**Price:** 225 for 165 gms\n\n**Availability in India:** Easily available on Nykaa and probably other offline/online stores as well. I bought it off Nykaa\n\n**Skin info:** Combination. Sometimes, it is combination-dry, sometimes combination-oily, sometimes normal. When it is oily-dry, it is oily around the nose and cheeks but the tip of my nose and chin will be dry. Its weird and really depends on my water consumption. It has been looking dull and dehydrated this past month.**Climate:** Humid, Hot, Rainy (currently)\n\n**Ingredients list:**  Water, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol,                             Styrene/​Acrylates Copolymer, Coco–Glucoside, Poloxamer 407, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methyl Paraben, Menthol, Disodium EDTA,                          Petrolatum, Allantoin, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hyaluronate,                            Perfume, Benzyl Alcohol, Citronellol, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool, CI 42090\n\n**Packaging:** Just like the photo. Comes in a plastic tub. You have to dip your finger in it to pick up the product.\n\n**Texture:** Looks like a light custard in the tub (it jiggles) but spreads like a light gel. It is described as a gel creme on the packaging and the description fits.\n\n**Usage:** Been using it two-three times a day since the 28th of September. In the morning, I spread a light layer on my damp skin after washing my face with Neutrogena Extra Gentle Face Wash. If I am reapplying during the day, I just clean my face with water and apply it on damp skin. At nights, I repeat the morning routine and spread a light layer on my damp skin after washing my face.   \nOn October 1, I had to go out and applied Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Sun Screen over it. On October 3rd morning, I applied Biotique Bio-Dandelion Serum after washing my face and then applied this gel on top. On October 3rd night, I mixed a drop of glycerine with the vaseline gel and applied on my damp skin after cleansing.   \nI have also increased my water intake so that is one thing that will contribute to my skin looking better. I am doing nothing else in my routine so far.\n\n**Opinion:** I love it (so far). It spreads smoothly across the skin and sinks into my skin easily.  At one point I felt that it absorbed too easily and perhaps I needed more on my skin but as soon as I splashed water on my face, I saw this light sheen blocking the water (probably because of the silicone). It feels a little cool when I apply it (because of the menthol) and tingles my eyes a wee bit (but doesn't hurt or make my eyes water. I actually like the tingling sensation on my skin). It keeps my skin feeling soft, smooth and moisturised for a long time. My skin felt a tad bit oily when I applied a thick layer though (however it could be because I sweat a lot that day). This combines well with both my Biotique serum (which is more like a light moisturiser than a serum) and glycerine. It does have a light fragrance (doesn't bother me at all) that seems to go away in a couple of minutes.\n\nI plan to add to this review and write about my whole basic routine at the end of the month. But my first impressions about this product are great. For those with dryer skin or living in dryer climates, you might need to apply a thicker layer of this to feel the benefits. I have never used the Ponds Gel that everyone loves. But looking at the ingredients list, this Vaseline Gel Creme could possibly be a substitute (I personally feel the ingredients are better but I am a beginner at this and could be wrong)\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions about this product.\n\n\nEdited to add:  I did notice a couple of tiiiiiny white heads around my chin and cheeks. And I seem to have a pimple forming near my nose. But I don't know if I can attribute it to the Vaseline gel. On 29th and 30th, I had to go to work and was wearing my mask for 5+ hours and its almost that time of the month. So I don't know if this product is clogging my pores and causing the one pimple and three whiteheads. I don't have a \"break out\" so can't say yet. Will be able to give a more informed opinion when I give a full review.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sc2z56tdu0r51.png?width=322&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c42ec854fa29737c2bfeff62a44ddd5bc341294",

    "body": "[The Tobacco Throwdown Round 7 - Maurer & Wirtz Tabac Original](http://imgur.com/gallery/0i4MyQ5)\n\n\n* **Brush:** Turn N Shave Barberpole\n\n* **Razor:** Charcoal Tech\n\n* **Blade:** Gilette Silver Blue\n\n* **Lather:** Tabac Orignal\n\n* **Post:** Stirling Shave Balm Unscented\n\nWhen my interest in tobacco scented soaps began I started to hear rumblings from the corners of the internet about a legendary tobacco scent of yore. A soap that would seperate boys from men, and a must try for anyone claiming to love tobacco scents. I am of course referring to the OG tobacco shaving soap out of Germany, the infamous *Tabac Original*.\n\n\nFounded in 1845 in Stolberg Germany Maurer & Wirtz soapworks is certainly the lingest running company that will be featured in the tobacco throwdown. 114 years later in 1959 Maurer & Wirtz began producing *Tabac Orignal* shaving soap. The soap has become a staple in the wetshving community known for its good performance and divisive fragrance.\n\nTabac Original comes standard in a heavy ceramic bowl with a wooden lid, branded with the retro and clean Tabac logo. It is  nice solid presentation, but nothing fancy. Tabac is also available in refill pucks which is what I have obtained for this review.  \n\nTabac is an old fashioned barbershopish scent with lots of florals and musks.  Unlike the rest of the soaps I have reviewed in this series Tabac is based on the scent of the Tobacco Flower as opposed to a cured tobacco leaf. Really this is comparing apples to oranges, but I did not feel that this reveiw series would be complete if Tabac were excluded.\n\nThe scent notes listed for Tabac Orignal are :  \n\n*Pepper, Petitgrain, Citrus & Neroli.*\n\n*Lavander, Camomie, Geranium & Oak Moss.*\n\n*Carnation. Sandalwood, Vetiver, Moschus(musks) & Ambergris*\n\nTobacco is conspicuously absent from the list but I did find it listed some places and exlcuded others. I ended up using the listed scent from the Tabac website.\n\nTabac is a smooth, leathery and powdery scent. I get bits of pepper and the underlying astringency of citrus that leads into a soapy air of lavender, but a light one that does not sparkle as much in Tabac as in many other scents.  The lavender leads into a strong heart of vetiver supported by sandalwood and musks with just a touch of distinctive ambergris to close things out. There are no distinct tobacco scents, but I can see Echoes of other tobacco flower fragrances I have used. I did not obtain the Tabac aftershave or Edt for this review and I have read conflicting reports as to whether or not those products maintain the same scent profile.\n\nWhile Tabac was introduced in 1959 its scent feels like it belongs more in the period of Mauer & Wirtz's founding, the mid 1800s. This is an extremely old fashioned and masculine fragrance. If the Full Measure of Man is a scent that makes me feel old and distingued, Tabac just makes me feel old and dessicated. It's a soapy scent that manages to not quite feel clean. I think a lot of that comes from the musks which just do not agree with my sensibilities.\n\nI am sure that this is a controversial take. After all several people here on reddit recommended this soap to me. But Tabac just does not connect for me.\n\nWhile I am not a fan of the scent of Tabac performance is definitely where this soap shines. Tabac is another hard puck soap like Pre de Provence No. 63, but Tabac has much better performance. The listed ingredients for Tabac Orignal are: *Potassium Stearate, Sodium Stearate, Potassium Tallowate, Potassium Cocoate, Aqua, Sodium Tallowate, Parfum, Sodium Cocoate, Glycerin, Potassium Hydroxide, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Sodium Hydroxide, CI 77891, Limonene, Hydroxycitronellal, Linalool, Citronellol, Coumarin, AlphaIsomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, Geraniol, Cinnamyl Alcohol, Isoeugenol, Benzyl Alcohol, Citral, Eugenol*\n\nTabac being a hard-pucked soap should last basically forever. I find that scooping a small chunk and blooming it in my lather bowl provides the best results, and I would think blooming is even more important for those who choose to brush load.  Tabac quickly works up into a thick creamy lather with great slickeness and cushion and plenty of residual slickness to touch up any trouble areas with no  need to reapply lather. Post shave feel os solid but nothing too special. I do not know if this is the original formulation of the Tabac shaving soap, but if so I am thoroughly impressed. Tabac provides the best performance of a mass market shave soap that I have tried so far. I would rate this soap as similar to Chiseled Face and Oleo Canard bases for performance.  \n\n\nWhile the rugged and Original scent of Tabac may not be a crowd pleaser the solid and consistent performance of the soap itself should be. There is a reason Tabac is so oft lauded across shaving forums large and small: this is a solid soap that lead the curve i  performance long before the advent of the modern artisinal market.\n\nWhile Tabac is a must try for every Tobacco lover (if only to say they have tried it) and a good recommendation for fans of traditional barbershops it just cannot keep up with the stiff competition from the rest of the Throwdown. Overall Id rate Tabac as dead last, 8/8 of the soaps I have reviewed so far.  It is a dated scent and does not present itself with nearly the same refinement as TFMoM the other 'old-man' scent I have reviewed for this series. Tabac does brings neither sweetness or spice, either of the things I love so much in so many tobacco scents.\n\nAs of week 8 the standings for the Tobacco Throwdown are:\n\n* [#1.

Even with my softest gel-tipped badger, the stuff loads like a dream to produce a pasty proto-lather that is then ezpz to hydrate into the good slick stuff.  In contrast to DR Harris, Tabac has zero propensity to froth if loaded with a brush that's too wet.  I'm guessing that the high proportion of K-salts and the bias towards \"heavier\" fats (stearic and tallow over coconut oil) are the main reasons.\n\nAlso notable: Tabac is available in what is probably the most ergonomic shave stick in existence.  The diameter is large and it goes on really easy, the cover fits snug, and the push mechanism works.",

I have used all of them for more than a month, though for some, the use has not been very regular because of the lockdown. Kindly factor that in however you may want to.**The review is strictly based on my personal experience- so ymmv, will differ for different people. Please do take it with a pinch of salt.**\n\n**1. Neutrogena Ultra sheer dry touch sunblock SPF 50**\\- This is the sunscreen I have used the longest amount of time for. Very budget friendly. Provides adequate protection. However earlier when I was not aware of the three finger rule, I would use the same quantity as I would with a moisturiser- it suited me and gave me a matte finish. However, when I began using the required amount, it dried my skin. Every time.  I no longer use it now. The consistency is a like a cream but it blends okay.Also since it is a chemical sunscreen, I have not faced any white cast issue with this.\n\nIngredients-[Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Homosalate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/homosalate), [Benzophenone-3](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/benzophenone-3), [Ethylhexyl Salicylate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-salicylate), [Octocrylene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/octocrylene), [Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyl-methoxydibenzoylmethane), [Silica](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/silica), [Styrene/​Acrylates Copolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/styrene-acrylates-copolymer), [Potassium Cetyl Phosphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-cetyl-phosphate), [Beeswax](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cera-alba), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Dimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone), [Caprylyl Methicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylyl-methicone), [Cetyl Dimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-dimethicone), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Sodium Polyacrylate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-polyacrylate), [Behenyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behenyl-alcohol), [Xanthan Gum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/xanthan-gum), [Chlorphenesin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/chlorphenesin), [Acrylates/​C12-22 Alkyl Methacrylate Copolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-c12-22-alkyl-methacrylate-copolymer), [Dimethicone/​PEG-10/​15 Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone-peg-10-15-crosspolymer), [Ethylhexyl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-stearate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Disodium EDTA](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [BHT](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Chlorhexidine Digluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/chlorhexidine-digluconate), [Ethylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylparaben), [Trideceth-6](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/trideceth-6), [Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/diethylhexyl-2-6-naphthalate)\n\n**Price and Availability**\\- Rs 650 for 88ml. easily available on e commerce sites like Nykaa, Amazon etc.\n\n**2. Innisfree Daily Mild Sunscreen SPF 50 PA ++++-** I got this last year during lockdown because this is the only budget friendly Korean sunscreen I knew of then. Really light lotion like texture and sits well on the face without piling. Gives a semi-dewy finish. However felt a little greasy on my face during humid season. Did it protect me adequately? I actually do not know because I wore it outside only a few times. I did not tan but the exposure to sun was not a lot so cannot be sure. Has a nice fragrance but when has that protected us from…anything. It has atleast three sunscreen filters and percentage is mentioned. But I am not sure if they are sufficient? No white cast with this either. I enjoyed using it except for the greasiness (which is not much but can still be felt).\n\n**Ingredients**\\-Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate 3.5%, Ethylhexyl Triazone 3.0%, Methylpropanediol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine 2.5%, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, Cetearyl Alcohol, C20-22 Alcohols, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Behenyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Tromethamine, Fragrance, Carbomer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polyisobutene, Saccharide Hydrolysate, Fructooligosaccharides, Ethylhexylglycerin, Pullulan, Caprylyl/​Capryl Glucoside, Sorbitan Oleate, Tocopherol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, C14-22 Alcohols, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Cetearyl Glucoside, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract\n\n**Price and availability**\\- Rs 700 for 50ml. Usually on discount so can be bought for around Rs 500 too. Can be purchased from Nykaa, Boddess, Amazon etc.\n\n**3. The Blessing Tree Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++-** Currently my HG. I have worn it a lot. Provides adequate protection. Has a lotion like texture but is thicker than the Innisfree one. Provides a demi matte finish. Does not feel greasy to me. Has a weird smell but that’s okay. It does not bother me much. Since it is a hybrid sunscreen, it does give a tiny amount, almost negligible white cast which settles down fast too. **WRP.**\n\n**Ingredients-** Octyl Methoxycinnamate, Oxybenzone, Titanium Dioxide, Octocrylene, Avobenzone, Zinc Oxide Lotion\n\nInactive Ingredients: Aqua, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Diisopropyl Adipate, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Propanediol, Diethylhexyl Syringylidenemalonate, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Niacinamide, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Perfume\n\n**Price and Availability**\\- Rs 249 for 100ml on Amazon.\n\n**4. Lóreal Paris Aqua Essence UV Perfect Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++-**  Can't speak enough about its amazing consistency and texture. So light and absorbs easily. Haven’t had the opportunity to wear it often since I bought it this year. The first time I wore it, it stung my eyes. The next time it did not sting my eyes but felt greasy because the weather was humid. I dont think the sunscreen is to be blamed for that. It’s major con (and everyone knows that) is the quantity for the price it is sold. No white cast. Might think of repurchasing but not sure about it.\n\nIngredients- Aqua, Alcohol Denat, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Isopropyl Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Propylene Glycol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Styrene/​Acrylates Copolymer, Glycerin, Drometrizole Trisiloxane, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Tocophérol Acétate, Phenoxyethanol, Stearic Acid, Adenosine, PEG-8 Laurate, Palmitic Acid, Ammonium Polyacryldimethyltauramide/​Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Limonene, Linalool, Benzyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Acrylates C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Geraniol, Disodium EDTA, Ceteth-10, Potassium Hydroxide, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Parfum/​Fragrance (F.I.L. C161957/​2)\n\n**Price and Availability-** Rs 515 for 30ml. Usually available on a discounted price of 400 something on Nykaa.\n\nVerdict- I will continue purchasing The Blessing Tree sunscreen. This sub introduced me to this budget friendly option and I am so grateful! The other sunscreens mentioned here are also good, never broke me out (my skin is not sensitive so maybe that’s why) so it totally depends on what you are looking for. I am anticipating queries about Oxybenzone and Co ‘s safety- please do read up on it. They are safe. The only issue with older chemical sunscreen filters is their instability. The newer ones are more stable so I’d definitely explore some of the newer filters in the future. **Other than that- it is more important to wear sunscreen, even if it offers very basic protection than to not wear sunscreen at all.** I hope this review will be helpful! Please ask away anything you would like to in the comments. I will try my best to answer them. (I will also post this under the sunscreen thread).",

    "body": "Yay, a new perfume is available. And it's a Christmas one! But, when I heard that the All is full of love perfume was only going to be available in the Advent Calendar, I felt doubtful. It's so expensive! However, I'm happy to report: I am in love.\r\n\r\n**Description from Lush:**\r\n\r\n\"Where would we be without love? Envelop yourself in a warm embrace of romantic rose and the comforting touch of sandalwood.\"\r\n\r\n**Ingredients**\r\n\r\nIngredients\r\nOrganic Alcohol Denat., Perfume, Water (Aqua), Glycerine, Labdanum Resinoid, Rose Absolute, Sandalwood Oil, Tonka Absolute, Benzoin Resinoid, Benzyl Alcohol, *Benzyl Benzoate, *Benzyl Cinnamate, Benzyl Salicylate, *Cinnamal, *Citral, *Citronellol, Coumarin, *Eugenol, *Farnesol, Geraniol, *Isoeugenol, *Limonene, *Linalool\r\n\r\n**Scent**\r\n\r\nWhat stands out to me is sandalwood & tonka. Yoga Bomb comes to mind, although that is just one element of this complex fragrance. \r\n\r\nThere is a natural sweetness to it that reminds me a bit of how it smells at the garden centre. A very small touch of green freshness similar to Sakura. Slightly piney maybe? \r\n\r\nThe third note that I pick up is Rose Jam-like sweet floral, with a touch of citrus. However, it is in the background. So this is not a citrus-heavy scent, in my opinion. I'm grateful for that, because (even though I like citrus), there are enough options for that at Lush already.\r\n\r\nSo Yoga Bomb meets Sakura meets Rose Jam. (In my humble opinion)\r\n\r\n**Longevity**\r\n\r\nHappy to report it lasts all day on my skin & clothes. Nice change from what I've experienced with their fragrances lately (LOM body spray seems very weak?).\r\n\r\n**Final thoughts**\r\n\r\nSo. Does this perfume fit in with the Christmas theme? Yes... It's floral, green and woody at the same time. If you liked Shade, you'll probably like this too. I really hope they make this available to purchase separately from the Advent Calendar.\r\n\r\nBut if you were looking for a gourmand fragrance (baked goods, ginger, coffee, vanilla sweetness) for Christmas, it is not that. You might like Turmeric Latte or LTGTR better in that case.\r\n\r\nFor all Dutch redditors out here: this smells exactly like how it smells at the Coppelmans garden centre around Christmas time, when they have all the decorations out!",

But I would love to try it. I’m a huge Lush perfume lover and we haven’t gotten a lot of new perfumes in the last couple of years 😢 btw I do agree about the LOM body spray comment. Mine is weak and lasts only 30 minutes. A Sakura body spray I bought 3 weeks ago performs terribly as well, I’m exchanging it for a different one. The body sprays used to be much stronger.",

    "body": "Welcome all you brave souls to Tabacotober, a celebration of the most divisive soap in wetshaving history. Love it or [hate it](https://i.imgur.com/u6zRBs0.jpg), Tabac will always have it's own niche among the classics and the artisans. In recent years, Tabac made the seemingly inevitable shift to a tallow-free formula, following along the same path as many EU (and formerly EU) brands before it. What does that mean for you, the lowly wetshaver?\n\n\nWell, to paraphrase a great wetshaver (probably), \"if you want to make a good review about soap, you must first invent the soap,\" or something. This is far from the [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/wetshaving/comments/f2hr9y/_/fhcm5sx) time I've covered the topic, but in it’s simplest terms, **soap is a salt**. The chemical reaction of the saponification process takes a weak fatty acid and a strong base such as lye, and water. Through the magic of chemistry we now have potassium and/or sodium salts, aka soap.\n\n\nSo let's take a look at the star of the show this month, [Tabac](https://i.imgur.com/bFyzqzv.jpg).\n\n\nThe Ingredient | Why it's included\n:--|:--:\nPotassium Stearate | is the potassium salt of stearic acid used primarily as an emulsifying agent.\nSodium Stearate | is the sodium salt of stearic acid. A primary component of soap which does the soap things, like encapsulating dirt so it can be washed away.\nPotassium Laurate | Skin cleansing compound containing fatty acid potassium.\nSodium Laurate | a detergent. The sodium salt of lauric acid (see below)\nGlycerin | a humectant used to help prevent skin moisture loss. Remember, soap is a salt, and salts draw out water.\nAqua | dihydrogen monoxide. Dangerous stuff.\nParfum | made of various aldehydes, esters, terpines etc. These are covered individually below, thanks to EU guidelines we actually get to know the exact compounds used, unlike US artisans who keep the names of their Brambleberry bulk preblend oil purchases to themselves.\nLauric Acid | A fatty acid chain, one of the components of the actual soap.\nLimonene | a multipurpose hydrocarbon functions both as as cleaning assistant which helps other cleaning agents to penetrate the skin and as a citrusy scent. Probably moreso the latter in this case.\nLinalool | A terpine from many plants, likely supporting a lavender note for Tabac.\nHydroxycitronellal | A medium chain aldehyde, a scent component. Interestingly identified in the EU as a known potential skin irritant.\nCI 77891 | aka titanium dioxide, a common white pigment, it's probably in a majority of your products.\nIsoeugenol | A scent component. A main scent in citronella.\nPentasodium Pentetate | A salt, a chelating agent, inactivates metallic ions. It's a preservative.\nTetrasodium Etidronate | aka tatrasodium EDTA. A preservative. Potentially harmful to the skins barrier, however not well absorbed, requires formaldehyde and cyanide to create.\nCitronellol | A perfume ingredient, safe at appropriate levels. Also an insecticide (citronella).\nCoumarin | [LITERALLY RAT POISON](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/diesa1/what_fragrances_would_you_like_to_see_reviewed/f3w636s?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)\nBenzyl Alcohol | a solvent. Probably the base for the perfume. Don't drink this.\nAlpha-Isomethyl Ionone | A synthetic violet scent compound made from brewers yeast.\nGeraniol | A scent component, also an insecticide (citronella).\nBenzyl Salicylate | A fragrance additive, sweet and balsamic.\nCinnamyl Alcohol | A fragrance ester, sweet balsamic and hyacinth.\nCitral | A fragrance aldehyde, lemony.\nEugenol | aka clove oil. Do you need more of an explanation?\n\n\n\nThis seems like a decently sized ingredient list. This is mostly due to the EU regulations requiring individual scent components to be listed, instead of just “perfume” which we commonly see in Made In USA products. So let's take out the perfume ingredients, coloring agents, and preservatives. We are left with;\n\n* Potassium Stearate\n* Sodium Stearate\n* Potassium Laurate\n* Sodium Laurate\n* Glycerin\n* Aqua\n* Lauric Acid\n\n\nThis is it. This is the real backbone of Tabac. Seven ingredients in Tabac that give us actual soap. “But where’s the palm/coconut/castor/safflower/whatever-veggie oil?” Instead of listing the reactants, this list instead shows us the products of the saponification reaction. These products being the two stearates and two laurates. Since we have both sodium and potassiums versions, I understand this means this formula uses two lyes in the saponification process, which is more common among artisan soaps than mass production soaps. We also have glycerin and lauric acid which may either be byproducts of saponification, additives, or most likely, both. The glycerin and lauric acid likely help to soften the blow of the drying quality of the soaps.\n\n\nSo that’s it, breaking it down, Tabac is a bare-bones duel lye soap formula without *any* additional moisturizers, vitamins, lanolin, or any of the other “skin foods” we commonly associate with good quality, skin happy shaving software. Do we even need all these extra additives? Are we convincing ourselves into equating a basic soap formula as lesser/equal/better than an artisan formula? If Tabac gives you quality shaves, then why not another old classic [Mama Bear?](https://mamabearssoaps.com/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=1&zenid=vpgklr21aip9h31copu8p07b35).",

        "body": "A shorter breakdown of the ingredients, putting them into soapmaking context:\n\n**Potassium Stearate / Sodium Stearate / Potassium Laurate / Sodium Laurate / Lauric Acid / Aqua:**  \nThis is the soap part.  It's what results from mixing stearic acid and lauric acid with lye (sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide) dissolved in water.  The stearic part of the soap makes creamy lather that's mildly cleansing; the lauric part of the soap makes fast bubbly lather that's very cleansing and can be harsh at high concentrations.\n\n**Glycerin:**  \nIf you make soap from complete fats (triglycerides - molecules built from three fatty acids linked with a glycerin subcomponent), glycerin is a natural byproduct of the saponification process.  This recipe uses pure fatty acids rather than complete triglycerides and thus creates no glycerin on its own.  Hence they add glycerin as a separate ingredient, because *in the context of shave soap* glycerin helps the lather hold water and become gloopy and slick without just collapsing as soon as it gets outside a narrow range of acceptable hydration levels.  Soaps without enough glycerin are real dang hard to lather well.  (See: MWF.)\n\n**Pentasodium Pentetate / Tetrasodium Etidronate:**  \nChelating agents to make the soap easier to lather in hard water.\n\n**CI 77891:**  \nColor.\n\n**Everything Else:**  \nFragrance / specific aromachemicals present in the Fragrance recipe that require disclosure under EU laws.",

    "body": "# Storing Your Peptides\n\nStoring your peptides correctly whether they are reconstituted or not is pivotal in how they perform. A big difference is in the temperature of when they are reconstituted versus when they are still in lyophilized form.\n\nTypically, when in lyophilized form or reconstituted form the rule of thumb is to maintain a temperature between 36 and 46 degrees Fahrenheit. For those of you that use Celsius that would mean about 2 degrees to 8 degrees. In many cases, this would mean storing it in your freezer which is a perfectly viable option.\n\n## Peptide Reconstitution\n\nProper reconstitution and maintenance of your peptides are pivotal in how well they work for you. If not stored or reconstituted correctly, you risk damage to or degradation of your peptides. But why do you need to reconstitute your peptides in the first place?\n\nThese substances mainly come as a compound that has been lyophilized. This phrase basically means that they have been turned into a freeze-dried crystalline powder. In order to use your peptides, you’ll need to add fluid to them. This is where the phrase reconstitution is coined.\n\nHowever, you cannot add just any old fluid to your compound, and it cannot be done in a listless manner. Great care needs to be taken to ensure that your peptide is not damaged during this process.\n\n### How to Reconstitute Peptides\n\nFor starters, you’ll need the following supplies for proper peptide reconstitution:\n\n* An [Alcohol Wipe](https://paradigmpeptides.com/product/prep-pads-alcohol-pads/?ref=217)\n* A syringe\n* Your Lyophilized Peptide\n* Bacteriostatic Water or Sterile Water\n\nTo begin the peptide reconstitution process, you’ll want to wipe down the top of your vials as a safety precaution with the alcohol wipe. Then you’ll want to use your syringe and pull either your bacteriostatic or sterile water from that vial. Keep in mind you don’t want to touch the needle as this part of the syringe has been sterilized. Therefore, touching it would then cause contamination.  \nFor the sake of this example, we’ll say that you pull 1ml. Keep in mind, different doses need different amounts of liquid when reconstituting. This will be explained further in the dosing section of this article.  \nFrom here, you’ll want to inject your syringe directly into the lyophilized peptide vial. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT just shoot the water into the vial. This will damage the peptide and render it useless.\n\nRather than spraying your peptide, the goal here is to drip the liquid down the side of the vial. Doing so will begin the process of reconstitution without destroying your product. Once you inject either your bacteriostatic water solution or sterile water into your peptide vial, you can remove the syringe from the vial. Some individuals may say you need to lightly swirl the solution in the vial. However, 9 times out of 10 this is unnecessary and can do more harm than good. You’ll basically want to let it dissolve on its own.\n\n## Bacteriostatic Water Vs. Sterile Water\n\nDuring peptide reconstitution, two variations of solutions are popular. These two solutions are sterile water and bacteriostatic water. The choice is purely up to the user which solution to use. However, there are some differences between the two.\n\n### Differences Between Bacteriostatic Water vs. Sterile Water\n\nFor [bacteriostatic water](https://paradigmpeptides.com/product/bacteriostatic-water/?ref=217), for instance, it is not like the sterile water in that it can be [used several times](https://paradigmpeptides.com/product/bacteriostatic-water/?ref=217) within a 28-hour span. In fact, because of this reason, bacteriostatic water is fairly popular among scientists. It is considered a non-pyrogenic solution, meaning that it does not conduct heat or fever when introduced to the body. It contains roughly 0.9% benzyl alcohol. This variation of alcohol is an aromatic alcohol. In terms of chemistry, they are a compound that contains a hydroxyl group that is indirectly bonded to an aromatic compound. This gives it a pleasant smell. All of this basically comes down to is that the liquid is made in a way where bacteria cannot grow. That’s what makes it more user friendly since it can be used multiple times.\n\nAs for regular [sterile water](https://paradigmpeptides.com/product/hospira-sterile-water-20ml/?ref=217), it too has its own positives. It too is a nonpyrogenic liquid. However, unlike the bacteriostatic water, the sterile water can only be used once and once opened and used would need to be discarded. In many cases, when the body doesn’t particularly fair well with bacteriostatic water, this is a good substitute.\n\n## Peptide Dosages\n\nFor the purpose of explaining how exactly we get the correct dosage for each peptide, we’ll say we want to go with a treatment regimen of [PT 141](https://paradigmpeptides.com/product/pt-141-10mg/?ref=217) also know as [Bremelanotide](https://paradigmpeptides.com/product/pt-141-10mg/?ref=217). Now, for PT 141, the vials come as 10mg vials. As mentioned in this article, the proper dosage is 1.75mg per 8 doses a month. This means that we not only need to know how to properly reconstitute a peptide, we also need to know how much of the reconstituted peptide we need to pull into the syringe to administer.\n\nFor starters, one insulin syringe is exactly 1mL of fluid. The measurements on the side of the syringe go up by 10s with each tick mark in between being 2 units each. Now, I mentioned that the vials come as 10mg vials. Say you add 1mL of bacteriostatic water to this compound following the instructions above. You now have one mL of bacteriostatic water and 10mg of peptide combined to create your reconstituted peptide. Now what?\n\n### Conversions When Dosing Peptides\n\nWell, now we need to understand how much we need to pull into our syringe to get the correct dose each time we use the peptide. How do we do this? Well, there is a little understanding of the old school conversions that need to take place. To start, every 1mg converts to 1000mcg. This would mean that in 1.75mg there is 1750mcg. Now, looking at your syringe, every tick mark converts to being 200mcg. Therefore, in order to get the correct dose of PT 141, you would need to pull up to 9 tick marks of fluid into your vial. This translates into 1800mcg which in turn would mean 1.80mg.\n\nNo, this is not right on the money at 1.75mg but you are right there. Now, if you’d rather be safe and stay under, you’d only need to figure out the next closest dose which on the syringe would end up being 1600mcg or 1.60mg.  \nNow let’s say you want to do the opposite and up your dose to 2mg per dose. This would then convert to 2000mcg. Again, each tick mark is 200mcg so this would mean that you would need to pull in 10 tick marks. On the syringe, this coincides with the 20 units mark.\n\nLet’s say you end up putting 2mL of bacteriostatic water instead of the 1mL. This effectively makes each tick worth 100mcg. So now if you still want your 2mg of peptide, you’ll have to pull up to the twentieth tick mark which then coincides with the 40 units mark instead of the 20 unit mark.\n\nSo, in reality, it will depend on both the number of peptides you have in mg as well as the amount of bacteriostatic or sterile water you put in your peptide vial.\n\nSo now say we have a peptide that has 5mg of product in the vial and you reconstitute it with 1mL of bacteriostatic water. This ends up being the same as having 10mg of product and 2mL of bacteriostatic water. In that in order to get your 2mg dose, you’ll need to hit that 40 units tick mark because each tick is worth 100mcg.\n\nThis all of course means next to nothing if you’re either not knowledgeable or afraid to perform your own subcutaneous injection. This next section works to aid in your confidence and gives you the main guidelines on how to perform this type of injection correctly.\n\n## How To Properly Perform A Subcutaneous Injection\n\nBefore we begin, let’s answer this question: What is a subcutaneous injection? A subcutaneous injection is a shot that is given under the skin but doesn’t pierce the muscle. Typically, this method is used in the medical field as a way of giving small amounts of medications.\n\nThere are two ways to administer a subcutaneous injection. You can either inject your peptide at a complete 90-degree angle or at a 45-degree angle. How do you know which angle to use? It’s simple. When you pinch the skin in between your fingers and can grab 2 inches then a 90-degree angle is the viable option. However, if you can only grasp about an inch of skin the 45-degree angle is recommended.\n\n### Types of Needles Used for Subcutaneous Injections\n\n📷There are two variations of needles that are commonly used to administer subcutaneous injections. The first is an insulin syringe. This type of syringe holds 1mL of your compound and usually has markings from 10 to 100. That would mean if you’re supposed to take a 0.5mL dose you’d only fill the syringe to the 50 mark.  \nThe second most common syringe is the tuberculin syringe. It has a needle that is slightly longer than an insulin syringe and is marked every 0.1mL. It too holds 1mL of the compound.\n\n### The Subcutaneous Injection Process\n\nWhat You’ll Need for Injections:\n\n* A [Sterile Syringe](https://paradigmpeptides.com/product/insulin-syringe-31-gauge-5-16-in-1cc/?ref=217)\n* An Alcohol Wipe\n* Your Reconstituted Peptide\n* Disposable Gloves (optional)\n\nAfter deciding which syringe you’re comfortable with you to have to choose what location to administer the injection too. There are four common areas when deciding where to inject. These areas include the abdomen, the thigh, the lower back, or the upper arm. Again, keep in mind this is not like a flu shot. The goal is not to inject your peptide into the muscle. It is to simply inject into the area just under the skin.  \nOnce your injection site is decided upon, this would be the point in which you would apply your disposable gloves. If you decide not to use disposable gloves this is okay as well. Just keep in mind you’ll want to handle everything with freshly washed hands.\n\nStart by using your sterile wipe to wipe down the area you plan to inject your peptide into and let it air dry. For this example, we’ll say you’ve chosen your abdomen. Once your abdomen is dry, you can move onto the next step. Which is the preparation of your needle.\n\nThe most recommended way to prepare your needle is to take the syringe in your dominant hand, so your writing hand. You’ll then pull the cover off with the other hand. Once this is completed you’ll then pull the correct amount of peptide into your syringe from your vial.\n\nSomething to keep in mind is that if you are using insulin syringe size needles, it is virtually impossible to properly clean them. Because of this, a one-time use and disposal needle is recommended.  \nAfter you pull your desired amount of peptide into your vial, you’ll want to pinch the skin where you are injecting it in between your thumb and first finger. Again, if you are able to pull about two inches of skin up then a 90-degree angle of injection is okay. However, if you are only at about an inch then you’ll want to go with a 45-degree angle.\n\nAt this point, you’ll want to inject the needle completely into the skin avoiding muscle tissue. This is where you’ll push the plunger in which will then administer your choice of peptide into your abdomen. Once you completely empty the syringe you can pull the needle out. A good thing to keep in mind while injecting is to hold the syringe barrel relatively tight and to use your wrist to do most of the injecting.\n\n## Learn More About Peptides\n\nDiscover all there is to know about peptides and proper care for them.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Butterbeer, 2 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 15 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Undercooked sweet bakery dough and cream soda.  Kind of hard to describe, but almost like a much less intense version of FA Joy or a butter rum mix minus the actual rum. Warm, soft dough taste with a slightly liquid texture.  Tastes like there is a bit of yeast-risen vibe to it. Sweetness is pretty non-descript, not really a bakery or frosting sweetness, more like a heavy sweet top note on that bakery-ish base.  I'd primarily use this to punch up sweeter bakeries, especially cinnamon rolls or other breakfast-type pastries at around 4%.\n\nInhale has some warmer bakery taste to it, but not really the grainy texture I'd expect.  Almost like a warm sweet dinner roll, or the middle of an undercooked cinnamon roll minus the cinnamon.  Kind of a generic moderate dense body instead of a fluffy bakery. Building flat sweetness.  Exhale has a stronger bakery taste.  Feels like there is some actual buttery richness in here, with a lighter, warm yeasty note.  Sweetness is a little more defined than on the inhale, and tastes a bit like cream soda.  Not really dense enough for a frosting note.  Texture overall doesn't fit the taste.  That might be where the \"beer\" part of the butterbeer comes in.  It isn't quite solid enough to really taste doughy, more like a sweet bakery dough soda.  Finish is pretty clean overall.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  No idea what butterbeer is supposed to taste like.  A bit odd overall, but nothing offensive.  Mostly a pretty heavy mismatch between the thinner texture of this and the richer bakery notes.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nah, not really.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'd use to thicken and sweeten other bakery concentrates.  Seems like it should be pretty spot on with cinnamon rolls.  It has a certain breakfast pastry vibe to it that would also work cereals.  This feels like it has a lot of promise as an additive in general, so I could see this being pretty widely useful working with bakeries.\n\nIf you wanted stick with the idea that this should be some kind of liquid, seems like a good starting point for a hot buttered rum or similar.\n\n**Notes:**  This doesn't really seem to work at 2%.  Light sweet bakery dough accent, but it's a bit dry and underflavored.  4% works substantially better. Bakery note is a bit more solid.  Still not bakery textured, but there is some more warmth, buttery nuance, and richness to it. 6% is still pretty solid.  Heavier bakery but a lighter texture.  Seems to be getting a bit dry again.  8% seems pretty dry and is starting to taste a bit chemical. I'd use this around 4% as a backup note for other bakeries, or maybe 6% if you want to accent around this as a primary note.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNah, still new.\n\n[Here's the Flavorwest product page.](http://flavorwest.com/index.php/water-soluble-flavoring/butterbeer.html)  SDS sheets are up for their newer flavors, it looks like they just list propylene glycol and benzyl alcohol.  On their flavors with sugar syrup or fructose, it's generally listed in those sheets.  So these don't have anything weird in them?

And although I try to be aware and work on it...sugar is a nice option as it slowly dissolves as it's being massaged (making it pretty foolproof for this fool). \n\nWhen my favorite sugar scrub/mask from Skinfood was discontinued last year I was really bummed. Finding that coconut sugar dream was a surprise in that it was just the right amount of exfoliation mixed with a rather nourishing formulation.\n\nBut, the team over at Beauty Within came through with their recommendation of the Fresh Sugar Strawberry Exfoliating Face Wash!\n\nThis product acts very similar to my long lost love in that it applies with a slight thickness and weight. The amount of scrubbing action can be customized by applying more or less water to the skin before the scrub.\n\nAfter about 15-30 seconds of massaging the sugar breaks down into a wonderful sugary face wash...although there is no lather here (I found myself following this up with my regular water based cleanser).\n\nThe result for me has been super smooth, soft, and resurfaced skin. The Fresh Sugar Strawberry Exfoliating Face Wash has helped to reduce some texture issues and seems to allow other products in my routine (toner/essence/serum) to absorb a bit more thoroughly.\n\nI’m so happy to have found this product and the strawberry/cream soda scent doesn't hurt either. This is one that I will be repurchasing and keeping in my routine for the foreseeable future.\n\nI can’t wait to try out the other offerings from Fresh.

    "body": "Hi fellow skincare addicts!\n\n*Edit: These are not 'new' but in the wake of the Purito controversy I think a lot of people are tying to find sunscreens they can trust. I'm not aware of any independent studies on Daylong but their filters are top of the line + I've had a really good experience with them so I thought I would do this review for you guys :)*\n\nI'm honestly a little surprised how little talk there is about these sunscreens, because they do the job fairly well, performance and ingredients wise. I'm talking about the ***Daylong Face Sensitive*** (normal to oily skin) and ***Daylong Extreme*** (face milk version, for dry to very dry skin). They are both broad spectrum SPF 50. They both claim to be water and sweat proof (I have never really put these particular claims to the test, but fyi).\n\n**My skin type:** .... weird. I am 30+, rosacea prone,  and my skin has changed *a lot* in the past couple of years, it's an absolute nightmare. Everything looks shiny on me no matter what, so I try to that into account for reviews XD I don't wear makeup very often, and my routine at the moment is toner + lotion + moisturizer (+squalane if needed), with little variation. Also I have light skin (FP scale 2).\n\n**EDIT: Forgot to mention that where I live it's very sunny and mostly dry all year round. Tested these this winter, maybe I'll do another little post about them in the coming summer.**\n\nAnyway, the review now!\n\n\\-\n\nIngredients:\n\n***Daylong Face Sensitive*** \\- Aqua, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate **(UVB)**, diethylaminohydroxybenzoy hexyl benzoate **(UVA)**, c12-15 alkyl benzoate, dibutyl adipate, tapioca starch, ethylhexyl triazone **(UVB)**, methylene bis-benzotriazoyl tetramethylbutylphenol (nano) (**Tinosorb M, broad spectrum)**, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine **(Tinosorb S, broad spectrum)**, sorbitol, helianthus annus seed oil, glycerin, tocopherol, dimethicone, lauryl glucoside, polyglyceryl-2 dipolyhydroxystearate, cetyl phosphate, cetearyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, carbomer, decyl glucoside, sodium levulinate, triethanolamine, caprylyl glycol, ascorbyl palmitate, ethyl ferulate, sodium anisate, polymethylsilsesquioxane, polyglyceryl-5 trioleate, propylene glycole, rosmarinus officinalis leaf extract, xanthan gum, bht, disodium uridine phosphate.\n\n***Daylong Extreme*** \\- Aqua, Ethylhexyl salicylate **(UVB)**, Methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol **(Tinosorb M, broad spectrum)**, Bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethmethylbutylphenol, Bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine **(Tinosorb S, broad spectrum)**, Diethylhexyl butamido triazone **(UVB)**, tyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, l adipate, Pentylene glycol, Alcohol, Sorbitol, Dimethicone, Cetyl phosphate, Cetyl alcohol, Triethanolamine, Tocopherol, Decyl glucoside, Lecithin, Acrylic acid / VP crosspolymer, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan gum, Aloe berbadensis leaf juice powder.\n\n\\-\n\nThese sunscreens are available in several countries in Europe but I'm not too sure about overseas *(Edit: apparently they are available widely but UV filters and ingredients may vary depending on your area)*. Daylong belongs to a group called Galderma, which owns brands like Differin and Cetaphil. In the EU they are very affordable, ranging between 11€ to 15€ depending on where you buy them, at least in my area.\n\nAs far as my experience using them:\n\n**Texture:** they are both pretty nice, the Extreme is a face milk so fairly liquidy and easy to spread, comes in your average tube over here but I think a pump version exists as well. The Sensitive one does come in a pump, and the texture is more like a gel (if you are familiar with AB gel-creams, it's pretty similar to that). Also spreads easily.\n\n**Longevity & comfort:** so this is definitely the strength of these sunscreens in my opinion. The Extreme one has been designed for people who have actual allergies and/or severe reactions to direct exposure to the sun. One generous application of either lasts forever. As in, if I apply in the morning, go out for a few hours (nothing too sweaty) in the afternoon it's still there on my face. I felt the difference in my skin hydration for sure (not feeling as tight in the afternoon vs most other sunscreens I own). Also works really well under makeup, especially the Extreme one (I mostly use MISSHA magic cushion as foundation).\n\n**Whitecast & appearance:** Unfortunately, the Extreme does have a noticeable white-cast. It's not quite the casper look but it's there (can see it more as a tone-up if you are pale but will never look natural on anything darker imo, if that's something that bothers you). The Sensitive doesn't have a white-cast at all but it's not a completely natural look either. It does look a little shiny on me (most things do), not in an offensive way but in a 'I have just put something on my face' kind of way, even an hour later. I find this a little surprising for something targeted towards oily skin but there you have it.\n\n\\-\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nThese sunscreens may not be the most cosmetically elegant I have tried so far, but they are definitely worth a try in my opinion, especially since they are in a very decent price range for the quality. And of course YMMV, so they might work for you cosmetic wise. They have some really serious protection and while I haven't tested the 'waterproof' claims they stayed on my face *forever* with a few hours of exposure (very sunny all year round here and dry, not much humidity).\n\nIf your skin in seriously dehydrated, I would give these a try if you can because for me they really helped with TEWL and keeping my skin feeling comfortable. Would I repurchase? Yes, for times I know I need some serious protection but I wouldn't use the Extreme one if I was going to meet someone, or at least not without makeup, because I would feel too self-conscious of the white-cast for sure.\n\nJust to clarify, these are not HG for me, but I'm sure they could be for dry and dehydrated skin types, and I think they deserve more visibility. The dream for me is finding something that gives me the same level of comfort and barrier but is more elegant.\n\n\\-\n\n**tl;dr: excellent, long lasting protection + helps with TEWL but white-cast on the Extreme version, slight 'glow' on the Face Sensitive one.**\n\nI hope this was helpful to someone!! :)",

I have to admit that I'm someone who struggles with reapplying sunscreen as often as you're supposed to, which is why I like using (very) water resistant sunscreens, and I also get the impression that the Daylong stays put very well, which I really appreciate, too. \n\n\nI also enjoy how well it applies, it spreads easily and comfortably, but still dries down and builds a film fairly quickly while other sunscreens sometimes seem to never really settle/dry down. The film it forms also seems really even to me, no streaks or anything, and it doesn't sting my skin or eyes nor settle weirdly in hair, eyebrows or lines. I think price-wise it's also pretty good (I usually buy the 200 ml bottle).\n\n\nEven though I like it a lot, I am hesistant to recommend it, because of the aesthetic aspect. I find that it has a whie cast (due to the Tinosorb M) and it also looks very shiny. It doesn't actually feel greasy or oily to me, but the shine is pretty intense. It's also a bit sticky, which doesn't really bother me on the face because I only notice it there when I touch it, but that's why I don't really like using it on the body, where there's more friction happening. \n\n\nPersonally, I can get the white cast and shininess under control with some make up, so for me personally it's not a huge issue, but I think a lot of people might be bothered by it/don't want to have to put make up on top of their sunscreen to make it look okay-ish.",

    "body": "Post summary:\n\n* Proof of concept for Bromantane nasal spray & other pharmacology\n* Shipping prices dropped on [bromantane.co](https://bromantane.co)\n* New releases\n\n# New findings on Bromantane\n\nA while back I discovered lost Russian literature on Bromantane: [Pharmacology of Adamantanes](http://library.lol/main/CD8E44AA817FFB656E936429BF0A8496). Me and friends translated it page by page to get to the bottom of it and we discovered a few cool things.\n\nEnglish translation: https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/uters3/the_pharmacology_of_adamantanes_full_english/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\n1. Bromantane is an antioxidant with greater efficacy than that of Bemethyl, but both combined synergized in their antihypoxic effects.\n2. Bromantane's *real* oral bioavailability is 27.5%.\n3. Bromantane's half life is 60x longer when injected.\n4. Bromantane encourages healthy testosterone homeostasis.\n5. PEG-400 alone was sedating in their studies.\n6. Bromantane's mechanism is likely the same as Amantadine.\n\n**Bioavailability:** So considering intranasal administration has been shown to enhance bioavailability to near intravenous levels in other models, and is similar in concept, this could mean a near 3-fold greater absorption (making 18mg more like 54mg), and a 60-fold greater half life (making 4 hours more like 10 days) compared to oral. This might be necessary to achieve the dopamine enhancement seen in some rat models.\n\n**Antioxidant & antihypoxic effects:** The antioxidant effect of Bromantane is likely what makes it an antihypoxiant. Bemethyl functioned via glutathione and catalase enhancement, but such is not clear with Bromantane. Bemethyl and Bromantane combined, however, appeared to synergize, meaning they might work through different mechanisms. Both had a positive effect on sex hormones such as testosterone, likely by protecting leydig cells.\n\n**Likeness to Amantadine:** They conclude that Bromantane's mechanism is probably like that of Amantadine's, which is what I thought as well. This includes antiviral activity. They attribute psychoactive effects to NMDA antagonism, however this book was published before it was discovered that Amantadine is predominantly a Kir2.1 channel inhibitor, and NMDA antagonist only at high doses. Therefore it is plausible that Bromantane is more selective to Kir2.1 than Amantadine, which could explain the improved dopaminergic effects.\n\n# Updates to Bromantane.co\n\nThis above went into my writeup on [https://bromantane.co/](https://bromantane.co/), where I've also drastically decreased shipping prices for everyone. This utilizes a plugin that calculates shipping costs in real time, and I've switched off to first class (still USPS).\n\nEveryone who preordered has had their shipments mailed out, and we now have stock.\n\nDue to the war in Ukraine, I had to find a new source. This put my entire business in jeopardy. Since I didn't know the chemists, I decided to give it chemical analysis here in the states. The results were very positive, both with HPLC and H1 Spectra. It might even be more purified than before. The spray's smell has changed, but in my opinion it's better. It almost has a peppermint oil smell to it. I like it.\n\n# SkQ1, Tabernanthalog and Tropisetron\n\nSkQ1 is in stock now, and a complete writeup can be found on [bromantane.co](https://bromantane.co). It's essentially a super potent antioxidant that has been speculated to help with a number of things: from improving eyesight, to lifespan, to rheumatoid arthritis, to cognitive decline, to cancer, etc. It's in a benzyl alcohol solution, so make sure it doesn't directly touch your eyes. The benefits generally speaking, don't require localized application, so the concept isn't bad. Sublingual was noted in studies as a possible route of administration.\n\nTabernanthalog has been listed for a while, and that's basically a non-hallucinogenic psychedelic derived from Ibogaine. In rat models it helped with abstaining from addictive drugs and it was antidepressant in effect.\n\n**Tropisetron** is something I have been excited about for a while, and within the coming month it will be carried on [bromantane.co](https://bromantane.co). During the writing of [my post on GTS-21](https://www.reddit.com/user/sirsadalot/comments/ryojef/exploring_the_mystery_of_nicotine_gts21/), I was very excited about the use of α-7 nicotinic receptors as a means to enhance cognition in healthy people. As it turns out, Tropisetron is a superior substance: it's cheaper, doesn't cause nausea (it's actually an anti-nausea medicine) and has a much longer half life. It also had better results in Schizophrenia.\n\nI'm also potentially looking into carrying CX-1739, Neboglamine and a few others, however I haven't found any leads yet.\n\n**Edit:** By the way, I'm pretty sure they censor u/sirsadalot on r/Nootropics, so please avoid doing that because instead of spreading support your entire message will just be deleted. Lol.\n\nComments locked because I'm being targeted again by the same power hungry mods that delete mention of my name.\n\nAnd as always, please join us on matrix in case we get mass reported by their bots:  [https://matrix.to/#/#server:nootopics.org](https://matrix.to/#/#server:nootopics.org)",

    "body": "i've been spending a little time comparing active/inactive ingredients and have the following to share if it's of any interest to anyone. please note i'm not a chemist so take everything with a grain of salt (no pun intended).\n\nSo the whole BPI year BUD thing really bugs me without any show of evidence to back up their claims. Nonetheless, i figured i'd take a look at zepbound, BPI, and Olympia and see if i could find any similarities that may or may not indicate longer term peptide stability.\n\nThe short of it is zepbound is on an island alone. They don't use lyophilized (freeze dried) API. They have a more stable form of API with proprietary buffering that lends itself to the long BUD.\n\nTaking a look at the 503B inactives, I found that BPI's formulation (allegedly Tirzepatide, Disodium Phosphate Dihydrate, Sodium Chloride, Benzyl Alcohol, and Water for Injection) has the more stable version disodium phosphate dihydrate vs. Olympia's formula which uses the more reactive sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous. These act as buffering agents to maintain the solution's pH which is imperative for long term stability.\n\nThese buffering agents are what's missing out of the 503A formularies. Hence, the shorter shelf life. Without a pH controlled environment the tirzepatide is in sterile water, which has a lower pH than the 503B buffered version.\n\nThey all (except zepbound) have benzyl alcohol (1-2%) for reduced bacteria proliferation risk. + Injection site reactions.\n\nThen I considered bottle fill volumes. Looking at peoples' pictures, it looks like BPI provides a smaller vial, with a larger fill volume; compared to Olympia's rather large vials with low fill volume. I do not know if either of these pharmacies nitrogen purge (Olympia confirmed they do Not), but either way there's a whole lot more room for oxidation in those Olympia vials.\n\nBPI. Now, these folks will not share COAs or third party assessments (I've tried, multiple times). I find this particularly off-putting for a high priced, INJECTABLE medication. Endotoxins? Percentage of tirzepatide actually present per ml? Nope, we don't get to know what we're paying for.\n\nOlympia did send me a COA out of their last batch, 3/19/25. Endotoxin, good. pH 7.6 (zep pH 6.5-7.5), fair. Tirzepatide 96.2%/ml. (for comparison, Brello's 1/25 COA 98% tirzepatide/ml. no pH info though likely fair for longer term storage).\n\nBPI-most recent FDA report, fine. Olympia-most recent FDA report, yikes! [https://www.fda.gov/media/180579/download](https://www.fda.gov/media/180579/download)\n\nMy intent in all of this was to identify the most worthwhile use of my money.\n\nFor a short term stock, i still think brello and RR are good buys (although RR costs \\~125% more and presents greater oxidation risks re: vial size and fill volume). Additionally, Olympia is also a great shorter term buy for something with no additives given this COA report. And for the alleged 12 month BPI BUD, i've now changed my BPI tune and am considering buying ($5.83/mg vs. zep $12.50/mg).\n\nTLDR: I was hoping to decide that Olympia vials with their 8/25 BUD could in theory last 12 months, but since reading into some things, i've decided that's not a worthwhile gamble. (But the COA report was fine and with a four month buy + the discount code, their pricing per mg is Very close to Brello's right now - and you'd likely get it shipped much sooner considering Brello's Mochi mess).\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gUnoMRwFJh1rJpBqH6gQzRKncUlr2mBv/view?usp=drivesdk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gUnoMRwFJh1rJpBqH6gQzRKncUlr2mBv/view?usp=drivesdk)",

Matrix hydrasource mask was the only thing that has even come close to my hg but unfortunately they stopped selling the mask on retail basis and it is intended only for saloon purpose and with the pandemic I don't think I will be stepping into a salon anytime soon. So I was looking for an affordable alternative and someone in this sub mentioned this one. Now the coming to ingredients \n\nMatrix biolage hydrasource mask- \nAqua , Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, stearyl alcohol,Cetyl Esters, fragrance,  Phenoxyethanol, Isopropyl Alcohol, Aloe Barbadensis / Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Limonene, chlorhexidine dihydrochloride , sodium citrate, Hexyl Cinnamal, Coumarin, Linalool, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Alcohol, Hydroxycitronellal, Amyl Cinnamal. \n\n Loreal total repair 5 masque - \nWater, cetearyl alcohol, mineral oil, dipalmitoylethyl hydroxyethylmonium methosulphate, cetyl esters, lactic acid, phenoxyethanol , trideceth-6 , chlorhexidine digluconate, limonene, benzyl salicylate, amodimethacone, 2-oleamido-1,3-octadecanediol, fragrance,cetrimonium chloride, butylphenyl methylpropional , Hexyl cinnamal.(they have reformulated since the last time I used it about 2 years ago)\n\nMY EXPERIENCE:\n     Now coming to texture , the loreal one is tad bit thicker than the matrix mask and the slip provided is also lesser than the matrix mask. So I needed about 1.5 times  the amount as matrix one . The shine provided by both are same .They both act similarly when it come to making my waves form and hold. The loreal one is not as moisturising as the Matrix mask , and the frizz is also a little more than matrix mask.  So overall I would say  loreal total repair mask comes close to matrix by about 85%  . And it is costlier than the matrix biolage hydrasource mask, so I will again start my search once this one gets over.",

There are a lot of upset reviews on their website and Amazon specifically regarding the formula change. Also, make sure you read the ENTIRE ingredients list when you buy a product because roughly the first half of these two formulas are the same. When I noticed the different bottle, I expected a formula change, but I only compared about half the ingredients and thought I was buying the same product.  I should have known better but won't be making that mistake again!  \n\n**Older, blue-top formula:** Water, Glycerin, Cetyl Palmitate, Mineral Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Octyldodecanol, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Colloidal Oatmeal, Dimethicone, PEG-40 Stearate, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, DMDM Hydantoin, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben  \n\n**Newer, red-top formula:** Water, Glycerin, Cetyl Palmitate, Mineral Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Octyldodecanol, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Colloidal Oatmeal, Dimethicone, Methylpropanediol, PEG-40 Stearate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Piroctone Olamine, Carbomer, Benzyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-2 Caprate, Decylene Glycol  \n\nI bought the new version about a week ago and only just realized why my skin has gotten so upset lately. I have rosacea and relied on this as a HG moisturizer for body AND face for the last couple years. The new formula burns my skin and makes my face flaky and red all day. It essentially makes my rosacea worse. My biggest concern, though, is that it makes some parts of my body red...areas that have never caused me ANY sensitivity issues before. Weird. Some other reviews mentioned that it isn't moisturizing at all because it doesn't sink in and that it has a weird smell, both of which I can attest to as well.  \n\nI just wanted to throw this out there in case anyone else uses this product or was considering it. I still HIGHLY recommend the blue-top version if you happen to find it somewhere, but this new red version was awful for me and apparently many others. Also, read the entire ingredients lists when you're comparing formulas!",

Obviously, the label on this limited run caught my eye, so it made for a good opportunity to try them out.  The label is certainly striking if not a little difficult to capture in a photograph.  Upon initial inspection, I thought it was a screen-printed label, but it is in fact a sticker label, only very well done.  The label is thick textured vinyl, and the \"blood splatter\" (not \"spatter\" in this case) is raised beyond that.  For those that don't know, this is a Jack The Ripper themed soap.  The blood splatter is in the shape of a nude female torso, and Jack and his knife can be seen in the negative space.\n\nThe soap concept was borne of a contest in which the winner named the soap, defined its theme, and played at least some part in outlining the scent profile.  It was inspired by five victims of Jack The Ripper.  Each note was influenced by the surroundings in which their bodies were found.  The place was Whitechapel.  The notes were to be smoke, chocolate/caramel, leather, lilac, and tobacco.  I can provide a screenshot of the original listing if there's interest.  Macabre as it may be, its creativity can't be denied.  This, alone, will offend some.  The art will offend others.  This writing is not intended to broach that aspect, but rather comment on my impressions of the overall product.\n\nThe all-black tub is your standard plastic offering.  There are no visible identifying marks for me to track down the precise model, but other than being black, they're the same as my L&L Grooming tubs in every other aspect.   The tub itself being quite flexible and the lid is fairly rigid.  I didn't measure it, but it's documented to have 150g of product, and the tub is just over half full.  The product is a pale tan color and is on the firm end of the croap spectrum.  It appears to have been pressed into the tub with the aide of a spatula or similar tool.\n\nThe fragrance off the tub was mostly smoky vetiver and leather with perhaps a very faint floral note, but not such that I could define the specific floral.  Lathered, the smoky vetiver is still forward, but it's much cleaner than say, Catie's Bubbles' \"322\".  The leather note is present, but muted throughout most of the shave.  With continued exposure during a 2+ pass shower head and face shave, the floral note also remained muted, but useful in keeping this from being a single-faceted aroma.  It's possible I detected some cocoa, but I was searching for it given the documented notes.  I did not detect tobacco.\n\nI used the 30mm APShaveCo Tuxedo knot both for a test lather the night before and for the full shave today.  I'd read some less-than-stellar reviews and was thus fully prepared for a mediocre experience.  Fortunately, I was surprised.  This beef tallow-based soap loads and performs very similarly to Barrister and Mann's white label soaps.  With that it shares the rather substantial thirst.  I learned a lot from the test lather and found it could handle even irresponsible amounts of hard water before finally collapsing. I suspect this thirst is the culprit for some of the below-average reviews.  In pushing the water, I obtained a very dense lather.  While this first go yielded a sufficiently slick lather, it wasn't quite as slick as Barrister and Mann's white label.  The residual slickness was above average, but again, not to the level of that of B&M's.  The post-shave was at least competitive with my other favored artisans, such that skipping a post-product could be entertained.  I almost never skip an aftershave, so I had planned on using Catie's Bubbles' \"322\" regardless.  I chose it for the smoky vetiver of which I'm a fan.  B&M's Hallows may have been a better \"pairing\" with the cocoa element, but it's irrelevant since the soap has little to nil lingering fragrance.  In this case, it's more about extending the experience.\n\nI've been intrigued by Phoenix and Beau's offerings for some time, now, and I'm glad to have picked this one up.  Since they're across the pond as it were, this single tub cost me $31.52 shipped to Texas.  Given that, I'm not compelled to randomly explore more of their offerings since similarly performing soaps are readily available stateside.  Additionally, I gravitate to soaps with matching splashes, and Phoenix and Beau apparently have no such offerings.  That said, when a unique theme and eye-catching label comes along again, I won't hesitate to jump on it.  Especially now that I'm confident they offer a product that performs as good as it looks.\n\n**Ingredients: Potassium Stearate, Potassium Tallowate (Bovine), Potassium Castorate, Cocos Lactate, Glycerin, Potassium Safflowerate, Potassium Shea Butterate, Lanolin, Allantoin, Tussah Silk, Vetiver EO, Sandalwood EO, Jasmine Absolute, Ylang Ylang EO, Leather FO, Chocolate FO, Benzyl Alcohol, Benzyl Benzoate, Eugenol, Farnesol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Linalool.**\n\n*Disclaimer: As previously mentioned, I paid a pretty penny for this soap and I received no incentives in exchange for my comments.  In fact, I have never met Phoenix or Beau, for that matter.*\n\n\n**Here's a gif I crudely made in an attempt to show the texture of the label:** \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/qrzENkY.gif\n\n**More label pics:**\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/W6gFmto.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/fNT9mq3.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/BHcgArb.jpg\n\n**Dry soap pic:**  https://i.imgur.com/z13roy2.jpg\n\n**Back label:**  https://i.imgur.com/tt3O2ZM.jpg\n\n**Test lather pic:**  https://i.imgur.com/GoA0LtA.jpg",

It started in my late teens with sides of my nose, and eventually spread to eyebrows, eyelids, upper lip, temples, parts of forehead and behind the ears.\n\nTried all kinds of pharmaceutical and natural remedies and the only thing that consistently kept it in check (although never really cleared it completely) was regularly washing my face with selenium sulfide based anti-dandruff shampoos.\n\nSome time ago I was shopping in an online drugstore and found an anti-fungal skin ointment with the same brand name as one of the shampoos that worked for me. I thought an ointment would be less rough for the face skin than a shampoo, plus it was cheaper so I bought it.\n\nTurned out that unlike in the shampoo, the anti-fungal substance in the ointment is ciclopirox with olamin (10 mg per 1 g, or 1%) and it works great for me! I've been applying a small amount of it once a day or once every two days and I've been completely free of any flaking or redness for 3 weeks now. This is the longest streak I've had in 20 years!\n\nI don't think I'm \"cured\" permanently (I suspect the symptoms will return after I stop using the product), and there's always a possibility it will eventually stop working, but so far I'm ecstatic. I also know that what works for some people doesn't for others, but if you haven't tried it yet, see if it does for you.\n\nI'm not going to provide the brand name since this is a Polish product and I doubt this particular brand is available outside of Poland, but I'm sure you can find an equivalent.\n\nIt is sold OTC in 20 g tubes in a suspension form (like a runny/watery white cream). Here's a list of ingredients:\n\nCyclopirox with olamin (10 mg per 1 g). Auxiliary substances: propylene glycol, benzyl alcohol, liquid paraffin, cetostearyl alcohol, lactic acid, macrogol cetostearyl ether, purified water.\n\nI hope this helps someone.",

At the time, I wasn't able to find much in the way of available formulas, so I dug into some GC-MS results for milk and butter to guide my path. Here it is:\n\nButter CO2: 17 ml\n\nGamma nonalactone: 16 ml\n\nMilk lactone: 13 ml\n\nButyl butyryl lactate: 11 ml\n\nGamma octalactone: 8 ml\n\nDelta dodecalactone: 7 ml\n\nBenzaldehyde: 2 ml\n\nIsobutavan: 1 ml\n\nPhenethyl acetate: 1 ml\n\nBenzyl alcohol: 1 ml\n\nMethyl laitone 10%: 10 ml\n\nCaramel furanone 0.01%: 2 ml (corrected from 1% to 0.01%)\n\nSulfurol 1%: 1 ml\n\nPotato pyrazine 0.1%: 10 ml\n\nIt's worth noting that there are some materials that ideally would have been included that I excluded (most notably delta octalactone, delta decalactone, gamma dodecalactone, and furaneol along with several aldehydes) simply because I did not have them on hand or they didn't support my goal. Additionally, some of the ratios were simply adjusted to taste compared to the available analyses, such as with an overdose of butter and an underdose of sulfurol.\n\nSpeaking of sulfurol, I spilled a bunch on a table in the process, and the room smelled of beef for a few weeks, so I can recommend *not* doing that.\n\nHope this helps anyone interested in milky notes.",

Inkey list oat cleansing balm: Beautiful cleansing balm for sensitive skin. I love using it on days when my skin is irritated and it helps in calming down the irritation. The rich consistency is perfect for the winter months. you can keep it on your face for 10 minutes as a hydrating mask before washing it off. Washes off completely without any residue. During peak winter I have used this as my only cleanser and didn't face any issue.  **HG** for sure 4.5/5 \n\nIngredient List: Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Oil, Candelilla Cera (Cire de candelilla), Silica, Sorbitan Stearate, Tribehenin, PEG-60 Almond Glycerides, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Flour, Aqua (Water/Eau), Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Lecithin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Biosaccharide Gum-4, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil. \n\n2.  Muji sensitive cleansing oil: This is thick in consistency like the DHC cleansing oil. I could smell   \n the olive oil in DHC cleansing oil but this smells like nothing. Washes off completely without leaving any residue. Does not sting my eyes and removes makeup well even waterproof mascara. Perfect dupe for DHC cleansing oil. I love that it comes in a 200 ml bottle. 4/5 **WRP** but I wanna try the light cleansing oil from Muji first. I can't find the ingredient list in English. \n\n3.  Inveda stubborn makeup cleansing oil: I love this cleansing oil. It removes makeup really well and washes off without any residue. Sometimes in winter i use this as my only cleanser and it works well. Consistency is perfect it is not as thick as Muji or DHC and it's not too runny either. It emulsifies slightly quicker than Muji oil but that makes a difference when you are tired at the end of the day and in winter when the water is so cold :P **HG** 5/5 \n\nIngredient list:  Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride,Olive Oil, Sorbate 30 Tetra Oleate, Sesame Oil, grape seed Oil, Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E Acetate, Hazel Nut oil, Rose Hip Oil, Castor oil, Fragrance",

    "body": "Hii guys. I have been on this sub for quiet some time but did not had enough karma for it to post.So this is my 1st post.\n\nSKIN TYPE- 18F ,Oily, ance prone, prone to comedones in summer. Now(in winters)have normalish skin.\n\nCURRENT CLIMATIC CONDITION- Cold winter's of Rajasthan.\n\nINGREDIENTS- Aqua, Aloe Vera Leaf Ext., Veg. Glycerin, Propanediol, Niacinamide, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7 (and) Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzyl Alcohol (and) Ethylhexylglycerin (and) Tocopherol, Xanthan Gum\n\nREVIEW- I purchased the cos iq niacinamide because it was fungal acne safe(yes i also have fungal acne on some specific spots on my forehead) and was for 349 something in sale.The texture is very watery and light. I used it for almost 2 and a half months now(kinda regular) and it is still 1/4th left. I purchased it mainly for my acne marks(pih) , redness and sebum control.\nThough it did control not control my sebum that much but i came to know afterwards that my skin was dehydrated(so the excess sebum production) so hyaluronic acid took care of that. But boy it did a great job for my redness and irritated skin. I used to apply it(on damp skin)as spot treatment on my irritated skin or red angry zits and the redness used to go down 50% overnight. For the acne marks it did work (a little less than i thought) but took some time and did gave my overall dull face a soft glow. \n\nVERDICT- might repurchase. Because i wanted to try chemist at play niacinamide and tranexamic acid serum.But if i do not i'll surely repurchase it. It is one of my holy grails.",

I couldn't bend my fingers, or anything.It was truly debilitating.\n\nAfter Doctor and Doctor of prescribing cream after cream, which only seemed to make things worse, I finally would up with a dermatologist who cared, but decided that she was not the best one to fix my issue. She refereed me to an Allergist who Specialized in Eczema. Through this allergist, I found out that I was not only allergic to cortical steroids, but also to things like Benzyl alcohol and many other ingredients that are in most hand creams and moisturizers.So every time I attempted to treat my Eczema, It was being made worse.\n\nfast forward 6 months of avoiding those substances that I am allergic to, My Eczema is not healed, but it is workable to a point where I can use my hands again 40 &#37; of the time.My allergist feels like there is somthing else causing the reaction but we cant figure out what it is.I get signed up for Dupixent. turns out my coverage cant cover it yet, and I certainly cant afford 27,000 dollars a year.\n\nAt this point, I took things into my own hands, I decided that, If its an allergic reaction, and we cant isolate it on the outside, then what if its on the inside. I started doing research on diets and other methods of thinking about inflammatory conditions.\n\nI made the decision to change my diet away from the standard Canadian diet, and switch to a Carnivore diet for 30 days.This diet consisted of basically the premise behind Keto Low carb/High fat/High Protien Diet.Foods included Meat/Eggs/Hard cheese. drinks were water and black coffee\n\nThe first 3 days were hell, But I didn't give up.Fast forward 30 days, my Right hand is completely healed. and my left hand is 70&#37; healed, I have not hand a single flare up and I feel the best I have felt in years.\n\nI like a lot of people, didn't believe in the whole hocus pocus of diet and how it affects your body, but its amazing what you will do when you lost all hope, and what a glimmer of hope can do.\n\nThanks.",

It definitely needs to be advocated for ahead of any steroid/drug; I wouldn't at all doubt there are dedicated accounts on here pushing Dupixent. \n\nDoes Keto require you cut out most dairy? I know you said 'hard cheese' but if milk was something you drank before and now you don't then that's revealing. I think a lot of people find success with Veganism, as I did, due to that elimination. Currently however i am only vegetarian and have now found a nice dietary balance. \n\nKeto is definitely interesting though, as far as I know there is little to no research about Ketosis and eczema. Please continue to share you progress. I hope month 2 is equally as successful for you!",

I appreciate your listing out the ingredients too.😘\n\nThere seems to be some confusion about some of the ingredients, but you've likely heard of them already, just by different names:\n\n**Centella asiatica**. AKA as **Tiger Grass** or gotu kola, the medicinal plant **is the star of skin-soothing Cica creams,** and **madecassoside** is one of the primary, most active compounds in centella asiatica.\n\nThese ingredients are in some of the Dr Jart (and others) products that soothe the skin. BTW, **CosRX has a cica powder** that you can mix in with other products to customize them as you see fit. For example, you may not want all the ingredients that are in the base of a product because it contains irritants, fragrance of cause acne, so you could use something like squalene or hyalauonic acid as the base/carrier to mix with the cica powder which is great especially for sensitive and/or rosean skin.

It's easy to use & ensures no product is wasted once you're finished with the contents.\n\n**🧖🏻‍♀️My Experience:** Yes, I was Influenced to buy this after their Shark Takn feature, & I wasn't disappointed.\n\nCos-IQ killed it with their serum-y texture. It's so easy to apply, & blends into the skin effortlessly, giving a semi-dewy finish. \n\nTrue to their word, there was no white cast on application. On days when I didn't blend it properly, it pilled a bit. But I didn't face the pilling issue constantly, so no complaints there.\n\nOn re-application, it felt a bit powder-y & I had to put a little more effort while blending to avoid a white cast. I didn't notice any tan, but mind you, I'm not out for longer hours. \n\nI was impressed when Cos-IQ admitted to their product having white cast & asked all consumers to replace it with a new product without any additional cost. Indian brands have come under scanner for their lack of response, so seeing Cos-IQ own up to their mistake was a good thing.\n\nThe downside is probably the less quantity. 30ml is quite less for a product. They're running an offer on their site costing Rs. 299/-.\n\n**Repurchase:** I'm yet to find my HG sunscreen, so I'm experimenting with other brands.",

    "body": "This was released today, but I managed to get mine two weeks ago - so I've used it 14 or so times, in the evening.\n\nIt's a classic balm - thick, no water, oil-based and emulsifies with water. Strips anything oil-based beautifully, like sunscreen or makeup. Zero smell.\n\nIt's in a tube and is *very* temperature dependent. In the morning, when the bathroom has been cold (winter, UK), it's basically unusable - it's solid, and you'd have to dump it in a warm sink for 15 mins to squeeze it out. In the evening, it's perfect, and squeezes out with the consistency of toothpaste. I suspect this is why balms are usually in pots... but I despise pots, so I'm fine with the possible mild inconvenience.\n\nIt only works as a first cleanse - you need to follow this up with a gel cleanser to get rid of the residue, else you can become unexpectedly greasy later in the day (from the few times I've used it in the morning).\n\n**BUT**... if you use it like that (evening, first cleanse)... it is wonderful. Does its job, leaves the skin (after second cleanse) soft, happy, uniform.\n\nIt's the best balm I've ever used (I've used most of the main ones, Clarins, Lacome, Pixi, etc). It's incredibly cheap, and is full of oaty goodness that's pretty hard to get outside Aveeno. It says you can used it as an oat face mask, and leave it on for 10 minutes - I've tried that, and it's great... but no better than just a quick wash with it, because it's already great.\n\nI've already bought it again (arrived today, because I fear it'll sell out).\n\n\n£9.99/150ml\n\n**Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Oil, Candelilla Cera (Cire de candelilla), Silica, Sorbitan Stearate, Tribehenin, PEG-60 Almond Glycerides, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Flour, Aqua (Water/Eau), Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Lecithin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Biosaccharide Gum-4, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil.**",

Though it’s not one of their pricier products it’s still more than I would like to pay so I was really excited to see this come out. Have you tried the drunk elephant balm? If so, how does this compare?",

I thought it might be nice to share it around even though it was made for my own personal use (and thus might not be the best table in the world). It's an incredibly basic list of sunscreens you'd get from your pharm.

    "body": "So...I do CO washing which as those of you know silicone in a condition is a bad idea.\nSo I was looking online for a product and found [this](http://www.pantene.com/en-CA/hair-care-products/product/Aqua-Light-Conditioner.aspx?UPC=080878057207). According to their description it's silicone free. So I called to inquire as they confirmed this. I went to the store, purchased this item and had been using it for about 3 weeks. \n\nIn that time I had developed this aweful residue spot on the back if my head and couldnt figure it out. Finally I looked at the ingredient list and clear as day it lists Dimethicone. Now this caused me a little frustration but I thought I would call and complain.\n\nhere is the list of ingredients : Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Fragrance, Benzyl Alcohol, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Glutamic Acid, Bis Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Disodium EDTA, Panthenol, Panthenyl Ethyl Ether, Citric Acid, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone\n\nThen started the most ridiculous conversation with the Pantene product support people I have ever had.\n\nIn a nut shell, They insisted I use a shampoo, wanted to send me a pamphlet on how to properly use their product and when I was willing to overlook the fact that I'm not an idiot and was explaining that the issue was now how I was using it but that they mis-advertized their products, and said it was silicone free. The stupid lady tried telling me that DIMETHICONE is NOT silicone. \n\nSo that's when I realized that my perceptions of Pantene as a brand where not what I thought and they in fact don't know what they are talking about and as a result I will no longer trust them with being a quality product if they don't understand their own ingredients.\n\nBreath....end vent..\n\nwas I wrong? Because I was 95% sure Dimethicone is a silicone based polymer. Its in fact one of the most obvious silicone products.\n\nI might call back when i have calmed down and approach it as an allergy issue because they clearly are misrepresenting the product as far as I can tell and as soon as they find I don't use shampoo they don't seem to care.",

It works as a smoothing agent by filling in gaps and texture gradients - think of it a sexy-time lube for your hair O_O;; ... washing my ponytail isn't going to be the same now that I've thought of this.\n\nANYHOW!

    "body": "I recently started using CoverGirl Clean Matte BB Cream and noticed after about a week I started getting painful acne and small closed comedones, but only on my chin and in/around my laugh lines. My cheeks, jawline, forehead, and nose are completely untouched. Is there a reason why this product, which I apply all over, would only cause breakouts in one area of my face? Or should I look for another culprit? I have since stopped using the BB Cream (which sucks because I really loved it) and I think my skin is slowly starting to clear up. Only other products I introduced around the same time are micellar water (which I'm still using to take off makeup, followed immediately by my normal face wash) and my Rimmel Stay Matte pressed powder, which I decided to give another go (have since stopped)...a bit suspicious of this as well because the lid had cracked so it is only sealed with the help of tape. But again, I used this product all over and on top of makeup so I'm not sure if it could be the culprit. Would appreciate some insight, thank you!\n\nAnd while I have you here, these are the ingredients in the BB Cream (which claims to be good for sensitive skin), anything stand out as possibly irritating?: Water/Eau, Cyclopentasiloxane, Propylene Glycol, Talc, Dimethicone, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Sodium Chloride, Peg/Ppg-18/18 Dimethicone, Pvp, Silica, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Acrylonitrile/Methyl Methacrylate/Vinylidene Chloride Copolymer, Trihydroxystearin, Arachidyl Behenate, Methicone, Sodium Benzoate, Synthetic Wax, Hexyl Laurate, Cetyl Peg/Ppg-10/1 Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate, Isopropyl Titanium Triisostearate, Ethylene Brassylate, Behenic Acid, Polyethylene, May Contain/Peut Contenir: Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxides",

It is also LEGAL to posses and use steroids (testosterone is a steroid), though NOT legal to sell. What I am doing is, by all technicality, not illegal BUT it may be in your area, so everything I say comes with a grain of salt. There are MANY risks, even if you do everything perfectly. I am not disillusioned and I KNOW what I am doing is not the smartest thing, but I have weighed the pros and cons, have knowledge of chemistry, and have access to someone who can CHEMICALLY test what I am getting for me to make sure it is safe. \n\n#####Do not ask me for sources for where I get my T, as I will not provide them. Not only is my source no longer in business, but it leaves me open to legal action depending on where you live, and I will not be liable for anything that happens. I am posting this for information purposes. \n\n#####IF YOU CHOOSE TO GO THIS ROUTE, PLEASE UNDERSTAND THE RISKS. \n\n\n\n--------------------------------\n\n\n\nHey all. \n\nI have debated talking about this for a while, but I feel like it is something that everyone should have access to information on this touchy subject matter if they want it. \n\nSome basic info - \n\n> What is it that you are taking, exactly? \n\nI compound my own testosterone cypionate from raw powder testosterone. I am currently on a dosage that works for my body (120mg/ml per week). \n\n> How do you do that??\n\nI won't go into full detail unless someone wants the specifics, but it isn't hard. You set up as sterile an area as you can, combine your testosterone concentrate with carrier oil, benzyl alcohol (for sterility), benzyl benzoate (to help with solubility), and you go through a specific heating process until they are combined. Afterwards, you run the testosterone through a 0.22 micron laboratory filtration system. I actually do this twice - once through a bottle top filter system, and then again when moving the testosterone from there to a vial. \n\n> Is this safe??\n\nThe long and short of it is \"NO\". You can only mitigate risks by being careful, maintaining as much sterility as possible, and doing a lot of research.\n\nBefore going into this, I spent months not only looking up options, but finding a source that I had very good results that was willing to send me a sample that I could chemically test beforehand. I have a friend who works in a biomedical lab who was able to test against a proper sample for purity. This is the only reason I ended up going through with DIY. \n\n> Why do you DIY rather than going to a doctor? \n\nMoney. I spend much less this way than I would out of pocket, as I cannot get it covered where I live. I am not a citizen of the country that I live in, and the insurance I have through my home country does not cover transition. It is cheaper for me to keep insurance through the country I am from than to pay for insurance through the country I am in. \n\nIn total, lab supplies + testosterone supplies + medical supplies run me about US$260~ per year. \n\nI do not have to pay for blood tests, or I probably would not DIY.\n\n> How often do you get your blood tested?\n\nEvery six months. My doctor is sympathetic to what I'm doing and it is not illegal, so he just cares about my health. Both he and my mother (who used to work as a nurse for an endocrinologist) help me to make sure that my levels are good. \n\n> Have you ever had a problem with what you're doing? \n\nI have had to adjust my injection schedule to weekly, as I had issues with mood and fatigue on a biweekly shot schedule. Other than this, I have not had a problem.\n\n> Where can I buy these things?!\n\nDon't ask me. \n\n> Can I buy T from you? \n\nNo. \n\nThat is all that I can really think of to put! If there is something you would like to know, please feel free to ask and I will answer to the best of my ability. \n\nEDIT: \n\nI am still here, if anyone is wondering. I probably will be for quite a bit. Have things to do and all that, but still here if anyone has questions about anything.\n\n2nd EDIT: \n\nWould anyone be interested in seeing the process? I am actually compounding more testosterone today, so I could take photos. ",

I think it's an important topic and one that deserves attention, but it's so touchy that people may be afraid to ask about it.\n\nMy impression is that you have done a lot of research and that you have resources available to you that most people will not have. As you say, being able to obtain a sample of what you're buying and test it is a requirement, and I think that the ability to test is something that is not available to most people. Having to trust that what you're buying is what you should be getting is troubling, to say the least.\n\nAnother aspect for folks in the US is that the cost of the actual drug is probably not a big factor - it's more the ability to jump through the required hoops to obtain it.\n\nMy general question, which actually has very little to do with the actual topic of the thread ... are you satisfied with the overall result of your project?

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** TPA Gingerbread Extra Ginger, 3% and 6%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 25 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Gingerbread spice without any of the actual bakery.\n\nLeads with aggressive, spicy ginger.  Very true bakery ginger type flavor. Nothing really sweet or candied here.  I'd normally speculate wildly about the other spices in here, [but since it's TPA they have a list of the compounds used available](https://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/componentlist.aspx?sku_search=18025) and they list Clove Stem and Cassia (aka Liar's Cinnamon) Oils.  So the secondary spices are definitely clove and cinnamon.  The clove is pretty aggressive adds some numbing type mouthfeel.  I don't pick up much distinct cinnamon, but it's a bit hard to pick up much nuance through all that ginger and clove.  Cinnamon more just reinforces the clove and ginger.\n\nI don't pick up anything that actual feels like a gingerbread base, and again cheating with the component list, the only other ingredients are vanillin and benzyl alcohol.  The vanilla, and any fruit nuance are pretty much steamrolled by that heavy clove and ginger.\n\nI'm not a scientist or anything, but the clove stem oil and cassia oil are a little freaky to see listed out.  I'm not getting any really distinct separation in the bottle though [and the normal tpa gingerbread also has ginger, nutmeg, and cassia oil.](https://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/componentlist.aspx?sku_search=334401) So it's probably not a big deal?  I haven't seen this (or TPA Gingerbread) flagged anywhere for not being water-soluble.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  No actual bakery here.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Pretty intense, but it's ginger.  More of a spicy, heat type hit than a normal sting.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3%, this is pretty intense.  Spicy ginger, and heavy almost anesthetic feeling clove. Not much cinnamon nuance.  No bakery in sight.\n\nAt 6% this is even more intense.  Ginger is unpleasantly spicy, and the clove is strong enough it pretty much mutes itself out after the 3rd drag.  Some more distinct cinnamon warm.  Also no bakery notes in here.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd be using this at lower percentages as a spice accent. .5% should probably be enough for most applications but I'd top out at 1%.  Not as intense as something like FLV Clove, but working with a dilution would probably give you more control here.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This would definitely work to spice up your gingerbread.  Use with a less intense gingerbread like CAP or TPA Gingerbread Cookie for additional spice kick.  In the same vein, should work with a lot of holiday type spiced cakes or even a fruitcake.\n\nGood option for a pumpkin pie spice flavor that focuses a bit more on ginger than just a clove bomb.\n\nThe clove here makes this a poor choice for just a ginger accent. So I'd avoid using this anywhere where the clove or cinnamon is going to cause an issue.\n\nAnd hey, throw it in a tobacco.  Those dry spice notes should go pair well with non-aromatic tobaccos for some additional spicy depth.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  None that I can find.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Doesn't lather much and does not dry out the skin either. I use it when i need a light cleanse, for example after an oil cleansing balm that emulsifies. I wouldn't recommend using it after a first cleanser like a carrier oil that doesn't emulsify on its own as it it won't be able to remove the oil. Will not recommend it to use to remove sunscreen alone it is really gentle for that. I got it on a 30%+ sale from vanity wagon, hence it was a good deal at that price. While finding out the ingredients list for this post, I realized it has so many fragrance components that a lot of people in this sub wouldn't appreciate, but YMMV I guess?!! (I got it a year ago when I didn't have any skincare knowledge and was attracted to ayurvedic brands. Having said that I don't regret this purchase at all and I still believe SoulTree is one of the better ayurvedic brands. Personally I'm not allergic to fragrance yet, so I don't mind it) It maybe perfect for a gentle morning cleanser too as its the perfect amount of gentle but personally I don't use a cleanser in the morning. It has a pH of 5 as per the website. Haven't tested myself.\n* *Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status: WRP if I don't find a better alternative (only if it is on sale, I don't believe in spending 600 on a cleanser, the only purpose of which is to clean).",

    "body": "Skin type: Normal to very slightly Combination. \n\nWeather: Winter, hence my skin feels dry at the moment. \n\nCurrent routine consists of The Ordinary Ascorbic Acid 8% + Alpha Arbutin 2% in the AM, and a rotation of AHAs, BHAs, peptides, Tranexamic acid, Niacinamide and hydrating serums. I don't know my own routine lmao, it's everywhere. I might just be overdoing it, but hyperpigmentation is such a rascal that I'm willing to go to almost any length to fix it. \n\nI bought the Oat Cleansing Balm because I heard some good reviews about it while I was using a really stripping cleanser (Kaya Youth Oxy-Infusion - I regret this really badly), and I thought I needed a very nourishing cleanser (not true, just needed a non-stripping one) and bought it on a whim along with some other products from The Inkey List through Cult Beauty. Here's my haul post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/j7cd9w/my\\_first\\_haul\\_in\\_india/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/j7cd9w/my_first_haul_in_india/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nHere's the link to Oat Cleansing Balm: [https://www.theinkeylist.com/products/oat-cleansing-balm](https://www.theinkeylist.com/products/oat-cleansing-balm)\n\n**INGREDIENTS:**\n\nPrunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Oil, Candelilla Cera (Cire de candelilla), Silica,Sorbitan Stearate, Tribehenin, PEG-60 Almond Glycerides, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Flour, Aqua (Water/Eau), Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Lecithin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Biosaccharide Gum-4, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TEXTURE, PACKAGING and SMELL:**\n\nWhen it first arrived from Cult Beauty, there was a separation of the oils and the waxy type substances, so I had to give it a good shake before using it. There was also a grittiness that felt like a physical exfoliator. This sort of goes away once you massage your face and it's not at all abrasive, it just felt like there was some slightly sharp powder in there. \n\nIt comes out with a gel viscosity and definitely feels oily to the touch. I thought it would be thicker (like an actual balm), but I was surprised. Once in contact with water, it turns milky and the oily consistency isn't there anymore. \n\nIt has an oily smell, not a huge fan but it's definitely tolerable. Packaging is nothing to write home about, it's fine. It's a tube packaging and dispenses the right amount. It definitely doesn't squeeze out too much, wasting the product, unlike my previous Kaya cleanser.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CLEANSING:**\n\nI only wear SPF (My left over Purito :( ) on the daily, and no makeup so I didn't really need a cleansing balm to be honest. And you definitely don't need a double cleanse if you just wear SPF. \n\nIt does the job fine. Since I don't use makeup I couldn't really tell its efficacy but I know that it removes my sunscreen (unlike a certain Forest Essentials Product \\*cough\\*). They recommend to use it on a damp face and massage it in but I liked to apply it on a dry face, massage and then rinse with water. I feel like this would be a more effective way to get rid of whatever's on my face.\n\nWhen I do put it on my face, it's the world's worst feeling - like the oil running down on your forehead during a champi and covering your entire face? Yeah that describes it perfectly for me. But once I rinse it off with water, I feel the happiest I have in the day. It kinda leaves an oily feeling by the end of it - very minimal but it definitely feels like there's something on your face. If you used CeraVe's Hydrating Cleanser, it feels like that after cleansing, but a tad more \"oily\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**USAGE:**\n\nTwo days after using it for the first time, I get whole ass white heads in clusters! And I'd never gotten a whitehead in my life before!! This was also the first breakout I'd gotten in months, so it was super disappointing. This was in the monsoon, where the weather tends to be a bit humid. However, I was still sceptical and continued using it (for 10 days). I didn't get any more whiteheads, but I just didn't feel like using it because of the texture. \n\nI then tried it again when the weather was transitioning from monsoon to winter, and this time I got three whiteheads instead of five. Improvement!\n\nNow that it's finally winter, I gave it a go once again and this time I only have ONE whitehead!!! So at least it's consistent and very scientific. It feels better in the winter for me, as I do have dry skin during this time. \n\nDuring all of this, the products I added to my routine was The Inkey List's Collagen Booster, Tranexamic Acid and Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid. I also added Forest Essentials' Neem and Saffron Cleanser to replace the cleansing balm. But I never got whiteheads from these so I would rule these out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**VERDICT:**\n\nDefinitely a Holy Fail for me. I didn't even need a cleansing balm lol. I just wanted to try one because I'd never tried it before and the fact that my previous cleanser was so stripping (even in the monsoon!) just broke my last bit of self control before buying this. \n\nI might suggest this to someone who wears a lot of makeup, because cleansing balms are any day better than wipes or cotton pads. If you are looking for a cleansing balm, you can try the Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm, I've heard some really good reviews about that one too. But it's expensive, and your skin might not have the troubles with whiteheads that I had dealt with. \n\nThis can also be used as a super hydrating mask by leaving it on for 10 minutes, so I guess that's what I'll be doing - to my hands and feet. The pro is that if you want to really lift your spirits, you can apply this cleanser and experience the joy of a lifetime when you finally rinse it off. \n\nSo here's a long review about a product that none of you were even considering of buying, but I promised a user in my previous post, so I was guilt tripping myself to do this. Let me know if you want any other reviews about some actual products I mentioned in this post and I will be happy to help!",

    "body": "I know a lot of you guys IV your drugs, as do I (in my role playing game where my DOC's are Methamphetamine Heroin and Fentanyl HCl).  This is one of my previous harm reduction posts about proper injection technique, possible consequences, and if you read the whole thing i'll even tell you how to prep a sterile vial for your injections.  Take my advice however you would like, hopefully it will help.  I'm open to questions. \n\nFirst things first, i'm going to discuss an ideal injection technique and recommendations for not so ideal techniques.\n\n****#1 ALWAYS USE A NEW RIG/syringe every single time.  They are readily available on the internet, very cheap (1% of the price of your drugs for a huge supply) and safe to ship even to your home.****\n\n****#2  AT LEAST FILTER your gear, but ideally what you should do is use a multi-use vial.****  You can buy sterile vials in many sizes all over the internet.  The other advantage is if you make your whole bag or more at one time you can use it whenever you want on the fly with no filtering/spoon/whatever.  So you start out with a clean technique, boil some water for a while or use bacteriostatic water (you can also buy on the internet).  If you are using your own water please buy benzyl alcohol (also on the internet).  You can make your own bacteriostatic water by adding 9 units of b.a. to ~10ml's of water/solution.  This will not only keep bacteria out of your solution for a long time but BA has also been proven in certain concentrations to be bactericidal (it will kill some bacteria already present in your solution).  You want to make this BA/gear/water solution in a clean container such as a shot glass wiped down with an alcohol wipe you are just using clean technique.  \n\nAfter you make it you switch to sterile technique using a new syringe (such as a 10cc with a removable needle) remove the needle and draw up the solution, then place a sterile .22 or smaller syringe filter: https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSKjnTjvGqmit4BAUy3kj30CIHADZEg3KpT5YWgYkfQrdT7PS9R1g on the end of your syringe, put your sterile needle on it and inject the solution while filtering it into the sterile vial.  This method is MUCH cleaner, easier and safer for you than all alternatives.\n\nIf you can't do this, please at least wipe down a clean spoon with an alcohol wipe, use sterile cotton or rip off the end of a q-tip (with alcohol disinfected hands) and filter your shot through that.  \n\n****#3 WASH YOUR HANDS, clean your injection site.  Rotate injection sites as frequently as possible don't reuse injection filters such as cottons, you will get cotton fever eventually and you may get endocarditis.  The single largest reason IV drug users get pulmonary embolisms is because scar tissue/granulation breaks off and goes to the heart.****\n\n****#4 Just something to understand, many people say there is a correlation between BTH and flesh eating bacteria, BTH has been known to have it more than #4.  This is just something you should be aware of in case****\n\nIf you take these simple steps you'll dramatically decrease your chances of getting an actual infection if you miss a shot.  You will also dramatically decrease your chances of getting cotton fever and endocarditis.  With endocarditis you may already have it especially if your technique isn't clean, and you won't know until it gets very bad.  You can't \"feel\" the bacteria on your heart/valves/etc.  \n\nNow if you do miss a shot, my advice is immediately place warm moist (even hot is fine as long as you don't burn yourself) towel/compress over the area and hold slight pressure.  Keep warming it up over and over if its a towel and hopefully within a day it will reabsorb.  \n\nIt is completely normal for the area to be red and painful the next day and sometimes even for up to a week.  This does not necessarily mean you have an infection.  There are also two types of abscesses (bumps essentially) so if you have a bump that won't go away it doesn't mean you have an infection.   You can also get a sterile abscess which in time will go away.\n\nRedness at the site and pain simply means there is an inflammatory response and is part of your body dealing with the foreign substance, it is completely NORMAL.  If the inflammation is very bad or painful you can use ibuprofen in doses 800mg+ to decrease inflammation.  \n\nWatch the site if it gets very bad quickly, like redness is spreading very fast or the site is getting warm or you are getting a generalized fever then you most likely have an infection.  If none of this stuff is happening then you are most likely OK to wait it out.\n\nAntibiotics or seeing a doctor are both fine, broad spectrum stuff effective against MRSA such as bactrim will ease your mind a bit even if you don't have an infection.   However do NOT let anyone lance/cut open your wound, including primary care physicians unless you have a surgical consult and at least a WBC count to prove infection.  If it is not done correctly it can cause an even worse infection that might cost you the limb.  Most clinic docs, nurses etc won't even try this because they know if they fuck up you'll sue them but if someone cuts you open to drain it make sure its a surgeon.  Just get antibiotics from the clinic docs.\n\n****I'm also open to questions if you guys have any.****\n\nTL;DR  Lots of people IV, lots of people have terrible technique, this guide absolutely doesn't cover everything since it had to cover abscesses and missed shots as well, but it gives some basic tips.

(This is not at all sponsored, I paid for my whole shipment, I just wanted to help others out who want to hear about it.)\n\nIt's a mineral sunscreen with 9.4% zinc oxide, unscented, and labeled as \"grease-free and no-clog\". Although I know some people were disappointed that it's not a chemical formula, it was exciting for me to see because my skin is sensitive and reacts to most chemical filters.\n\nThe formula is super lightweight, and rubs in completely clear. I have white but slightly tanned skin, and there is no white cast on my skin at all. (Although I can't vouch for how it would look on darker skin tones.) Personally I've never tried a mineral sunscreen that hasn't left at least a slight white cast on my skin - this one doesn't.\n\nThe formula is originally a bit tacky, but dries down comfortably matte after 1-2 minutes. It's not drying, nor greasy. I can't yet vouch for how well it protects my skin, or if my skin will break out from it, but it's the most comfortable mineral based sunscreen I've tried.\n\nIt's $14 for 1.4 oz, and here are the inactive ingredients: Water, Dimethicone, Propylene Glycol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Sorbitan Oleate Decylglucoside Crosspolymer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycerin, Squalane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter) Extract, Polyester-5, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Coco-Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohols, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Ethyl Ferulate, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Bisabolol, Sodium Chloride, Phospholipids, Gluconolactone, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Benzoate, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Urea, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nedit: I will say that the pump on the packaging is wonky, only really works at a very specific angle, which is a bit annoying. Although another bonus I forgot to mention, is that I can apply it close to my eyes without any irritation or stinging. ",

Took out Vitamin E (Tocophersolan). And added some plant extracts, [link](http://www.rahn-group.com/en/cosmetics/product/27/). Personally I don't like those supplier research documents, not every plant extract really works, and only well published research is relevant in my opinion.

I have repurchased this moisturizer around 5 or 6 times so far, so here's my overdue review.\n\n**Texture:** gel-cream\n\n**Price:** $14.99, available in US only. Eucerin does sell another anti-redness cream in Europe, but the ingredients are different.\n\n**Experience:** While I can't speak on redness reduction, I will say that it feels really calming and soothing on my reactive skin. It is fragrance and essential oil free. The texture is pretty light, making it perfect for those with oily skin, acne, or rosacea. I am prone to acne, but this has never caused me to break out. It leaves a very soft and breathable finish on the skin. If you have extremely dry skin or use tretinoin, it may not be moisturizing enough on its own. Personally, I use sunscreen on top of this, so I appreciate that it's not too heavy. For nighttime use, I either use a generous amount of this cream or a thicker moisturizer if I'm really dry.\n\n**Ingredients:** The star ingredient is **Licochalcone A**, a licorice derivative with anti-inflammatory benefits that Eucerin uses in many of their products. Licochalcone A \"has been shown to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines, eicosanoids and reactive oxygen species in a number of human skin cells as well as to relieve post-shave irritation and UV-induced erythema in vehicle controlled studies.\" It also reduces skin damage from high energy visible light (HEVIS).\n\nSurprisingly, **panthenol** is the third ingredient, suggesting there's a high amount in the product. Typically, products with panthenol as the third ingredient contain \\~5%, give or take.\n\n*Full Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Panthenol, Caprylic-Capric-Triglyceride, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Octyldodecanol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone, Squalane, Tapioca Starch, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Myristyl Myristate, Butylene Glycol, Benzyl Alcohol, Glycyrrhiza Inflata Root Extract, Carbomer, Phenoxyethanol, Ammonium-Acryloyldimethyltaurate-VP-Copolymer, Sodium Hydroxide, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben.*",

You just need to check ingredients for things like drying alcohols, fragrance, irritating essential oils and any other irritants you know off.

        "body": "Let me dissuade some misconceptions here. Let's start with the facts:  \n1) Bacteriostatic water doesn't stop bacteria from growing, but slows the growth down (in that respect it's definitely better when compared to sterile water)  \n2) Sterile water does not get contaminated immediately. Bacteria requires certain conditions to grow. Proper storage and administration can give you those 28 days everyone refers to (a bit more details in [this reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeptideGuidesPH/comments/1l3a75g/comment/mw40bt0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button))  \n3) Bacteriostatic water contains benzyl alcohol which can destabilize or degrade certain peptides (GLP-1, i.e. semaglutide, tirzepatide are good example, but there are more)  \n4) Bacteriostatic water is very cheap to produce (some are simply using bottled purified water and mix it with benzyl alcohol - bad idea, because there is already bacteria in the water compared to sterile water), margins are huge\n\nWhat do these facts mean? Of course sellers of the peptides want you to buy bacteriostatic water (because they make a huge margins on that). The goods ones warn that it will degrade certain peptides.\n\nOur experience:  \nWe were trying to find bacteriostatic water which would meet our criteria. We didn't find it in the Philippines yet (refer to point 4 regarding the production). But there's a proper supply of hospital-grade FDA-certified sterile water. That's what we are using.\n\nMy advice:  \nIf the peptides you are using are not destabilized or degraded by benzyl alcohol and you are certain about the quality of bacteriostatic water, then use it. It will allow you to store the product for more than 28 days more safely (do not ask for how longer, there's too many factors).  \nNo matter what you use, follow the protocol (store in the fridge, desinfect, do not reuse needles), it's the only thing that 100% guarantees you those 28 days of storage.",

Obviously, the label on this limited run caught my eye, so it made for a good opportunity to try them out.  The label is certainly striking if not a little difficult to capture in a photograph.  Upon initial inspection, I thought it was a screen-printed label, but it is in fact a sticker label, only very well done.  The label is thick textured vinyl, and the \"blood splatter\" (not \"spatter\" in this case) is raised beyond that.  For those that don't know, this is a Jack The Ripper themed soap.  The blood splatter is in the shape of a nude female torso, and Jack and his knife can be seen in the negative space.\n\nThe soap concept was borne of a contest in which the winner named the soap, defined its theme, and played at least some part in outlining the scent profile.  It was inspired by five victims of Jack The Ripper.  Each note was influenced by the surroundings in which their bodies were found.  The place was Whitechapel.  The notes were to be smoke, chocolate/caramel, leather, lilac, and tobacco.  I can provide a screenshot of the original listing if there's interest.  Macabre as it may be, its creativity can't be denied.  This, alone, will offend some.  The art will offend others.  This writing is not intended to broach that aspect, but rather comment on my impressions of the overall product.\n\nThe all-black tub is your standard plastic offering.  There are no visible identifying marks for me to track down the precise model, but other than being black, they're the same as my L&L Grooming tubs in every other aspect.   The tub itself being quite flexible and the lid is fairly rigid.  I didn't measure it, but it's documented to have 150g of product, and the tub is just over half full.  The product is a pale tan color and is on the firm end of the croap spectrum.  It appears to have been pressed into the tub with the aide of a spatula or similar tool.\n\nThe fragrance off the tub was mostly smoky vetiver and leather with perhaps a very faint floral note, but not such that I could define the specific floral.  Lathered, the smoky vetiver is still forward, but it's much cleaner than say, Catie's Bubbles' \"322\".  The leather note is present, but muted throughout most of the shave.  With continued exposure during a 2+ pass shower head and face shave, the floral note also remained muted, but useful in keeping this from being a single-faceted aroma.  It's possible I detected some cocoa, but I was searching for it given the documented notes.  I did not detect tobacco.\n\nI used the 30mm APShaveCo Tuxedo knot both for a test lather the night before and for the full shave today.  I'd read some less-than-stellar reviews and was thus fully prepared for a mediocre experience.  Fortunately, I was surprised.  This beef tallow-based soap loads and performs very similarly to Barrister and Mann's white label soaps.  With that it shares the rather substantial thirst.  I learned a lot from the test lather and found it could handle even irresponsible amounts of hard water before finally collapsing. I suspect this thirst is the culprit for some of the below-average reviews.  In pushing the water, I obtained a very dense lather.  While this first go yielded a sufficiently slick lather, it wasn't quite as slick as Barrister and Mann's white label.  The residual slickness was above average, but again, not to the level of that of B&M's.  The post-shave was at least competitive with my other favored artisans, such that skipping a post-product could be entertained.  I almost never skip an aftershave, so I had planned on using Catie's Bubbles' \"322\" regardless.  I chose it for the smoky vetiver of which I'm a fan.  B&M's Hallows may have been a better \"pairing\" with the cocoa element, but it's irrelevant since the soap has little to nil lingering fragrance.  In this case, it's more about extending the experience.\n\nI've been intrigued by Phoenix and Beau's offerings for some time, now, and I'm glad to have picked this one up.  Since they're across the pond as it were, this single tub cost me $31.52 shipped to Texas.  Given that, I'm not compelled to randomly explore more of their offerings since similarly performing soaps are readily available stateside.  Additionally, I gravitate to soaps with matching splashes, and Phoenix and Beau apparently have no such offerings.  That said, when a unique theme and eye-catching label comes along again, I won't hesitate to jump on it.  Especially now that I'm confident they offer a product that performs as good as it looks.\n\n**Ingredients: Potassium Stearate, Potassium Tallowate (Bovine), Potassium Castorate, Cocos Lactate, Glycerin, Potassium Safflowerate, Potassium Shea Butterate, Lanolin, Allantoin, Tussah Silk, Vetiver EO, Sandalwood EO, Jasmine Absolute, Ylang Ylang EO, Leather FO, Chocolate FO, Benzyl Alcohol, Benzyl Benzoate, Eugenol, Farnesol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Linalool.**\n\n*Disclaimer: As previously mentioned, I paid a pretty penny for this soap and I received no incentives in exchange for my comments.  In fact, I have never met Phoenix or Beau, for that matter.*\n\n\n**Here's a gif I crudely made in an attempt to show the texture of the label:** h\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/qrzENkY.gif\n\n**More label pics:**\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/W6gFmto.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/fNT9mq3.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/BHcgArb.jpg\n\n**Dry soap pic:**  https://i.imgur.com/z13roy2.jpg\n\n**Back label:**  https://i.imgur.com/tt3O2ZM.jpg\n\n**Test lather pic:**  https://i.imgur.com/GoA0LtA.jpg\n",

Far more important and interesting is the part that he played in welfare and social reform in East London, e.g. Acts of Parliament that alleviated poverty and poor living conditions.\n\nIn some ways he (and his behaviour) was a locus for that change. The area that he lurked within was 1) extremely poor, 2) massively insanitary. The area was not properly policed and was feared by the Middle Class. It (and he) were symptoms of the issues that had riddled that part of our capital.\n\nI can see why some might find the design offensive but with a flavour for its inspiration hopefully you get a clearer idea behind it now.\n\nThanks again,\n\nKerry.",

My conditions are: 1 eq benzyl alcohol in DCM, cool in ice bath, add 1 eq PBr3, stir for an hour at 0C, quench with water, wash with bicarb, dry over Na2SO4 and concentrate. The reaction is very, very clean, but the yield is consistently in the 50-60% range. It's not a dealbreaker for my chemistry, but it's a little confusing - where's the rest of it?!  \nMy starting alcohol extracts well into DCM, so if the conversion were incomplete or if the benzyl bromide were hydrolyzing I would see it. Both products are very non-volatile, so I'm not losing it on the pump. No EDGs on the ring to make methides, and the solution stays pretty well colourless so I don't think there are side-reactions. The only thing I can think of is that the phosphite ester intermediate is going into the basic wash, but I always figured the bromide substitution was very fast. Anyone have experience with this type of reaction to shed some light?",

    "body": "Hey y'all. New guy here. A couple of days ago I read the intro to CG and went straight ahead to a store to find the right products to start using the CG method. Turns out, I had no clear idea of what to go for, since many ingredient's names had no sense for me. Were they alchohol? Silicones? Maybe both of them? Since there's no signal inside the stores, I couldn't even use the ingredients bot.\n\nI got out and checked reddit back and found the holy list of products... except there's an extreme lack of content in the italian list. Having no idea about what to buy, I went back home and started reading more on the wiki. After reading a good amount of articles, I wrote a guide for myself, so I can understand if a product should be the one I need or not. Might as well share it here.\n\nBeing the guide to myself, it's made in my native language (italian). I could make a translation, but you'd notice that it's no more than the content of a couple of wiki pages summarized, so I think it would still be a good idea to go read those, since they're surely better written than mine. Aside from that, in this guide there's the full content of the intro, with all the explanations of all the techinques added (SOTC, Plopping etc.), a list of all the main ingredients you should find on a product, understanding what is nice to have and what should be avoided (among alchohols, silicones and humettants), some dedication about porosity and how to care for your curles during sleep and when you don't wash them. This should hopefully help any italian who gets here to fill the holy list of italian products easily. There you go:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrima di cominciare, leggerai diverse volte il termine \"sgranocchiare\". Si intende tamponare gentilmente i capelli partendo dalle punte, alzando le ciocche fino alla cute, quindi strizzare.\n\nRoutine per lavare i capelli \\[le tecniche in parentesi quadra sono opzionali\\]:\n\n\\- **Reset shampoo** (solo una volta. Solfati, no siliconi) \\[se possibile V05 clarifying, ma va' bene  anche uno della linea Ultra dolce (es. quello alle 5 erbe) o Fructis (es. il Cucumber Fresh) della Garnier. (da riusare non più di una volta al mese)\n\n\\- **Balsamo** (no solfati, no siliconi). Non aver paura di abbondare. Pettina i capelli con il balsamo ancora in testa.\n\n\\- **Sciacqua** via il balsamo, continuando a massaggiare. Puoi valutare di lasciare un po' di balsamo in testa\n\n\\[S2C\\]: dopo il balsamo, aggiungi porzioni d'acqua come se fossero un prodotto. Strizza l'acqua nei capelli per sciacquare poi via il balsamo.\n\n\\- Prendi molto **gel** (no solfati, no siliconi, no alcol) e usalo sui capelli ancora bagnati\n\n\\- **Asciuga** \"sgranocchiando\" con una maglietta in cotone o asciugamano in microfibra. Asciuga col diffusore da lontano, temperatura media.\n\nPer aumentare il volume, puoi mettere dei fermagli sulle radici dei capelli.\n\n\\[Plopping\\]: appoggia una maglietta in cotone su un mobile. Appoggia la fronte sulla maglietta. Lega la maglietta attorno alla testa e solleva nuovamente la testa.\n\nDopo 10 minuti, leva la maglietta e usala per asciugare \"sgranocchiando\" i capelli.\n\n\\- **A capelli asciutti**. \"sgranocchia via\" la \"croccantezza\" causata dal gel, con le mani\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[SOTC\\]: se i capelli risultano crespi, puoi aggiungere un olio, massaggiando dalla punta verso la radice, quando i capelli sono perfettamente asciutti.\n\n\\[Super Soaker\\]: usa tutti i prodotti insieme. Sciacqua usando poca acqua alla volta.\n\n\\[Finger coiling\\]: definisci i ricci applicando il prodotto riccio per riccio. Avvolgilo intorno alle dita e ripeti con il riccio successivo.\n\n\\[LOC\\]: utile sui ricci annodati. Prevede l'utilizzo di balsamo, olio e crema, nell'ordine che ho scritto\n\n\\[Rake & Shake\\]:  dividi i capelli in ciocche e applica i prodotti sulle lunghezze pettinando i capelli con le dita. Una volta alle punte, afferra la  ciocca e agitala per \"riattivare\" i ricci.\n\n\\[Shingling\\]: dividi la testa in 5-6 sezioni e focalizzati su una alla volta, applicando il prodotto aiutandoti col pettine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Alcol:**\n\nAlcuni alcol sono totalmente da evitare (Ethanol alcohol, Ethyl alcohol, Propanol alcohol, Alcohol denat., Isopropyl alcohol, Isopropanol alcohol, Benzyl alcohol)\n\nAltri sono permessi, in quanto non causano danni. Anzi, possono addirittura portare benefici (Cetyl alcohol, Cetearyl alcohol, Stearyl alcohol, Lauryl alcohol)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Siliconi:**\n\nSon divisi in categorie. Alcuni di questi possono essere presenti senza problemi, altri meno perchè possono accumularsi. Oltre ad accumularsi, comunque, portano benefici vari.\n\n1. Evaporativi. Evaporano nel giro di due ore al massimo, quindi non si accumulano.\n\n\\- Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane, Hexamethyldisiloxane, Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, cyclomethicone (quest’ultimo e altri ciclo-XXX-silosani non sono solubili in acqua, ma evaporano comunque rapidamente, quindi non sono un problema)\n\n2) Facili da lavare. Non evaporano e possono essere presenti nel balsamo. Alcuni di questi, però, possono essere resistenti all'acqua (specie se calda) e potrebbero richiedere uno shampoo coi solfati perchè vengano rimossi.\n\n\\- Methicone e Dimethicone e Dimethicone copolyol (buoni se non hanno ingredienti cationici),silica, silequioxanes, siloxysilicates (es. diisostearoyl trimethylolpropane siloxysilicate) (questi sono pesanti),diphenyl dimethicone, dimethiconol, disiloxane, Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane, Lauryl methicone copolyol, Phenyltrimethicone, Trisiloxane\n\n3) Difficili da lavare, ma non si accumulano. Si accumula solo in un primo strato. Gli strati successivi eliminano i precedenti, quindi l’accumulo non è troppo. È comunque meglio evitarli, se possibile.\n\nDimethicone crosspolymer, Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer, Aminopropyltriethoxysilane, Aminopropyl Dimethicone (senza surfatante cationico), Amodimethicone (senza surfatante cationico), Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone, Dimethicone, Dimethicone PEG/PPG, o -dimethylsiloxane, in presenza di un altro catione polimerico come bromuri, cloruri o polyquaterni.\n\n4) Difficili da lavare, si accumulano. Da evitare totalmente. Per essere rimossi si richiede l’uso ripetuto di shampoo con solfati.\n\nBehenoxy dimethicone, Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone, Cetyl dimethicone, Cetearyl methicone, Dimethiconol hydroxystearate, Polysilicone-18 Cetyl Phosphate, Propyl Dimethicone, Stearoxy dimethicone, Stearyl dimethicone, Stearyl methicone Trimethylsiylamodimethicone\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Umettanti:**\n\nDa evitare in zone calde e umide, in quanto tendono ad assorbire troppo e rendere i capelli troppo secchi.\n\nGlycerin, Propylene Glycol, Honey, Agave nectar, Sorbitol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed silk protein, Fructose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Come trattare i ricci nei giorni in cui non li lavi:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dormi con i capelli avvolti** in una sciarpa in seta, oppure legali in modo da formare una coda partendo dalla cima della testa (metodo ananas)\n\nSe hai i capelli molto lunghi, puoi fare trecce.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ogni giorno** puoi trattare i tuoi capelli in più possibili modi, a seconda dell'umidità dell'ambiente in cui vivi e la porosità dei ricci:\n\n0) Bagna completamente i capelli, aggiungi un po' di balsamo (eventualmente S2C) e gel. Praticamente lavali di nuovo.\n\n1. Usa uno spray per spruzzare il balsamo (o anche solo acqua) per inumidire, poi \"sgranocchia\" un po' i ricci.\n2. Bagnati le mani con gel diluito, oppure balsamo diluito, oppure anche solo acqua, e \"sgranocchia\"\n3. Valido se hai tempo per asciugarti bene e se hai capelli corti; prendi l'acqua con le mani e \"sgranocchia\" le punte, eventualmente aggiungendo un po' di gel, poi asciuga (eventualmente plopping)\n4. Cerca una sezione particolarmente crespa, bagna le mani, aggiungi una goccia di gel e applicalo sulla sezione (eventualmente finger coiling). \"Sgranocchia\" tutti i ricci un po' in generale.\n5. Agita i ricci e \"sgranocchia\" mentre sei a testa in giù. Puoi anche incasinare i capelli un po' ma evita di far passare le dita lungo i ricci o rischi di fare un disastro.\n\nIn particolare, quando fai attività sportiva, è una buona idea usare un po' di balsamo, ed eventualmente sostituire il gel con creme per ricci.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Porosità:**\n\nI capelli possono in genere avere bassa, media o alta porosità.\n\nQuesti due link sono i modi migliori per identificare la porosità dei capelli: [https://www.curlsbot.com/porosity/](https://www.curlsbot.com/porosity/)\n\nOppure  [http://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2012/06/hair-porosity-how-to-measure-sort-of.html](http://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2012/06/hair-porosity-how-to-measure-sort-of.html)\n\nBassa porosità:\n\nI capelli impiegano più di 2 secondi a bagnarsi, anche sotto il getto diretto dell'acqua\n\nL'acqua rimane sopra i capelli invece che bagnarli\n\nI prodotti non vengono ben assorbiti, perciò si accumulano di più in mezzo ai capelli\n\nI capelli impiegano molto a seccarsi\n\nI capelli sono più resistenti a trattamenti chimici (come il colore)\n\n\\- Lavali sempre con acqua calda\n\n\\- Usa gli heating cap\n\n\\- Metti i capelli in una cuffietta per la doccia in plastica e usa un asciugamano riscaldato\n\n\\- Usa prodotti più leggeri, specialmente se usi gli oli, in quanto tenderanno ad appesantire molto i capelli. (Oli leggeri: jojoba, argan/argania, grapeseed/semi d'uva, sunflower/girasole, sweet almond/mandorle dolci). Eventualmente non usare affatto gli oli.\n\n\\- Usa con una certa regolarità un prodotto che elimini gli accumuli sui capelli. Il prodotto dev'essere un po' aggressivo ma non quanto un comunque shampoo.\n\nAlta porosità:\n\nSi bagnano immediatamente anche con poca acqua\n\nI capelli assorbono rapidamente qualunque cosa\n\nI capelli si asciugano velocemente dopo essere stati lavati\n\nAccettano facilmente prodotti chimici (come il colore), ma possono espellerlo altrettanto facilmente.\n\nPossono sembrare pesanti e secchi\n\nSi annodano facilmente\n\nTendono a essere crespi\n\n\\- Usa oli pesanti (castor/ricino, olive, coconut/cocco, flax/lino, hemp/canapa, jamaican black castor/ricino nero giamaicano) e oli che chiudono le cuticole.\n\n\\- Usa settimanalmente una maschera per capelli\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Altre generalità:**\n\nGli ingredienti principali di cui tenere conto sono: solfati, siliconi, polyquats, umettanti cocco. proteine, (in genere i capelli tendono ad accettare o rifiutare gli ultimi due tipi di ingredienti). Evita il calore diretto e i prodotti Pantene.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConsigli da u/GIUlianab\n\nSe vuoi provare a seguire il CG per adesso prova a guardare tra i prodotti Omia e de I Provenzali, dovrebbero avere almeno balsami e maschere senza  siliconi (le maschere della Omia sono buone) e shampoo senza solfati e siliconi. Io personalmente sconsiglio il co-washing, specialmente se  vivi in un luogo con acqua molto dura. Usare uno shampoo delicato (senza solfati o con questi in basso nella lista degli ingredienti, in quanto dovrebbe indicarne una bassa quantità) è sempre meglio secondo me.\n\nLa Biopoint di recente ha lanciato una linea senza siliconi, solfati e  parabeni, se la trovi ed è nel tuo budget puoi provarla, la Garnier ha lanciato le maschere hair food (solo non lasciarle agire per un minuto, non fanno una cippa in un minuto) e se non sbaglio il balsamo Splend'Or è  CG. \n\nQuello che per me ha funzionato davvero è stato usare una vecchia  magliette di cotone per asciugare e plopping, mettere una stoffa di raso sopra il mio cuscino quando dormo, dormire con \"l'ananas\", lo S2C, lo  scrunching e applicare tutti i prodotti sui capelli gocciolanti.",

The sunscreen smell is very present (which I've always disliked) but goes away after a few minutes. \n\nIt does not leave your face as dewy as other sunscreens, it is not drying, a bit moisturizing, and does not pill. Really, I can't say anything against this sunscreen other than high price. Other than that, you can quite feel it on your face, which is to be expected from most sunscreens. It's a tube with a weird applicator, but it's not a deal-breaker. As opposed to the Cicadiane, the UVAPF is not disclosed, but since the INCI are so similar, it should be around 38.\n\n[Yves rocher Soin Anti-Âge SPF 50+:](https://www.yves-rocher.fr/corps-et-douche/soin-solaire/protection-solaire/soin-anti-age-protection-fps-50-/p/yr.R57438) AQUA (Eau) DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE, PHENOXYETHYL CAPRYLATE, C12-15 ALKYL BENZOATE, DIBUTYL ADIPATE, DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, METHYLPROPANEDIOL, BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE, PHENYLBENZIMIDAZOLE SULFONIC ACID, DIMETHICONE, ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE, TROMETHAMINE VP/EICOSENE COPOLYMER, PEG-100 STEARATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, SODIUM STEAROYL GLUTAMATE, STEARYL ALCOHOL, ERYNGIUM MARITIMUM EXTRACT (Extrait D'Etoile Des Dunes), ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, GLYCERIN, XANTHAN GUM (Gomme De Xanthane), PARFUM, BENZYL ALCOHOL, ISOEUGENOL, TOCOPHEROL\n\n**-> Uvinul A plus, Tinosorb S, Ensulizole, Uvinul T 150**\n\nThe Trio White would have been my HG (I'm tired of looking for a sunscreen), had I not decided to buy Yves Rocher's one to try since it's -45% on their website. I'm not against fragrance (especially if it's masking sunscreen smell), and the fragrance is very much pleasant and faint; not overbearing at all.\n\nApplication is great, it's an airless pump which are vastly superior to tubes, and greatest of all... it gives my skin a very healthy look in a way. Most sunscreens give me a greasy-ish look. As opposed to the Trio White, I don't feel it at all on my skin. Despite the fragrance, the formulation is top notch. I know fragrance + UV exposure = bad, but I'm kinda willing to take the risk, and will stop if my skin ever comes to react badly.\n\nAnyway, thanks to this, my search for a face sunscreen has ended. \nIf this sunscreen is not in sales, it's around 21€, which depending on where you buy the Trio White, can be more expensive than the Trio White (which I bought for 17€).\n\nFinally, I'm pretty sure than Yves Rocher is more accessible than Noreva around Europe.\n\nThe marketing is funny though: \"made to meet women's highest standards\". I'm a man, please.",

    "body": "Since the different types seem to respond differently, I should say that I have mild to moderate type 2. Meaning, as long as I basically do nothing to my skin, then I only have a little redness and maybe an inflammatory bump here or there. I flush when I exercise or am flustered, but it goes away after an hour or less. However, when I was using face wash, actives, and/or moisturizers, even really gentle or well formulated ones, then my face was always covered in red bumps with bad texture issues.\n\n**Ok, so now I want to talk about topical antivirals- namely Abreva.** Basically I discovered that Abreva- a cold sore cream- completely heals my skin in like a day. While my skin is mostly okay, if I do get bold and cause a flare up with a new product I just put this stuff on and the next day everything is pretty much completely clear. When I use it regularly my skin is absolutely flawless, glowing, moisturized and healthy looking.\n\nIt was so effective that at first I worried there was some kind of steroid in it, but I’ve researched this possibility and it seems that it doesn’t contain any, and I wouldn’t say that I experience any kind of rebound after stopping it so it must be something about the antiviral properties of the cream. I haven’t found anyone with the same experience, though I have read several posts about people going on oral antivirals for cold sores/COVID and finding that their rosacea was significantly improved and in some cases they seemed to have cured it- or at least they reported back sometime later saying that their symptoms still hadn’t return despite ceasing the viral treatment.\n\nAll I know is that nothing, NOTHING, has made my skin more beautiful and tolerant of products than when I put Abreva on it. It even seems that things which normally give me reactions are okay if I layer it with the abreva. And I really can't emphasize enough how much my skin hates everything so this in itself is a miracle. I also have acne prone skin so it seems that whenever I find something that doesn't seem to cause little pustules or bumps I eventually get deeper cystic like pimples.\n\nThe only reason I don’t use it everyday is because up until two days ago I was still skeptical that there could be some kind of steroid cream or something because my skin just looked suspiciously great after using it. Azelaic acid worked for me, but it dries my skin out and you need an RX for it where I live, and I don’t like the formulations of the OTC ones available to me due to all the stupid irritating extracts they add to try and get fancy. This abreva stuff though? No dryness, in fact it makes my skin so hydrated and supple! It truly is a miracle cream and once I get back into a country that sells it, I’m going to make it my daily treatment cream- unless someone has any info on why that might be a bad idea of course! But again I did some research as far as toxicology and all of that goes, it should be safe to use on your whole face consistently.\n\nIt’s not cost effective, it’s about 25$ for two tiny tubes. Though two tubes would last me about 3 weeks of full face application, so 35$ a month for something that gives me the best skin of my life, and requires no doctors appointment, isn’t too bad.\n\n**Second thing that is pretty effective is putting silicone scar tape on any kind of skin inflammation**. This has been life changing for actual acne. Every now and then I get a deep pimple, and if I put this on the day I notice a little bit of redness and inflammation forming, it does not come to head. Like, without fail it will be skin colored and smooth within 24 hours if it’s new, and maybe 48 hours if it was already a little more formed. I get scars when I get pimples so this has been so helpful, I think I have had maybe one pimple come to head in the past year, only because I didn't get to it in time (vs. the usual 10 or 11 big ones). I’ve tried pimple patches and I found them ineffective, they don’t actually prevent the pimple from forming and when I put them on already formed pimples they actually seem to make PIE and inflammation hang around much longer, even if the “head” or white part gets sucked out, the red inflammation seems to stay longer.\n\nThe cool part though is that it works for any kind of T2 rosacea irritation too, all around my skin just looks better on the areas that I apply the tape to, like smoother and healthier almost? For Rosacea type bumps/pustules you don't need to get to it in advance, literally just place the tape on it whenever you notice a flare and are in private and leave it on for as long as you can (i.e. however long you are staying inside your house because it looks silly to have tape all over your face ofc). You should see a substantial difference in the redness and swelling in the bumps which were under the silicone patch. It is extremely gentle to remove, it just rolls right off and has never caused any irritation, but that could be different for Type 1 people- not sure.\n\nThere's two theories at play. One is that the silicone provides an artificial barrier so that the skin can do its thing and heal itself while protected. Another is that silicones kills mites via suffocation, so it could be related to something with the Demodex mites as well! These are my explanations for why it takes away my rosacea bumps so easily, but I still am not sure why it works like voodoo magic at preventing deeper pimples from forming. Like it literally erases any trace of it within a day. Very cost effective too- 13 bucks for a roll that lasts forever if you just cut it into little pieces to use as a spot treatment.\n\n**Okay and finally an observation that I'd love to hear some ideas on if you have any**\n\nSomething I wanted to mention is that my skin reacts to almost every skincare product, but can tolerate basically any makeup product provided that it’s not a “skin care and makeup in one” type of product. One theory is that part of the reason why our skin reacts to everything is that due to a damaged barrier, things sink deeper than they’re meant to and this causes the inflammation that leads to bumps, redness and pustules. I think the fact that almost all makeup is fine, but almost all skincare is not supports that theory. This is because with makeup products, they are specifically formulated to not penetrate deeply because that would clog our pores. Whereas skincare products contain ingredients that cause the product to penetrate more. So, if I can handle most ingredients in formulas designed to stay superficial, yet suddenly have major issues with those same ingredients when they’re formulated to go deeper, then perhaps it is the fact that they are penetrating too deeply, rather than it being the case that my skin just doesn’t like a million different chemicals. Because again, if it were the chemicals themselves then I should be seeing the same reaction with makeup that I do with skincare. Of course, there are certain harsh chemicals that my skin hates regardless of if it's in makeup or skincare (e.g. salicylic acid), but those are the obvious ones. It doesn't make sense that I am reacting to such gentle skincare formulas with no obvious triggers, yet I can sleep in some dollar store foundation and have my skin look great. There's something about the penetration vs. sitting on top of the skin that's important here.\n\nOne inference from this is that it’s probably particularly helpful for people with type 2 rosacea to wait a minimum of 15 minutes after wetting their face before they apply their skincare products. This is because products are known to penetrate much deeper when skin is wet, and skin takes about 15 minutes to fully dry- it’s the main reason why you’re not supposed to put retinoids on too soon after washing, because they penetrate too deeply and then cause unnecessary irritation.\n\nSo the takeaways are:\n\ni) Abreva is a miracle cream for T2 rosacea, and if you don’t tolerate any moisturizers what so ever I highly recommend trying it out. Like if you are someone who has “tried every moisturizer with no luck”, and I know there’s a lot on here, then RUN to the store and get Abreva. Don’t think of it as a moisturizer, think of it as a gentle rosacea active that will also moisturize your skin.\n\nii)  Silicone scar tape is voodoo magic for early stage pimples and basically all kinds of blemishes, and if you’re having a T2 flare you should definitely try it. I will sometimes put abreva on first and then a silicone patch if there’s an area that is particularly inflamed and I wake up to calm skin every time.\n\nAnd finally, the penetration of products might be a key factor for those whose skin reacts to \\*everything\\*. I would love to hear more thoughts on this last point or if anyone has any information that could help us connect more dots. For example, after realizing this I’ve found that I’m more likely to tolerate products who contain contain propylene glycol (a penetration enhancer) near the first half of the ingredient list if I’m a rare and usually short-lived phase where my skin lets me use moisturizer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update:** I didn't realize Docosanol, the active ingredient in Abreva was benzyl alcohol. After researching it with this name it appears that there are clear antiparasitic properties, which would explain why it's effective for Rosacea! \"Benzyl alcohol is thought to inhibit lice from closing their respiratory spiracles, allowing the lotion to obstruct the spiracles and causing the lice to asphyxiate\".

I found this, about the active ingredient of Abreva:\n\n“1-Docosanol, also known as behenyl alcohol, is a saturated fatty alcohol containing 22 carbon atoms, used traditionally as an emollient, emulsifier, and thickener in cosmetics. Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).”\n\n It works by blocking the virus that causes the cold sores (herpes simplex) from entering the healthy skin cells and growing in number.\n\nDocosanol is an aliphatic alcohol that inhibits fusion between the plasma membrane and the HSV envelope, thereby preventing viral entry into cells and viral replication.\n\nThe drug is a chemical compound known as behenyl alcohol with no direct viricidal activity. Instead, docosanol exerts its action by modulating the host cell to inhibit fusion of lipid-enveloped viruses with the plasma membrane; thereby, interfering with viral entry into the target cells.\n\nAbreva ingredients:\n\nIngredients : Docosanol (10%). Inactive Ingredients: Benzyl Alcohol, Light Mineral Oil, Propylene Glycol, Purified Water, Sucrose Distearate, Sucrose Stearate.\n\nSo it looks like it may be acting as a barrier cream like you said. I am sort of curious to see what would happen if you put Abreva on half of your face and pure petroleum jelly (or Cerave healing ointment) on the other.",

I am sure about half of the people who have read this are applying or searching to get this Abreva cream - I know I would if it was available where I live :)\n\nSo, does this post have any basis, did someone try it to provide experience?\n\nI am very into theories in general. If your post has any truth, then either docosanol may randomly be another possible ingredient for rosacea recession (perhaps because it forms a protective layer? there is behenyl alcohol ingredient in some of my face creams btw), either this could mean that whatever causes rosacea may have a connection to the herpes virus (I for one thing was getting cold sores before developing rosacea, and also was infected with chickenpox as a toddler-which relates to another type of herpes. Come to think of it... chickenpox also gave me papules and pustules back then! lol).\n\nAs for silicone scar tape, I get that silicone may help to block moisture loss and therefore keep the skin hydrated, but on the other hand it also traps heat... so I don't understand how trapped heat in the skin may help rosacea type 2 symptoms... If it is a matter of mite suffocation, then any kind of tape would have the same result, right?\n\nYour penetration argument does have a point. I personally don't use make up often at least not all over my face so I can't quite relate, but I think I have read some people in here have makeup products that flare them. Penetration is definitely higher with wet skin, and some actives should never be applied on wet skin. \n\nJust a question: what made you try a cold sore cream on a flare spot? Did you happen to have a bump near the cold sore, or was it something else?",

One day I decided to try the Cookies and Leather scent, I noticed after a few days that I wasn't getting my usual runny nose etc and I actually felt good.  \nSo I looked at the back of the can and the ingredients and compared it to a can of Lynx Africa - low and behold the Cookies and Leather scent had no Citral in the ingredients.  \nInterestingly enough as far as I know this is the only Lynx without Citral in the ingredients.\n\nAnyway so I looked up Citral and where it's from - Citrus peel oil!!  \nThe penny dropped when I thought about getting the tingly mouth from eating oranges - my case solved!\n\nJust to point out there is another Citrus based ingredient in Fragrances products and that is Limonene, which is basically the core of Citrus fruits.  \nSo you could be allergic to both or in my case just the Citral (peel oil) not the fruit.",

If that helps you.“\n\n[**https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic\\_cigarette/comments/f0ya9/what\\_is\\_your\\_all\\_day\\_vape/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/f0ya9/what_is_your_all_day_vape/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce upon a time there was a world where there was no strawberry menthol or cactus, dragon fruit, grape, coolada, meringue, raspberry, strawberry, liquid with tits and its own Youtube channel with cap and raffle. At that time the Liquids had sonorous names like: Tobacco, cigar, pipe or menthol (Dekang, 2007).\n\nI was allowed to try some things from that time. I have tried many (one hundred) \"tobacco\" flavours. I know why everyone and their cat hate tobacco flavors.\n\nMy first vape contained vanilla or menthol, but only a RY4 really tasted good.\n\nThere's hardly a RY4 that doesn't taste, many are great, some boring, but rarely one is unstoppable.  Since 2007, the taste of tobacco, vanilla and caramel has helped smokers to switch to the e-cigarette.\n\n \n\nLudo Timmermans from the Netherlands, once an employee of the Ruyan Group (today: Dragonite) whose boss Hon Lik is considered the inventor of today's e-cigarette, began to develop his own devices: Janty Kissbox I (2008), Janty eGo (2009) (\"Freud discovered the ego, but Janty perfected it\"), Janty Kuwako (2012), Janty MiD (2013), but this is about the RY4 he created.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe \"boss of Dekang\", \"a good friend\" of Ludo, invited him to a laboratory tour. He stayed there for a week and wanted to create the Liquid you can never get enough of. He oriented himself on his favorite taste (tobacco) of the Ruyan e-cigarette and finished the \"Ruyan blend #4\" on a Sunday afternoon, after four hours of work in the fourth version and some fine-tuning. \n\n \n\n„*Ludo gave me permission to post this.*\n\n*Janty/Ruyan first introduced the RY4 in The Netherlands in August of 2007.*\n\n*International Vaporizer Society - Elektrische sigaret • Toon onderwerp - \\*\\*\\* NIEUW - JANTY LIQUID \\*\\*\\**\n\n*Ludo and a chemist went to the Dekang lab and tried to create the typical Ruyan flavor, based on the original Ruyan cigarette, Ludo loved that taste, at the time that was the only flavor available.*\n\n*(tobacco flavors)*\n\n*They attempted several times to make the flavor, so 1st try, 2nd try, all the way up to the 4th try.*\n\n*After the 4th try, and a couple of changes, Ludo liked the flavor, however at the same time it was not really the Ruyan cigarette flavor, so he asked them to make the flavor for Janty and name it Ruyan#4.*\n\n*Ludo knew that THIS was the taste that would make it in the e-cig world.*\n\n*Ludo was a heavy smoker and THAT taste knocked him off of his chair. LOL.*\n\n*Ludo knew that with vanilla and carmel and a couple of other ingredients, which he will not name, mix those up and you will get a flavor that will never get old, and you can use that basis to build other flavors.*\n\n*Later on Ludo asked them to change the name to RY4 because they found that*\n\n*1. the taste really had nothing to do with Ruyan and*\n\n*2. it was not logical to use a brand name, even though it was the original plan to simply create the Ruyan flavor.*\n\n*Back then, in 2007, it really was the beginning of the e-cig. Ludo really had no idea of the Chinese mentality.*\n\n*It was all so innocent and they were so excited -sigh-.*  \n\n*Ludo thought they were the only ones and that this flavor was theirs.*\n\n*Ludo later found out that Dekang gave the flavor away, now Ludo knows that's typical for the Chinese.*  \n\n*Ludo can not judge the story about the chemist who disappeared, that's an internal situation.“*\n\n[https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/threads/the-really-big-ry4-roundup-long.193327/page-16#post-3638187](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/threads/the-really-big-ry4-roundup-long.193327/page-16#post-3638187)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt may have consisted of the following ingredients:\n\n [http://eu.jantyworld.com/index.php?option=com\\_content&view=article&id=79](http://eu.jantyworld.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=79)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProtovanol  11,0%\n\nEthanol 5,0%\n\nVanillin 4,5%\n\nVanilla tincture 14%\n\nRose oil 1,9%\n\nBenzyl alcohol 1,8%\n\n2-methylbutyric acid 0,8%\n\n2-hydroxy-3-methylcyclopent-2-enone 0,7%\n\n2-methylbutyraldehyde 0,3%\n\nPiperonal 1,7%\n\nUndecan-4-olide 0,3%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhether this is really the holy grail, the original formula of the very first RY4, is doubtful, the recipe is a criminal story, but I will not go into it further.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAccording to today's knowledge, Dekang produced the same RY4 Ludo produced for Janty until May 2010.

    "body": "# Introduction\n\n  \nL-phenylacetylcarbinol is a compound used in the synthesis of ephedrine,  itself used as a precursor to amphetamines. Industrially, it is synthesized by the aerobic fermentation of benzaldehyde by baker's yeast  (S. cerevisiae/SC). While the process is quite simple, it can require a bit of equipment and knowledge, especially when talking about maintaining sterile cultures and proper growth conditions. I will therefore explain two methods of different sophistication for the production of L-PAC through biotransformation. The growth medium should  be sterilized by autoclaving before use.  \n\n\n# First method:\n\n  \nOne might describe this technique as \"sloppy but easy\". It requires less equipment, is easier, but is also less effective and will result in lower yields.  \n \n\n**Procedure:**  \nIn 500ml of sterile 0.1M pH 6 citrate buffer add 44g of yeast and 55g of glucose. Place in a water bath heated at 30°C. Incubate for 40/50 minutes.  \nAdd benzaldehyde (25 mmol) in 5 mL ethanol and acetaldehyde (25 mmol). Incubate for 60 minutes.  \nFilter through Celite.  \nExtract with 3\\*100 ml ethyl acetate. Break emulsion using saturated  Sodium Chloride solution, dry over anhydrous sodium sulfate, evaporate solvent. This is your L-PAC.  \n \n\n**Explanations:**  \nCitrate buffer: this is used to maintain a stable pH, as the growth of  the cell will lower it overtime (not good). To prepare this buffer, follow the procedures given by this calculator: [https://www.aatbio.com/resources/buffer-preparations-and-recipes/citrate-buffer-ph-3-to-6-2](https://www.aatbio.com/resources/buffer-preparations-and-recipes/citrate-buffer-ph-3-to-6-2) . Don't forget to change the pH to 6.  \nTemperature: allows higher metabolic activity of the yeast.  \nEthanol: used to dissolve the benzaldehyde and acetaldehyde and increases their bioavailability.  \nAcetaldehyde: used as hydrogen acceptor instead of benzaldehyde, thus limiting the production of benzyl alcohol.  \n \n\nThis is an easy procedure that almost anyone can follow after a bit of reading on standard sterile techniques, but gives lower yields than the other one (between 20 to 40%). It can be improved either by having  better aeration using either orbital shaking at 150 rpm or by pumping sterile air into the medium, with 1L of air per liter of medium per minute, or by immobilizing the cells in alginate beads. You can look this up on youtube, it's very easy to do, and can increase yields significantly.  \n \n\n# Second method:\n\n  \nThis protocol is more advanced, but can increase yields up to 60 or 70%  if done correctly. It will however require more material. Even though it isn't perfect, it is way better.  \nThis method was designed for the yeast Candida utilis instead of S.  cerevisiae. You can use SC instead but you will see a decrease in  yields. You can buy C. utilis here: [https://www.biomall.in/product/candida-utilis-atcc-9950-0779p-0779p](https://www.biomall.in/product/candida-utilis-atcc-9950-0779p-0779p)  \n \n\n**Procedure**  \nThe growth medium is composed of 10g/L urea (brings nitrogen), 10g/L  MgSO4 (brings magnesium and sulfur) and between 50 to 70g/L of sugar using molasses. Dissolve in adequate volume of 0.1M pH 6 citrate buffer.  \nThe day before, inoculate a starting culture of yeast and incubate at 30°C overnight.  \nRead optical density (absorbance) at 595nm. Inoculate your fermentation reactor with 15% v/v of your starting culture adjusted to 0.4 OD. Example:to inoculate a 1L container, if OD was measured at 0.2, add  300mL to 700mL. If OD is already at 0.4, add 150mL to 850mL etc...  (240x106 cells/ml in the inoculum, see explanations) . Don't forget to calibrate your spectrophotometer with the culture medium.\nIncubate at 30°C with either orbital shaking at 150 rpm or pumping sterile air at 1 v/v/min rate. If pumping air, you might want to add some slow stirring in there.  \nIncubate until OD reaches between 0.3 and 0.4. This should take between 4 to 6 hours, can be less or more. Check OD every 30 minutes until you reach the desired value.  \nThe addition of benzaldehyde is done in multiple doses. For a 50mL culture, the volumes are 68, 62, 56, 50, 43, 37, 31, 25. Add an equivalent volume of  acetaldehyde at the same time. Wait one hour between each addition.  \nExtract using 1:2 toluene/medium v/v, evaporate.  \n \n\n**Explanation:**  \nOptical density: it is measured using a spectrophotometer. Here we read absorbance at 595nm, which is proportional to the number of cells in solution. As a rule of thumb, remember 0.1 OD=60x10\\^6 cells/mL  \n \n\n**General notes:**  \nFor aeration, on a small scale orbital shaking at 150 rpm is better. On a larger scale, you will need to bubble air passed through a filter.  \nIn the second protocol, the addition of benzaldehyde is done in multiple doses to increase yields. This can be further improved by continuously injecting benzaldehyde in decreasing rate, but this is complex to do in an amateur setting.  \nSubstituted benzaldehydes can be used and will yield the corresponding L-PAC analog.  \nFinally, you can borrow some element of method 2 and incorporate them in  method 1 in order to customize the experimental design to your liking.  Be aware that other strains and species can be used, greatly increasing  yields. See \"production of L-phenyl Acetyl Carbinol (L-PAC) by different  novel strains of yeasts in molasses and sugar cane juice as production  medium\" by Ravi et al for more info.",

Please still be careful if you have sensitivities/allergies.\n\n--\n\nFor more information on some of the ingredients mentioned, here are some scholarly articles (yeah, we're doing it /r/skincareaddiction style up in here!)\n\n[Disodium EDTA](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12396676)\n\n[Butylated Hydroxytoluene - BHT](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12396675)\n\n[Dimethicone](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14555417)\n\n--\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nAll links to cosDNA are the most recent entry for each item, where possible, to account for formula changes. Whether these ingredient lists truly reflect what's in the products, I cannot say.\n\nI know that some people will have received completely different products in the bag, so this may not completely apply to all of you. Still, I think this is a great start if you're wondering about the safety of your products.\n\nHowever, this *is* just a starting point. I encourage you all to not just read my little TL;DR's but to visit the results linked and scan for any known allergies or sensitivities. Please, don't just take my word that things will be safe because skincare is such a personal thing, and some items that work well with my skin may be nightmare fuel for yours.\n\nConsidering just how many products were missing from the cosDNA database, I've decided that I'll be working toward adding them. Of course, I shall be updating this post with links. If I myself have missed a product in this post, feel free to point it out - taking note that the coupon products were left out on purpose.\n\n--\n\n*Thank you to everybody for taking the time to read all this. Happy and safe skin-caring!*",

    "body": "I subscribed to [GOOP.com](http://www.goop.com/) years ago and loved it but I stopped reading a while ago because some of Gwenyth Paltrow's posts are repetitive and boring. \n\nA few days ago, Gwenyth released, exclusively for Goop, - [Tammy Fender Limited Edition Quintessential Serum and Epi-Peel Duo](http://www.goop.com/shop/tammy-fender-serum-and-epi-peel-duo.html) ... For $395!\n\n---\n\nIngredients:\n\n[Epi-Peel](http://store.tammyfender.com/products/Epi%252dPeel-%7C-Formula-No.-E%252d517-%281.9-oz%29.html): '*An award-winning facial-in-a-jar, this ultimate multi-tasker merits a permanent place in every beauty routine.*'\n\nAqueous Extracts of Hibiscus Sabdariffa, Rose Hips, Orange Peel, Lemongrass, Lemon Peel, Green Tea Leaf, Beeswax PEG-8, Cetearyl Alcohol (and) Ceteh 20 (Plant Source), Sunflower Seed Oil, Grape Seed Oil, Kaolin Clay, Rosemary Extract, Oat Extract, Essential Oils of Lavender, Spearmint and Rosemary, Zantham Gum (Plant Source), Glycerine, Oleoresin (Rosemary), Soybean Oil, Dehydroacetic Acid (and) Benzyl Alcohol (Natural Food Grade Preservative System) \n\n\n[Quintessential Serum](http://store.tammyfender.com/products/Quintessential-Serum-%7C-Formula-No.-QS%252d9-%281-oz%29.html): '*This all-in-one age-defying superstar is our most sought after product – delivering immediate nutrition, radiance and cell renewal.*' \n\nBrassica Campestris and Aleutrities Fordi Oil (*They are a polymer derived of possibly [turnip mustard oil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassica_rapa) and something else which I wasn't not able to find any information on aleutrities fordi*), Rose Hip Seed Oil, Sunflower Seed Oil, Avocado Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Pure essential oils of Rose, Frankincense, Chamomile, Oleoresin. \n\n---\n\nHere's the major crunch of Tammy Fender's Quintessential serum for less.\n\nI wasn't able to find any turnip mustard oil online but apparently it is a popular cooking oil in Indian cuisine and some E-articles said that it is actually canola oil. Maybe it is but maybe it is not. I didn't include here because the information on turnip mustard oil is very limited.\n\n[Rose Hip Seed Oil](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/3987807/4064857.htm) - 1 oz / $5.65 \n\n[Sunflower Seed Oil](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/3987807/3778998.htm) - 1 oz / $4.10\n\n[Avocado Oil](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/3987807/3777612.htm) - 2 oz / $4.35\n\n[Evening Primrose Oil](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/3987807/7037279.htm) - 1 oz / $4.45 \n\n[Rose EO](http://www.edenbotanicals.com/products/essential-oils-pure-therapeutic-grade/essential-oils-q-r/rose-absolute-bulgaria.html) - 1/8 oz / $29 \n\n[Frankincense EO](http://www.edenbotanicals.com/products/essential-oils-pure-therapeutic-grade/essential-oils-e-g/frankincense-somalia.html) - 1/4 oz / $7\n\n[Chamomile EO](http://www.edenbotanicals.com/products/essential-oils-pure-therapeutic-grade/essential-oils-c-d/chamomile-german-blue.html) - 1/8 oz / $12 \n\n[Rosemary EO](http://www.edenbotanicals.com/products/essential-oils-pure-therapeutic-grade/essential-oils-q-r/rosemary-ct-verbenone-france-organic.html) - 1/4 oz / $10\n\nTOTAL: $76.55\n\nWith these ingredients, you can make at least five bottles of Quintessential serum for only $76. Essential oils will last you almost forever. Each serum probably has less than 20 drops of essential oils altogether. Noted: 1/8 oz essential oil equals 80 drops. 76.55 dollars divide into 5 bottles equal 15.13 dollars each. Which do you prefer to spend it on $175 or make yourself for $15. Why is it worth 175 dollars? It is because of branding, marketing and packaging. It actually has nothing to do with ingredients.\n\nAs for Epi-Peel, this will be your homework, please go to [Garden of Wisdom - raw ingredients](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/rawingredients.html) and [Eden Botanicals - essential oils](http://www.edenbotanicals.com/products/essential-oils-pure-therapeutic-grade/essential-oils-a-b.html). If that ingredient name doesn't sound familiar then [google it](https://www.google.com/). Try to figure it out yourself so that way you will learn and know which brand is a rip off or not.",

    "body": "So I just discovered that Nivea did the unforgivable crime of reformulating their classic bestseller - their body milk in light blue bottle with Shea butter and almond-y scent. It’s called the Nivea Pampering Soft Milk (VERWÖHNENDE SOFT MILK) in the light blue bottle. it’s also called:\nNivea Smooth Sensation Body Soft Milk or Nivea Smooth Sensation Body Lotion, depending on the country. The formula for all those three names is the same, I’ve checked (after going down this rabbit hole), and the colour of the bottle is the same. \n\nAnd if you are in the US, then the formula for a similarly-looking Nivea body lotion in the light blue bottle (which in the US is called Nivea Shea Nourish Body Lotion) is different from both old and new European formulas for the same product 😩 the old European formula is better, the US formula is much simpler (but should work in a humid climate where people don’t need as much moisture). \n\nback to European formulas:\n\nApparently, they’ve also reformulated their other body milks/body lotions, both in deep blue colour bottle and in the white bottle (which is why those products no longer work for my skin 😩). \n\nThe new formula isn’t as hydrating and occlusive as the old one (even though the new formula claims to give hydration for 72 hours, the old one was better). Basically, the old formula has a richer feel, stays longer on the skin and locks-in moisture better, for longer period of time bc it had stronger occlusives and emollients. But as the result, it was a bit tugging on the skin and took a few minutes to absorb. The new formula absorbs immediately,  is easier to apply but is less hydrating. And it now contains denatured alcohol (at least in the light blue and white bottles). So, if you live high humidity and have normal, combo or slightly dry skin, you probably will be okay with the new formula. But if you live in dry air or have extremely dry skin, then you probably would prefer the old formula. \n\nfor years the old Nivea Body Milk in light blue was my holy grail. Nothing could beat it. Even Lipikar or Vaseline Body Lotion weren’t strong enough for my skin. Nivea was the only lotion that would actually keep my skin moisturised for an entire day, without being too thick, too greasy, too difficult to apply or too slow absorbing. And now it’s gone 😢 \n\nFortunately, you can still find the old formula on Amazon and in some online stores who are still selling the leftover stock. The new formula has words 72 h  on the packaging. The old formula would say 5 in 1, 48 h. The old formula is still officially available in Ghana and some other markets around the world but in EU, UK, Ukraine it seems to be officially discontinued (so only can be found in old stock). \n\nIf you are curious about the formulas, here are all of the them: \n\nThe old European formula for Nivea light blue body milk/lotion: \n\nAqua, Glycerin, C15-19 Alkane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Palmitate, Paraffinum Liquidum, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Glucoside, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Sodium Carbomer, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Linalool, Limonene, Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citral, Geraniol, Parfum (this formula should be saved in some museum of skincare and studied by chemists bc it’s so good).\n\nThe new European formula for the same product: \n\nAqua,Glycerin,Alcohol Denat.,Cetearyl Alcohol,Ethylhexyl Cocoate,Glyceryl Stearate SE,Butyrospermum Parkii Butter,Isopropyl Palmitate,Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil,Sodium Hyaluronate,Tocopherol,Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil,Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate,Glyceryl Stearate hydroxypropyl starch phosphate, xanthan gum, ethylhexylglycerine, phenoxyethanol, linalool, limonene, benzyl alcohol, perfume.\n\nThe US version of the product: \n\nWater, Mineral Oil, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, C15-19 Alkane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Dimethicone, Fragrance, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nI’ve also found this version in the Polish market (but they have both the new and the old European formulas, too) - this is one is quite close to the OG formula in terms of the level of hydration and occlusion but less cosmetically-elegant, heavier, waxier, a bit slower to absorb and a bit more difficult to spread: \n\nAqua, Glycerin, C1316 Isoparaffin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Palmitate, Paraffinum Liquidum, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Glucoside, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Sodium Carbomer, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Linalool, Limonene, Hydroxyisohexyl 3Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol, AlphaIsomethyl Ionone, Citral, Geraniol, Parfum.\n\nThe closest thing to the old formula that I’ve found so far is their new Nivea Irresistibly Smooth Body Cream in the light blue jar. The formula is different, slightly less hydrating but close enough. It should be more fast absorbing and easier to apply: \n\nGlycerin, Mineral Oil, Alcohol Denat., Stearyl Alcohol, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Cetyl Alcohol, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Microcrystalline Wax, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, Myristic Acid, Arachidic Acid, Oleic Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Linalool, Limonene, Benzyl Alcohol, Citronellol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, BHT, Fragrance. - \n\nit’s not available in all countries, only in some. \nThe Polish regional variant is also close to the OG body milk formula but is less cosmetically elegant. \n\nSo since I now know these things, I had to share it with you 😂\n\n",

Some of them contain Paraffinum Liquidum, Dimethicone and C15-19 Alkane, which seem to have been replaced in the new formulation of your lotion with less occlusive stuff. I think the version with glycerine+vit E is supposed to be the heaviest of the bunch, maybe it's worth checking out.  \nAs a more expensive option, you could try the Bioderma Atoderm cream or balm. I had the cream a few years ago and found it more occlusive than Lipikar, so the balm should work even better.",
