    "body": "Naisipan kong dumaan sa Watsons ngayong araw para bumili ng lotion, dahil paubos na yung ginagamit ko. Nakita ko tong lotion na 'to ng Luxe Organix na naka B1T1 for Php 405, kaya naisipan kong subukan. 2 variant yung binili ko, itong Retinol + Gluta, tsaka yung Niacinamide + Arbutin. \n\nTLDR:\n\nMay microfoaming, malakas ang fragrance, heavier skin feel kumpara sa ibang serum lotions sa Market, mali-mali ang IL, mislabeled dahil imbes na retinol, Retinyl Palmitate ang laman base sa IL. \n\nUnahin muna nating tingnan ang packaging. Sa unang tingin, di nalalayo material sa packaging ng mga serum lotion ng Vaseline. Tho, yung sa Vaseline, rounded yung tabas ng seal ng tube sa both sides, samantalang itong sa LO ay pointed. \n\nSa itsura naman mismo ng laman, off-white na medyo madilaw yung kulay ng lotion. Medyo clumpy din yung itsura pagkalabas nito sa tube, at madali ding mag-break yung emulsion upon skin contact. Malakas yung fragrance nya na dominated ng floral notes. Unang naisip ko nga nung naamoy ko e amoy poon, dahil sa sobrang floral. \n\nMedyo matagal ipahid sa balat, kumpara sa ibang serum lotion na nasubukan ko na. Naka-observe din ako ng microfoaming during application nitong lotion. Ang microfoaming ito yung nagkakaroon ng puti-puting streaks sa balat habang pinapahid ang isang product, kadalasan mga emulsion gaya ng lotion at creams. Ang microfoaming ay dulot ng pagkaka-trap ng air sa product habang ipinapahid sa balat. Kung ikukumpara ko ito sa ibang serum lotion na nagamit ko na (Vaseline Gluta-Hya Serum Burst Lotion, Smoochkins Nia-Arbutin Nano White Serum Lotion), ito yung pinaka heavy ang skin feel. Hindi ko masyadong na-feel yung pagka serum lotion. And lastly naka-experience din ako ng pamumula at pantal sa braso ko after ko gamitin itong lotion na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list. \n\nWater (Aqua), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Myristate, Fragrance, C15-19 Alkane, Stearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Triethanolamine, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Glutathione, Polysorbate 20, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ceramide NP, Mannitol, Pentylene Glycol, CI19140, Phosphatidylcholine, Retinyl Palmitate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Chloride, Polyglyceryl-10,  Citric Acid, Tocopherol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nHindi na talaga nawala ang mga errors sa IL ng mga local products. Di yata talaga uso ipa-check man lang sa regulatory personnel ang IL na ilalagay sa final layout ng packaging bago ang ipa-mass printing. Para sa product na ito, hindi Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol ang tamang INCI name, kung hindi Cetearyl Alcohol. Next, Polyglyceryl-10, what? Incomplete yung ingredient name. Ang daming Polyglyceryl-10 esters na nag eexist, wag nyo na kami paghulain. (Side Note: Ang Polyglyceryl-10 esters ay kadalasang ginagamit as non-ionic emulsifier sa cosmetics.). \n\nPangalawa kong napansin, CI19140. Ang CI19140 ay isang dye na kilala din bilang Tartrazine Yellow or FD&C Yellow #5. Ito yung nagbigay ng medyo madilaw na kulay sa lotion na ito. Konektado ito sa kasunod kong punto. \n\nIkatlo, bakit Retinyl Palmitate ang nakalista dito sa IL? Kaya nyo ba nilagyan ng Yellow #5 ang lotion na ito para magmukhang may retinol, kasi nakakapagdulot ng paninilaw sa mga product ang retinol kapag ihinalo ito? Ngayon, ano ba ang problema kung retinyl palmitate ang nakalagay, imbes na retinol? Ito kasi yun: maliban sa obvious na mislabelling sa product na ito, mas mababa ang potency ng retinyl palmitate kaysa sa retinol. Sa buong retinoid family, ang mga retinyl esters kagaya ng retinyl palmitate ang may pinakamababang potency, dahil kailangan pa nito ng isang extra conversion step (retinyl palmitate -> retinol). Tandaan, ang mga retinoids, kailangang ma-convert into retinoic acid para ma-activate ang retinoic acid receptors natin sa balat at makuha ang benefits. \n\nRetinyl esters -> Retinol -> Retinaldehyde -> Retinoic Acid\n\nKada conversion step, bumababa ang potency ng isang retinoid, kaya sa kaso ng retinyl palmitate, na isang retinyl ester, eto ang may pinakamababang potency. \n\nMay peptides din pala itong lotion na ito: Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9 at Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11.\n\nAng acetyl tetrapeptide-9 ay isang signaling peptide na nagbibigay ng message sa fibroblasts sa ating dermis na magproduce ng collagen (specifically Collagen Type 1) at proteoglycans, na mahalaga para mapanatili ang structure at mapanatiling tight (hindi sagging) ang balat natin.  Nakakatulong din itong mabawasan ang appearance ng fine lines sa mukha, dahil na rin sa stimulation ng collagen at proteoglycan production. \n\nKung ang dermis ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, ang epidermis naman ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-11. Kagaya ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, signaling peptide din ito na nagbibigay ng mensahe sa epidermis na mag-synthesize o magproduce ng Syndecan-1 at Collagen XVII. Kapag mataas ang dalawang ito sa balat, nag-iimprove ang elasticity ng balat. \n\nKaramihan ng mga nabanggit na benepisyo ng dalawang peptides na ito ay base pa lamang sa mga in-vitro studies na naisagawa na. Wala pang gaanong in-vivo clinical studies na lumabas kaya medyo skeptical pa din ako sa mga peptides na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo lastly sa product claims. \n\n* Retinol + Gluta\n\n* Whitening Serum Lotion\n\n* Lightening\n\n* Firming\n\n* Hydrating\n\n* 24 hr Supple Smooth\n\n* 3X Peptide Youth Repair + Hyaluronic Bright + Ceramide Glow\n\nUnang claim pa lang, sablay na. Wala namang retinol tong lotion na 'to. Pinaglololoko ako nitong LO e. \n\nSa claim na lightening at whitening, medyo duda ako. Mukhang glutathione lang ang pwedeng masabi ng brand na ito na skin lightening ingredient. Pero duda ako sa efficacy ng glutathione na makapagpa lighten ng skin topically. Maraming limitations yung mga published studies tungkol sa efficacy ng topically applied gluta, gaya ng mababang bilang ng participants sa studies at sobrang iksi na study period. \n\nSa claim na firming, mukhang inilagay ito gawa nung mga peptides. Sa hydrating claim, meron namang hydrating ingredients (glycerin, hyaluronic acid derivatives, olive oil, Plukenetia Volubilis oil, tsaka Ceramide NP). Same din dun sa mga sumunod na claims, dahil sa presence ng mga nabanggit na ingredients. \n\n\nFinal words:\n\nHindi ako masaya sa nabili kong lotion na 'to. Hindi kasing lightweight at fast absorbing nung iba kong nasubukan na serum lotions. Amoy poon yung fragrance. May microfoaming during application. Nagkapantal ako sa braso. Mali-mali ang IL. Pero yung pinaka disappointing sa lotion na 'to e yung claim na may retinol daw, pero retinyl palmitate lang ang nasa ingredient list. May paglalagay pa ng yellow dye para magmukhang may retinol. Napakalaking red flag para sa akin ang pagmi-mislabel ng product.\n\nAyun lang. Salamat sa pagbabasa. At laging maging mapanuri sa mga binibili at balak nating gamitin na products. \n\n",

Yellow dye appears to have been added to the lotion to give the appearance of fully evolved retinol being an ingredient as retinol usually makes creams look yellow.\n* The peptides used claim to target fine lines and elasticity, but only proven by in-vitro studies (i.e. in controlled lab environments) vs. in-vivo (i.e. on living organisms)\n\nThank you for this in-depth review, skincare\\_chemist19!

    "body": "I've copy/pasted this text multiple times now and decided to just make a separate post about it (and I admit I want to be lazy and just post a link instead of repeatedly copy/pasting a comment). Some of you may recognize a good portion of this, but I've added some points because I'm trying to make this post as comprehensive as possible.\n\nIn order to determine whether a product is water-based or silicone-based, you have to look at the ingredients. -Cone/-methicone, and -siloxane words near the top of the list tend to signal a silicone-based product. Water will be at the top of the list for any liquid product because water makes it liquidy. It doesn't mean that a product is water-based. Without water, the product would not be spreadable/blendable. For example:\n\nMAKE UP FOR EVER HD Microperfecting Primer Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Aqua (Water), **Dimethicone**, **Trisiloxane**, PEG-12 **Dimethicone**, **Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone** Crosspolymer, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Squalane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Lauryl PEG/PPG-18/18 Methicone, Phenoxyethanol, Ceteth-10, Laureth-4, Ethylglycerin, Panthenol, Potassium Sorbate, Polysorbate 60, Parfum (Fragrance), Argania Spinosa Extract (Argania Spinosa Kernel Extract), C12-14 Pareth-12, Hydrolyzed Algin, Dodecene, Sorbitan Isostearate, Isostearyl Alcohol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Tromethamine, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. [CI 19140 (Yellow 5 Lake), CI 75470 (Carmine), CI 77007 (Ultramarines), CI 77288 (Chromium Oxide Greens), CI 77289 (Chromium Hydroxide Green), CI 77491 (Iron Oxides), CI 77492 (Iron Oxides), CI 77499 (Iron Oxides), CI 77742 (Manganese Violet), CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide)].\n\nSee the bold words? Definitely silicone-based! Again, the water keeps it a more liquid-y consistency so it's easily spreadable. It doesn't mean that the product is water-based. Particularly with primers, I can always tell because it has that \"silicone\" feeling. Now let's look at a water-based primer:\n\nLaura Mercier Foundation Primer - Oil Free Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Isodecyl Isononanoate, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, C22-20 Alcohols, Squalane, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Esters, Phenoxyethanol, Boron Nitride, Silica, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Allantoin Tocopherol Acetate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hamaelis Viginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Cucumis sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Retinyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Polyamino Sugar Condesate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Chlorphensin, Benzoic Acid, Polysorbate 60, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Saccharomyces/Xylium Black Tea Ferment, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Potassium Sorbate, Green 5 (CI 61570), Yellow 5 (CI 19140).\n\nSee how there are no -cone/-methicone or -siloxane words near the top of the list? That means that it's water-based. This primer does contain dimethicone, which is a silicone, but it's relatively low on the list, which means that it contains a very small amount of silicone (ingredients are typically listed in order, beginning with what is in there most and ending with what is in there the least). Thus, because this primer contains much more water (and other ingredients) than silicone, it is water-based.\n\nOil-based foundations are exceptionally rare. After much searching, I finally found one: Alexandra de Markoff Countess Isserlyn Cream Makeup (another is NARS Balanced Foundation, which has been discontinued, so I could not find an easily copy/paste-able ingredients list). Let's look at the ingredients:\n\nWater (aqua), **Decyl Oleate**, **Lanolin Oil**, Propylene Glycol, Talc, Isotearic Acid, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetyl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Fragrance (parfum), Emulsifying Wax NF, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Acetylated Lanolin Alcohol, PPG-12-PEG-65 Lanolin Oil, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben. May contain Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI77492, CI 77499, Ultramarines (CI77007)\n\nYes, water is listed as the first ingredient, but that is to keep the product more blendable. The second and third ingredients (in bold) are definitely oils. Phew! You don't know how many ingredients lists I went through to find that! I swear unicorns are easier to find! ANYWAY, they should play well with silicone-based primers. However, this is unlikely to be of concern to you because chances are you're not using an oil-based foundation (if you are using an oil-based foundation, check your closet for a herd of unicorns).\n\nIn general, you want water-based primers with water-based foundations (or tinted moisturizers, BB creams, CC creams, concealer, or any other base products; I'm just going to keep typing \"foundations\" for the sake of brevity), and silicone-based primers with silicone-based foundations. The two different bases (water and silicone) can cause your foundation to pill when layered on top of each other. In particular, using a silicone-based primer with a water-based foundation on top of it often causes the foundation to pill because the primer creates a silicone barrier. When you try to apply a water-based foundation on top of that, the silicone repels the water in the foundation, and the water in the foundation does not absorb properly into your skin, resulting in unevenness.\n\nPlease remember to moisturize well underneath your makeup (and to give your moisturizer time to absorb fully, meaning your skin should no longer have that \"tacky\" feeling that you have right after applying moisturizer). If you use sunscreen (which you should, especially with summer coming up), you need to let that absorb as well. The base of your moisturizer/sunscreen is irrelevant, because if you allow them to absorb completely, they will not affect makeup application at all. If you begin applying primer and foundation before your moisturizer and/or sunscreen has fully absorbed, they can cause your makeup to break up sooner, which is the opposite of what you want.\n\nAlong the same line, your powder is irrelevant to the base of your foundation/primer. There is no such thing as a water-based powder (it then wouldn't be a powder). If your powder isn't working with your foundation/primer and giving you the look that you want, it is not related to the base of your foundation/primer. Also, not everybody needs to use powder on top of their foundation, so if you're not liking the look, you may consider skipping powder altogether.\n\nAdditionally, you only need a small amount of primer for your face (a very thin layer is sufficient... your face should not feel too slippery). Do not apply too much primer. Water-based primers will absorb into your skin better, but silicone-based primers tend to sit on top of it. Using too much will create a slick film that causes your foundation to slide off much sooner. Remember that it is easier to add more (and I recommend that you add more gradually, little by little) than to take primer off of your face. Over time, you'll get used to the amount you need for your face.\n\nWhile pore-filling primers, such as Benefit Porefessional, NYX Pore Filler, and Too Faced Primed and Poreless, are designed specifically to fill in your visible pores, you can also use any primer to do this (though in my experience, they do not do as well at filling in pores as pore-filling primers, and silicone-based primers work best for filling in pores). Just make sure that you tap the primer into your pores rather than rubbing. Tapping gets the product into your pores to fill them in. Rubbing does not do the same (though you can rub afterward to make sure the surface is smoothed out) and will not give you the same pore-filling results.\n\nFinally, please remember that just because you are using two products with the same base, it doesn't necessarily mean that the products will work for you. Not every product works for every person. You may need to experiment to find the right combination for you. I highly recommend asking for samples, as they are a much cheaper (i.e. FREE) method of trying out a product. You can ask for samples of any product that can be sanitized and put in a small sample jar, such as primer and foundation.\n\nI hope this post has been helpful.

This was the video I decided to go with since many people seemed genuinely curious how to rack these giant fruit bombs. \n\nAnyway going into secondary we racked it into potassium metabisulfite and potassium sorbate to stabilize , but also to scavenge any oxygen that likely got in the brew from pressing the fruits and the mead splashing around a bit. \n\nAlso added 40g of of Amburana oak chips from North East Barrel Company, and I’m gonna let that sit for prob 30 days. Likely will add cinnamon, maybe a cup of maple syrup, a couple cups of brown sugar, and some ground black peppercorn to finish off spicing it. \n\nI’ll see if I can post pics in the comments below of the brew in its carboy looking big and beautiful, as opposed to making another, entirely separate post.

    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

    "body": "Hello everyone. \n\nI have seen a lot of “How can I make Cider” or “How to xyz my cider” or “my cider tastes like butthole” posts lately and I've been planning on doing one big post as a frame of reference and to try to finally get some concise answers or at least vague advice for people who make cider or are planning to. \n\n\nThe term \"cider\" is very ambiguous. I see arguments sparking here often of what a “cider” actually is. However, that argument is irrelevant to the process of making something that is actually good to drink.  \n\n\nI will attempt to divide this into more simple and concise categories and discuss techniques and strategies for each. First I will make notes on things that are important for any recipe.\n\nThese notes are made on research, but mostly, personal experience. I'm sorry for the wordiness, **I will try to highlight the most important points for those of you (i.e. everyone) skimming**.  \n\n\nPlease give me a few minutes to double-check formatting, this has been a long process.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - -\nFirstly:\n\nThere are some things that go for every type of cider you can make:\n\n1) **Do not boil your ingredients**. Do don't unless some particular ingredient that is not fruit requires boiling for extraction. If you boil your juice/fruit/must you will get something that tastes so bad your garbage disposal will spit it back up. \n\n2) There are three things that are absolutely and completely an ingredient in every recipe.  **Good Juice, good yeast and patience.** Honestly, if you can use fresh-pressed apple juice from good apples, do. It will completely make the difference between a typical cider and an incredible drink. However, I make great cider all of the time without spending out the ass on fresh-apple juice. \n\n-If you are using cheap mott's type juice, try to put at least part of your juice as fresh pressed or at least use some pasteurized fresh fruit. It will make a huge difference. And try to avoid the 100% Vitamin C ones, but completely avoid  with potassium sorbate. \n\n3) In these recipes, **I highly (9/10 times) recommend adding actual fruit matter to your ciders. Especially when using particularly aggressive yeasts.** It will not only improve the \"fresh-cider\" type flavor, but it's good for yeast food.  Fresh is always best, but frozen works great too. Freezing ruptures the cell walls and helps make it easier for more sugars to be processed by the yeast. What about bacteria? See pasteurization method below. \n\n- - - - - - - -\nAnother note on fruit additions\n\n**Primary**\n\n**If you add a few pounds of fruit in primary, you're going to start with a beautiful colored concoction.  It's going to ferment out completely and you won't be able to tell.** I've seen cider start red with raspberries and completely lose all the color in two weeks. \n\nHowever, **it's good for your yeast. It also adds character to the nose and adds a body to build your secondary fruit addition upon**.\n\n I always add fruit at both primary in secondary (if I add fruit).\n\n**Secondary**\n\n**If you want to maintain the color and flavor of your chosen fruit, add it at secondary**. Use the mash method shown below and add it when you're within a few points of your targeted final gravity. \n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n\nPasteurization:\n\nThere are a few methods of pasteurization. Frozen fruit is usually pasteurized before it's frozen, and I've yet to have problems simply dropping it in without treating it. However, you will get much more color, quicker fermentation and more flavor if you blend and \"mash\" the fruit.  This also applies to frozen fruit.  I have had *wonderful* results with the method shown below. This method was given to me by user Biobrewer, so please send karma or puppies his way:\n\n*I literally mash up the fruit really well (usually a few pulses in the blender is good), and add just a little water, enough to make it fluid enough for heat to transfer (doesn't take much since there is usually a fair amount of fruit juices). I then heat up to 110 F with some pectin enzyme for 30 minutes, then pasteurize for 4-5 minutes at around 170 F. Lastly, I cool by submersion of the pot in an ice bath, sanitize the outside, and funnel the fruit mush into the fermentor and rack the beer on top.* \n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n\n\nOkay, so you've skimmed down to this far and you're thinking \"when the hell is he going to talk about actually making cider\".  Well now we can get down to business. I will go over Apfelweins, Graffs and Typical Ciders.\n\n\n\n\n1)** Apfelwein / Apple Wine **\n\n*This category is strictly regarding wines that are fermented with a strain of yeast typical to wines such as Montrachet, Coate des Blanc, Champagne etc.  A really, really good apfelwein is arguably much more complex, generally drier and usually a higher %ABV beverage than other ciders.* \n\nStrategies In Making your Wine:\n\n\n-**Do not use Montrachet or Red Wine yeast.** I commonly see Red Star Montrachet yeast suggested as I believe it is in Edwort's Apfelwein recipe. I also commonly see people who use this yeast say their cider tastes like, well, ass.  Don't confuse poor choice of yeast with poor yeast, Montrachet is a great yeast, but it is a Red Wine yeast. Your cider typically should not resemble the thickness, spicyness or richness of a red wine.  Note: Yes, you *can* use Montrachet, but more often than not you are looking at a minimum of 9 months from pitch to glass before it tastes decent and usually it still doesn't. (although we all have preferences that are different). White wine, champagne, and hybrid yeasts are much more fitting.\n\n-Firstly, I am in an area where I really only see Lalvin and Red Star strains. I have used both and it seems that Lalvin is a common brand on this sub. In my opinion, Lalvin creates superior dry yeast. I highly recommend them all. To simplify the difference for those who can't really choose (or don't care), it really comes down to how sweet, green or dry you want your wine. **My favorite is 1116(K1V).  A white/champagne hybrid that requires little to no-sweetening for a refreshing flavor in even a young wine (5 months pitch to glass minimum).  If you are on the fence about your apfelwein yeast, use 1116** A little tart, a little sweet, a little dry. \n\n-Following in favorite would be 1122. To me, it seems on the verge of a white/vino verde type yeast. \n\n-D47 is fine, but it seems to me it needs a bit more age than the 11 series and is more prone to getting that young-wine-sour-ey flavor. It usually will age out fine.\n\n-**I often steer people away from Champagne yeast because if you're just grabbing regular ol' juice off the store shelf and pitch Red Star Champagne or Lalvin 1118 (Champagne) you're going to end up with something that tastes like fizzy soda water.** Not much flavor and very, very dry. It is, however, very possible to create a good cider like this but if you do, and you want it to pop but still have lots of flavor, use fresh juice, and lots of fruit matter to your primary (i.e. apples,  blueberries, blackberries..whatever).\n\n\n\n\n2)**  Malted Cider **\n\n*This type of cider is typically known as a Graff it is a partially malted and usually lightly hopped cider.  As someone who eats beer for three meals a day, I have the authority to say that this is a beer-drinker's cider.  Graff's are wonderful. They give the type of body to a cider most beer drinkers need. It's not wine-ey and it's not too fruity. It's balanced.*\n\nMaking your Graff\n\nFirst Off, **Cider is popular among gluten-free drinkers. If you add malt to your cider, warn others that may be gluten-intolerant.**\n\n\n-**If you will search “Graff Recipe” you will find a HBT talk thread that will create a dry, mildly sweet and absolutely enjoyable cider. I recommend you start with this recipe if you are curious.** I am am willing to post personal favorite recipes or suggestions, but I'm not going to copy-paste a recipe that is easily searchable and who's author deserves more credit than I.\n\n-On that note, the torrified wheat isn't necessary for head retention. For a base I usually just steep pilsner, white wheat and cyrstal 20 or 60.  I get incredible head retention. \n\n-**Yeast will contribute nearly the entire character of your cider.** This isn't news for most of you.  Think it through, it will define your drink. The typical S04 will make a dry, slightly tart flavor that is totally enjoyable. I recommend most ale yeasts but I encourage you to experiment. To those unfamiliar with lots of yeast, do a little research or simply start with typical yeasts. WLP001,002,013 are always good places to start. I have done a graff with Saison yeast and it was like nothing I've ever had. Almost more cirtus-ey than apple-ey. But it was a hit on New Years.  I would, however, avoid yeasts that are notorious for generating lots of isoamyl acetate. To me, those banana flavors just clash with the apple. You may have a different opinion. \n\n-**The guidelines posted in the typical Graff Recipe call for a specific amount of hops and say “if you want to change the hops, use less, not more”.  For all intents and purposes, I will stick to this advice.** If you just want a typical dry cider, the suggested .5oz Cascade boiled for 30 minutes with your malt is perfect. For those of you mildly experienced, you'll probably realize this hop addition is essentially to lightly enhance existing bitterness without creating an overt, or arguably existent at all, aroma. This is correct. I'm never to positive because I'm always adding fruit which makes measuring OG a bit more of a pain, but I think you're aiming for about 7-14 IBU's in five gallons. So if you want to experiment, go for it, but this is really about IBU's, so don't just totally interchange Columbus, Saaz or Cascade without running a calculation. \n\n\n3) ** Typical Ciders **\n\n*This is just a typical cider made with no malt and ale yeast. My favorite commercial example would be Harpoon. I believe their cider is probably the best commercial top-fermented cider. I love looking at the back of the bottle... Ingredients: Fermented Apple Juice. There are no secrets with this drink except that they're actually getting fresh juice from an orchard a few miles away from their production, keeping the temperatures maintained and using an ale yeast similar (read identical) to their typical ales.*\n\n-There isn't too much to say here because the process is pretty straightforward. Get your juice or make your must, drop your yeast in. Take gravity readings and bottle.\n\n- - - - - - - - - \n\nSome questions you may have:\n\n**Do I need to make a starter?**\n\n-*Sigh*. Listen, you don't have to make a starter. You also don't have to tie your shoes, but your day is going to be more difficult if you keep tripping over your laces. Use regular extra-light LME. Yes, you can get away with pitching just a vial or smack pack. Your cider will turn out fine. Making starters is just a good habit to be in.\n\n-Disregard this if you are using dry yeast, and yes, one packet is enough.\n\n**Does temperature matter?**\n\n-Of course it does. If temperatures are an issue for you, choose a yeast appropriate for your range. Focus on esters you want to avoid or create. As a rule of thumb, you can't go wrong around 65F. \n\n\n**What if I want to add something to my cider?**\n\n-Then do it, I'm not your mother. I don't really care because you're probably not going to give me any of it anyway. Just search. Someone has added that ingredient and I'm sure wrote about it in detail previously on this sub, HBT, etc. Don't get ambitious. You can always add more, you can't really add less.  \n\n\n**How long until I can drink it?** \n\n-How patient are you? For wine yeasts, I usually recommend a **minimum** of 1 month primary and 2 months secondary. Then another 3-8 months in a bottle.  Even with ale-oriented ciders, I usually need a bit of age on my ciders and they will improve with a few extra weeks in a fermenter, especially if you're going to just drop it in a keg and drink it in a week.\n\n-You have to remember that fruit is fairly lazily fermenting, especially if added in secondary. So account for that and give the appropriate time needed, especially if your drink is destined for bottles.\n\n-For ales, give it at least three weeks to secondary, or just five weeks in a primary. Or longer. If I'm not in a hurry I do 1 month primary, 1 month secondary. Why do I secondary? Because I do. Don't argue with me about it. If you don't like it, don't do it. I also am usually adding extra juice or fruit to secondary so it's nicer to siphon-on than dump-in.  \n\n\n**I want to have a sweet, carbonated cider, but I don't want to backsweeten with lactose or splenda, what do I do?**\n\nIt depends on whether you bottle or keg\n\n\n**If you keg. It's easy. You can kill your yeast and add whatever you want.** I usually drink a few glasses back and then add a half gallon of juice to the 4ish gallons remaining. Do you need to add sorbate? I get away with not doing it by keeping everything cold enough, especially when you add new juice.  If your keg is going to get warm, add the sorbate. I haven't had problems with off-flavors. But make sure you add enough. Aggressive yeasts can maintain plenty of activity if the concentration of sorbate isn't high enough.\n\n-Original Sin is a very unique cider created by fermenting with champagne yeast, killing it with sorbate before it ferments out entirely and lightly carbonated. Give it a try if you can get your hands on it. It's got quite an interesting mouthfeel and I actually enjoy it.\n\n**If you bottle, it's more tricky, but not impossible**. \n\n-When using wine yeast. Primary in one jug. Let it ferment out. Then split it in half between two secondary fermenters half-filled with fresh, non-fermented juice. You will retain much more sweetness this way. And hey dude, now you have twice the cider! It's like magic that gets you drunk. \n\n-When using ale-yeast, the process is essentially the same. But don't entirely split your batch. Just leave a gallon out at primary and add it in secondary.\n\n\n\n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n\n\nOk, *deep breath* I think I covered most of what I want to. I apologize for the wordiness but it's easier for me to type all of this out now and just copy paste it from my history when people ask questions in five days because this inevitably end up buried. \n\nI encourage you to ask and answer questions. I also encourage you to disagree with me. We all have opinions and this write up is much more from experience and not laboratory science. Technically I'm a scientist, *but not that kind of scientist*.  \n\n",

        "body": "Great post; both thorough and specific. \n\nIn case anyone is interested, here is an article I wrote on cider-making for a local paper about eight years ago.  \n\n>The campsite in central Brittany meandered in and around the ruins of a 13th-century castle. While I cooked in its original medieval kitchen, a small older woman fresh from rabbit-hunting entered. She offered me a glass of \" cidre\" from an unlabelled green bottle, and despite my basic French, I was able to glean that what was passing my lips began life in her small orchard. Strong, dry, and full of ripe fruit, this surely was bough-born champagne. With the sugar peeled away, the subtle complexities of apple were revealed: seeds, skin, leaves, bark, and earth were right there in every sip. When I told her that cider this good cannot be purchased in Canada, she let me know that it couldn't be bought in France either.\n\nI realize that I will never own an apple orchard or a cider press, but after this experience, I refuse to drink high-production cider made from apple-juice concentrate. I got to thinking, How difficult could it be to turn a jug of good-quality apple juice into hard cider? Facing the problem of making something into alcohol, I usually go to Dan Small of Dan's Homebrewing Supplies (310 Commercial Drive). On the way there, I picked up a four-litre jug of unfiltered, organic apple juice for $6. Pointing to the jug I heaved onto the counter, I asked Small, busy grinding barley, for the simplest way to turn its contents into booze. He stopped long enough to suggest pouring in a packet of champagne yeast (99 ¢), then popping in a rubber bung with a fermentation lock ($2.50). In a few weeks it would be about 7.5-percent alcohol, he declared, after taking a hydrometer reading of my apple juice. Then all I would have to do is rack and bottle, tossing in a little corn sugar for carbonation, and in a couple of weeks, I would be ready to party. Small, having achieved an enviable poetic simplicity, is something of the local brewing laureate, but this just seemed too easy, and I had to question him on it.\n\nDespite wanting to get back to his barley mill, he related to me how simple cider is to make. On the farm where he grew up near London, Ontario, each fall his father crushed all of the windfall apples. He threw this mash into an oak barrel where the pulp would settle. \"Us kids weren't allowed any of that juice after Halloween,\" Small recalled with a grin. \"By Christmas it would have been fully fermented out.\" At this point, dad would have to remove a circular pane of ice from the barrel to dip his cup, naturally fortifying the cider as he did so. Small laughs as he tries to figure out how strong the cider would have been by January. \"Of course, Mom didn't know.\"\n\nSmall admitted that epicureans might suggest refinements on his suggested brewing method. He mentioned Shirley Warne, who wasn't home when he phoned but who walked in five minutes later, like a muse invoked.\n\nWhile Small continued milling barley, I spoke with Warne, a slight but intense woman with spiky silver hair. Despite branding herself a \"neophyte\", she demonstrated an encyclopedic knowledge of cider-brewing.\n\nHer method involves a little more equipment (although no oak barrels) and a few more steps. She usually brews six jugs (about 24 litres) per batch, pouring all into a sterilized primary fermenter with a loose-fitting lid that allows for some headroom. Warne finds champagne yeast overly efficient, as it tends to ferment out every last speck of sugar; her preference is a more finicky Swiss ale yeast for the flavour it imparts and the residual sweetness it leaves.\n\nShe lets the primary run for about a week at 15 º C, racking it into a 23-litre carboy once it is no longer active, then adds a teaspoon of powdered gelatin to help the yeast to \"flocculate\" (brewer's talk for \"sink to the bottom\"), then lets this secondary fermentation sit somewhere cool (eight to 12 º C) for a month, after which it is usually ready to bottle.\n\nWarne eschews carbonating with corn sugar, preferring the German technique of \"krausening\", which involves adding a small amount (eight percent of the total volume) of fresh juice, which may be inoculated with a pinch of yeast, back to the newly fermented cider. This, she said, will give it a softer carbonation, which is smoother on the palette, and a cider you cannot buy here, or anywhere, for ready money.",

I also like the idea of mashing and adding apples, so I may do that as well. Would that mean I would want to cut back on the sugar I add? And do you have a preference on a type of sugar to use?

This is my opportunity to contribute to this community. Please be kind to one another while debating.*\n\nBACKSTORY:\n\nI am fulfilling a prior reddit comment about doing a comparison between older and newer Huy Fong Foods sriracha, plus Underwood Ranch's Dragon Sriracha.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor those not aware, Underwood Farms was the original pepper supplier to Huy Fong Foods.  Legal actions and business decisions appear to have impacted Huy Fong's product.\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jun/05/sriracha-sauce-lawsuit-huy-fong-underwood](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jun/05/sriracha-sauce-lawsuit-huy-fong-underwood)\n\n[https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/2021/b303096.html](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/2021/b303096.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnderwood Ranch has released their own sriracha (\"Dragon Sriracha\") which uses peppers formerly used by Huy Fong Foods.  I had to purchase their product via their website, as their grocery store distribution is limited.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gll4xm37lp8c1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=272ce0c6d9b4ab32889f38dd0c9a64e404c5ca12\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6jx7johukp8c1.png?width=4032&format=png&auto=webp&s=19d25fcce2011a94cf7cd5d9af3ee516bc564c0b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aqp1nmhukp8c1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=22bab97e4e4f4ff80cecf6ff3496d9311973285e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/to364dhukp8c1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=083f3eb787c4c933c7b8f76d0eca21c4f75c69e4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4fc5lvgukp8c1.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=31be9f2f6e766da1f2b51caeda4c4f5760f11021\n\nABOUT THE PRODUCTS:\n\nThis reddit community has opinions on taste differences between the older and newer Huy Fong srirachas. I happen to have bottles of older and newer Huy Fong Srirachas (28oz version);  I recently bought the Underwood Ranch sriracha (17oz).\n\nThe older bottle (expiration 2018) was opened some time during Summer 2023, then subsequently refrigerated.\n\nThe newer bottle (expiration 2025) was opened some time during December 202**3**, then subsequently refrigerated.\n\nI purchased the 16oz Underwood Ranch \"Dragon Sriracha\" in December 2023, opening it December 26, 2023 and refrigerating for several hours before using.  This is also my FIRST TIME tasting the Dragon Sriracha.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTASTE TESTS:\n\n1. I cooked Grade AA eggs *as scrambled eggs*; nothing added to the whisked eggs, e.g. milk, butter, spices.  I added real bacon (precooked Kirkland-brand from Costco) to the eggs as they cooked.  Each of the srirachas was added to a section of the cooked scrambled eggs/bacon for a mid-day meal. (See photo)\n\n2) I used three separate spoons to taste each of the srirachas.  Given the strength of hot sauce, I used a small amount which I ate/swallowed from the spoons.  (I drank water as a rinse/spit between each test.)\n\nThese tests are imperfect, as each taste may have had some affect on the other tastings.  BUT I consider myself to have good taste buds;  I was able to gauge both heat and flavors without a problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMY OPINION:\n\nThe older Huy Fong sriracha has had time to ferment, due to age.  This may have altered the taste to a degree. It still retained its peppery sharpness, its slight sweetness and the familiar refrigerated consistency.  The bottle was almost empty when I used it. It was delicious.\n\nThe newer Huy Fong sriracha IS DIFFERENT.  The flavor possesses something slightly saltier mixed with the sweetness.  The sharp pepper flavor is largely absent; the heat is more mild than the older version.  It is still delicious, although I can actually taste not one type of salt, but actually make out different salt tastes infused in the sauce.\n\nThe winner?  **Underwood Ranch's \"Dragon Sriracha\".**\n\n*OMG, this stuff is INCREDIBLY OG!!!*  Yes, it's fresh, compared to the older Huy Fong sriracha I had.  But it is flavor from Heaven!  (I've tried other srirachas, including Dynasty, Sky Valley, Tabasco, among others. Not in the same category.)\n\nThe flavor is intense, warm (even hot) and wonderful!!  The consistency is akin to Huy Fong sriracha; the color is slightly darker, though.  And I got more pepper and garlic taste than sweetness--which was noticeable, but not like the newer Huy Fong sriracha.  I wasn't overwhelmed with salt flavor(s), which is kinda surprising after viewing the ingredients.\n\nIf you're familiar with the original Huy Fong Foods sriracha, then you will get that 'taste flashback' since Underwood produced peppers which were used (past tense) for Huy Fong Foods sriracha. (Oh, how the mighty have indeed fallen!)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNOTE THE INGREDIENTS FOR Huy Fong srirachas:\n\n(Expiration 2018)\n\nChili, Sugar, Salt, Garlic, Distilled Vinegar, Potassium Sorbate, contains Sodium Bisulfite as preservatives, and Xanthan Gum\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Expiration 2025)\n\nChili, Sugar, Salt, Garlic, Acetic Acid, Potassium Sorbate and Sodium Bisulfite as preservatives, Xanthan Gum\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegarding Acetic Acid:  Vinegar is at least 4% acetic acid by volume, making acetic acid the main component of vinegar apart from water. It has been used, as a component of vinegar throughout history from at least the third century BC.\n\nNo idea why Huy Fong chose \"Distilled Vinegar\" for the older ingredients vs. \"Acetic Acid\" in the newer (even though acetic acid is in vinegar).\n\nNote that the older Huy Fong sriracha says \"MADE IN U.S.A. WITH CALIFORNIA PRODUCE\" while the newer Huy Fong sriracha only says \"MADE IN U.S.A.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So, fellow redditors, there you go!**  Hope more of you will consider posting your thoughts/experiences, too.  For the price, Huy Fong is a much less expensive option.  But for true quality, *Underwood Ranch is the BEST, imho.*  I \\*will\\* be purchasing more of their product!",

    "body": "I love being able to eat at a cheap restaurant or buy some snacks and I know exactly how it will taste, every single time. I love knowing exactly what I'm getting. The fact that I can just go to a store and buy chocolate chip cookies whenever I want is amazing! What a time to be alive! Why would I go through the effort of making my own dough and baking and cutting out crackers when I can just go buy a box of Ritz crackers that I know will taste and feel the same every time? But those \"health conscious\" types, you know the ones, they're always preaching about how terrible this stuff is. It'll give you diabetes, it'll give you cancer, it'll give you some nebulous illness. These paranoid dumbfucks probably think eating more kale and plain oatmeal would cure my autism for all I know. I'm so tired of their shit.\n\n\"Eat whole foods!\" The fuck does that mean? Eat a bunch of raw fruits and vegetables like I'm a wild animal without hands and a brain capable of heating and combining my food into better flavors? No. Fuck off.\n\n\"Don't eat things with ingredients you can't pronounce and don't know what they are!\" Joke's on them, I love looking up that stuff so I DO know what it is and how to pronounce it. \n\n\"The more steps of preparation the food takes to get to you, the more nutrition it loses!\" I'm pretty sure this one isn't even true, but I also don't fucking care. Do the people that say this live on a ranch farm where they source all of their own ingredients so nothing is ever handled or processed by another industry or entity first? I don't love big ag and mega food corps either, but that's because of capitalism, not because they put potassium sorbate in the food (it's a natural preservative salt found in some plants that inhibits fungal growth).\n\n\"Cooking your own food is so much cheaper and better for you.\" Okay, how much of my day am I committing just to preparing food? I have special interests to hyperfixate over, you know how annoying it is to feed myself during that time even when the food is easily acquired? I'm perfectly willing to exchange money for time saved on my behalf. I can muster the fucks to cook something when all the ingredients are delivered directly to my house and no other time. \n\n\"But it tastes better homemade!\" I've had home home cooking from many an American family. No, no it absolutely it does not. I will choose prepackaged food or a restaurant every time, where I can see my options and the ingredients versus whatever overcooked and under seasoned mystery slop comes out of someone's personal kitchen. Maybe if your home cooking came from a place that has more flavor that White Suburbia you could be right about homemade tasting better, but mine didn't, and I will never forgive or forget those culinary sins I was made to endure.\n\n \"Fast food is garbage and is destroying our country's health!\" Pretty sure it's a societal and structural problem with a lack of affordable and accessible healthcare and needing to be able to drive a car to go anywhere or do anything in this country. But sure, go off I guess. I'm part of the problem for eating at Taco Bell. Me not doing this will have such an effect on the world, I'm sure.\n\n\"Make a big batch of food and eat it over the week!\" No, because I don't hate myself that much. Do these people have any idea how disgusting food gets after being put in a refrigerator for more than a few hours? Both the taste and texture completely degrade. I've been forced to eat questionable leftovers and I will never forget the hours of torture in the bathroom to get it out. Fuck no. I'm not eating food more than 24 hours after it was prepared unless its designed not to spoil quickly (like dried packaged foods). Congratulations to NTs for being human garbage disposals with no sense of taste or smell, I guess. Sounds like a cool carnival trick.\n\nAnyway, I hate just about anything related to food culture around me. Health food culture, gourmet food culture, whatever the fuck the stay at home mom tradwives on Tiktok are trying to sell... Fuck all of it. I'm an adult who can make my own decisions about my food and I want to eat Oreo cookies and In-N-Out burgers and chicken wings with garlic parmesan fries. It is a triumph to simply wake up every day and feed myself, and I refuse to be shamed again about my \"bad\" food choices ever again.  \n",

I love the self sufficiency that comes with cooking and not being reliant on our corporate overlords. and kale and oats can be really good if made the right way (salad and chocolate oatmeal). Believe me, im not trying to be a shill for tiktok health nuts and I don't really care about chemicals in my food as long as they don't cause cancer. I absolutely love cooking the \"traditional\" unless makes no sense/is stupid. idk how to finish this so rant over ig :/",

    "body": "I have been alluding to this post for a while, and now that it is officially summer here in Milwaukee and I have the week off it seems good enough time as any to finally write this.\n\n# Why Fruit?\n\nBefore we get into the process, we need to look at recipe design. I know, boring stuff. If you think recipe design is for try hard nerds, please go to the next section and consider subbing at r/prisonhooch.\n\nFruit in beer can be as easy as just tossing raspberries in your wheat or sour and calling it a day, but why raspberries? Why do you see those all over the place and very little watermelon, or peach, or citrus? Well, when you ferment the fruit in beer you change its flavor. Most of what you taste when you eat said fruit is the sugar that it contains, and as you should know your yeast will consume all of that sugar, so your final product won't taste like you eating the piece of fruit while drinking the beer. Because of this we need to know how the fruit tastes once its devoid of sugar and work around that. A process I enjoy doing for this is to make a dry wine made up entirely of that fruit. This gives you the best idea if what you're doing is doomed from the start (like watermelon).\n\nThe list I gave of not as common fruits are for one unifying reason, they are mostly sugar and taste like nothing when fermented. It's the same with why you shouldn't use honey in a beer for flavor, but instead honey malt. Knowing this can save you time when you attempt to make fun of ABI by making that pumpkin peach ale only to realize that you put in 10 lbs of peach puree and all you got is another pumpkin ale, and not even in the proper season.\n\nOther not as common fruits are blueberries and sweet cherries. This group has the same problem that concord grape wine or Manischewitz has, once the sugar is gone from these they taste like medicine.\n\nThe last group of uncommon fruits are the citrus family. Oranges, limes, lemons and even pineapple can do weird things to your brew because of their acidity, and in the special case of pineapple enzymes that kill head retention. The other reason these fruits aren't used is because there are two great ways to get the flavor without having to resort to the actual fruit and claim Reinheitsgebot status: there are dozens of hop varieties out there that give these flavors and different yeasts that when stressed can mimic the taste. So why go through the hassle of processing fruit when you can just swap ingredients?\n\n*K\\_Mander, you just gave me a list of fruits not to use. So what should I be using?*\n\nGood question. The best fruits are ones that are not overly sweet and have other flavors that exist beyond sugar. Raspberries are such a common fruit because of their natural tartness, so when their sugar is gone that flavor remains. Tart cherries have a better cherry flavor and don't taste like medicine after being fermented. Likewise, wine grapes aren't all that good for eating, but they ferment nicely. It's the same reason why crab and deer apples make better hard ciders than eating or baking apples. Lastly, apricots are the best way to give you a peach flavor that can withstand fermentation (see, alternate ingredients to give you your end goal). But at the end of the day, this hobby thrives on experimentation and you learn more from your failures than you do successes.\n\n**Takeaways from this chapter:**\n\n* Fruit after it's fermented doesn't taste the same as just eating it\n* See if there are alternate ingredients that you can use to mimic the flavor\n* The best fruits are ones with strong flavors that don't rely all on their sugar (raspberries, apricots, and other tart varieties)\n* Take risks!\n\n# Sourcing Your Fruit\n\nSo you've read my warning and are going to use fruit anyways. Good for you! Trying new things is always fun even when it doesn't work out. But where do we get the fruit? Simple answer is anywhere.\n\nFresh is always the best, but it can be pricey. If you have any pick your own orchards near by you can easily get a haul for cheap, but you pay for it in labor. I've also gone to asking vendors at farmers markets if they have bruised and questionable buckets that they'd sell for half off. Let them know you're brewing with it and slip them some product after its done and they'll remember you, but only as fondly as the hooch you've made.\n\nFrozen is a great resource because it's cheaper, year round, convenient, and partially processed to make it easier to handle.\n\nCanned fruit is also an option. The largest upside to canned is that it is already pasteurized so you don't need to worry about sanitizing your fruit before adding it. The largest downside is that because of the pasteurization process you will get some different flavors because it is cooked. And please be sure to check to make sure that it is in juice, not heavy syrup.\n\n*I have my fruit... now what?*\n\nWe need to ready it before it goes in the beer. You don't want whole berries just floating in your brew, you won't get any flavor from them.\n\nReadying is simply doing a light wash if you have unprocessed fruit (frozen and canned will have done this already), simply rise it under water and make sure there's no dirt on it. Unless you like that pure earthy quality in your beers.\n\nAfter washing you do a fine chop or puree of your fruit, making sure to remove any gross bits first. Freezing and then thawing can help with this process as it breaks them down at the cellular level.\n\nNext up, YOU HAVE TO SANITIZE YOUR FRUIT!\n\n*Wait, what's up with that all caps portion?*\n\nThank you for noticing that, narration prompt. As with all cold side additions or touches to your beer, you want to be sure that what you have has been thoroughly cleaned in order to not introduce wild bugs that can infect your product. There is also a common misconception on what sterilized actually means. Sterilized is any process in which you have removed the vast majority off all bacteria or other living micro organisms\\*, while sanitized is the same but to a lesser extent\\*. This can be done with heat (pasteurization), a chemical process, or by irradiating it (we will not be talking about this one for practical reasons). *(I don't know how to change this so people don't think mixing their fruit with StarSan is a viable procedure, so I'm leaving it so people DO NOT accidentally think a StarSan rinse is a viable activity. Hate mail bellow)* One thing that is not sterilization is cold, so everyone repeat after me:\n\n# FROZEN IS NOT STERILIZED*!!!!\n\n\\*(or sanitized, or what ever your word choice is)\n\nSome frozen fruit is pasteurized before the freezing process, but not all. This is mostly done with the larger fruit manufacturers as the stuff that's frozen is the planned left overs (or too ripe and won't survive shipping) from the harvest and they all get processed the same way. But even if they claim it's processed, [they might have missed a few bugs](https://imgur.com/ZQR1QNP). Because of this I still encourage you to sterilize your purchased fruit.\n\nYour friendly, local, organic, probably bearded, wearing a \"grow food not grass\" shirt producer at the farmer's market does not pasteurize their product and it will have wild bugs in it that can (not will, yeast tend to make things alcoholic to kill off potential competition) infect your beer. Cluster berries are the worst cause because of all the little grooves in them that you can't wash as well. Downvotes to the left and leave an angry comment about how you've only froze and never had an infection; I'm sure your luck will comfort the ones who did get a wild bug.\n\nThere are three common practices for ~~sterilizing~~ *sanitizing* the fruit: campden tabs, alcohol, and heat. But before we get there, we need to ready the fruit.\n\nHeat is simple where you get the crushed/juiced/whatever fruit to a steady 185 degrees for 30 or so minutes. All the sous vide wands make this process really easy. Do **NOT** boil as it will change your flavor. And if you're just going to boil, why not add it to the boil kettle? This is far from an ideal solution, but it works.\n\nCampden is my preferred method where you mash/juice/chop the fruit (freezing and thawing can make this easier) and add a crushed campden tab per gallon of liquid (this is referred to as must), then leave it out covered with a tea towel for a day or two to let the sulfur dissipate. I like this because it's the same method used for wine and keeps the delicate flavors heat can remove (even if the beer will hide some of those flavors) but it also takes less active time than simmering the solution.\n\nAlcohol is even easier, but more expensive and very easy to overdose. Soak the fruit in any distilled spirit (vodka for no flavor, other items if you want that flavor) for at least an hour, and toss it in. However, a bag of campden tabs is about $6 and you only need 1 tab per gallon of must, so it will last you through 100 gallons of fruit juice. Even Everclear is more expensive than that and less exact.\n\nNow that you have your ~~sterilized~~ *sanitized* fruit you can to add it to the beer.\n\n**Takeaways from this chapter:**\n\n* Frozen is not ~~sterilized~~ *sanitized* and can introduce sour bugs\n* Different sources give you different amounts of control of your product\n* Frozen is not ~~sterilized~~ *sanitized*\n* Quality ingredients drive quality products\n* Frozen is not ~~sterilized~~ *sanitized*\n\n# Adding the Fruit\n\nThere are 4 major ways to introduce fruit into your beer, in order of ease they are: boil, \"secondary\", blending, and keg.\n\n**BOIL**\n\nBoiling the fruit is by far the easiest and safest way of putting fruit in your beer. Not only does it sterilize (or sanitize, depends on how long it is in the boil) the fruit, it fully mixes it in with the wort and adds nothing else to your processes. If using frozen you can even use it as a way to help bring down your temp when trying to cool the beer.\n\nThe problems with this method is that you will lose some of the more delicate aromas of the fruit as they get blown out of the airlock, and because they were boiled you can get a bit of a cooked flavor. You can play with this cooked fruit flavor and have a MO with biscuit and victory for a pie beer. But it's still a workable choice if you just want it one and done or you have limited everything.\n\nHowever, there's a reason no one cooks their fruit in any other fermentation hobby.\n\n**\"SECONDARY\"**\n\nThe most popular way to add fruit is by adding it to your beer after primary fermentation has slowed or stopped. No need to actually transfer the beer to another vessel though, just put the fruit in a muslin bag and set it in your fermenter. It will kick off a secondary fermentation because of the new sugars and run along.\n\n[My process is to pour in your sterilized must into the fermenter through a muslin bag,](https://imgur.com/a/4fV9dNo) tie the bag off, and tie a piece of unflavored, waxed floss to it for when it sinks. The bag will let the liquid in and out just fine while containing the fruit pieces. This way when fermentation is done you can just pull the floss to remove the bag and not worry about clogging your siphon.\n\n**BLENDING**\n\nBlending is the same process used to make a mediocre sour and and undrinkable sour become a lot of mediocre sour. The actual theory is simple: make two things, put them together until it becomes what you want it to be. For fruit beer it means you need to make a dry wine along side your beer with minimal additions (maybe even during the mash, you have the downtime) and when both complete you start playing mad scientist by combining them until it tastes like what you want.\n\nThe obvious downside to this process is that you need to have two fermentations going at once, which means you need twice as much gear. But for everything that makes this difficult, you get rewarded by absolute control over your final product...\n\nOr as much control as one can hope for with brewing.\n\n**KEG**\n\nRemember way back when I said fermented fruit tastes different and there's no way to get that flavor? Well, I lied. The one way to get that sweet fruit flavor in your beer is to kill off all your yeast and keg the beer (you could bottle it, but it will be flat). Once again we're stealing a wine process: stabilizing.\n\nJust before you sterilize your fruit, put the similarly dosed one crushed campden tab per gallon of beer in your fermenter and mix it up good. Let it sit a day to stun and kill your yeast. After a day put in 1/2 tsp per gallon of potassium sorbate into your sterilized beer and let it sit another day. Add your must, mix, and cold crash to drop all of the particulates. Then it is completely safe to keg.\n\n*Wait, when just adding fruit it was okay to add campden, why are we now adding sorbates?*\n\nThe problem with modern, commercial yeast is that is has been cultivated next to campden and other sulfites for so long that they've started developing immunities to them. They won't die to the chemical, but they can be stunned. This is why you need sorbates. The few remaining yeasties that do survive the campden treatment will then bind to the potassium sorbate and stop their replication process. So while they will consume a bit of the sugar present  when adding the must, they won't duplicate and will just fade away.\n\n**Takeaways from this chapter:**\n\n* All of the processes work, some just sacrifice ease of use for flavor or more control\n* Because they all have different end flavors, some processes are better than others for getting your final result (u/EngineeredMadness will hate me for this, but I do like the cooked flavor in that raspberry pie beer I alluded to earlier. Don't need to worry about pectic haze if it's already dark and creamy)\n* I swear by that muslin bag trick, and it works great with a Big Mouth Bubbler EVO 1\n\n# FAQ and personal notes\n\nFavorite gear is the plastic Big Mouth Bubbler EVO 1 because it has the slip ring I can lock the muslin bag into. Makes pouring easier. EVO 2 they changed it to a gasket and looks like it would make for a terrible seal.\n\nFavorite yeast is Wyeast 3638 (Bavarian Wheat) because it has hints of tropical fruits instead of the normal banana bomb. Otherwise US-05 (Chino) because it is so clean.\n\nGrain bill of choice is 70% pils or 2 Row and 30% white wheat. Doesn't get in the way of the fruit and normally I want the fruit center stage.\n\nBest recipe was a chocolate raspberry stout. 5 lbs of raspberries were used and one of those batches was my first sour; not by choice.\n\n*I made a fruit beer and it was cloudy, even after cold crashing.* That was probably pectic haze. Fruit has a thing called pectin (like what you need to make jelly) that can be a pain to get rid of. The two best ways to have a clear product is to **NOT BOIL THE FRUIT** (it releases and binds pectin, making it more visible), and to add pectic enzyme to break it apart. You should only need a quarter tsp (or half ounce (or 15 grams (ooo, triple parenthesis))) of pectic enzyme for 5 gallons of product. Just be sure you don't use it within 12 hours of campden because those two chemicals can mess with each other.\n\nWatermelon wine tastes like you're chewing on the rind and I am so happy I made it rather than just tossing the fruit in a beer.\n\nYes, I did make a pumpkin peach ale after that Super Bowl commercial and I am still upset by that beer because the puree wasn't cheap.\n\nI love r/prisonhooch for what it is and don't want them to change a thing.\n\nIf you think I'm talking out of my ass and you've had no issues with frozen, then you do you. I'm not going to show up to your brew day and berate you about your process. But I will bring beer if I am invited. I just want more better beer in this world and sometimes that means mitigating risks by inconveniencing ourselves.\n\n~~Everyone seems so hung up on the usage of \"sterilized\" because it's not~~ *~~technically~~* ~~sterilized. Well, good thing we're making booze in our kitchens and driveways; not writing papers for a lab journal. Silver to whoever can get me a better word that doesn't make readers think a StarSan rinse or just freezing is a viable solution.~~\n\n# Edits\n\n* Clarified my BMB to be EVO 1.

        "body": "**DO NOT BOIL OR COOK FRUIT.**\n\nFor heaven's sake.  I even got this question asked at the ask-the-experts panel at NHC.  It's not a good method, it kills flavor and gives you permanent pectin haze.  It's not a good option for process, and people kick it around because it's the only thing they know from making beer.\n\n**There is no hot process in wine making or cider making.  Save for bochet, there's no hot process in mead making.  Aseptic fruit is flash pasteurized or irridiated, which is a process you cannot do at home.**\n\nI really want to put this one to rest.  Wash the fruit, use campden, do a freeze thaw (for juice yield).  These are the proven methods that work, everything else is sub par.  If anything, for fringe/atypical technique, there's proven industry research for both chlorine and acid-rinse (star san/phosphoric) baths for 3 log reduction in bacterial load (somewhere in my post history).\n\nAlso, I really wouldn't recommend blending a stock wine recipe with beer.  Stock fruit wines/recipes will have some tannins and acid added, as well as sugar to \\~12% ABV.

We follow sanitary procedures, but not sterilization procedures.  If we want to be pedantic about it, there is a significant difference.  But we are not working in a sterile environment.  Using a muslin bag? not remotely sterile.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSource: I do a shit ton of fruit and grape wines  \n\n\nMore edits: That being said there are some good points in this about fruits do not taste what you think they taste like without sugar.

If you don't know where to start, track down muscato grapes or juice for white or merlot for red for a forgiving starting point, flavor and cost wise.",

I'm pretty new to brewing, but a couple of things here I wanted to get some more clarification on or I guess just discuss in greater detail.\n\nFirst, I haven't brewed beer with honey, but I've done a couple of meads and including that in your list of problematic additions is a bit baffling to me. Sure, it's great fermentation fuel, but even when I've got up to 15-16% ABV in a dry mead people who have never tasted mead before say they are surprised at how well the honey comes through. True, there isn't much else going on in a mead besides the honey and a few flavor additions (especially compared to beer), but I figure the much lower alcohol tolerance of beer yeast strains would mean there's much more unfermented honey left over for you to taste. Am I not thinking about this correctly? I guess there's a lot less honey added in a beer than a mead, but you've still got a lot of other sugars in wort for yeast to chew on.\n\nSecond, why do you need to sanitize fruit additions at all? Even at relatively low percentages of alcohol, aren't pretty much all of the \"bugs\" that could potentially grow in wort being killed off? I've heard from a lot of experienced brewers and sources for fruit additions that it's unnecessary to sanitize fruit additions unless you've picked the fruit wild and often then you just need to clean the fruit, not really sanitize it.",

    "body": "Part 2 based on u/winwinnwinnie’s comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/Hair/comments/t82slz/mending_split_ends_part_2_with_castor_oilsebacic/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nYou can temporarily mend split ends together with the ingredients polyquaternium-28 and PVM/MA copolymer. Most products that claim to mend split ends don’t have these two ingredients. Also, both ingredients are required for the mending to work and withstand other stresses like combing. \n\n#Here’s the study done on these two ingredients showing the semi permanent mending effects: \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/6111412_Semi-permanent_split_end_mending_with_a_polyelectrolyte_complex\n\n##Brief explanation:\n\nThe cationic, anti static ingredient **polyquaternium-28** is attracted to the anionic ingredient **PVM/MA copolymer**. The idea is that damage and split ends are anionic so the polyquaternium-28 is attracted to them and will bind them together until it is washed out. In the study, these two ingredients were shown to bind together split ends and also withstood the stress of combing.\n\n#Here are some products I FINALLY found that have these two ingredients:\n\n#[Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum 4 oz ($20)](https://www.frendsbeauty.com/kim-kimble-healed-ends-serum-4oz.html)\n\nIngredients: \n\nWater (Aqua), **Polyquaternium-28**, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Arctium Majus Root (Burdock) Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail Extract, Malva Sylvestris (Mallow) Flower Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Saccharum Officinaru (Sugarcane) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Lactic Acid, Ethylhexyglycerin, Betaine, Hexylene Glycol, **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Dimethicone PEG-8 Meadowfoamate, Hexapeptide-11, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nThis one has **polyquaternium-28** as the 2nd ingredient, then some oils, a bunch of extracts, then the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 17th ingredient. Phenoxyethanol as the preservative is fine here since it is being used on the ends, not on the scalp.\n\n#[Color Proof SuperRich Split Ends Mender 3.4 oz ($11)](https://www.beautyplussalon.com/color-proof-superrich-split-ends-mender)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Glycerin, **Polyquaternium-28**, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum, Fragrance (Parfum), **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxypropyl Cyclodextrin, Polysorbate 80, Caprylyl Glycol, Linalool, Citric Acid, Limonene, Sorbitan Oleate, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Citronellol, Citral, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Quaternium-95, Propanediol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Extract, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Hydrolyzed Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Lentinus Edodes Extract, Tocopherol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Benzoate, BHT, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate.\n\nThis ingredients list is interesting, **polyquaternium-28** as the 3rd ingredient is awesome, but the 4th, 5th, and 6th ingredients are two preservatives and a fragrance. That’s fine, as xanthan gum is also a thickener. Then the 7th ingredient is the **PVM/MA copolymer**. Then there’s a bunch of emollients and extracts and another preservative that is annoying to see in products. \n\n##This one contains Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, a **formaldehyde releasing preservative**. This is fine, as the formaldehyde is how it preserves the product, but it is always good to be aware of these things, so you don’t let the bottle sit for a very long time, as this ingredient **releases formaldehyde slowly over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[White Sands The Cure 24/7 Serum 3.38 oz ($20)](https://sleekshop.com/products/white-sands-the-cure-24-7-serum.html?sku=whs09-3-38-oz)\n\nIngredients:\n\nDeionized Water, **Polyaualerium-28**, **PVMMA Copolymer**, Xanthan Gum, Caprylic/Capric Acid, Triglyceride, Cyrribidium Grandilorioum Flower, Propylene Glycol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate, Fragrance.\n\nThis one has a much more simple ingredients list! **Polyquaternium-28** is the second ingredient and the **PVM/MA** copolymer is the third ingredient. Then there is xanthan gum to thicken and preserve. \n\n##However, again, at the end of this list we have **formaldehyde releasing preservatives**: **Diazolidinyl Urea and Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate.** Again, this is fine, but good to be aware of so you don’t let the bottle sit for a year, as these preservatives **slowly release formaldehyde over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[OGX Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream 6 oz ($9)](https://www.ulta.com/p/locking-coconut-curls-air-dry-cream-pimprod2005306)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater (Aqua), Tapioca Starch, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Polyquaternium-37, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Polyquaternium-28**, **PVM/VA Copolymer**, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Lecithin, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nHere we have tapioca starch to reduce any heavy oily feel. Then some emollients and oils. Then **polyquaternium-28** as the 7th ingredient and the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 8th ingredient. Then there’s some more emollients and then the preservative and a fragrance. Phenoxyethanol is a fine because this is for use on the end of the hair, not the scalp. \n\nSo there you have it. You can semi-permanently mend your split ends. It took a LONG time for me to find products that actually had the *combitnation* of BOTH of these ingredients. \n#So if anyone else finds more products that contain polyquaternium-28 and PVM/MA copolymer, please share here!\n\nAlso, for those that can’t tell, the links are imbedded in the title of the product. So, for example, you can click on the title Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum at the top of the post and it will take you to the website. The links are imbedded in every title",

    "body": "Companies sometimes share the percentage retinol they use, but it's good to realize this is sometimes not the percentage of the pure retinol, but of a mixture.\n\nPhrases like \"1% coated retinol\" , \"a 1% retinol complex serum\" or we use \"0.5% slow release retinol\" are indicications they could be referring to a mixture/complex. Percentages like 2.5% or 3% are very unlikely pure retinol. There are also products that mention retinol in the product name, while the products doesn't contain retinol, but a derivative like Retinyl Palmitate.\n\nCompanies may list everything below 1% in random order, so often they try to get that 1% line high up on the ingredient list, and then list the actives first to make it look more potent. You could try to spot that 1% line, it can be helpful to determine wether the % is referring to a mixture or to the actual pure retinol. You can also look for ingredients on the inci list that are used in these standard retinol mixtures, commonly used coated/mixture forms can for example be found here:\n\n[https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1)\n\nSome ingredients that are commonly used at or below 1%:  Phenoxyethanol, Parabens, Levulinic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, EDTA's, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Carbomer,  Hyaluronic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Ubiquinone, Peptides, Retinoids, Ceramides, Fragrance, most plant extracts in powder form etc.\n\n\n\n**First example, M. Asam Retinol 1% Intense:**\n\n* Claim: 1% retinol in encapsulated form\n* Indications it's not 1%: Retinyl Palmitate is usually used below 0.3%. Polyurethane Crosspolymer-1 and Glycine Soja Oil are part of RetiCap PF, most likely this serum contains 0.08% Retinol.\n* Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, **Retinyl Palmitate, Retinol,** Panthenol, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, **Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil**, Tocopherol, Lauroyl Lysine, Dipentaerythrityl Pentaisononanoate, Carbomer, Polyglyceryl- 10 Laurate, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, **Polyurethane Crosspolymer- 1,** Caprylyl Glycol, Bht, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Second example, Inkey List Retinol Serum:**\n\n* Claim: 1% stable retinol and 0.5% granactive retinoid\n* Indications it's not 1%: Tocopherol, Carbomer in general are not used above 1%. Caprylyl Glycol in combination with other preservatives is in general not used above 1%, this means there's less than 1% Dimethyl Isosorbide (part of) Granactive Retinoid, which contains 10% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, so 0.05% in this formula. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (and) Sodium Ascorbate (and) Tocopherol (and) retinol is called RetiSTAR. This contains 5% Retinol, so at 1%, there's 0.05% retinol in this formula. So 1.5% total retinoid, no not really, more likely it's 0.1% max.\n* Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Caprylyl Glycol,** Phospholipids, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Squalane, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Extract, **Carbomer**, Sodium Ascorbate, **Tocopherol,** Polysorbate 60, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycolipids, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol,** Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Third example,**[Dr Brandt 2% Retinol serum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26OFz0DakQc&t=0m13s)**:**\n\n* claim 2% Retinol Complex\n* Why it's not 2%: Tocopherol and Phenoxyethanol are not used above 1%. Could be  \"Retinol C50 by Amcol\" or \"Iuvenesens® B-15\". So most likely 0.3% at most. Think about how the fancy packaging and marketing makes you think this is really worth $70. With all the fragrance ingredients lie Limonene, Grapefruit Oil and Lavender Oil it's best to skip this product.\n* Water, Glycerine, Dicaprylylcarbonaat, Isoamyl Lauraat, Cyclopentasiloxaan, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Boter, Shea Butter Cetyl Esters, Triheptanoin, **Tocoferol, Phenoxyethanol,** Behenyl Alcohol, Methylpropaandiol, Glycerylstearaatcitraat, Polysorbaat 20, Natriumacrylaten Copolymeer, **Retinol,** Glycerylstearaat , Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Limonene, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, etc...\n\n**Fourth example, Sunday Riley A+ High Dose 6.5% Retinoid :**\n\n* Claim: 5% retinoid ester, 1% liposomal-encapsulated retinol, 0.5% blue-green algea\n* Probably the 5% refers to Granactive Retinoid, you can't use 50% of this, so that means there's 0.5% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Which seems correct since the 1% line is around Diheptyl Succinate, and Dimethyl Isosorbide is the 3th ingredient. The Retinol is less than 1%, it's liposomal encapsulated, so this could be \"Iuvenesens® B-15\" as well, probably this means there's about 0.2% Retinol at most. So instead of the claimed 6.5% Retinoid, for $85 you are actually getting 0.2% retinol, 0.5% HPR with no indepedant studies on it's anti aging properties, and some unproven plant extract.\n* Water/Eau/Agua, Propanediol, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Triheptanoin, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Hexyldecanol, Disiloxane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Diheptyl Succinate, Propylene Carbonate, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate**, PPG-24-Glycereth-24, Phenyl Trimethicone, **Retinol, Ubiquinone (CoQ10),** Honey Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Algae Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Opuntia Ficus-indica Fruit Extract, Bisabolol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Phospholipids**, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Lecithin, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, 4-t- Butylcyclohexanol, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Helianthus Annuss (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitol, Cetylhydroxyproline Palmitamide, Polysilicone-11, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Polysorbate, Hydroxyphenyl Propamidobenzoic Acid, Stearic Acid, Brassica Campestris Sterols, PVP, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Alcohol, Potassium Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, **Tocopherol**\n\n**Fifth example: Indeed labs Retinol Reface:**\n\n* Claim 1% retinoid fluid, 1% retinol time release complex encapsulated, 3% retinol like peptides\n* Looking at the position of Dimethyl Isosorbide, there's most likely 1% Granactive Retinoid, so 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Retinol is under the 1% line, I'm not completely sure which form is used but could be Retinol 10S, so this means 0.1% final concentration. Xanthan Gum in normal viscosity products is usually something like 0.2%. Peptides at 3%, this mixture contains 100ppm and 50ppm, so 0.0003% and 0.00015% respectively. So instead of thinking to get 5% pure actives, you are getting something like 0.2%.\n* Water, Dimethicone, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Cetearyl Glucoside, Peg-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, **Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol**, Sodium Acrylate/sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, **Xanthan Gum**, Glycine **Soja (Soybean) Oil, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,** Polysorbate 80, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, **Retinol**, **Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Acacia Senegal Gum, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Tocopherol\n\n**Cerave Skin Renewing Retinol Serum**\n\n* Claim: encapsulated Retinol\n* They don't mention any percentage, but it is below 1%. They could have used ROVISOME Retinol Moist,  Water (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Alcohol (and) **Retinol** (and) Polysorbate 20 (and) Potassium Phosphate. This contains 3% retinol, most likely used at 1-2%, there's 0.03-0.06% actual retinol. So if that is correct I think this is more a beginners retinol.\n* Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, **Polysorbate 20**, Peg-40 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, **Potassium Phosphate,** **Ceramide Np**, Ceramide Ap, Ceramide Eop, Carbomer, Niacinamide, Isoceteth-10, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Triethanolamine**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cichorium Intybus Root Extract / Chicory Root Extract, **Lecithin**, **Retinol,** Silica, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, **Alcohol,** Hydroxyacetophenone, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, **Pentylene Glycol,** Xanthan Gum, Phytosphingosine, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter / Shea Butter, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**The Ordinary Granactive 2% Emulsion**\n\n* uses [InuMax Advanced Retinol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/la/PersonalCare/Detail/2163/637871/InuMax-Advanced-Retinol)\n\nAnd to add one more thing besides the vague percentage marketing, remember that Retinol is very, very unstable. It's very difficult to formulate with pure retinol. So it's understandable companies work with premixed complexes. Though even with these complexes as a consumers you can't be 100% sure it stays stable during the whole shelf life. Some products use dropper bottles or tubes that allow air in formula, and products may have been stored for months in warehouses and stores. It can be fine, but as a consumer it's difficult to know for sure. Remember that for PAO and shelf life stability, tests are done to measure things like bacterial/yeast growth, shifting, pH fluctuations. Doing a stability assay to determine the degradation of specific actives in a formula is **not** a mandatory part of that. PAO and shelf life are thus not a 100% guarantee the actual actives remain stable and effective. If you want something OTC, adapalene is much more stable and you don't have to worry wether you are getting the right percentage, it's a standardized proven formula. It doesn't bind to all receptors and is mainly proven for it's anti acne benefits, but the results for it's anti-aging benefits are promising. Other option could be a Retinaldehyde or a Retinol product that is formulated by a larger well known company, is in airless packaging, and which you store in a fridge at home. \n\n\"It can be difficult to discern the concentrations of OTC retinol and retinaldehyde in a given product as there is no labeling requirement in the  USA to list these concentrations. In general, irritation is a biomarker of efficacy, and formulations that do not produce irriation are unlikely to have significant effects. In addition it is advisable to steer patients toward larger, well-established cosmetics companies with a good reputation. Brandname products from companies that have rigorous quality control and regulations are preferred over products from small manufacturers. Because retinol is a fairly unstable compound and requires proper packaging and storage conditions to maintain efficiency, there can be great variability among preparations.[Cutaneous Photoaging, Watson,  Griffiths, 2019](https://books.google.nl/books?id=6reqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=adapalene+photo+aging&source=bl&ots=AkWsbaI5qq&sig=ACfU3U1l2wWZkLfx3P1VHkbLM_ZyfdoopQ&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjahICuw_znAhXDzaQKHS13DLI4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=adapalene%20photo%20aging&f=false)\" --> to add one thing to this, some studies also indicate that when retinol degrades it becomes more irritating to skin, so irritation is not always a good marker.\n\n\nPersonally I think if you want to be sure, go for prescription tretinoin, that is proven and effective, and often more affordable than retinol as well. Otherwise some options below. \n\n* UK: Dermatica - \"otc\" tretinoin\n\n* US: Curology - \"otc\" tretinoin or Adapalene\n\n* [Paula's Choice 1% Retinol Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice.com/clinical-1pct-retinol-treatment/801.html) - $58/30mL\n\n* [Avene RetrinAl 0.1% Retinaldehyde](https://www.aveneusa.com/retrinal-intensive-cream) - $70/30mL\n\n* [Geek&Gorgeous 0.05% Retinaldehyde](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/a-game-5) $13.50/30mL",

Because with a brief look earlier I saw the Palmitamide MEA in it and thought it's one of the ceramides (the names are so similar haha!). However, today I saw incidecoder mentioning it as just a viscosity controlling ingredient (and I usually find them quite accurate), but more things came up where I saw something from mdedge [here](https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/74188_main.pdf) stating \"Palmitamide MEA (PEA) is an important component of MimyX nonsteroidal cream, Dr. Smith said. PEA is an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties\" but this doctor has a consulting agreement with Stiefel Labs, which manufactures Physiogel. Also came across this [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/) but it's testing a synthetic ceramide PC-104 in combination with other things like Palmitamide MEA, grapeseed extract etc. Plus, I remember reading an AMA from kindofstephen where he said \" I think most cosmetic companies would attribute patents as a marketing cost. Most novel patents I've seen in the cosmetic industry are to deal with delivery vehicles (like an airless soft container, etc)\". My takeaway is things can be patented even if they're not doing too much, because to consumers it seems like it's doing a lot? And now idk if this ingredient/Physiogel is any good as a ceramide cream or it's just a good plain heavy moisturiser.\n\nEdit: Realised this ingredient is present in Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume, along with SK-Influx, where it's described as \"Atoderm Intensive Baume quickly stops itching and reduces the urge to scratch thanks to its anti-itching dermatological active ingredient PEA\"\n\nMy understanding is Physiogel doesn't have any ceramides or cholesterol/phytosterols (looks like Zeroid uses phytosterols in place of cholesterol?), but has PEA as a fatty acid (skin similar ingredient), so it must be a good moisturiser but not an ideal-ratio ceramide moisturiser.",

When I went to buy another bottle they send me to [this product instead](https://www.amazon.com/Usumacinta-Mexican-Vanilla-Blend-Ounces/dp/B016SIPJ76) The ingredients in this Mexican vanilla blend are: Vanilla Bean Extractives in Water, Vanilla Bean Pod, Alcohol, Caramel Color, Potassium Sorbate (preservative), Sugar, Sodium Benzoate (preservative) If anyone can shed some light on this issue that would be great.\n\nFollow up questions: What is your favorite vanilla extract brand?

A bottle of vanilla extract necessarily includes something other than just a bean. I'm guessing the company got caught by regulators and was forced to properly label their product. It's probably exactly the same product as before, only now it accurately states what's in the bottle. Before they were just lying to you.\n\nVanilla comes up here from time to time. It generates strong opinions, much of it unsubstantiated by taste tests or any real evidence. There *have* been taste tests over the years by Serious Eats and ATK/Cook's Illustrated. The conclusion of both was clear: cheap and artificial is perfectly fine for most baking purposes. If you're making something where the vanilla extract won't be cooked - like ice cream or custard - it may be worth investing in expensive, pure extract from Nielsen-Massey or other vendors. But for your chocolate chip cookies, just buy that big cheap bottle of McCormick from the supermarket. You're going to cook off all the volatile nuances anyway.",

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae](https://preview.redd.it/04x8cx1jvsy81.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db29ff28ad9fbcd3ff56a158d60e872ed63cb538)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\nand that's all from my side! I know its not much but then again kangaal haalaat mein kharidaari mushkil hai 💀. anyway, here's a list ss that I do want to try once this lot is finished:\n\n* sunscoop sunscreen serum (only if dermaco doesnt work lmao. really intrigued)\n* Face shop sunscreens (itne variants . ek try karne ka mann hai 😖)\n* beauty of joseon rice ss (stock mein aaja bhai 😫)\n* missha sun aqua gel and essence (bas aise hi lol)\n\nI've also tried the neutrogena ultra sheer, episoft , a few banana boat ones but way long ago so I don't clearly remember them to give the verdict on them. just if I haven't repurchased them, consider that they didn't work well for me.\n\nhope this was informational and you guys enjoyed! if you still have any other questions related to the product above, feel free to comment!",

Pictured above.\n\n**Fragrance:**  ~~Yes. An extremely artificial flowery scent. Dissipates, but I find it slightly annoying while applying.~~. None. \n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:** Got this when my previous gel moisturiser got over. I had already used the other 3 and I started using this with fairly high expectations. And I was / am disappointed. **It's not bad. It moisturises**. But I was expecting a jelly like moisturiser that sinks in easily while still packing a moisture -filled punch. And this is not that. It takes way longer than I'd like to sink in.  I either have to compromise on the quantity I use and the moisturised feeling or go around feeling oiler than I would like. It's the kind of product that does everything to some level, but none of them spectacularly or to an above average level.\n\nAs far as healing for barrier damage is concerned, I get way faster results from the other three Bioderma moisturisers and I pretty much never touch this for that purpose after the initial trial period.\n\nThis does have a few de-pigmenting ingredients, but so far I've not been able to see anything results that I can directly attribute to this product.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:**  Moisturised feeling. I've used this with actives that are known to cause dryness and faced no issues. It can handle drying actives. No glow noticed. No standout effects.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:**  Can't think of anything. If you start using this with low / zero expectations, you'll probably like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status:**  Jury's still out, haven't decided. But as of now it's a **Will Not Repurchase.**\n\n\n***Additional Notes on whether the product is fake****\n\n**Tl;dr: Old tube is genuine, NOT FAKE.  Confirmed by brand too. Review still stands**\n \n\nOn 24th October 2023\n\n1. Some people's experiences does not coincide with mine in important ways such as fragrance and I'm now wondering if mine was a fake, I contacted Bioderma but haven't received any info yet. But I'll update and or delete the review when I do get it. \n\n2 Of 5 people, 4 can't smell anything from their product and 1 can (but doesn't sound similar to my description. & Bioderma still hasn't replied :(\n\nOn 1st November 2023\n\n1. Bioderma replied on Instagram that my moisturiser is genuine, By the time they replied, I had already repurchased another tube from Tira, to check for myself. The new tube has already arrived and they are identical in all ways. Including from the same batch 😅. \n\n2. New tube arrived with bioderma samples, which jogged my memory. Old tube had also arrived with samples. Two of which I still have unopened. So chances of old tube being fake is 0.\n\n2. But the smell was still different. My old tube smells like a flower. My new one doesn't smell of anything, unless I put copious amounts on my arm and put my nose in it and even then it smells like a teeny bit chemically, Thats all. I can understand why most people say it smells like nothing, because that's what I would have said too, if I wasn't looking that closely. \n\n3. Anyway, I was breaking my head trying to figure out why my old tube is has that smell, And then it struck me. I had a perfume leak incident in my travel kit many months ago. Most of the stuff is replaced and I don't still have that perfume, so I'd kind of forgotten. The tube was new then and I didn't use it enough to note the frag or lack thereof. I think the gel or top of the packaging still smells of the perfume and that's why I was mistaken. \n\nSo that was much ado about nothing, apologies. \n\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Atoderm Intensive baume\n\n**MRP:** 786 for 75 ml. Available in 45ml,  200 ml tube and  500 ml pump bottle.\n\n**Texture:** White Cream.  Pictured above.

It doesn't smell exactly like grease but it reminds me of grease. It's a dusty, chemically smell that I associate with Bioderma moisturisers. Like if you've smelled any of the Bioderma moisturisers, all except the gel-creme have the same DNA, though they are not exactly the same. It's not repulsive, but it's there. Does dissipate after a minute or so.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  I bought this on a whim after a few friends raved about it. They were so so so right. This was the second bioderma cream moisturiser I used, so I knew it would help with barrier issues but it does so much more. When I first used this, I had oily to combination skin and I never ever used cream moisturisers by choice. I had a misconception that since I was an acne / clog prone, oily skinned person, that I need to stay as far away from cream moisturisers as possible. This is the moisturiser than changed my mind.\n\nIf I want a one and done PM product when I'm too tired or too lazy or too whatever, I reach for it.\n\nIf I want a one and done travel moisturiser, this is the only one I pack.\n\nSuper dry climate, this is it.\n\nAirplane dryness, this is it.\n\nSlight tingling, or signs of barrier damage incoming, this is it.\n\nBarrier damage, this is it.\n\nDerm procedures, this is it.\n\nBut in even other scenarios such as humid climate or AM routine, where this is NOT my ideal or go-to product, it still does a decent job. It holds its own. It can be greasy but hey it can be worked with. It does an amazing job moisturising without clogging pores for me.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:**\n\nMoisturised feeling.  Super soft skin. Heals Barrier overnight depending on damaged your skin is. It's my tried and tested barrier recovery product.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The heaviness, I guess. Upto combination skin or barrier-damaged oily skin, it's fine. Very oily skinned people may want to avoid this for general use.\n\n**Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:** Have repurchased 3 or 4 times. Will continue to repurchase till it's discontinued. Love it. **Holy Grail.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Bioderma Sensibio Forte Rapid soothing cream\n\nMRP: 1499 for 40 ml.\n\n**Texture:** White Cream.  Pictured above. Heavy feeling on the skin.\n\n**Ingredient List :**  [Aqua/​Water/​Eau](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum)](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/paraffinum-liquidum), [Beeswax (Cera Alba)](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cera-alba), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Cetyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-alcohol), [Glycyrrhetinic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycyrrhetinic-acid), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [Palmitic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/palmitic-acid), [Stearic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/stearic-acid), [Sorbitan Sesquioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitan-sesquioleate),[Tocopheryl Acetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tocopheryl-acetate), [Mannitol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/mannitol), [Xylitol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/xylitol), [Rhamnose](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/rhamnose), [Fructooligosaccharides](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/fructooligosaccharides), [Laminaria Ochroleuca Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laminaria-ochroleuca-extract), 🌟[**Allantoin**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/allantoin)**, 🌟** [**Sodium Pca**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-pca), [Caprylyl Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylyl-glycol), [Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylic-capric-triglyceride), [Pentylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentylene-glycol),[1,2-Hexanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/1-2-hexanediol), [Carbomer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/carbomer), [Triethanolamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/triethanolamine)\n\n**Fragrance:**  Yes. A different version of that greasy smell.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  This was first prescribed by my then dermatologist for application after a MNRF session. And since then till Atoderm intensive baume came into my life, this was a re-buy. **Slightest irritation, and I used to apply it**. I have urticaria, this helped with many of my allergic reaction episodes. **Skin will feel greasy, but it was soothing at the same time.** As soon as the greasiness disappeared, I used to reapply. **This was never a daily use moisturiser for me.** I kind of used it like medicine. As and when needed, at the quantity, I needed. However the soothing it provides does overlap with the Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume and I've not repurchased this in more than a year. I simply use that, wherever I previously reached for this. I have a feeling this is a gold standard product for certain sub set of people who need a rich, soothing moisturiser, but for most of us, this can be a pass.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:** Moisturised feeling. Very soothing on irritated skin.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The heaviness, I guess. Upto combination skin or barrier-damaged oily skin, it's fine. Very oily skinned people may want to avoid this for general use. And the price. Damn expensive for 40 ml.\n\n**Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:** As of now, I don't miss it in my routine, so **WNRP.** Considering the price and the benefit from the others, unless you have sensitive skin or are advised by your derm to try this out, I'd skip it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Cicabio Crème\n\n**MRP:** 1399 for 40 ml\n\n**Texture:** Green tinged Lotion.  Pictured above. Feels heavy for a lotion.\n\n**Ingredient List :**[Aqua/​Water/​Eau](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Fructooligosaccharides](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/fructooligosaccharides), 🌟[**Zinc Oxide**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-oxide)**,** [Sorbitan Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitan-stearate), [PEG-30 Dipolyhydroxystearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-30-dipolyhydroxystearate), [Butylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butylene-glycol), [Polyacrylamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyacrylamide), [C13-14 Isoparaffin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c13-14-isoparaffin), [Laureth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-7), [Copper Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/copper-sulfate), 🌟 [**Mannitol**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/mannitol)**,** [Sodium Hyaluronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-hyaluronate), 🌟 [**Xylitol**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/xylitol)**,** [Zinc Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-sulfate), [Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Vine Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/vitis-vinifera-vine-extract), [Rhamnose](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/rhamnose),[Laureth-3](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-3), 🌟[**Asiaticoside**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/asiaticoside)**, 🌟**[**Madecassic Acid**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/madecassic-acid)**, 🌟** [**Asiatic Acid**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/asiatic-acid), [Hydroxyethylcellulose](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethylcellulose), [Acetyl Dipeptide-1 Cetyl Ester](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acetyl-dipeptide-1-cetyl-ester), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylic-capric-triglyceride), [Laminaria Ochroleuca Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laminaria-ochroleuca-extract)\n\n**Fragrance:** A subtler version of that greasy smell, a teeny bit herbal, to be this dissipates the quickest of all the bioderma moisturisers.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  😍 I love it. I love it only slightly lesser than Atoderm Intensive Baume and mostly because it's comparatively way more expensive. 😅.  I wouldn't use this daily, there's no need, but definitely a barrier saviour product. I wake up with such soft glowy skin even when it's damaged, like the healthy part of my skin feel look glowy even if skin damage texture is still there to an extent.\n\n***Comparing with baume, since I use them both for similar reasons :*** I originally had the impression this was heavier than Atoderm Intensive Baume and that it forms a suffocating seal on the skin. This isn't true under normal circumstances. It does feel suffocating when barrier is SEVERELY damaged but not otherwise. I applied this on half and the baume of half my face to check if there's any major difference and no. **No functional difference noticed.**\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:** Soothing, Healing, Moisturising, it does it all.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The price. And for a lotion consistency product it's quite heavy.\n\n**Repurchase Status**: When I started writing this review, this was going to be a WNRP, because between all of them, I'd only repurchase Atoderm Intensive Baume, but ngl, the more I thought about it, I find myself wavering. **This is a WRP.** I don't know when, but I'll probably come back to this at some point.\n\n# \n\n# Comparision\n\n***Ranking based on Use Case***\n\n||1st Choice|2nd Choice|3rd Choice|4th Choice|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|As an AM Moisturiser|None of them|Intensive Gel-creme|Intensive Baume|Sensibio Forte|\n|As an PM Moisturiser|Intensive Baume, Cicabio, Intensive Gel-creme, Sensibio Forte||||\n|Time taken for Healing|Cicabio|Sensibio Forte, Intensive Baume|Intensive Gel-creme||\n|Versatility (Can work for any of the above use cases in a pinch)|Intensive Baume|Intensive Gel-creme|Cicabio|Sensibio Forte|\n\nI've ranked them after considering the following factors (these are the most important deciding factors for me personally).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***As  AM Moisturiser:***\n\n**I would use absolutely none of them as an AM moisturiser.** That doesn't mean they can't be used as such. it's just that none of them absorb in minutes or 'set' when you use a normal amount or slather it on. They're all occlusive but not the matte kind. Intensive Gel-creme is the easiest one of them to use as an AM moisturiser.\n\nThis gif will show you how long it took for them to sink into my arm, which is way dryer than my skin. But caveat is that I don't always use a AM moisturizer (infact I very very rarely do), but i when I do, I slather it on like below. If you use a teeny teeny weeny bit, you might not face this issue. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/isq9941kddwb1.gif\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***As PM Moisturiser:***\n\nI can't actually decide I love them all. Atleast I love Intensive Baume, Sensibio Forte and Cicabio, but there's nothing to complain about the gel creme either. ✨ **Skin just looks so nourished with all the Bioderma moisturisers.** ✨  If you use only a tiny amount, all of them will sink in by morning. I like to slather them all on. And how much is absorbed by morning completely depends on how damaged my skin is. If I catch signs of barrier damage early and use them, they'll sink in. If I've completely wrecked my skin, there will be residue when I wake up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***On healing***\n\nTime taken for healing: shortest to longest, ranked above. But honestly, most people don't need a moisturiser stronger than Intensive Baume even for barrier damage.\n\n**Note on the likeliness of clogging pores and causing acne: I've personally not had breakouts from any of them. None of them caused acne for me.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\n👉🏾 All 4 moisturisers are good.\n\n👉🏾 For most people Sensibio Forte & Cicabio is not necessary. Unless you have facial wounds, surgery on your face, intensive derm procedures, very bad rosacea and are prescribed or recommended these, I'd say skip them.  People with sensitive skin may like them though.\n\n👉🏾 If you have oily skin, you might like Bioderma Intensive gel creme.\n\n👉🏾 Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume has ceramides, fatty acids and cholesterol. Ratio unknown, will link if I can find anything.\n\n👉🏾 I've seen a fair number of people mention that baume is heavy and breaks them out in this sub. Something to be aware of.\n\n👉🏾  If I had to suggest only one product, from the above, hands down it'll be Atoderm Intensive Baume and it's best cost - benefit wise too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Im going to buy the cica +arnica to try out next. The Atoderm Creme Ultra doesn't seem interesting enough to me to want to try. If I can get a mini or sample somewhere just to update this post, I'll do that.\n\nETA2: After writing so much I still like left somethings out , so I'm editing to add them. Apologies 🙏\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs with any other review, YMMV",

    "body": "I just want to preface this post by saying that I like Jaclyn Hill. I bought Champagne Pop when it first came out because 1) I wanted to support Jaclyn and 2) it looked like a beautiful highlighter in a color I don’t have. I thought the highlighter was going to be limited edition….it ended up being permanent and I felt silly to have woken up at a strange hour to order it. I don’t regret purchasing it because its my most used highlighter in my collection. \n\n\nRecently, I saw a review on the eyeshadow palette that is part of this new collection that JH did with Becca. This youtuber (Rita B) was disappointed with the disparity in formula between JH eye palette and other Becca palettes. \n\n\nIt seems as if Becca used cheaper ingredients and a standard formula to mass produce these palettes cheaper and quicker. They cut corners to make more money. So I got curious as to whether the formula for the highlighter was the same or different in the palette vs the single. Lo and behold – it’s DIFFERENT. In the JH face palette, MICA is the first ingredient, whereas in the single TALC is the first ingredient. This leads me to believe that Becca put more fillers in the Champagne pop in the face palette to save production costs. TALC is an additional ingredient in the blush Rose Spritz whereas its not in the regular blush formula. I’m disappointed to be honest.

For instance, while regular MAC brushes are handmade and typically use higher end fibres (real and synthetic), their holiday brush sets are always machine made and low quality fibres. Many companies use cheaper quality ingredients in palettes as the price is quite low for a large number of shades which is more of a pain in the ass to manufacture. A change in ingredients doesn't necessarily automatically equate to a lesser quality, but it's always a good idea to be wary of limited products. I always advise waiting out the first batch if you can, and then read reviews from people you trust or swatch it yourself if you can get the chance. Yes, it's not as exciting and sometimes brands market it in such a way that \"it might be your only chance\" - but it'll save you $$.",

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin.

I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F18 (umar badh gayi but dimaag nahi 💀)**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , acne (pustules, fungal and cystic) pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae ](https://preview.redd.it/fnjipguox9ma1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d880ff6b482ade3f03237375ef02cdd64fb4e3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( .

I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl  Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise!

I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet.

I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a  fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\n* **The Derma Co.** **1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum** \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\]\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 30 ml (bought from amazon)\n\n**For skin type** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid. fragrance free. really watery and leaves a dewy-shiny finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredient list** : Purified Water, Glycerin, Avena Strigosa Seed Extract, Lecithin, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Silica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Decyl Glucoside, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7 & Disodium EDTA.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was....okay-ish? idk but I was really excited for this since their HA sun gel is one of my HGs. This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less 😖 if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would  get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation.

I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop 😭. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :(  but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nupdate : this ones a hard no for me. is it calming? yes. but the whitecast is too much. and when i sweat it literally looks like I'm secreting milk from my skin  (~~nipple)😭😭~~\n\n**rating** : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/​PPG-10/​1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is 🔥🔥🔥. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool 🤤 only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure! in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty 😖 I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao 😌 so you can guess I go out a lot heheh. I feel like this one is getting over sooner than others in my ss ki theli 😫 but either way, if you find a good deal on it, blindly add this to your cart and order it. you wont be dissappointed!\n\nrating : 5/5 and WRP on reduced mrp only.\n\n* **Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun : Rice + Probiotics (SPF50+ PA++++)**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1530 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1200 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : dry, sensitive, acne prone and combination\n\n**texture and appearance** : creamy white lotion (ya nasty-). unscented ( ha, ha , aur socho ashleel cheeze 🤡)\n\n**ingredients list :**   Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Water, Glycerin, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Behenyl Alcohol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Sodium Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Water, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/​VP Copolymer, Polyisobutene, Silica, Caprylyl/​Capryl Glucoside, Sorbitan Oleate, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Bifida Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacillus Ferment,Streptococcus Thermophilus Ferment\n\n**filters :**\n\n* uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nthis deserves all the hype it gets on the net. my current and forever HG sunscreen (unless they change formulation). seriously this ticks all the boxes . no whitecast? check. great filters? check. doesn't make you face look like you rub pan grease on it? check. it absorbs so well and is more moisturizing than some of the moisturizers out there. obviously, wished we would get more quantity for the price paid but itna criticise karne ke baad bhi, brands toh behre hai 😔and on reapplication, doesnt feel like im doing the 100 layers challenge lol. plus , I don't feel regret when applying it these days, cuz no fear of sunscreen melting during winters (#rajailife) . *taareef karu kya uski, jisneee tujhe banayaaaa✨\\~*\n\n**rating :** 5/5 and forever HG\n\n* **Benton Mineral Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 15g (haalat kharab biros). got it at 30% on beauty barn\n\n**For skin types** : normal and sensitive skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : a white stick. that's it. kind of a really thick lotion like texture. unscented and smol. mineral sunstick.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Coco-caprylate/caprate, sunflower seed wax, propylene glycol dicaprylate, H-di/trimethylol hexyllactone cross polymer, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, titanium dioxide, dicaprylyl carbonate, Synthetic fluorphlogopite, vinyl dimethicone, microcrystalline wax, aluminum stearate, polyhydroxystearic acid, purslane extract, centella extract, sodium hyaluronate, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, sodium Acetylated hyaluronate, caprylic/capric triglyceride, polyglyceryl-4diisostearate/polyhydroxystearate/sebacate, silica, alumina, pentylene glycol, allantoin, panthenol, Glycerin, Madecassic Acid, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Xylyl Glucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Glucose, Glyceryl Caprylate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Stearic Acid, Tocopherol, Purified Water, 1, 2-hexanediol, ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**filters** :\n\n* titanium dioxide\n\nthis one came around the same time as the tocobo sunstick on beauty barn so being the ✨phisool kharchi wala baccha✨, I bought both of them. unfortunately , this one was a big letdown. how tf can a sunstick leave a whitecast? this one is a great example. first off, it requires a lot of pressing and dragging across the face to dispense , so not fond of that, especially when I have active acne. secondly, it legit looks like someone rubbed fair and lovely mixed with water on my face 💀. its not waterproof, expensive for the quantity you get and gives a disappointing finish and result. I'm not particularly sure about protection against sun on this one but oh well. also piddu si stick hai so kind of cute but lootne wala hai lmao\n\n**rating** : 2/5 and WNRP\n\n* **Tocobo** **Cotton Soft Airy Sun Stick SPF50 Pa++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1550 for 20g (bought at 1100 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily, combination, acne prone skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale blue long cylinderical like stick. has a really pleasant and soft floral fragrance . leaves a matte fininsh and doesnt feel greasy on apllication. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list :**  Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Niacinamide, Tromethamine, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Pentylene Glycol, Polysilicone-15, Vigna Radiata Seed Extract, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Extract, Sophora Flavescens Root Extract, Rheum Palmatum Root/Stalk Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Oenothera Biennis (evening primrose) Flower Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Seed Oil, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Fragrance\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* titanium dioxide (physical filter)\n\nprobably the only sun stick that comes even close to the isntree sun stick. this gives such a good matte finish without any greasy feel . plus has cute floral smell to it that doesn't transfer to your skin or anything. and damn what a bang for a buck. probably the closest dupe for the isntree one. the only con is that it kind of pills after the 3rd application and rubs of oily after a while. if you are a person who touches their face every once in a while (like my dumbass), you might find it a bit uncomfortable. that being said, most of the times I just blot the grease away after 3-4hrs of application and apply another layer afterwards. sun protection wise, it does a good job! my forehead is the area that is the most prone to getting tan and it looked quite even toned after 3 weeks of consecutive use. one of my most favorite sticks (😏)\n\n**rating** : 4.5/5 and lets seeee\n\n* **Neutrogena beach defense sun stick water + sun protection SPF 50+**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs 1260 for 42 g (got it at Rs. 900 from amazon)\n\n**for skin types** : honestly, none lmao. I used it as a body stick most of the time with how oily this was. but can be used by anyone ig\n\n**texture and appearance** : whitish yellow stick. has a fruity kind of smell. really oily and greasy on first application that doesn't absorb or goes away after a while.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Polyethylene, Isohexadecane, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Ozokerite, Paraffin, Synthetic Beeswax, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Neopentyl Glycol Diisostearate, Dimethicone, Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Fragrance, BHT\n\n**filters** :\n\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n\noof this was an impulse purchase that I regretted later on. mind you, this is a great sunstick for your body but definitely not for your face . not to mention its waterproof . but the tapti garmi really just melts everything in its way and this is no exception. bhai itna chip chipa lagta hai i dont even feel like putting this on just because of the MoIsT feeling it gives. unless you're going to a pool or beach (as it suggests duh) , if you're okay with feeling like [that peanut butter baby](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.ie%2Flife%2Ffamily%2Fthis-peanut-butter-baby-is-sure-to-brighten-up-your-day-31499579.html&psig=AOvVaw0Qc7SXcD436wP5Ywrn_yJv&ust=1678212392776000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCIDzt77yx_0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) , then you can give it a try. it  does provide a good amount of product for the price and is a solid waterproof one fosho. but nahi jhela jata for some reason 😣😣😫\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\nme after buying and trying all of these to find my HG\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zzjpjrbly9ma1.gif\n\nbut it was fun doing this in a span of a few years and I finally got one that fits all my boxes . the BOJ one is seriously godsent for me ✨✨~~lets just ignore that it makes my wallet cry every time I buy it .~~ But id rather spend more on stuff that works than just hit and trials lmao. also I've gone past my obsession on using sun sticks as a whole since they require quite a lot of pressing while applying and the application just irritates my acne a lot 😫 imma finish the ones I have but I have no intentions on buying anymore from any brands (even though the minimalist and earth rhythm ones look good 🤡)more reviews to come! ill be doing one on stuff my dad will be bringing from the U.S in the next few weeks so do let me know if you'd like a follow up on those too! (~~why do i treat my posts like a sitcom😭).~~  and as always, any other questions, comments are always welcomed and so are dms!\n\nbyeeee 💖💖",

        "body": "also my post exceeded the word limit so here's some more lmao :\n\n   \n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF      50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n   \n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte      Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable      UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB      filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV      filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB      mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change",

    "body": "So I always thought that ferments were a \"Asian skin care\" thing. But ever since getting some high end Western skin care as gifts, I noticed that many of them actually have a lot of fermented/yeasty ingredients in them.\n\nBut I can't find much on the \\~science\\~ or evidence behind why ferments can be good for your skin. But I also wonder, since ferments aren't really a thing that majority of consumers in the Western market are looking out for (like fragrance, rose water, coconut water, rosehip oil, fruit/veggie extracts that have label/experience appeal, but aren't necessarily good for skin), why would these huge companies bother putting ferments in their expensive skin care if they didn't have evidence that they do SOMETHING?\n\nI especially am curious because AB/Korean beauty are sometimes looked down upon as just being trendy and not using ingredients that are scientifically proven to be truly beneficial for skin.\n\nDo you think ferments are legit? What do they do for YOUR skin? Your fav AB fermented products or ones you are wanting to try?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are some of the leave-on skin care from [Sephora's \"Best Selling\" skin

Fermenting antioxidant rich ingredients such as ginseng, green tea etc. breaks down the antioxidants/complex molecules that are beneficial to our skin into smaller molecules, which allows it to be absorbed into the skin easily. Not only that, yeast/bacteria ferments produce additional metabolites (AHAs, peptides) that provide additional benefits such as whitening, hydration, skin repair, you name it!\n\nEdit: forgot to put my favorite fermented product!! I love the Manyo Factory Galactomyces Niacin Special treatment. :) \n\n2nd Edit: here are the links to some scientific literature articles on fermented cosmetics which were found through PubMed! You do need access to the database if you want to read them in its entirety, but you can get some brief information on the topic just through the abstract.\n\nFermenting red ginseng enhances its safety and efficacy as a novel skin care anti-aging ingredient: in vitro and animal study.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23126662\n \nEvaluation of tyrosinase inhibitory and antioxidant activities of Angelica dahurica root extracts for four different probiotic bacteria fermentations.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254340\n\nSkin resistance to UVB-induced oxidative stress and hyperpigmentation by the topical use of Lactobacillus helveticus NS8-fermented milk supernatant.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28598022\n\nBifidobacterium-fermented soy milk extract stimulates hyaluronic acid production in human skin cells and hairless mouse skin.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12637786",

Normal is the operative word here because ain't nobody washing their face like actors in a commercial,that's clearly abnormal.\n\n🐳 **What works** : This was recommended by my dermat after a bout of eczema 2 years back and I absolutely swear by it. It's gentle,glides like a dream and doesn't make you feel taut. My ideal cleanser traits  basically match my romantic relationship requirements oof.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't**  : You can't rely solely on this to remove every last trace of makeup. Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n🐳 **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\n🐳 **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ✨ *manifestion* ✨ and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured. [I brought mine from this one.](https://instagram.com/_vivanka_chennai?igshid=5brie36vc4w2)\n\n\n\n🔵 **TONER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **DermaFique All Important Toner** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260\n\n🐳 **Application** : I got this transferred into a mist spray bottle because I quite enjoy the feeling of being spring irrigated. So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\n🐳 **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\n🔵 **SERUM** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (⚠️ensure the dropper doesn't touch your face⚠️) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n🐳 **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\n🐳 **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\n🔵 **MOISTURIZER** 🔵\n\n🔹**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice; Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\n🐳 **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\n🔹 **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\n🐳 **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔵 **SUNSCREEN** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\n🐳 **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\n🐳 **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\n🐳 **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you! Rest your eyes for a bit,it did endure quite a bit of a strain with this one :P",

I have uploaded a video and images for the comparison but I'll first start with the review.\n\nReview\n\n* *Your skin type-* Sahara desert dry skin\n* *Your current climatic conditions-* Hot af\n* *Your current AM/PM routine-*  \n**AM**\\- Nothing, I only apply sunscreen if have to go out  \n**PM**\\- Ponds cold cream (for my double cleanse), cleanser (Neutrogena hydro boost cleanser), tret (twice a week), ordinary peeling solution (once a month), innisfree jeju volcanic mask (once a month), moisturizer (I have like 4-5 moisturizers that I use)\n* *Your age- 22*\n\n**The Ordinary AHA BHA Peel**\n\n* *Usage timeline-* More than a year\n* *Ingredient List-* Glycolic Acid, Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Sodium Hydroxide, Daucus Carota Sativa Extract, Propanediol, Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Salicylic Acid, Potassium Citrate, Lactic Acid, Tartaric Acid, Citric Acid, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Xanthan gum, Polysorbate 20, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n* *Holy Grail but Will Not Repurchase-* I fucking love it, it made my skin so smooth and my complexion brighter. I never had any skin problems before as such, but it just made everything better. I never experienced any sort of purging or irritation with this peel. Although, I will not be repurchasing it because I paid ₹1200 for this even though it lasted more than a year. The availability is an issue too.\n\n**Minimalist AHA BHA PHA Peel**\n\n* *Usage timeline-* 2 times\n* *Ingredient List-* Aloe Vera Juice, Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Gluconolactone, Mandelic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lecithin\n* *Holy Grail but Will Repurchase-* I loved it in the very first go, I saw immediate results much like the ordinary. I did not experience any sort of irritation or purging with this either. I honestly don't have much to say because the results are pretty much identical for both.\n\nComparison\n\n**Texture**\n\nAs you can see in the video below, apart from the colour difference the minimalist one a bit flowier than the ordinary. Also, I like the shape of the dropper of the minimalist one, it's pointy rather than the round tip and it looks classier ( at least to my eyes). That is really it when it comes to the texture and the feel of the products.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/mobbuo/video/dxwg1bxpdes61/player\n\n**Application**\n\n*note- i forgot to take my before pics, pls forgive a newbie 😔😔😔*\n\nI did a half-n-half application of the peels. The immediate thing I noticed was the way they applied, ordinary being thicker is slightly easier to spread because it doesn't drip as much as the minimalist.\n\nAlso, idk what it is about minimalist peel but I had to apply it a tad bit more than its counterpart.\n\nThird, minimalist did not burn AT ALL while the ordinary always burns a little, even after a year of consistent use.\n\nIn the images below you can see my skin right after the application of the peels, the results are very much the same.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2kdr544sdes61.jpg?width=3464&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8425c82498afb958897ee5482979129fdc1c07d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In Conclusion-** I like both, I don't have a preference for one over the other when it comes to the results. The only thing is that minimalist is cheaper and easily available, so I will go for that one instead of the ordinary.",

The expectation seems to be that it's supposedly very good for acne prone skin. There are pictures of someone with pretty bad acne showing before and after pictures of their acne going away. (Korean skin care is more geared toward CALMING & SOOTHING acne than to go to war with it with drying treatments and whatnot. I guess because a large component of acne is inflammation?)* \n\n*Some people said it doesn't seem to do anything for them, sensitive types seems to like it a lot, that it absorbs quickly. They like that it's unfragranced. Some VERY oily types said they feel like their skin is a little bit more oilier when they use it and that it doesn't absorb well for them. It may be really popular due to Director Pi suggesting it as the #1 soothing ampoule in her recent video.

    "body": "Cleansing balms\n\nUPDATE 8/20/20: I’m adding a new balm I’ve recently tried (at the bottom of the list). If anyone has tried balms that you’d like to review in the format used, please post them below!!!\n\nOk, I’ve been (still am) on a mission to try and review all of the best/most popular cleansing balms in an effort to find the very very best one. I’ve tried nearly all of the most popular ones now. I searched everywhere for a comprehensive review of all of these and couldn’t find much so I’m hoping this will be a helpful resource to others who might be looking too. I welcome any input!!\n\nBackstory:\nI had been using The Body Shop’s Camomile balm since way before cleansing balms went mainstream, for probably a decade at least. I never knew there were other options until I was given a sample of Farmacy Green Clean and that’s what started me down this path - I wanted to see what the best option truly is! I liked my Camomile but could there be a better balm out there waiting for me??!\n\nAs always, YMMV but below are my results! All prices are in Canadian dollars and I have not researched pricing or availability in other countries.\n\nAs for what I actually use it for - I don’t wear a full face of makeup every single day but I do always wear a tinted sunscreen and mascara at a minimum, usually with a light powder foundation, blush and brow gel as well. I’ve tried every balm below on little to no makeup up to a full face of special occasion makeup.\n\nA note about ingredients - I’ve copied ingredient lists below from the brands websites. It was important to me to evaluate which ones have polyethylene (plastic) as well as essential oils.\n\nI would LOVE to hear your thoughts on those below or any other options I haven’t tried yet!\n\n**TL;DR FINAL VERDICT**: for a really good clean and soft face, Drunk Elephant’s Slaii is probably the best value in terms of value, packaging, ingredients, etc. I think this will continue to be my go to in the super dry winter months (especially since I tend to wear a bit thicker makeup in the winter), but to be honest, I think I will probably continue use my trusty Body Shop Camomile Cleansing Butter in the summers.\n\n**The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter**\n\nSize: 90mL (3oz).   \nPrice: $17 CAD @ The Body Shop reg price (but it’s often on sale).   \nPrice per oz: $5.67/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a wide and flat metal tin that is perfect for storing bobby pins or things in after (no plastic packaging, yay!). I have had a few times over the years where the threads get misaligned and stuck if it was tightened wrong and have needed to use a knife or screwdriver to pry it open again.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.   \nTexture & Emulsion: When scooping the balm out, it stays a little solid as you rub it into your skin. I wouldn’t say it emulsifies 100% to an oil but it feels great on the face and it’s super spreadable once warmed up. Doesn’t feel greasy/oily, more creamy.    \nScent: Very neutral scent, I don’t believe there are any added scents, essential oils or fragrances.    \nOn the Eyes: It doesn’t sting the eyes at all, but sometimes there’s a light film, if so I just blink a few times and it goes away.    \nAmount Required: A very small amount is required for my whole face (probably about 1/2 tsp max) and one tin easily lasts me a few months.    \nIngredients: No plastic to be found here! I also love that the ingredient list is short and sweet.    \nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, Parfum, Aqua, Linalool, Limonene, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Citric Acid.    \n\nVERDICT: I’ve loved this forever and to be honest, now that I’ve tried some others I’m not totally sure if the grass is actually greener on the other side. Still a top contender for me and the price is amazing! I do wonder though if my skin feels a just a tiny bit less moisturized after using this (compared to some of the others below)...\n\n**Farmacy Green Clean** \n\nSize: 90mL (3oz).   \nPrice: $45 CAD @ Sephora Canada.   \nPrice per oz: $15/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes, but the plastic tray it is stored in is very flimsy (sits in top of the tub).    \nTexture & Emulsion: When scooping the balm out, it melts easily and emulsifies quickly to rub around your face. Not greasy/oily.    \nScent: Light citrusy scent (almost like a lime sherbert or something) that smells so good I just want it all over my face all the time.    \nOn the Eyes: I do find it causes quite a bit of a film if I use it on the eyes (something I’d never really experienced before with the Camomile balm), no stinging unless it gets directly in the eyes. Makeup dissolves easily with minimal rubbing or tugging.    \nAmount Required: A small amount is required.    \nIngredients: While they say it’s not “microbeads” and that it melts in water, this product does contain polyethylene aka plastic. Take that for what you will. This product does have quite a bit of essential oils and extracts.    \n\nCetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Peg-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Peg-10 Isostearate, Polyethylene, Phenoxyethanol, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Amino Esters-1, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Amber Powder, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Water/ Aqua/ Eau, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Echinacea Purpurea Root Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Moringa Pterygosperma Seed Extract, Disodium Phosphate, Citric Acid.   \n\n\nVERDICT: I like it, I love it, I want some more of it. It smells amazing and feels luxurious on the face. Even though a little goes a long way, I do have a hard time justifying spending that much money on a first cleanser (and I don’t love that it contains polyethylene and a lot of essential oils).\n\n**Physicians Formula The Perfect Matcha 3-in-1 Melting Cleansing Balm**\n\nSize: 41mL (1.4oz).  \nPrice: $15 CAD @ Shoppers Drug Mart (also find at Walmart, Superstore etc).   \nPrice per oz: $10.71/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a screw top and an internal insert underneath. The insert holds the very tiny spatula.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes but it’s tiny, about the size of a safety pin.   \nTexture & Emulsion: It melts but it’s not overly emollient and isn’t as spreadable as others I’ve tried.    \nScent: Sort of a light essential oily/green tea/citrus scent. Some say it smells like Green Clean but I completely disagree and it’s nowhere near as nice of a smell.    \nOn the Eyes: A bit of eye stinging and a definite film was to be had.    \nAmount Required: Larger amount required to effectively remove makeup/sunscreen of any I’ve tried to date.    \nIngredients: Looks like we have that ever present plastic again (polyethylene) as well as fragrance, food colouring and citrus essential oils. Sad face.    \nCETYL ETHYLHEXANOATE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SORBETH-30 TETRAOLEATE, PEG-5 GLYCERYL TRIISOSTEARATE, PEG-10 ISOSTEARATE, POLYETHYLENE, FRAGRANCE/PARFUM, CAMELLIA SINENSIS LEAF POWDER*, PHYLLOSTACHYS EDULIS SHOOT WATER**, NELUMBO NUCIFERA FLOWER EXTRACT***, CITRUS NOBILIS (MANDARIN ORANGE) PEEL OIL, WATER/EAU, PHENOXYETHANOL, SORBITAN SESQUIOLEATE, POLYGLYCERYL-10 OLEATE, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, LACTIC ACID, SODIUM BENZOATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, MALTODEXTRIN, YELLOW 5 (CI 19140), BLUE 1 (CI 42090). *MATCHA, **BAMBOO, ***LOTUS\n\nVERDICT: It’s a no from me, dawg. I couldn’t wait to finish this (relatively small) tub so I could try the next product. Having heard so many claims that it’s a perfect dupe for Green Clean, I was VERY disappointed. IMO they are nothing alike other than the colour (both balms are a light green colour). Smell, texture, effectiveness, price, ingredients - nothing wowed me.\n\n**Heimish All Clean Balm**\n\nSize: 120mL (4oz).   \nPrice: $23.95 CAD @ Amazon.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $5.99/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a flip top. Under the lid is a second lid which holds the included spatula. I like that the spatula is separated from the product but the extra lid makes it extra bulky in my cabinet.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes.   \nTexture & Emulsion: This balm I’d say emulsified almost immediately to a complete oil. It has a light oil feel (similar to say a sunflower oil, not as thick as an olive oil for example). It melts right away once it touches your face and feels like an oil face massage as you rub it in. It feels quite luxurious!    \nScent: Light floral scent (smells like essential oils). I like it and it’s not too overpowering IMO but I have heard some people find it too strong of a scent.    \nOn the Eyes: No stinging and the eye film is minimal.    \nAmount Required: I’d say a medium amount. Definitely more than the Camomile and Green Clean but it doesn’t seem excessive.    \nIngredients: There is polyethylene (plastic) in this as well as a number of essential oils which those with sensitive skin may wish to avoid.    \nEthylhexyl palmitate, cetyl ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, polyethylene, PEG-8 isostearate, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, cocos nucifera (coconut) fruit extract, citrus aurantifolia (lime) fruit extract, freesia refracta extract, iris versicolor extract, jasminum officinale (jasmine) extract, lilium tigrinum extract, leontopodium alpinum extract, nelumbium speciosum flower extract, narcissus pseudo-narcissus (daffodil) flower extract, rose extract, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) peel oil, lavandula angustifolia (lavender) oil, pelargonium graveolens flower oil, amyris balsamifera bark oil, citrus paradisi (grapefruit) peel oil, eucalyptus globulus leaf oil, melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) leaf oil, juniperus mexicana oil, boswellia carterii oil, citrus aurantium bergamia (bergamot) fruit oil, tocopheryl acetate, 1,2-hexanediol.\n\nVERDICT: There’s a lot to love about this - the scent and the texture are awesome, the price is definitely right, and I enjoy using it. My skin does always feel great after and it doesn’t dry me out. Cons for me are the bulky packaging, the amount of essential oils and the microbeads. I do like it but I’m not ready to stop my search quite yet.\n\n**Drunk Elephant Slaai**\n\nSize: 115mL (3.83oz).   \nPrice: $45 @ Sephora Canada.   \n(Note that this price includes a small vial of Bamboo Booster (physical exfoliating grains) as well).   \nPrice per oz: $11.75/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top. The spatula is magnetic and sits on top of the tub via a magnet (super handy for the makeup cupboard but also exposed/can pop off in a makeup bag while travelling).    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes.    \nTexture & Emulsion: Feels like softened butter and emulsifies to a thick oil feeling (similar to olive oil).     \nScent: Neutral, but a light olive oil type scent. I wish it had a nicer smell but it’s not offensive.     \nOn the Eyes: No stinging, easily removed eye makeup.    \nAmount Required: just a little, I’d say the smallest amount of any I’ve tried which is great news for it lasting a good while.\n\nIngredients: There don’t appear to be any polyethylene in this product and it’s lighter on the essential oils as well (good news if you have sensitive skin).\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Lauryl Laurate, Polyglyceryl-3 Laurate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Wax, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Oil, Actinidia Chinensis (Kiwi) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Ananassa (Strawberry) Seed Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Polyglyceryl-2 Caprate, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Seed Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Schinziophyton Rautanenii Kernel Oil, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Ximenia Americana Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Glycerin\n\nVERDICT: Love love love! Definitely don’t use too much but when using a small amount the oiliness isn’t too much and it makes my face feel soft and clean. However, a second cleanse is a must.\n\n**Clinique Take the Day Off Balm**\n\nSize: 125mL (4.17oz).    \nPrice: $40 @ Sephora Canada.    \nPrice per oz: $9.59/oz.    \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.    \nTexture & Emulsion: Texture is comparable to a solid form coconut oil (similar to the Heimish balm in texture and colour also). Emulsified quickly to a soft oil.    \nScent: Unscented.    \nOn the Eyes: A light film, but no stinging. Takes extra rubbing to loosen stubborn eye makeup.    \nAmount Required: Medium amount (not as much as Heimish but not as little as Drunk Elephant).    \n\nIngredients: Very short ingredients list but unfortunately, those classic plastics are in this balm as well (polyethylene).\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate , Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil , Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride , Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate , Polyethylene , Peg-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate , Water\\Aqua\\Eau , Tocopherol , Phenoxyethanol\n\nVERDICT: Honestly, I have no real bad things to say. It’s utilitarian. It doesn’t feel luxurious but it works.\n\n\n**Acure Seriously Soothing 3 in 1 Serum**\n\nSize: 50mL (1.7 oz).   \nPrice: $23.49 @ well.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $13.82/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a glass jar with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.   \nTexture & Emulsion: A very soft solid serum that gets a little melty when room temperature is quite warm. It melts immediately in your hand/on your face and becomes a liquidy oil. It feels luxurious but does leave an oily film so a second cleanse is definitely required.\nScent: Strong scent due to the blue tansy oil (some might not like it but I do!)\nOn the Eyes: It’s very gentle and doesn’t sting or leave a film.\nAmount Required: Very little required. I’d say about half a teaspoon for my whole face including eye makeup.\nIngredients: No plastic here! Just very basic natural ingredients.\n\nCaprylic/capric Triglyceride, Euphorbia Cerifera(Candelilla) Wax, Copernicia Cerifera(Carnauba) Wax, Butyrospermum Parkii(Shea) Butter, Rosa Canina(Rosehip) Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa(Argan) Oil, Tocopherol(Vitamin E), Tanacetum Annum (Blue Tansy)flower Oil, Ribes Nigrum (Black Currant)seed Oil.\n\nVERDICT: I didn’t originally buy this for a cleanser, (just as a balm) but used it in a pinch as my first cleanse when I accidentally lost my jar of Slaai on a camping trip. I love how my skin feels soft and soothed after using it as a cleanser and it feels so silky on my skin. It is a little on the expensive side but I think it’s a keeper for sure seeing as it’s so versatile!!\n\n**Banila Co. Clean It Zero Original Balm Cleanser**\n\nSize: 100mL (3.3 oz).   \nPrice: $27.96 @ Amazon.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $8.40/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: TBD.   \nTexture &amp;amp; Emulsion: TBD.   \nScent: TBD.   \nOn the Eyes: TBD.    \nAmount Required: TBD.   \nIngredients: Doesn’t look like there’s any microbeads in this bad boy, thankfully!\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, PEG-10 Isostearate, Synthetic Wax, Onsen-Sui, Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Lithospermum Erythrorhizon Root Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance, Ethylhexylglycerin, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Bambusa Vulgaris Leaf/Stem Extract Aspalathus Linearis Extract, Angelica Archangelica Root Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Polydiethyleneglycol Adipate/IPDI Copolymer, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Acrylates/Methoxy PEG-15 Methacrylate Copolymer\n\nVERDICT: TBD - haven’t tried it yet but I plan to so I’ve included the info I was able to find so far.\n\n\nYour turn!

My hair is normally loosely wavy (just looks messy, not nicely waved) when air-dried. Last time I was at my hairdresser's, she used the Matrix Biolage R.A.W. Color Care Conditioner with me, dried my hair slowly in a hood hair dryer and holy moley... my hair felt like butter and the waves were soooo much prettier.\n\nSo basically, my question is... based on the ingredients list of the conditioner, what was likely to have worked so well for my hair?

Just wondering if I should be on the lookout for certain ingredients in other conditioners, or whether I should keep buying RAW Color Care (It's a hassle for me to obtain).\n\nIngredients list: Aqua / Water / Eau, Cetearyl, Alcohol, Brassicamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Cocos, Nucifera Oil / Coconut Oil, Cetyl Esters, Parfum / Fragrance, Tartaric Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Salicylic Acid, Glyceryl, Stearate, Limnanthes Alba Seed Oil / Meadowfoam Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Glycerin, Linalool, Geraniol, Glycine Soja Oil / Soybean Oil, Cocos Nucifera Fruit Extract / Coconut Fruit, Extract, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate\n\nLink to conditioner: [https://chatters.ca/products/matrix-biolage-r-a-w-color-care-conditioner?variant=32581793742929&currency=CAD&utm\\_medium=product\\_sync&utm\\_source=google&utm\\_content=sag\\_organic&utm\\_campaign=sag\\_organic&gclid=Cj0KCQjwiqWHBhD2ARIsAPCDzaktZow4lzaPQeaG3mD3KSuNorpQHuRHi2hjJP7v08rgWV2Qoigc2z8aAkAcEALw\\_wcB#product\\_info](https://chatters.ca/products/matrix-biolage-r-a-w-color-care-conditioner?variant=32581793742929&currency=CAD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=Cj0KCQjwiqWHBhD2ARIsAPCDzaktZow4lzaPQeaG3mD3KSuNorpQHuRHi2hjJP7v08rgWV2Qoigc2z8aAkAcEALw_wcB#product_info)\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone!

    "body": "Ingredients:\n\n1. Three boxes of preferred jello flavor\n2. Two packets or 14 grams of unflavored gelatin \n3. 150mls of water or juice\n4. 100mls of preferred cooking oil (I use coconut oil)\n5. A literal PINCH of Potassium Sorbate \n\nOptional ingredients but highly recommended:\n6. Two LorAnn flavorings for extra flavor punch!\n7. Spoonful of Marshmallow Fluff \n\nThe reason my recipe is the greatest is because it allows you to make shelf stable gummies in a day or less without worrying about them melting or sweating later. The other tutorials I've seen so far are great but lack longevity when it comes to storage and gave me problems when I tired to sugar coat them so I took all those recipes and turned em into one simple process to create the GREATEST GUMMIES EVER! \n\nMy tutorial provides you with instructions to create gummies that not only resemble store bought gummies in texture and shelf stability but also gives you the freedom to custom make any flavors you want!!! \nPlease feel free to share this recipe with all your friends and family!!!💚\n\nRecipe Instructions:\nThis recipe creates about 400-420mls of melted gummy mix. So use the proper mould sizes or buy extra moulds in case you run out of space when pouring or injecting. \n*Start to finish takes around 7-8 hours* *Cook time is around 1 hour*\n\nStep 1. Take the 150mls of juice or water and pour 100mls of it into a double boiler setup with the stove set on low. You add in the PINCH of Potassium Sorbate now, it'll melt in by itself like magic!\n\nStep 2. Take the remaining 50mls and put it into a small bowl and dump in the 2 packets or 14 grams unflavored gelatin and mix it well with a fork. If you're using the lorAnns flavorings you need to add them into the 50mls of water or juice before you add the gelatin. Make sure you get all the dry gelatin bits mixed and soaked. You'll notice it clumps together after you have mixed it for a little while. Clump it all together to one side of your bowl for easy removal later. Let this sit for at least 5 minutes to bloom properly.  \n\nStep 3. Dump in all 3 boxes of your favorite jello mix into the now heated 100mls of water or juice in your double boiler setup. Let this cook for 45 minutes, you can probably do it less but I like to ensure all the jello is melted.\n\nStep 4. At the end of the 45 minutes you can add in your bloomed gelatin that we set to the side, it should come out all together in one piece. Just let it melt down and then mix it all in really well.\nFun fact: gelatin smells like straight donkey ass if you don't add flavorings. \n\nStep 5. Now the optional Marshmallow Fluff. You can do as big or small of a spoonful as you want! Doesn't really matter unless you don't want Cream Saver style gummies and if that's the case just skip this step. Make sure you mix it in really well. If you're noticing it's not all one color then you need to mix more until it's all one unison color. \n\nStep 6. Now that you have combined the flavored jello and unflavored gelatin you can add in your choice of cooking oil. Now this step was specifically adapted to my previous recipe to make medicated gummies and when I tried making it without the oil I noticed the gummies didn't feel as smooth as they normally do so that's why I'm using oil in this recipe, you can use any type but I've found coconut oil to work the best!\n\nStep 7. Get it all mixed together really well!!! At first the oil will be reluctant to mix but once the temperatures of both liquids reach equilibrium it will start to mix in. Just keep mixing until you see it stop separating.\n\nStep 8. Your gummy mix is now ready to pour or inject!!! I inject with a turkey injector. It holds 50mls at a time and allows me to precisely fill the cavities without making too much of a mess. \n\nStep 9. Once you've gotten all the gummy mix poured or injected you need to let them sit in the moulds at ROOM TEMPERATURE for at least 3 hours. After the initial 3 hours are up you can pop them out the moulds and set them out on some parchment paper to finish drying out. They need to dry for another 3 hours once they come out the moulds before they are ready for your friends and family.\n\nStep 10. If you want to coat them in sugar you need to do it right after they come out the moulds so as soon as they've sat in the moulds for 3 hours and you pop them out, you should immediately start coating them in sugar, once they're coated they need to sit out for another 3 hours to form a nice shell on the outside. After this last step you are good to go and can enjoy the fruits of your labor!!! 🙏🏼\n\nNow in my picture you probably noticed it's not a normal sugar coating and you're partly right! It is still sugar but it's colored sugar!!! I recently came across this in my gummy adventures and realized they take my gummies to a whole new aesthetic level so I couldn't resist!!! If you want your gummies to really pop you should match the color of the gummy to the color of the sugar and that will create an almost neon colored gummy that will literally look like little shiny crystalized bears. I appreciate everyone that takes the time to read and check out my recipe and I hope it helps you in your journey! 💚💚💚\n\n🦍🫱🏻‍🫲🏿💪",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

    "body": "## **What's in a \"Puppuccino\"; is it safe for dogs?**\nA \"Puppuccino\" is just whipped cream in a small cup.\nWe make this whipped cream by mixing heavy cream and 8 pumps of Starbucks Vanilla Syrup in a pressurized canister.\n\nThe syrup contains: \n> *SUGAR*, WATER, NATURAL FLAVORS, PRESERVATIVE: POTASSIUM SORBATE (E202), CITRIC ACID (E330), COLOR: CARAMEL (E150d).\n\nThe heavy cream brand varies by store location. At my store, we use Kroger Heavy Whipping Cream. It contains the following: \n> *Heavy Cream, Skim Milk*, Mono & Diglycerides, Polysorbate 80, *Carrageenan*.\n\n**It is not safe for dogs.** The amount of sugar in the whipped cream can caused your dog's blood-sugar levels to spike. Most dogs are lactose intolerant after a certain age, and will develop the following symptoms if too much lactose is consumed: abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. In some animal studies, carrageenan was shown to cause intestinal lacerations and tumors. The remaining ingredients are non-beneficial, and there could be more of them that are potentially harmful to your dog.\n\n\n## **Why is the \"Puppuccino\" on your \"Secret Menu\" if it's not safe for dogs?**\nFirst and foremost, *there is no \"Secret Menu\"*. Customers can come up with whatever creation they desire, and then give it a name, but that does not make it a real Starbucks product. I don't know who started the \"Puppuccino\" fad, but it was not created or endorsed by Starbucks. We are also not responsible if your dog becomes sick or worse because you decided that it was a good idea to feed it a cup of whipped cream.\n\nYou also should not expect baristas to know what this, or any other \"Secret Menu\" item is.\n\n## **Is it really free?**\nIt likely depends on the store, but typically you won't get charged for asking for a little dab of whipped cream along side your drink. *However, if a customer was clearly abusing this fact (as in coming in 3 times a day for nothing but a cup of whipped cream to feed their dog), I would probably alert my manager, since they are wasting our time and money. Of course, I would first inform them of the dangers of feeding their dog so much sugar and dairy.\n\n\\* *Clarified.*\n\n\n\n# **BARISTAS:**\n\nPlease do not recommend or offer whipped cream or \"Puppuccinos\" to customer's pets. When wearing your green (or black) Starbucks apron, you are representing Starbucks. When a customer is offered a \"Puppuccino\" by someone who is representing Starbucks, they get the impression that it's a real Starbucks product, and may even get the impression that it's safe for dogs. This could lead to a lawsuit and probably your termination if someone's dog is killed by consuming something that you directly offered to them as a treat for their dog, while you were on the clock.\n\n**What you can offer to a customer's pet:**\n\n* Admiration, compliments, etc..\n* A cup or (oatmeal) bowl of filtered water.\n\n### What are your feelings and experiences with \"Puppuccinos\"? Feel free to discuss below, and correct me if I'm wrong about anything. Thanks for taking the time to read!\n\nOr if you didn't take the time to read/ **TL;DR**:\n\"Puppucinnos\" aren't real, are bad for your dog, and not endorsed by Starbucks.",

When asked for one, I have no problem with Starbucks saying, \"you should be careful about giving too many of these to your dog,\" or something to that effect. \n\nOutright refusal to sell them, however, based on the potential health concerns to an animal you don't own is not appropriate. Starbucks has some beverages that are extremely unhealthy but you don't refuse to sell those to people. I realize that animals can't make their own decisions, which is why a caution by the baristas is ok, and possibly even needed. But it's not ok to automatically assume you know better than the pet owner. Many of us are responsible and take great care of our animals.",

    "body": "\nI have gotten into making mead and shared my results on a number of subs. People seemed interested, so I figured I’d post a guide here! \n\n[I have once made a crude guide to mead making on imgur, so here’s the link to that!](https://imgur.com/gallery/PAoCaTy) The collected results are [here!](https://imgur.com/gallery/sifwTLW)\n\nI’ll go into more detail now, though. \n\nFirstly, let’s cover what mead is. Mead is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented honey. It’s very simple to make and has been around forever. It’s probably the oldest alcoholic drink there is. So, crudely spoken, in order to make mead, you mix honey with water and get it to ferment. Wait a few weeks and boom, you get mead! \n\nNow, in detail, here’s what I do: \n\nFirst of all, here’s the equipment you absolutely need to get started: \n\n• 1x Carboy, I recommend at least three litres, but bigger, while more expensive to fill, is also better. You can also use something other that a Carboy, but the container you use should be \n\na) airtight \n\nand b) sealable with an airlock. \n\nEither way, this is what you use to ferment it in. \n\n• Airlock. If you buy a Carboy, they often come with it. An airlock is a device that allows you to seal the bottle, keeping out oxygen and bacteria, while also allowing the gases from fermentation to escape. \n\n• You also need a siphon in order to rerack the mead in the process (I’ll get to that). \n\n• sanitiser. Now, other mead makers look away, because what I’m about to say, while true, will make you cringe: I recommend you use a chemical, oxygen based sanitiser, but if you don’t want to buy that, use cheap spirits like vodka. \n\n• mead makers over at r/mead will tell you to use a hydrometer as well, but while it’s insanely helpful, you don’t need it to make a good mead. However, not using one won’t let you determine the exact ABV. You can make good estimates, though, so this really is optional, especially for a one time thing. \n\n• you need honey. Raw honey is best, but my experiments have revealed that you can use literally any honey, as long as it’s real honey and not some syrup based crap. Get the cheapest real honey you can find for your first try. How much? Well, the rule of thumb is 2 parts of water to one part of honey. Speaking in plain numbers, I recommend using one kilo for three litres of mead or roughly 1.5 kilos of honey for five litres of mead. You can also use less honey, the name of the mead you get then is “hydromel”. It’ll have less alcohol, but is not a bad thing to make and can taste awesome. And it’s still mead. \n\n• brewer’s yeast. You can use dried bread yeast, but it may have some difficulty working and it can introduce off flavours. Using brewer’s yeast works a lot better. Use any brewer’s yeast you like, Ale or beer yeast, wine yeast, cider yeast, champagne yeast, port yeast, mead yeast... it doesn’t matter, they all work. Three things you should know, though: \n\nOne, different yeasts have different alcohol tolerances. That doesn’t mean that beer yeast always gets you a lower percentage than wine yeast, but it means that some strands just can take less than others. Be sure to look into that before you start. \n\nTwo, different yeasts bring out different flavours. Look into what each yeast will bring out in particular, or don’t. In the end, it’ll probably still taste great.\n\nThree, what exactly does the yeast do? Well, it’ll turn the sugar into alcohol until it either runs out of sugars to turn into alcohol (I’ll warn you now that while mead is a sweet drink, because the yeast can’t turn every sugar into alcohol, and because it’s honey wine, the end result is less sweet than you might expect) or until the alcohol concentration gets too high for the yeast. That actually gives you a little bit of information to plan your mead. One way of making your mead sweeter is simply to use a yeast that has a lower alcohol tolerance than the amount of sugar (in the honey) you used could get you. You should also know that using a high tolerance yeast will give you a mead that immediately when it’s done, while tasty and definitely drinkable, also has some alcohol sharpness and benefits from ageing. \n \nSo anyway, you need yeast.\n\n• any other ingredients you want to use. Add Apple or Apple juice, and the technical term of the resulting mead is “Cyser”. Add rose petals and you get a “rhodomel”. Add grapes and you get a “pyment”. Add any other fruit and you end up with a “melomel” (recommend raspberries or blueberries, that tastes awesome). Add nothing and it’s a “traditional”. We already covered a bigger portion of water, that’s a “hydromel”. Also interesting is a “bochet”, with burnt or caramelised honey, and a “metheglin”, with spices. Be easy on the cloves and the cardamom, though! \n\n• you may use yeast nutrients if you’re planning on making a “hydromel”, a “metheglin” or a “traditional”. You can always use them, but I found that adding some fruit usually covers that anyway. If you want to use nutrients, you can buy wine making yeast nutrient salts online. They’re not that expensive. \n\nNow, let’s finally look at the process. This post is very long already, but the actually process is easy and quick, so don’t be discouraged! \n\n1. The first step is to sanitise everything, and I really mean EVERYTHING you use. Follow the instructions that come with the chemical sanitiser or soak you equipment in the cheap alcohol and then wash off with water in the end. \n\n2. If you want to make a bochet, cook your honey, but watch the time. 12 minutes is perfect if a caramel taste, any longer will quickly turn into lightly burnt marshmallow, with the taste of burnt sugar increasing with every minute. If you don’t want to make a bochet, skip the cooking, but mix water and honey in your Carboy. Add your nutrients (unless it’s fruit, then wait a second). \n\n3. If you want to make a rhodomel, a pyment, a metheglin, a Cyser or a melomel, now is one of two possible times to add your ingredients. I usually add my ingredients now. Cut up any fruit in order to increase exposure of the juice. Wash them thoroughly and then add them to the Carboy. Then you fill up with more water. Cold water will do it. You may also use frozen berries or actively freeze berries before you use them. That’ll break down cell walls and tissue and will work beneficial for your mead. You don’t need to do that, though, fresh fruit works fine. \n\nFill it up with water, like I said, but leave about two or three inches of head space. Depending on the kind of fruit you used, fermentation could be more vigorously and fill that gap fairly quickly. Leaving headspace prevents overflow and the cost of very little mead. \n\nAfter you filled it up, you may take a gravity reading with a hydrometer. You do that by filling some of the must into a testing tube and putting your hydrometer into the must, letting it float. You’ll need this particular reading if you want to determine the ABV later on with your hydrometer. However, like I said, this isn’t really necessary! \n\n4. when you’re done, and everything is inside your Carboy, make sure the must is room temperature at most before adding the yeast. You do not want to kill the yeast by putting it into a must that is too hot (40+ degrees Celsius). If it’s too cold, it’ll need to reach room temperature first before it starts fermenting, but this will not harm the yeast otherwise. \n\n5. After you added the yeast, put water into your airlock and seal the Carboy. Then wait. \n\n6. It is beneficial to open the container and stir the must once a day for the first half week in order to degas the whole thing, but then you should keep it sealed and just let the yeast to its job. \n\n7. After two to three weeks, you should remove any physically present ingredients from your mead. That means any rose petals, lavender, ginger pieces, berries, fruit, cinnamon sticks etc. There are two easy ways to do this, and I recommend one more than the other. \n\nHere’s the one I recommend: you use a second Carboy, sanitise it (and your siphon, you know the drill now, sanitise EVERYTHING), and rack the mead over into it. The ingredients are left behind and you can remove them from the now empty Carboy and clean it. Seal the new Carboy and put the mead away again. \n\nThe second option is not recommended because of the risk of contamination and oxidisation, but I occasionally use it nonetheless and it does work: \nIf you do not have a second Carboy, take an empty canister. Sanitise it (you know the drill), then rack your mead into it. Clean the Carboy, get rid of the remaining ingredients, sanitise it, and rack the mead back into it. That works. \n\n8. This is also the second opportunity to add ingredients. Instead of adding your ingredients to primary fermentation (at the beginning), put them into your Carboy after two weeks and rack the mead into it. Then you repeat the step to remove the ingredients again after another two weeks. Rumour has it that the taste of the ingredients will be more prominent if you do it this way. \n\n9. If you did step 8, do step 7 after two weeks. Then you seal the Carboy again and put it away. \n\n10. Now you just wait until fermentation is over. If you don’t use a hydrometer, wait another month or two. If you do have a hydrometer, take a gravity reading (by filling mead into your SANITISED test tube and letting the SANITISED hydrometer float within it). Take another gravity reading a week later and a third one after another week. If the readings are the same, fermentation is over. \n\nLet the mead fall clear. Some yeasts clear up quicker than others, but with enough time, they all do. You can also bottle it earlier, but then you’ll have dead yeast falling to the bottom of the bottle eventually.\n\n11. If you use a hydrometer, now is the time to determine your ABV. Take the reading you took at the very beginning and subtract your final gravity from that. Multiply it by 0.136 and you get your ABV. Let’s say your starting gravity was 1110 and your final gravity was 1010. That’s 100x0.136 and leaves you with an ABV of 13.6%. \n\n12. Once your mead fell clear, bottle it. Bottles with screw-tops are not suited for long term storage (there’s a risk of oxygenation if the bottle isn’t completely air right), but if you plan to consume all of your mead within two months, that’s fine. Otherwise I recommend corking your bottles, or you just take a chance :D most importantly, sanitise the bottles before you fill them. \n\nIf your mead has a high ABV, I recommend ageing it for 6-12 months before consuming it. It’ll taste a lot better and rounder. However, it’ll also taste good if you just drink it quickly. \n\nWhatever you do, DO NOT JUST ADD HONEY OR SUGAR TO MAKE IT SWEETER. It’ll just start fermenting again. If you want to sweeten it (you really don’t have to, time will bring out the honey again), stabilise the mead with potassium metabisulfate and potassium sorbate (be careful you don’t buy and use *sodium* sorbate. It’ll work but introduce off flavours). Stabilisation will take about a week and a half, then you can mix some honey with water and mix that solution into the mead. However, again, you do not need to do that! \n\nSo, that’s it. That’s how you make mead! Sorry it turned out to be so long, but it’s a lot less to do that it seems! \n\nGood luck, shoot me any questions you might have.\n\nEdit: two more things. If you’re interested in doing this more than once and picking this up as a new hobby, check out r/mead. It’s a nice community full of very helpful people. \n\nAlso, I can’t promise you this for every place, but depending on where you live, I might be able to help you find your equipment relatively cheaply. Best piece of advice is this, though: check out your local hobby, or even better brewing store.",

Specifically I've really enjoyed many of the Odd Side \"Fruitsicle\" series beers as well as the HOMES \"Sherbert\" series of beers.  I live an hour (or more) away from either of these places so I'm rarely able to get some of the better releases.  Taking that to heart I decided that I would just make my own!\n\nEnter my first attempt (and a successful one at that) at a lactose kettle sour.\n\n[Pic](https://imgur.com/MXt1PbF)\n\nMy goal here was to make a rich, flavorful, full bodied beer that when carbed represented the way that sherbert sort of \"bubbles away\" on your mouth and leaves you with a delicious flavor.

I originally went for a \"Yellow Full\" profile but then ended up with this.  I can't remember why, it may have been based off a berlinner weisse profile I found somewhere else.\n\n| Calcium | Magnesium | Sodium | Sulfate | Chloride | Bicarbonate |\n|----------|--------------|----------|--------|-----------|------------|\n| 25ppm | 0ppm | 18ppm | 41ppm | 14ppm | -91ppm |\n\n2.5ml of lactic acid in the first mash in step with a target pH of 5.35\n\nNotes on process\n-----\nI followed the mash steps above and hit my numbers pretty much spot on in terms of pH and amount of sweet wort.  I took my 6.5 gallons and pre soured it down to around 4.4pH with lactic acid.  I didn't record how much it took but iirc it was around 8-9ml.\n\nAfter pre souring I added half of a carton of goodbelly mango and wrapped the lid of my kettle with saran wrap.  I then lifted part of the wrap and blew CO2 into the headspace for around 30 seconds.  I understand the CO2 will intermingle with the O2 in the headspace but my goal was to at least disperse some of it.  This part is debatable as I understand, but I do a lot of things for insurance whether it's necessary or not.\n\nI came back to the wort 23 hours later and found the pH to be 3.5.  This is around where I was hoping for.  As I was using black currant concentrate I anticipated the pH to drop a bit more when I added it in.  Or at least the perceived tartness to be there.  I had used 16oz of the same concentrate before on a hard cider so I had an idea of what the flavor and tartness would be like.\n\nBeing satisfied with 3.5pH I brought the wort up to boiling temps and continued my boil schedule as normal.\n\nWhen done, I chilled the wort to 65F, oxygenated with pure O2 for about 20 seconds, and pitched a single pack of US-05 without rehydrating.\n\nA week later I took a gravity reading and did hit my intended gravity, just a touch low at 1.016.  I added the concentrate and took another reading and it showed 1.020 with that added.  I debated on whether I wanted to let the sugars ferment out or not but in the end decided that I was impatient and went on to keg it.  I added .5 tsp of potassium metabisulfite (campden) and 2.5 tsp of potassium sorbate to the beer and gently stirred it into solution.  These measurements are per the [Brulosophy sparkling hard cider recipe](http://brulosophy.com/2017/12/14/bru-it-yourself-sparkling-hard-berry-cider/) which I'm a fan of and it seems to work well.\n\nI kegged and force carbed to around 3 volumes of CO2 and found that to be very pleasant.  The end result is what you see above!\n\nThe aroma is full of currant and that sort of \"milky vanilla\" aroma that lactose adds.  It's like a sweet chalk if that makes any sense, I find it really works with the fruit though.  It gives the perception that you're about to drink something thicker with some body.  Tasting the beer, the body really is there.  That was the goal of the lactose and a whole pound of torrified wheat in a tiny base malt batch.  The tartness is perfect, it's not overbearing at all and it's easy to down a whole glass in just a few minutes if you so felt the need...\n\nI actually really enjoyed this beer uncarbonated as well, even when taking samples before kegging it was incredibly refreshing and went down easy.\n\nI'll definitely be experimenting with whole fruits, juices, and spices going forward.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n",

    "body": "After seeing this question a few times on this subreddit, I decided to do a deep-dive into the mechanics of 2F bottle conditioning and some possible reasons why your batches may not turn out as fizzy as you want them to.\n\n# tl;dr\n\n* Use the proper bottles (round \\[never square\\] glass flip-top bottles, reused commercial kombucha bottles, or reused plastic soda/seltzer bottles)\n* Stir your kombucha before bottling\n* Make sure your 2F has enough sugar (from either fruit, added sugar, or both)\n* Use fruit juices, extracts, or tinctures rather than whole fruit or purees\n* Leave about 1 inch of air (headspace) at the top of your bottles\n* 2F at the proper temperature (70F - 85F)\n* Let the bottles sit for enough time (24-72 hours)\n* Don't burp your bottles\n* Refrigerate your booch after 2F for at least 6 hours to reduce the possibility of kombucha geysers\n\n*Alternatively*, buy some other equipment and force-carbonate.\n\n# What makes kombucha fizzy?\n\nFundamentally, fizz is carbon dioxide (CO2) dissolved in the kombucha liquid, much like soda, beer, or seltzer. There are a few factors that can affect the CO2 in your kombucha 2F - some are more easily controlled than others, but all of them contribute to fizz.\n\nBroadly, 2F relies on a chemical reaction (sometimes known as [ethanol fermentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol_fermentation)) in which the yeast in your kombucha uses sugar for fuel to generate alcohol and CO2.\n\nSome flavoring agents may also make kombucha *feel* like it's fizzier, even if they don't actually increase the production of CO2. Fruits like pineapple and rhizomes like ginger root have a spicy/pungent mouthfeel, which can trick your brain into believing that your kombucha is fizzier than it actually is.\n\nIn this post, we'll focus on CO2 production and absorption rather than mouthfeel.\n\n## Bottle Choice\n\nLet's start with equipment. Ultimately, 2F is attempting to do two things at the same time:\n\n1. convert sugars to CO2, and\n2. force your kombucha liquid to absorb that CO2\n\nFor the second part, it is vital that your 2F bottles maintain a consistent high-pressure environment. To do this safely, proper equipment is imperative.\n\n**Round Glass Flip-Top Bottles - Yes!**\n\nMost of the pictures/videos of fizzy kombucha success on this subreddit show that they are coming out of round glass flop-top bottles, and with good reason. These bottles are rated to withstand the internal pressures created by the CO2 that is produced during 2F. [EZ-Cap style bottles](https://www.amazon.com/Swing-Top-Glass-Bottles-Chalkboard/dp/B01LB1862A) are rated for [4 bar / 58 PSI at room temp](https://www.amazon.com/Swing-Top-Glass-Bottles-Chalkboard/dp/B01LB1862A#productDescription_feature_div) and [Grolsch flip-top bottles](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41PL7U3550L._SX342_.jpg) are rated for [5-6 bar / 70-80 PSI at room temp](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/forum/threads/psi-tolerance-of-grolsch-bottles.403931/). For reference, most traditional soda bottles seem to fail around 100 PSI at room temp ([anecdotal evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXeZIISDiNw)). Generally, when these types of bottles fail, the rubber gasket will start leaking before the glass explodes - this is by design. If your gaskets fail, or if they look worn-out, you can purchase replacements online or from your local homebrew store.\n\n**Square (or other non-round) Glass Flip-Top Bottles - NEVER!**\n\nPressurized containers (home hot water boilers, commercial brewing vats, etc.) are cylindrical because the internal pressure is equally distributed along the surface of a single, continuous wall. Containers with corners experience uneven distribution of pressure on the various surfaces, which creates areas that are more likely to fail under stress than others. This means that square glass bottles must be *much* thicker than cylindrical glass bottles to safely contain the same pressure. Very few square glass bottles are rated for fermentation pressures for that reason.\n\nSeriously, [Don't 🙌 use 🙌 square 🙌 bottles!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/c3ron7/dont_use_square_bottles/).\n\n**Glass Beer Bottles - No**\n\nBeer tends to be carbonated at a much lower pressure than kombucha, so the bottles used for beer reflect that lower pressure rating. Homebrew forums are full of posts about \"bottle bombs\" that occur when someone uses too much priming sugar (more on that later). In general, beer bottles are not a great choice for kombucha 2F.\n\n**Reused Commercial Kombucha Bottles - Yes!**\n\nCommercial kombucha bottles are also great for 2F, as long as you keep an eye on the caps that you are using. Over time, the seals in the caps can wear down and may cause leaks. Depending on the brand of kombucha, you can buy replacement caps - check this [video from kombucha basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-TsBf-3p_M&t=110) for more details about different cap sizes.\n\n**Reused Soda/Seltzer Bottles - Yes (mostly)**\n\nWhen new (or gently used), soda/seltzer bottles can easily withstand the pressures required to carbonate kombucha. As long as they are not heated or thoroughly abused, they are [generally recognized as safe](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/reuse-plastic-bottles/) and will not leach dioxins.\n\n**Mason Jars - No**\n\nMason jars are built primarily for canning purposes, which involves creating a vacuum seal in order to keep *negative* pressure in the jar. This is great for canning, but bad for kombucha (we're trying to build up lots of positive pressure in the bottle to push CO2 into solution). The pressure building in 2F can cause mason jar lids to buckle, which will let CO2 escape.\n\nTo recap:\n\n**Good Equipment**\n\n* Round Glass Flip-top Bottles (rated for fermentation pressures)\n* Reused Commercial Kombucha Bottles\n* Reused Soda/Seltzer Bottles (but not for too long)\n\n**Not Great Equipment**\n\n* Square Glass Flip-top Bottles (or any shape other than round)\n* Glass Beer Bottles\n* Mason Jars\n\n## Stir Your 1F Before Bottling\n\nBefore you bottle your kombucha, make sure your stir your 1F well. Bacteria tends to float and yeast tends to sink, and you want to create an even distribution of both in your finished product. Without a good stir, you may end up with some bottles that have very little yeast (and thus very little CO2 production).\n\n## Sugars\n\nIn beer production, the addition of \"priming sugar\" is a tightly controlled process that leads to a near-certain production of CO2. This is less predictable for kombucha because the bacteria in the SCOBY also eats sugar and produces acids, rather than CO2. Like 2F timing, you may need to experiment to determine the right amount of sugar to add in order to produce the right amount of CO2 for your liking. If you are flavoring your kombucha with fruit or juices, keep in mind that their naturally occurring sugars will contribute to the production of CO2.\n\n# Flavoring\n\nPlenty of people have successful, fizzy kombucha when they add whole fruit or purees to their 2F during bottling, but if you want the maximum amount of fizz while still reducing the chances of a bottle geyser, juices/extracts/tinctures are generally a better idea.\n\nWhen you open your kombucha, the CO2 dissolved in the liquid wants to come out of solution. This process can be assisted by two things - temperature (more on that later) and [nucleation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleation) sites. The presence of large particles in your kombucha will make for a more explosive opening because the particles create nucleation sites for the CO2 to latch onto and come out of solution. That's one of the reasons why commercial brewers tend to use juices or extracts - it cuts down on the number of nucleation sites and thus the possibilities of explosive openings.\n\nNote: if you filter/sieve your 1F before bottling, you should be aware that it will have two, opposing effects on carbonation:\n\n1. It will remove yeasty sediment from your brew, cutting down on nucleation sites (good for CO2 retention)\n2. It will remove some of the yeast that assists in 2F (slows CO2 production)\n\nIf you're buying off-the-shelf juices (rather than juicing at home), read the ingredients list first. Some juices contain preservatives or other stabilizers that can interfere with fermentation (and CO2 production), like [sodium benzoate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1152300/), [potassium sorbate](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14356007.a24_507.pub2), [scorbic acid, sodium sorbate, calcium sorbate, and sodium metabisulfate](http://homebrewingcaps.com/brewing-ingredients-preservatives/). For best results, buy fresh fruit and use a juicer or a blender and sieve/filter to create your own juice.\n\n## Headspace\n\nThe amount of headspace (air in the bottle above the kombucha liquid) has a significant impact on fizz due to the compressibility of gas and liquid (a [little more detail on this in an old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/8ni1vq/is_headspace_important_for_carbonation/dzvmhki/) from u/RidgeBrewer). If you fill your bottles to the top (i.e., no headspace), the production of CO2 builds pressure too quickly and the yeast goes dormant. If you don't fill them enough, the CO2 produced will stay in the headspace and won't be dissolved into the kombucha liquid. Generally, about 1 inch of headspace at the top of your bottle is about right.\n\n## 2F Temperature\n\nSimilar to 1F, the speed by which the yeast in your kombucha produces CO2 is dependent on the ambient temperature where the bottles are stored. Warmer temperatures (80F and higher) will lead to fizzier kombucha than cooler ones (65F - 80F) and very cool temperatures will bring CO2 production to a crawl.\n\n## 2F Time\n\nThe longer you let your 2F sit, the more sugars will be converted to CO2 by the yeast in your kombucha. The length of 2F is not an exact science and you may need to experiment with timing for your setup. Some folks 2F for 24-48 hours, others for about a week, some for months.\n\n## Light\n\nWhile long-term exposure to the ultraviolet rays in sunlight will damage yeast colonies and prevent them from reproducing, a [short exposure to UV light increases their reactivity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3876234/). Unfortunately, UV light also has a negative effect on the bacterial cultures in kombucha, so it is not advisable to use light as a means to improve CO2 production in 2F. If you use clear bottles for 2F, store them in a dark environment to avoid harm to the yeast and bacterial cultures in your kombucha.\n\n## Don't burp\n\nSome folks recommend burping your 2F bottles periodically to prevent explosions, but doing so will hinder the absorption of CO2 into the kombucha liquid. With the proper conditions (pressure-safe bottles, reasonable sugar amounts, steady ambient temperature), burping is not necessary. For more information about pressure and its effects on the solubility of gas in a liquid, check out this [Khan Academy video on Henry's Law](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/health-and-medicine/respiratory-system/gas-exchange-jv/v/henry-s-law).\n\n## Temperature (yes, again)\n\nWhen the warm 2F is finished (i.e., your kombucha has a significant amount of CO2 and it is ready to drink), dropping the temperature of the 2F bottles will decrease the probability of kombucha explosions. At colder temperatures, liquids are able to absorb higher amounts of gasses (for the science, check out the [temperature dependence of Henry's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry%27s_law#Temperature_dependence)). For a high-fizz kombucha with a vastly decreased chance of painting the ceiling, refrigerate your kombucha before opening (6-24 hours at a minimum).\n\n# What about \"forced carbonation\"?\n\nMany commercial kombucha brewers (and some homebrewers) use a technique called \"forced carbonation\", which is pretty much what it sounds like. Instead of waiting for the yeast to create CO2 in 2F, you can use a [CO2 tank](https://smile.amazon.com/Aluminum-CO2-Air-Tank/dp/B000EXWIVM), [regulator](https://smile.amazon.com/Kegco-LHU52-Elite-Gauge-Regulator/dp/B07DYPSHZS), [some beverage line with a ball-lock fitting](https://smile.amazon.com/PERA-assembly-liquid-disconnect-brewing/dp/B079LX9575), a [carbonator bottle cap](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B01K4GGYT0), and a 2L soda bottle to force CO2 into your finished 1F. Best results are achieved at temperatures just above 32F (see the previous section) and shaking the soda bottle when it is hooked up to the CO2 tank and regulator will actually help the CO2 enter solution. That's a bit counterintuitive compared to the normal advice (don't shake your soda cans), but it works because the gas is going from a high-pressure environment (the CO2 tank) to a low-pressure environment (your kombucha).\n\nKombucha that is force carbonated will be a bit different than kombucha that has undergone 2F in a bottle with added sugars, because the naturally occurring sugars in flavoring agents will not have a chance to be eaten by the yeast in your kombucha (as yeast tend to go dormant when refrigerated). Also, since the yeast have gone dormant, your brew will be less alcoholic than a traditional bottle conditioned 2F. If you plan to force carbonate, please keep these things in mind when adding flavors - you may find that adding less flavor can give you better results.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you've made it this far, thanks for reading!

To recap, my recipe was as follows:\n\n* Six pounds of *organic* raspberries (because I'm better than you)\n* 2 lbs. white sugar\n* 0.5 tsp. pectic enzyme\n* 3/4 gallon of water\n\nAnd that's it! Raspberry wine just like God intended. Two weeks out, it went totally dry, sitting at 0.990. At this point, it tasted like the wine version of a sour beer. Absolutely unique, but not something I wanted to drink. Having posted of my troubled wine here, the general consensus was that, sadly, nothing could be done. I should have made the wine with only 2 to 3 lbs. of raspberries because six would inevitably impart far too much acid. Now, I did float the idea of back sweetening to balance out that acidic kick, but most people (including myself) didn't think it would be enough.\n\nWell, *we were wrong*. I added 6 ounces of sugar at bottling yesterday (along with potassium sorbate and metabisulfite), bringing the gravity to 1.008. I cannot tell you what a transformation that little bit of sugar wrought. The wine was simply delicious, especially for being so young. It was tart, semi-sweet, well-rounded, and simply tasty as f\\*\\*k. I got five bottles out of the batch, giving two to my friend Ashley. I now plan to hang on to those bottles for a year before I pop one open to see what age does to them.\n\nAnyway, just thought y'all might like to hear about my success story!

If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/​Vinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only.

I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles.

I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember.

I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above.

I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

I may or may not have been keeping a weather eye on upcoming SPF releases ever since Director Ahn In-Sook mentioned in passing in a video that many cosmeceutical brands have either put a stopper on releasing new sunscreens or postponed the release of those awaiting completion to better the formula and ensure they're up to snuff, thus there will be a slew of SPF releases come March. ~~Heaven forfend we suffer the wrath of deadly solar lasers cuz finding The One is nothing short of a bluidy struggle.~~\n\nWhat I've noted in these new releases was a combination of robust formulas and new filters. *Exciting!* I've already translated the INCI lists and entered them into Incidecoder & Cosdna. Okay, enuff intro. Have a look-see at some of the freshest sun armours to keep safe from baneful UV rays.\n\n(Links to show product specs, ~~no affiliates no sirree, s'all SK retailers/official

I'm pretty sure these are all  the same base sunscreen with the same protection. I would get the sunscreen with the simplest ingredient list and whichever one is cheapest. The About Me Be Clean seems to be alcohol and fragrance-free (non sure if rosemary leaf oil is an essential oil and fragrant??). I would probably go with the Innifree though because I prefer alcohol in my sunscreen, otherwise they are too too dewy and greasy looking, and the ingredient list is rather simple. If only it didn't have fragrance, but I can compromise with that. The Dr. G has too many unnecessary ingredients and many comedogenic ingredients like myristic acid, so I would stay away from it.",

I know I have sensitive acne prone skin.  but it is often dry and flakey.  the only time I get oily is when I am wearing makeup, which I do very often. I think I might have hormonal acne, because I will break out with hard cystic acne a couple of weeks out of the month, then it will calm down after my monthly cycle ends.  \n\nother problems: I get very bad cystic acne deep in my skin. I usually only get these on my chin or around my mouth, but I have recently gotten a couple of the left side of face on my upper cheeks.  I have large pores the are constantly clogged.  I have these weird small bumps that look like they are filled with gunk but are hard to pop.  i also have clogged pore looking things that i can squeeze and a never ending noodle of puss will come out (sorry to be so gross im just trying to explain what i deal with) not to mention little white heads here and there.  but most the the problems are around my mouth/lips and on the apples of my cheeks/around my nose area\n\nwhat ive tried to do: first of all let me say i cant afford to go to a derm, but i am not opposed to seeing an esthetician if it is affordable.  i have been using aveeno clear complexion foaming face wash to wash my face, makeup removing cloths before i wash, then i use face moisturizer.  but i have just started using OCM with castor oil and avocado oil.

Cystic acne is frequently related to hormones. Can you see an OB/GYN? They would at least be able to talk to you about that, and if you are ok with going on birth control or other hormonal meds, that might help.\n\nI agree with what most other commenters are saying, though. Drop the multitude of heavily fragranced Lush products and start over from scratch with some gentle products like CeraVe and maybe some oils. Seeing an esthetician might be worth it just so someone can see your skin and guide you through treating it irl, but don't let anyone try to sell you miracle products.

Obviously when you see the derm, just reiterate that you don't have insurance and you would just like to work out the least expensive option at this point that will still be effective.

        "body": "After trying a TON of different acne products, I stopped everything and started basic: face wash (Cetaphil), toner(Thayer's Witch Hazel, alcohol free with Aloe Vera), moisturizer (Cetaphil with SPF). This actually made my skin less red and more calm. Have you also considered your diet? My skin has changed for the better by removing all processed food and sugar (this includes eating out), becoming gluten free, and removing all dairy products from my diet. About a month after I quit everything I did a juice fast (mostly green juices) and it made me breakout but after the detox my skin felt and looked awesome! It really helped flush out all the toxins. I also started taking more vitamins since I am vegan and it is hard to get all the necessary fatty acids and nutrients I was once getting from fish and meat. R-Lipoic Acid, EPA-DHA, evening primrose oil (great to help balance your hormones) and a multivitamin containing iron. I saw my skin change again in about 3 months. As far as OCM, I have been using sunflower oil which I read somewhere is good for acne prone/combination skin. \n\nNow, this might not work for you but it's important to look at all options when you're trying to clear up your skin. And drink lots of water, I mean TONS! It will make a big difference in your skin as well. And if you smoke, stop smoking! And please, stop picking! It only makes your acne worse in long run and your skin will end up scarred once it finally clears up. Good luck on your journey and don't give up! It will get better!",

They don't always appear as \"ceramide \\_\\_\", there are other names for them, such as:\n\nHydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, Myristoyl/​Palmitoyl Oxostearamide/​Arachamide MEA, Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide, Hydroxypalmitoyl Sphinganine, [Safflower Oil/​Palm Oil Aminopropanediol Esters](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/safflower-oil-palm-oil-aminopropanediol-esters), etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo today I wanted to make a list of products that are easily overlooked when searching for ceramide skincare, because many people are only looking for the word \"ceramide\".

I bought a single gallon of \"100% cider (with added ingredient)\", separated into four jars with airlocks, ensured all were at 74°F, prime then pitched yeast into three of them. \n\nJar 1 - EC-1118\n\nJar 2 - Red Star Super Rouge\n\nJar 3 - LalBrew Nottingham Performance Ale\n\nJar 4 - Nothing. Wild yeast control and, if nothing happened with the others, my kveik specimen.\n\nIt's been about 2 to 2.5 days, and nothing's happened in the 3. I also threw some of the Nottingham in a gallon carboy with apple juice concentrate and water nearby, just as a precaution for the unlikely event all three were weak yeast. They weren't, it's bubbling away here, yeast orgy is in full swing.\n\nSo, it looks like these glycolipids may be a party stopper. I have some Latvian kveik that has ripped through some of the worst conditions warming to room temperature, and I'll toss it into Jar 4 as a last ditch effort to see if anything can beat this, but I'm not too confident.\n\n[As an aside, I'm quite surprised. Even with potassium sorbate I found I could cook or over pitch those juices into something bottleable. Or at least I'd get *some* activity, even for a short time.  These glycolipids seem to just swat away what I've thrown at it so far.]\n\nWill let you know if the kveik yields a surprise, but my gut feeling is glycolipids are a no-go for fermentation.",

    "body": "\nI have gotten into making mead and shared my results on a number of subs. People seemed interested, so I figured I’d post a guide here! \n\n[I have once made a crude guide to mead making on imgur, so here’s the link to that!](https://imgur.com/gallery/PAoCaTy)\n\nI’ll go into more detail now, though. \n\nFirstly, let’s cover what mead is. Mead is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented honey. It’s very simple to make and has been around forever. It’s probably the oldest alcoholic drink there is. So, crudely spoken, in order to make mead, you mix honey with water and get it to ferment. Wait a few weeks and boom, you get mead! \n\nNow, in detail, here’s what I do: \n\nFirst of all, here’s the equipment you absolutely need to get started: \n\n• 1x Carboy, I recommend at least three litres, but bigger, while more expensive to fill, is also better. You can also use something other that a Carboy, but the container you use should be \n\na) airtight \n\nand b) sealable with an airlock. \n\nEither way, this is what you use to ferment it in. \n\n• Airlock. If you buy a Carboy, they often come with it. An airlock is a device that allows you to seal the bottle, keeping out oxygen and bacteria, while also allowing the gases from fermentation to escape. \n\n• You also need a siphon in order to rerack the mead in the process (I’ll get to that). \n\n• sanitiser. Now, other mead makers look away, because what I’m about to say, while true, will make you cringe: I recommend you use a chemical, oxygen based sanitiser, but if you don’t want to buy that, use cheap spirits like vodka. \n\n• mead makers over at r/mead will tell you to use a hydrometer as well, but while it’s insanely helpful, you don’t need it to make a good mead. However, not using one won’t let you determine the exact ABV. You can make good estimates, though, so this really is optional, especially for a one time thing. \n\n• you need honey. Raw honey is best, but my experiments have revealed that you can use literally any honey, as long as it’s real honey and not some syrup based crap. Get the cheapest real honey you can find for your first try. How much? Well, the rule of thumb is 2 parts of water to one part of honey. Speaking in plain numbers, I recommend using one kilo for three litres of mead or roughly 1.5 kilos of honey for five litres of mead. You can also use less honey, the name of the mead you get then is “hydromel”. It’ll have less alcohol, but is not a bad thing to make and can taste awesome. And it’s still mead. \n\n• brewer’s yeast. You can use dried bread yeast, but it may have some difficulty working and it can introduce off flavours. Using brewer’s yeast works a lot better. Use any brewer’s yeast you like, Ale or beer yeast, wine yeast, cider yeast, champagne yeast, port yeast, mead yeast... it doesn’t matter, they all work. Three things you should know, though: \n\nOne, different yeasts have different alcohol tolerances. That doesn’t mean that beer yeast always gets you a lower percentage than wine yeast, but it means that some strands just can take less than others. Be sure to look into that before you start. \n\nTwo, different yeasts bring out different flavours. Look into what each yeast will bring out in particular, or don’t. In the end, it’ll probably still taste great.\n\nThree, what exactly does the yeast do? Well, it’ll turn the sugar into alcohol until it either runs out of sugars to turn into alcohol (I’ll warn you now that while mead is a sweet drink, because the yeast can’t turn every sugar into alcohol, and because it’s honey wine, the end result is less sweet than you might expect) or until the alcohol concentration gets too high for the yeast. That actually gives you a little bit of information to plan your mead. One way of making your mead sweeter is simply to use a yeast that has a lower alcohol tolerance than the amount of sugar (in the honey) you used could get you. You should also know that using a high tolerance yeast will give you a mead that immediately when it’s done, while tasty and definitely drinkable, also has some alcohol sharpness and benefits from ageing. \n \nSo anyway, you need yeast.\n\n• any other ingredients you want to use. Add Apple or Apple juice, and the technical term of the resulting mead is “Cyser”. Add rose petals and you get a “rhodomel”. Add grapes and you get a “pyment”. Add any other fruit and you end up with a “melomel” (recommend raspberries or blueberries, that tastes awesome). Add nothing and it’s a “traditional”. We already covered a bigger portion of water, that’s a “hydromel”. Also interesting is a “bochet”, with burnt or caramelised honey, and a “metheglin”, with spices. Be easy on the cloves and the cardamom, though! \n\n• you may use yeast nutrients if you’re planning on making a “hydromel”, a “metheglin” or a “traditional”. You can always use them, but I found that adding some fruit usually covers that anyway. If you want to use nutrients, you can buy wine making yeast nutrient salts online. They’re not that expensive. \n\nNow, let’s finally look at the process. This post is very long already, but the actually process is easy and quick, so don’t be discouraged! \n\n1. The first step is to sanitise everything, and I really mean EVERYTHING you use. Follow the instructions that come with the chemical sanitiser or soak you equipment in the cheap alcohol and then wash off with water in the end. \n\n2. If you want to make a bochet, cook your honey, but watch the time. 12 minutes is perfect if a caramel taste, any longer will quickly turn into lightly burnt marshmallow, with the taste of burnt sugar increasing with every minute. If you don’t want to make a bochet, skip the cooking, but mix water and honey in your Carboy. Add your nutrients (unless it’s fruit, then wait a second). \n\n3. If you want to make a rhodomel, a pyment, a metheglin, a Cyser or a melomel, now is one of two possible times to add your ingredients. I usually add my ingredients now. Cut up any fruit in order to increase exposure of the juice. Wash them thoroughly and then add them to the Carboy. Then you fill up with more water. Cold water will do it. You may also use frozen berries or actively freeze berries before you use them. That’ll break down cell walls and tissue and will work beneficial for your mead. You don’t need to do that, though, fresh fruit works fine. \n\nFill it up with water, like I said, but leave about two or three inches of head space. Depending on the kind of fruit you used, fermentation could be more vigorously and fill that gap fairly quickly. Leaving headspace prevents overflow and the cost of very little mead. \n\nAfter you filled it up, you may take a gravity reading with a hydrometer. You do that by filling some of the must into a testing tube and putting your hydrometer into the must, letting it float. You’ll need this particular reading if you want to determine the ABV later on with your hydrometer. However, like I said, this isn’t really necessary! \n\n4. when you’re done, and everything is inside your Carboy, make sure the must is room temperature at most before adding the yeast. You do not want to kill the yeast by putting it into a must that is too hot (40+ degrees Celsius). If it’s too cold, it’ll need to reach room temperature first before it starts fermenting, but this will not harm the yeast otherwise. \n\n5. After you added the yeast, put water into your airlock and seal the Carboy. Then wait. \n\n6. It is beneficial to open the container and stir the must once a day for the first half week in order to degas the whole thing, but then you should keep it sealed and just let the yeast to its job. \n\n7. After two to three weeks, you should remove any physically present ingredients from your mead. That means any rose petals, lavender, ginger pieces, berries, fruit, cinnamon sticks etc. There are two easy ways to do this, and I recommend one more than the other. \n\nHere’s the one I recommend: you use a second Carboy, sanitise it (and your siphon, you know the drill now, sanitise EVERYTHING), and rack the mead over into it. The ingredients are left behind and you can remove them from the now empty Carboy and clean it. Seal the new Carboy and put the mead away again. \n\nThe second option is not recommended because of the risk of contamination and oxidisation, but I occasionally use it nonetheless and it does work: \nIf you do not have a second Carboy, take an empty canister. Sanitise it (you know the drill), then rack your mead into it. Clean the Carboy, get rid of the remaining ingredients, sanitise it, and rack the mead back into it. That works. \n\n8. This is also the second opportunity to add ingredients. Instead of adding your ingredients to primary fermentation (at the beginning), put them into your Carboy after two weeks and rack the mead into it. Then you repeat the step to remove the ingredients again after another two weeks. Rumour has it that the taste of the ingredients will be more prominent if you do it this way. \n\n9. If you did step 8, do step 7 after two weeks. Then you seal the Carboy again and put it away. \n\n10. Now you just wait until fermentation is over. If you don’t use a hydrometer, wait another month or two. If you do have a hydrometer, take a gravity reading (by filling mead into your SANITISED test tube and letting the SANITISED hydrometer float within it). Take another gravity reading a week later and a third one after another week. If the readings are the same, fermentation is over. \n\nLet the mead fall clear. Some yeasts clear up quicker than others, but with enough time, they all do. You can also bottle it earlier, but then you’ll have dead yeast falling to the bottom of the bottle eventually.\n\n11. If you use a hydrometer, now is the time to determine your ABV. Take the reading you took at the very beginning and subtract your final gravity from that. Multiply it by 0.136 and you get your ABV. Let’s say your starting gravity was 1110 and your final gravity was 1010. That’s 100x0.136 and leaves you with an ABV of 13.6%. \n\n12. Once your mead fell clear, bottle it. Bottles with screw-tops are not suited for long term storage (there’s a risk of oxygenation if the bottle isn’t completely air right), but if you plan to consume all of your mead within two months, that’s fine. Otherwise I recommend corking your bottles, or you just take a chance :D most importantly, sanitise the bottles before you fill them. \n\nIf your mead has a high ABV, I recommend ageing it for 6-12 months before consuming it. It’ll taste a lot better and rounder. However, it’ll also taste good if you just drink it quickly. \n\nWhatever you do, DO NOT JUST ADD HONEY OR SUGAR TO MAKE IT SWEETER. It’ll just start fermenting again. If you want to sweeten it (you really don’t have to, time will bring out the honey again), stabilise the mead with potassium metabisulfate and potassium sorbate (be careful you don’t buy and use *sodium* sorbate. It’ll work but introduce off flavours). Stabilisation will take about a week and a half, then you can mix some honey with water and mix that solution into the mead. However, again, you do not need to do that! \n\nSo, that’s it. That’s how you make mead! Sorry it turned out to be so long, but it’s a lot less to do that it seems! \n\nGood luck, shoot me any questions you might have.\n\nEdit: two more things. If you’re interested in doing this more than once and picking this up as a new hobby, check out r/mead. It’s a nice community full of very helpful people. \n\nAlso, I can’t promise you this for every place, but depending on where you live, I might be able to help you find your equipment relatively cheaply. Best piece of advice is this, though: check out your local hobby, or even better brewing store.",

Boiling water is: (1) free and (2) does't require gross, unhealthy chemicals.\n\nWe've made mead both using champagne yeast and using spontaneous wild fermentation (which is my favorite).  Benefit of doing a wild fermentation is that it's free and super easy. Once you add enough water to the mead, it will naturally start fermenting.",

    "body": "In my opinion the only way ascorbic acid may potentially work topically is when it's used fresh, and applied at night in the absence of UV exposure. Personally I don't believe in preformulated water based ascorbic acid products. Even when it's fresh the amount of studies that prove that vitamin c really works topically is quite limited. Vitamin c penetrates skin rather poorly. There simply is no standardization to prove the effectiveness of a specific formula, unlike sunscreens and retinoic acid. Shelf life is no indication of the stability of actives and doesn't say anything about it's stability on skin. Ascorbic acid is simply notoriously unstable, it's more likely to degrade on skin and be irritating. From all the research available today, the best efficient way to get ascorbic acid in skin is to just take it orally.\n\nBeneficial actives in bold, potential irritants in italic/stripethrough\n\n**Water based products**: below pH3.5 the ionic charge of AA is removed ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5605218/)), improving skin penetration and stability, but water based products remain extremely unstable ([ref](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/7291637/stability-of-vitamin-c-derivatives-in-solution-and-topical-formulations/3),[ref](https://skinelegance.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/CSBM_-Skincare-theories-busted-Dec-2014.pdf)), most companies don't store their product in fridges in warehouses, it isn't unlikely products are severely oxidized by the time they arrive at your home\n\n* [€18/50mL - Skinlex 20%](https://www.skinlex.com/product/20-vitamin-c-serum-30ml/)\n  * **pH:** 3-3.3\n  * **Pros:** simple irritant free formula, right pH, pump is convenient compared to pipet, light serum, inexpensive\n  * **Cons:**  pump is not airless, concentration other actives unknown, instability, the look and feel of website and adress of company make me doubt if it's really formulated by a well educated cosmetic chemist\n  * **INCI:** Water, **20% L-Ascorbic Acid**, Butylene Glycol, **Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin**, *Triethanolamine*, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol.\n\n* [€28/50mL - SkinPep C15](https://skinpep.com/super-c15-serum/)\n * **pH:** 4.3\n  * **Pros:** Great blend of actives, light serum, shared concentrations\n  * **Cons:** pH is too high, dropper, instability, incorrect ingredient order (Propylene Glycol)\n  * **INCI:** Aqua, **15% l- Ascorbic Acid, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-3, Panthenol**, Hydrolyzed Collagen, **1% Alpha Tocopherol, 0.5% Ferulic Acid**, Glycerin , *Triethanolamine*, Phenoxyethanol, *2% Propylene Glycol*, Ethoxydiglycol, Laureth-23\n\n* [€34/50mL -Wishtrend 21.5 Advanced Serum](http://www.wishtrend.com/skin-care/1215-pure-vitamin-c215-advanced-serum-by-wishtrend.html)\n * **pH:** unknown\n  * **Pros:** Simple irritant free formula\n  * **Cons:** concentration is a bit high, dropper bottle, lack of stabilizers, not many actives \n  * **INCI:** Hippophae Rhamnoides Water (70%), **Ascorbic Acid** (21.5%), Sodium Lactate, 1,2-Hexanediol, **Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol**, Cassia Obtusifolia Seed Extract, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol\n\n* [€41.60/50mL - SkinActives 15%](http://www.skinactives.com/Vitamin-C-Serum-Ascorbic-Acid-L.html)\n * **pH:** 1.5-2.5\n  * **Pros:** Airless pump!, great blend of actives, not very expensive, no propylene glycol, ph is low enough for penetration, skinactives is busy with a reformulation without the citrus extracts.\n  * **Cons:** ph is irritating, according skinactives not suited for daily use, lack of stabilizers like water reducing agents, recrystalizes quickly.

I've been debating with myself wether to put this on the good or bad list. In my opinion there are a lot of uncertainties about the stability of diy formulas, especially if you start mixing it through existing products. Even destilled water contains impurities that will react with ascorbic Acid, and many people don't use water reducing agents, or stabilizers like propyl gallate, sodium metabisulfite, chelators etc. A low pH, vitamin E, Ferulic acid help of course, but I don't think many people really understand the exact chemical reactions going on and don't have analyzers like they do in labs, so how certain can you be about your own creation. Most often DIY formulas also just recrystallize on skin. Formulating an ascorbic acid serum really is difficult, it is more than just dissolving some ingredients in water. Dissolving in TO Ferulic Acid will be difficult since maximum solubility in Propanediol is just 5%, in contrast to 33% in water. The key here is to make it fresh every 1-3 days I guess.\n  * [€5.80/20g TO Powder](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-100pct-l-ascorbic-acid-powder-20g?redir=1)\n  * [€89 /20mL Philosophy Turbo C booster](https://www.sephora.com/product/turbo-booster-c-powder-P204606)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Anhydrous formulas**: best stability, but not much research on penetration\n\n* [€9.60/50mL - The Ordinary C23](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-vitamin-c-suspension-23pct-ha-spheres-2pct-30ml?redir=1)\n  * **Pros:** Cheap, anhydrous (stable), together with TO Ferulic+Resveratrol a very affordable good combo\n  * **Cons:** No other actives,  no vitamin E, relatively unpleasant texture, stinging, for me too thick/greasy for daytime use.

Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.\n\nThat means that with TO Vit C 23%, your skin is only using about 2%, while L-AA's max absorption rate is 20%.",

I started the fermentation on Oct 12, and I let it run its course. On Dec 4 I put some into a jar and i've been letting it clear, i've already tasted it, and it tastes surprisingly good. The fruitcake had Potassium Sorbate in it, but it didn't seem to be an issue. I added enough sugar to get it up to 10% ABV, don't remember what type of sugar I used but it was either granulated white sugar, or brown sugar. First picture is right after starting the fermentation, and the second picture is immediately after siphoning into the jar. The third picture was taken after it started to clear, it's also far clearer now than in the photo, a while after taking #3, I poured a little extra into the jar that I had left over as well. The last picture is of course, my fruitcake of choice. Overall easy experience, no snags, 8/10 taste. Also, I used bread yeast and it doesn't taste like bread, so that's a plus!",

I'm definitely not going through an entire bottle of newly opened sunscreen in a week. Was relieved that 3 out of 4 above had preservatives but the sad thing is this isn't 100% across the board. We're not even at the stage where we can evaluate if the preservative system is sufficient, I'm having to go with \"well, at least there's one.\"\n\nCan anyone chime in one whether one preservative like ethylhexylglycerin or phenoxyethanol is as sufficient as we can compromise on for commonly used products? I can't tell an entire industry to bring back parabens (which sadly accompany formulas with other irritating/comedogenic ingredients for me like niacinamide, alcohol/alcohol denat., shea butter, etc. and I don't think my skin likes the high ratio of propanediol in many products) so this is me on copium.  \n\nI still use skinsort even with all its problems, but too bad they only have \"paraben-free\" as a filter option and not \"with parabens or preservatives\" as one.\n\nUpdate: To clarify, I'm personally expressing my own concern based on the resources I've access to as a public consumer. I appreciate people giving me balanced pushback (and thank you to those sharing resources for me to look into further), and still, given that we're all forced to navigate these cloudy waters on our own if we don't have a background in this field already means these questions come up for me.

It would be completely foolish of me to do so without any solid, evidence based, backing behind it; every single opinion that I give on this sub or any other has anywhere between many years of experience or solid hours of googling behind it, and I expect others to do the same. \n\nTaking the word of someone, anyone, regardless of their qualifications or credentials without doing research on their claims and finding how it lines up with the general consensus it's also very foolish. LabMuffin is not infallible, she's one woman who can make mistakes and will make them in the future, and relying on her word alone is not enough when it comes to complex topics and discussions. \nThe Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, the branch of government that oversees and imposes The Comestic Act, is where you have to go if you want to further understand any ingredient of any product made and sold in Korea. There are plenty of [documents](https://www.mfds.go.kr/eng/wpge/m_24/de011014l001.do) and webpages made available in English for you to look through, and many other [websites](https://cosmetic.chemlinked.com/cosmepedia/regulatory-requirements-for-cosmetic-ingredients-in-south-korea) who dive deeper into the topic by reviewing and translating documents. \n\nIn short, to try and raise alarm on a topic based with very little backing and even less proper research is definitely not helpful in the current anti-science climate we're living in.",

They either justify their short-life products as ~it’s meant to be that way because it’s au naturel~. Or they still use preservatives, just not the largely demonized and widely recognized ones like paraben, then they market it as paraben-free, which is technically true and they don’t explicitly state preservative-free, **but you can’t pretend that the fear of paraben isn’t read as the fear of preservatives as a whole to the public**.\n\nAnd Lab Muffin isn’t just some random influencer who doesn’t know what she talks about. Yes, she is flawed and fallible. But she is very passionate about consumers’ science literacy. Now is it possible for her viewers to watch her videos and not perfectly grasp her message? Of course! Each of us is deeply imperfect as a communicator and an audience. \n\nBut it’s still incorrect to conflate someone like Michelle as the typical influencer who loves to talk out of their a** and someone like OP as the anti-science crunchy type. After all, the examples OP listed are all Korean sunscreens, which btw I literally just received my stock-up haul of Skin1004 sun serum, but you can’t ignore the fact the K-beauty brands literally had a scandal not too long ago regarding their sunscreen regulation. And guess who was the big influencer that originally went bat for K-beauty brands when the allegations started to bubble up? It was Lab Muffin beauty.",

    "body": "I have always been a big fan of Plum Cake. It is not overly sweet. Its caramel flavor goes great with tea. When i was in US, i used to squeal in joy when i used to spot plum cakes in the Indian store. Then feel dejected when i see the manufacture and best by dates. Still buy it and eat it. When i came on short visits I used to carry plum cakes from Society bakery in Kochi with me back. Then i had an idea to try and make a plum cake myself. It was a revelation. Real plum cake is nothing like what you get in elite boxes. It is made with dryfruits soaked in alcohol and has a moist texture. It smells heavenly of orange peels. \n\nPlum Cake came to us from the England. In old English almost every dried fruit was known as plum, and fruitcakes made with these dryfruits were called plum cakes. Mostly they contained raisins and currants. As the global trading became easier, more variety of dryfruits were added to plum cakes. \n\nHow did Malayalees start eating Plum Cakes though? In 1880, in Thalasserry , Mambally Bapu  — an exporter of milk, tea and bread to British troops in Egypt  — decided to set up his own little borma (bakery). He had just returned from Burma, where he had mastered the art of biscuit making, and wanted to popularise baked goods among the local Malayalis. He soon was making different types of biscuits and breads for the local population. In 1883, a few days before Christmas, Murdoch Brown - a British planter - walked into the bakery with a rich plum cake he had brought from England. He asked Bapu to taste the cake and asked him if he could bake one just like that. Brown gave Bapu a quick-demo about the basics of cake making, and gave him some ingredients for the plum cake. Bapu made the cake, adding his own Kerala twist with native Malabar spices and local brew. Sayippu was greatly impressed with the cake, and soon locals also started having the plum cake. \n\nNow, Elite seems to be the market leader in Plum Cakes as far as general market is concerned. Their plum cakes come with the minimum that is expected in a plum cake like raisins and plum cake flavor, and contains the commercial preservatives and chemicals which ensure a long shelf life and low production cost. I checked the 4 plum cake varieties released by the company. What is the difference between them (apart from price)\nRich Plum Cake - contains 20% candied fruits and 3% dates/cherry/tuttifruity\nPlum Surprise Cake - contains 8% candied fruits and dates/cherry/tuttifruity (unknown)\nPlum Delight - contains 9% candied fruits and dates/cherry/tuttifruity (unknown)\nChoco Plum Cake -  contains 7% candied fruits and dates/cherry/tuttifruity (unknown)\n\nI would request you to find out the home bakers near you who make plum cakes. The home-made plum cake, made in the traditional way is unlike the dry slabs of plum cake that you get from commercial brands. It is moist and tasty without all the chemical ingredients we can live without. Homebaked ones contain from 30% to 50% dryfruits. Or the trusty neighbourhood bakery atleast. \n\nChemicals in commercial plum cakes: \nINS 442 \n(Mixed ammonium salts of phosphorylated glycerides – emulsifiers)\nINS 224\npotassium metabisulfite\nINS 422\nGlycerin\nINS 471\nglyceryl monostearate, glyceryl distearate\nINS 260\nglacial acetic acid\nINS 466\nPreservatives like:\nINS 202\n(potassium sorbate) \nINS 211\n(sodium benzoate)\nAdded Colors\nINS 150d sulfite ammonia caramel\nINS 122 azorubine, carmoisine\n\nHome made cakes on the other hand contain may be 2-3 essential chemicals - which are baking soda, baking powder, salt. They use good dry fruits and no artificial colours. Dryfruits are usually soaked for months together before being baked into cakes\n\nBelow i am giving couple of home bakers who are kind of big operations in Kerala:\nOmana Paul bakery,\nKallivayalil Bakes \n\nSpend this christmas with some nice plum cakes!",

    "body": "You want to know if it worked...I'm burying the lede here. Stay with me though.\n\nI have not had a chance to read the papers K18's team wrote in the last 10 years, so I decided to do this \"part 1\" with current results, then a part 2 with paper/patent comments plus how my hair fared in an upcoming bleaching service.\n\nK18 is a post-wash leave-in treatment applied on towel-dried hair. The claim is \"...molecular breakthrough clinically proven to reverse hair damage in 4 minutes\" from bleach, dyeing, heat, other chemical services like perms.\n\nAnd\n\n>Traveling into the inner-most layers of hair to reach the core polypeptide chains (keratin chains), our revolutionary K18Peptide™ is just the right size and makeup to fit in and reconnect broken chains.\n\nIngredients as of this writing:\n\nWater, Alcohol Denat., Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Ether, Cetyl Esters, Behentrimonium Chloride, Polysorbate 20, sh-Oligopeptide-78 (K18Peptide™), Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Starch, Isopropyl Alcohol, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Fragrance, Geraniol, Linalool, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Alcohol.\n\nIt is sold in 5 ml sample sizes or 50 ml full size. The pump pushes out about 1ml of product and anywhere from 1 to 4+ pumps is needed for the treatment depending on hair length, volume, & strand thickness. The lotion goes over clean but not conditioned towel-dried hair. Once applied, it needs to sit on hair for 4 minutes before using any other product.\n\nThe instructions are to use every time you wash your hair for 4 to 6 washes. If using a lot of product (no explanation on how 'heavy product use' is defined), the website text recommends a clarifying shampoo before application. After the initial 4-6 applications, the rate is 1 application every 3 to 4 washes.\n\nPros (and DOES IT WORK?):\n\nK18 improved the look and feel of my bleached hair ends, and the hair ends curled with no coaxing needed and felt soft/shiny again. The time my hair takes to dry without products shortened by 1.5 hours. Frizz diminished. Squishing my hair after washing produced less water. And I got to day 4 curly hair, which had not happened to me, ever.\n\nI saw significant change after application #4. I had committed to doing 6 washes/applications, so I continued. Areas of my hair that had been bleached more than the rest showed improvement last.\n\nLike Olaplex, K18 does something good, but I cannot state that it does what it claims (insert peptide chain in cortex, have peptide chain chemically link up bits and pieces in cortex). I did not test elasticity.\n\nK18 significantly improved hydrophobicity. Based on the list of ingredients I bet there is heavy adsorbtion of cationics going on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLess pro, but not cons:\n\n1. The amount to apply is tiny, and spreading it throughout the hair is challenging because one cannot see where product has been applied versus where it has not, plus the product is all over your palms, so cannot feel, either. For my hair I needed 4-5 pumps (4-5 ml), so I applied in sections, ends first, and hoped for the best.\n2. For people whose curly hair routine includes putting styling products in sopping wet hair, or not touching curls, using K18 requires rethinking all that as it is applied on clean towel dried hair, and must  be applied before any other hair product.\n3. If you co-wash, I would suggest using a shampoo that does not deposit much of anything on the hair prior to using K18\n4. The dosing chart is hidden on the product page (you must select the accordion chevron--the arrow pointing down-- to the right of \"how to use\"  to see the text)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAssorted: If buying the 50 ml product in the US, your cost is $1.50/pump. The 5 ml sample cost is $2.40/pump. Also, their customer service answered my questions pretty fast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWill I buy again? \n\nEDITED 5 /8 / 2022: Link to Part 2: [https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/ule42z/k18\\_my\\_experience\\_part\\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/ule42z/k18_my_experience_part_2/)",

    "body": "I’ve been putting this post off for too long, but it’s 4am and I can’t sleep, so I may as well get ‘er done.\n\n**Background:** I’ve used two full sized bottles of SK-II’s FTE, and I’m about 1/4 of the way through Missha’s! I feel both have been given a fair chance to show their results. I have oily skin with rosacea, and have been using prescription retinoids for a couple months now.\n\n**SK-II Ingredients:** Galactomyces ferment filtrate, butylene glycol, pentylene glycol, water, sodium benzoate, methylparaben, sorbic acid.\n\n**SK-II Review:** It’s no surprise that I loved this stuff, seeing as I used up two bottles of it. The texture is lighter than water, and it sinks in in a matter of seconds. My skin legitimately felt healthier, bouncier, and more resilient after continued use. It doesn’t feel hydrating by itself, but after a while I felt as though I didn’t need as much additional hydration as I normally do. I would say my skin looked brighter, but only marginally. There are downsides though—because of the mild exfoliation, I experienced a slight purge the first week of use. I also don’t think it’s compatible with strong retinoids because of its exfoliative properties. After being on adapalene for weeks, I noticed a stinging sensation when I would apply it. Luckily I was towards the very end of the bottle and was able to use it up.\n\n**Missha Ingredients:** Bifida ferment lysate, diethoxyethyl succinate, niacinamide, 1,2 hexanediol, adenosine, water, lecithin, saccharomyces ferment filtrate, potassium sorbate, glycerin, hydrogenated lecithin, acetic acid, water, polyquaternium-51, ceramide NP, phenoxyethanol, dimethicone, yeast ferment extract, lactic acid, hordeum vulgare extract, cassia alata leaf extract, ethylhexylglycerin, sodium PCA, butylene glycol, dipropylene glycol.\n\n**Missha Review:** I switched to Missha because I couldn’t justify dropping another $200 on a FTE without at least trying a dupe, and I’m glad I did. If SK-II is lighter than water, Missha is about the same as water. It’s by no means thick or heavy, just not quite as light, and doesn’t sink in as immediately. Besides the texture, the first thing I noticed is that it felt very hydrating. I’m assuming there has to be some degree of exfoliation going on because of the small amount of lactic acid, but it didn’t sting my retinoid treated skin in the least. In fact, it felt very soothing. Even when I ramped up adapalene to tretinoin, there were no bad reactions. My skin doesn’t feel quite as healthy/resilient as it did with SK-II, but despite that it *looks* better. It’s smoother, my redness is noticeably reduced, and overall looks brighter.\n\n**Final comparison/wrap up:** If I’m considering price, Missha is the winner. It accomplishes some pretty impressive things for being less than a 1/4 of the price of SK-II. If price isn’t a consideration, I think it’s less clear cut. SK-II feels higher end on the skin, and I’ll forever miss that healthy skin feeling and subtle luminosity—but again, I don’t think it’s suitable to use with super strength actives like tretinoin, unless you’ve been on it for a long time and are 100% adjusted to it. IMO Missha is better if you’re after immediate hydration, want more soothing action, and prefer to use harsh actives.\n\nI tried to be as thorough as possible, but I did start this at 4am after not sleeping well… so if I need to clarify anything please let me know! As always I love questions, and hope I helped :)",

I’m out of the loop, but I really thought - wow, when did missha sponsor some esports team??!\n\nsecond, I can actually add something on topic. I used to really like the missha one and used it for a good while (easily 4 bottles). but a couple years back they changed the formula again and that made me breakout pretty fast (normal/dry skin). not sure if it was that yeast ferment, but it didn’t really agree with me. I’m still using the night ampoule from the same line. it has been changed twice aswell, but without negative effects for me. \n\nI feel like this duo of fte and ampoule is one of their staples, but by the time (which is a really long time usually) you need to repurchase, there might be a new edition. not sure if that is the case for skII aswell.",

    "body": "So sorry in advance for such a long post - you can skip to what we plan on doing! \nMy husband and I have decided to hop on the mead making train and asked for a mead kit for Christmas. We got the basic Craft a Brew kit which did not come with stabilizers or a hydrometer, but I’ve done some research and decided to get campden tablets, potassium sorbate, a hydrometer, and more gallon containers to rack and make more meads. A couple of our friends are making their first meads as well and on March 29th, we will be taste testing our meads and going the a Renaissance festival.\nOur mead is going to be a strawberry rose mead that I watched Golden Hive Mead make. \nAny pointers in this process is much appreciated!!\n\nWe are now on day 3 and THIS IS WHAT WE’VE DONE SO FAR:\nDay 1 we puréed 3lbs of strawberries and added peptic enzyme and let it sit for an hour. Afterwards, we strained it and added the juice into the carboy with half a gallon of spring water and then added 3lbs Round Rock Honey in 1/3 increments. Shook it around and then added the day 1 yeast nutrients that came with the kit (does not explain what nutrients these are). We then swirled it around again and added more spring water to it. Then we added the Lalvin D47 yeast and added the airlock and stopper..instructions did not say to swirl it around again but looking back, I feel like we should have, but oh well.\nDay 2 we degassed as best we could and then put half the day 2+5 nutrients in tiny increments and degassed in between each increment. Added airlock and stopper and let it do it’s thing..the degassing part was really the only struggle because I’m not really sure how “dissipated” the foam needs to be because at that point, there was a small 1/2inch line of foam the whole time and it would not completely dissipate no matter how many times we swirled that thing..\n\nWHAT WE PLAN ON DOING:\nWe will add the rest of the nutrients on day 5 (12/25) and degass again. On days 6-20 it says to regularly degas it, and then just let it continue fermenting until bottling on day 30..but that’s not where we will be ending it!! This is where I’d like some pointers, please.\n\nBased on the Golden Hive Mead video, after we ferment for 30 days, I plan on racking it into a new gallon container to back sweeten it and add some rose flavor to it. So in the video, they crushed a campden tablet into a different container and racked their mead into it. Then they dropped a brew bag filled with 2tbsp of dried rose petals into it. They waited 24hrs and then added potassium sorbate into it and then waited another 24hrs before removing the brew bag of petals and  adding more honey. They then let it sit until bottling. \n\nMy questions are:\n1. In the video, it sounded like he steeped the brew bag of dried rose petals for 2 weeks before putting the brew bag into the mead..wouldn’t that remove the rose flavors? Can I just put the brew bag of dried rose petals into the mead for that 48hrs of stabilizing, or would that be an overwhelming rose flavor?\n2. I really wanted to add more strawberries into it after primary fermentation, because I’ve heard you can add fruit before and after primary.. when exactly can I do that and do you recommend? I was thinking of adding in 1lb of frozen strawberries at the same time I’m adding honey in to back sweeten. \n3. Is there too much foam in my day 3 photo?? \n\nPlease note, I was not able to get an original hydrometer reading because I didn’t realize that the hydrometer set I bought did not come with a graduated cylinder and I had no way of testing it.. so I took the reading from the Golden Hive Mead and another video of Man Made Mead doing the same Craft a Brew kit which both turned out to be 1.09.\n\n Thank you in advance for all your help! I’m excited to learn more about this process and make more meads!",

If they are the same, you can add potassium sorbate and potassium metabisulfite to stabilize the mead. This must be done BEFORE adding fruit. Then after 24 hours you can add the fruit. Typically you rack off the lease and onto the potassium sorbate and potassium metabifulfite.\n\n3: no, not too much foam.",

After stabilising with potassium sorbate/metabisulphite, wait 24 hours and then add the pouch of rose petals. After 24 hours taste the mead and then repeat this every 12-24h until you are happy with the strength of the rose petal flavour. Once you have reached the desired ‘rosiness’ I would then backsweeten with honey. \n\n2. For fruit in secondary fermentation, just add your fruit to a brew bag and put that into the demijohn for 5-7 days, then remove. If you are going to add fruit, DO NOT backsweeten with honey until you are happy with the strawberry flavour as the fruit will naturally make your mead sweeter. Backsweeten after the addition of fruits. \n\n3. The amount of foam looks fine, there is very little headspace so if you get a really vigorous ferment, some of the foam/liquid may get into the airlock, in which case, clean and sanitise it and quickly put it back into the bung. \n\nHope you find the above useful & welcome to the hobby!",

    "body": "Hello Reddit and hello r/Homebrewing, I hope it's okay that I post this article here. I plan to reference this post as a link and hope it can help others learn to make enjoyable mead while lowering the learning curve and clearing up common questions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaking Mead\n\nA beginner’s guide to my approach\n\nBy Kevin Miller\n\n4/15/2020\n\nMaking Mead should be easy. Maybe not simple, but not difficult. Like all crafts, true mead making artisans pour their energy into creating the best product they can. And because of this, the process can be very complex, time consuming, involved, and tedious. But it doesn’t have to be.\n\nWhat is mead (in simple terms)?\n\nMead is an alcoholic drink made from water and honey. And the best part is, it can be that easy. Honey naturally contains bacteria that will ferment it when dissolved in water. It will ferment itself and doesn’t even need to be heated. Easy right?\n\nHow complicated is mead?\n\nMead is a wine with a very delicate flavor and aroma that can be tailored as much as grape wine. It can be aged, be given realistically any additive like spices, oak aging, yeast nutritional supplements, acids, tannins, even special strains of bacteria.  It can be carbonated, and can be improved through several years of aging. Mead can be as complicated and complex as any other wine. \n\nSo how much work is worth a beginner’s time?\n\nObviously this question’s answer will differ from person to person. One must decide for themselves how much time, focus, and money they are willing or able to dedicate to the craft. But with that said, plain honey and water isn’t very enjoyable to drink; there are some things that really need to be done to create a great beverage. \n\nVery bare essentials:\n\nWater - clean, dechlorinated\n\nHoney - any kind\n\nYeast - preferably a mead, wine, cider, ale, or lager yeast\n\nYeast nutrition - we’ll come back to this\n\nA container - Carboy, jug, demijohn, bucket\n\nSome basic brewing equipment\n\nAgain, there can be so much more involved in the process but I have around 20 batches of mead (of all sizes half to 5 gallon) with this list.\n\nLet’s tear into the details of what you’ll need to begin!\n\nWater.\n\nThere are books, even college degrees on the subject. If you want to get serious about the craft you will eventually need to learn more about your water. It’s source, it’s contents, how to get the best water and what to do with it. To begin with, however, you can simply use store bought spring water or boil the water the day before to sterilize it and evaporate the chlorine and chloramine. I’ve had good results with both. Store bought is my recommendation because you can get a fairly consistent product for cheap. If you go this route, stay with the same brand so you can learn how to tailor your recipe to the water’s characteristics.\n\nHoney.\n\nOh boy! This is a fun one! Honey suppliers, bee keepers, bee keeping supply stores, grocery stores. The reality of honey is that it’s never consistent and the smaller the supplier is, the more variation there will be from batch to batch. And one flavor or style or supplier may not be always available. Don’t worry too much about that, but know that if you buy specialty honey, you may not be able to get it again.\n\nWhat type of honey is the best?\n\nI can’t tell you what honey you’ll like best, but I can say that almost any honey is good enough to use. In the beginning, avoid using only one light bodied honey because, if there isn’t any flavor to begin with, the brewing fairies aren’t just going to add it to your mead while it’s fermenting. For a solid start, I recommend mixing half clover and half wildflower for a medium body and slightly buttery flavor.\n\nHow much should you pay?\n\nUntil you have made several successful batches, pay as little as possible. Buy in bulk to save money if you are able. Consider places like Costco, Walmart, Smart and Final for the best prices. Honey doesn’t go bad as it naturally seals spoiling bacteria so buy enough for a few batches. You’ll use it. For a quick starting guide you will want around 2 lbs per gallon of semi-strong mead (10%) 3 lbs per gallon for strong mead (15%)\n\nYeast!\n\nThis is another topic that can become a whole education. The yeast’s life cycle starts with coming out of hibernation once they’ve been rehydrated. First they shit themselves, then they have an orgy, replicate, and die. Each subsequent generation will feed on the old dead yeast as well as the simple sugars in the mead, excreting esters (flavors), CO2, and ethanol as they go. As the mead becomes more alcoholic, it also becomes more toxic to the yeast. When the mead reaches this point they clean up their mess and begin to go dormant.\n\nThe simple facts are that yeast are living bacteria. They live in the air, on every surface, and all over you. They also exist in the honey you’re using. But, not all “wild yeast” make a tasty mead. Some folks don’t pitch yeast, they just let mother nature take over. This is risky but can lead to some really fun brews because every strain will impart their own flavor and ferment at different speeds and at different temperatures.\n\nHere’s my advice: buy quality yeast (not baking yeast-it tastes terrible in wine). Buy a few different types and play with it as you learn. My favorite brand of wine yeast are Lalvin and Redstar. I mostly use Red Star Premier Blanc since it ferments nicely at room temperature. I also like their Cote des Blanc. Most people start with Lalvin D47 but it adds flavors I don’t prefer (yeah, yeast adds flavor. More than you’d guess!) I do like the K1-V116. This is another thing you’ll want to buy extra since you’re not going to only brew once.\n\nMany new brewers will just rip open the yeast and pitch it right in the mead. Don’t be a jerk. Hydrate your yeast first. Usually the instructions are on the back but in essence you want to warm up some water to room temp and stir in the yeast. Cover it loosely with plastic wrap and put it out of any light. Do this before you start making your mead and it should be ready by the time everything’s mixed up.\n\nYeast Nutrients?\n\nRemember how I said that yeast are living organisms? Well, that means they need food and vitamins, even air, to thrive just like everything else. You can buy lots of products to keep your yeast healthy. “Fermaid K” and DAP are big ones that can be purchased at a local home brew shop or online. Ferm k is basically vitamins and yeast hulls (that’s right, feed them dead bodies) and DAP (diamonium phosphate). Those products aren’t absolutely necessary but they will keep the yeast healthier and improve the flavors that the yeast give off. Stressed yeast produces bad flavors. \n\nIf you’re on a tight budget, you can add a small handful of raisins and some acidic fruit like orange or lemon (juice and skin). Just be sure to wash and sanitize the fruit before adding. Keep in mind that natural ingredients like these will add to the flavor for better or for worse.\n\nContainers…\n\nThere are as many options as there are people who like mead. The easiest way to start is with clean, new, plastic buckets. They should be food safe HDPE (high density polyethylene) and can be found a home depot, grocery outlets, and you local brew shop. I don’t recommend them because they are easy to scratch and bacteria can and will hide in the scratches. All of my plastic gear gets VERY thoroughly washed with a microfiber cloth but I try not to use it if I can avoid it.\n\nA good cheap place to start is by buying a gallon jug of cheap wine. Drink it, cook with it, pour it out, whatever. Make sangria and share with cute girls. You can usually get them for around $10 and you get some wine with it :)  Realistically, you’re going to end up with just over a half gallon of mead if you start with a gallon container. But, the perks to these are that they’re easy to clean, you can see the fermentation action, you can easily find bungs and airlocks for them. As soon as you think you’re going to make bigger batches, you’ll want to upgrade to glass carboys. They are the thick glass 3 or 5 gallon containers that most home brewers use. Carboys are a standard size and you can find accessories like bags, straps, and handles that make them easier to carry.\n\nI’ve used all of the above and more. You can ferment in anything, so find whatever fits your budget and needs. If you want to go with single gallon containers you might even know someone with one or two laying around. Whatever you pick, buy at least two so you can rack your mead. I’ll explain later.\n\nBASIC BREWING EQUIPMENT\n\nOk, there are lots of ways to do this. Here’s what I use:\n\n* Sanitizer (I prefer Star San)\n* Racking Cane and vinyl tubing\n* Bungs (it’s nice to have extra)\n   * One gallon jugs use either #6 or #6 ½ \n* Air locks (I prefer the three piece style)\n* Hydrometer (for measuring sugar levels and ABV%)\n* Big ass spoon\n* Food scale\n* Big bottle brush\n* Bottles (swing tops are the best for beginners\n* Cleaning buckets\n* Funnel\n\nReady to know how to brew?\n\nBefore you start brewing you need to know something. Most of brewing is cleaning. Seriously. Like 90%\n\nNow pay attention: Washing is not the same as sanitizing. Read that sentence again.\n\nWashing is done with hot water and dish soap. It is the process of manually removing oils and solids. Washing always happens first. Sanitizing is the process of chemically neutralizing any living bacteria that could cause spoilage. Sanitizer can only reach the outside of anything and soaking a mold colony in sanitizer will not kill it. That’s why we wash first. Home brewers usually use acid sanitizers like Star San that can be left on the equipment without affecting the flavor of the mead. Professional wineries use sulfites to sanitize but that must be rinsed off and requires some knowledge of chemistry. Also, sulfites can kill yeast.\n\nI always start my brew day with lots of cleaning. Grab a drink, crank the tunes, wipe everything down, sweep the floors, clean and sanitize the ALL equipment and you’re good to start. When you are finished brewing, it is good practice to clean equipment before putting it away. I also sanitize mine before putting it away because you can’t be too careful.\n\nNow the fun part, brewing! First, rehydrate your yeast. Then, mix your honey and water together with your big ass spoon, take a gravity reading, and add any additions. Then, put it in the fermentation container and shake for eight to ten minutes. Pitch the yeast and add a sanitized airlock filled with sanitizer. Store it in a closet on top of a towel and also covered with a towel. Add nutrients according to the directions. \n\nThat’s it!\n\nOkay so that’s pretty simple right? But here are some tips:\n\n1. Put down towels. Keep extra towels at the ready.\n2. Remember, the container will have to hold the yeast, the honey, and the water. You’re probably not gonna nail this the first time and you may even occasionally forget to leave room for the yeast. To help yourself out, draw a fill line on the container’s outside with a sharpie around 75% full. You can fill to that line, then add your hydrated yeast and have enough room for fruit and the bubbling that happens during fermentation.\n   1. I like to do two batches at once to make it worth my time!\n3. Fill a bucket with sanitizer and use it all day while brewing. At the end of the day, use it to fill a spray bottle. Sanitizer keeps for a long time and you will want it down the road, trust me.\n4. When buying a hydrometer, look for one that’s easy to read. The ones designed for beer are good.\n5. You can warm the honey to make it easier to mix but don’t exceed 110f or it will kill off the beneficial bacteria. Also, yeast can only tolerate a tight range of temperatures. Check the yeast before heating and keep below the max.\n6. Shaking a gallon of mead for eight minutes sucks, but shaking five gallons is much harder. I bought an aquarium pump and stainless steel air stone to aerate the mead. It’s great. If you don’t want to buy one then you can place the container on a towel and rock it back and forth. If you rock or shake it, plug that thing up so it doesn’t spill out. And be careful when you take the bung out, there will be pressure inside.\n7. Bungs! Since we’re on the topic, you’re going to want some bungs. I’d recommend buying bungs with holes for an airlock and a small bung pin that can fit inside that hole. Otherwise you will need solid bungs as well. Best to buy extra! If you are using one gallon jugs, buy both #6 and #6 ½ because each just is a little different. If you use carboys, the manufacturer can tell you the bung size.\n8. When you are storing the mead, keep it out of sight and out of harm’s way. You don’t want it to be moved around or exposed to light.\n9. Your mead will likely take three to four weeks to ferment. You can tell when it’s done when the airlock burps only once per minute. Alternatively, you can pull a sample and check it with your hydrometer. Honey is totally fermentable so you can achieve a final gravity reading of 1.000 (I’ve gotten as low as 0.997).\n\nWhat’s a hydrometer (and what is gravity)? A hydrometer is a long glass tube that measures the density of sugar in a liquid and gives you a “gravity” reading when dropped into a cylinder. The ABV is calculated from the difference of the Final Gravity (FG) and Original Gravity (OG). Any reading is also considered a specific gravity (SG) and is recorded in points measured to thousands. What the heck does that all mean? Well, if you measure clean water without any sugar it should give a reading of 1.000, if you add a pound of honey to a gallon of water, you should have added somewhere around 35 points (or 35 thousandths) and get a reading of 1.035 (which would give you about 4.59% ABV)\n\nSo when can you drink it??? Literally whenever you want. But it’s not gonna taste good right away. Lots of things happen to the mead over time. Once fermentation is done, it should be moved to another container with a racking cane (a two part siphon that won’t transfer all the gunk at the bottom) and a vinyl hose to a sanitized container. It can sit there indefinitely. The higher the alcohol, the longer you should wait. At 10% the flavor will begin to mellow at three months and continue to improve for the next four years. Good luck. Once it goes into the second container you can stop the yeast completely with a sulfite addition. More on that later. I would let it sit in the second container for at least a month before bottling.\n\nBottling!\n\nOkay, you’ve made it this far, congratulations! I hope you don’t feel too bogged down with all this info. The good news is that it doesn’t get much more complex unless you want it to. So you want to bottle this stuff and share it with your fellow vikings?! \n\nBottling bucket:\n\nThis is the few places that I like to use plastic containers. Home brew stores sell bottling buckets that are great for this. If you buy one, don’t use it for anything else and always clean it before and after with a microfiber cloth to keep from scratching it. Transfer your mead in with a racking cane or siphon and let it rest at least half an hour before bottling.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, Swing tops are really the best option for small batches. I have a capper and a corker and I still use swing tops for batches under five gallons. \n\nI recommend buying a case of EZ Cap swing top bottles but there’s nothing wrong with collecting bottles from friends or buying beers and sodas that come in a swing top and reusing them. I’ve done both, both work, but EZ Cap bottles are thicker and will last longer. Yes glass gets chipped, sometimes they explode.\n\nJust like brewing equipment, bottles need to be washed well, scrubbed with a brush, and sanitized. I have a bottle tree for drying and it’s well worth the money. Alternatively you can use a sterilized dishwasher to dry sanitized bottles. Now that you’re a home brewer you will want to reuse bottles. TAKE MY ADVICE, rinse or wash bottles as soon as they’re empty. You don’t want to fill a bottle up just to find a clump of mold at the bottom that the scrubber missed. When I finish a bottle I give it 3 good rinses before I leave it on the counter. And I try to make sure it makes it into the washer that night.\n\nSo fill your bottles with pride knowing they are clean and free of contaminants! But don’t fill them to the brim! Leave half the neck for head-space. Also, if there is any sugar left in the mead, know that it will continue fermenting and become carbonated. I’ve had bottles explode. It’s a mess you don’t want to deal with. If you want to carbonate your mead we can talk about that but it’s not easy to do safely. I recommend getting the basics down first.\n\nTIP! I have found I can usually fill ten 12oz bottles per gallon (1 gallon = 128 oz)\n\nI know that was a lot to read, but hey, you did it!! Don’t stop your research here. Go brew a couple batches and continue learning while they ferment!\n\nNow I’ll leave you with my favorite recipe:\n\nKevin’s Spiced Mead (not an official name)\n\nIngredients\n\n* 1 lb Clover Honey\n* 1 lb Wildflower Honey\n* 1 Gallon clean water\n* 1 pack Côte Des blancs yeast\n* 1 lemons, squeezed and zested\n* 1 Tbsp coriander\n* 1 tsp peppercorn\n* 1 tsp whole cloves or ½ tsp ground cloves\n\nOptional\n\n* 6-8 oz any honey\n* 0.32 grams KMBS (Potassium metabisulfite) or ground up campden tablet\n\nSteps\n\n1. Start Yeast 30 minutes early!\n2. Boil 1 cup of water and remove from heat. Add coriander, peppercorns, cloves and steep for 3-5 minutes.\n3. Mix 1 lb of each honey, lemon, spices and water\n4. Aerate and add yeast\n5. Ferment to SG of 1.000\n6. Rack into a clean and sanitized secondary container\n7. Age for 2 months\n\nThe mead is dry but drinkable at this point but most meads can benefit from aging one to four years (sometimes more). Most people prefer a little sweetness in their mead but because all of the sugars in honey are completely fermentable, you can't just add sugar without the yeast starting back up. Adding more sugar after the fermentation is called \"back sweetening\" and can be tricky.  If you want to sweeten it up, there are a few ways to do it.\n\n1. Cold crashing\n2. Filtering\n3. Pasteurization\n4. Chemical additions\n\nCold crashing a mead is a process of bringing it to near freezing temperatures and allowing the yeast to fall out of suspension, then racking the mead off the yeast. This approach takes several iterations and is not fool proof as any yeast left behind can restart fermentation. Use this for meads that will be served very soon and not stored.\n\nFiltering is the use of 1-5 micro filter. This can be done in conjunction with cold crashing to effectively remove the yeast but will require time and some extra equipment.\n\nPasteurization is the process of killing the yeast by bringing the mead to 140 Fahrenheit and holding it there for at least 20 minutes. This can be done in a kettle or after the mead is boiled. There is some danger to boiling bottles as they can explode if there is already pressure in the bottle. Use great care with this method.\n\nChemical additions are the easiest and safest method in my opinion. Typically, potassium sorbate and potassium metabisulfite (KMBS) are the chemicals of choice for stopping bacterial growth in wine. You can use commercially available products like campden tablets or easily buy powdered chemicals. KMBS is the wine industry's standard but sodium metabisulfite can work just as well. Aim for a target of 1/2 tsp sorbate and 492 mg KMBS (75 ppm) per gallon to stop yeast dead. Your wine will need to sit for about 2 months to allow the chemicals to degrade so as to not be tasted. Extensive research has gone into the saftey of these chemicals and have been approved for use up to 350 ppm and are detectable by taste at 100 ppm.\n\nSteps to stop fermentation and backsweeten:\n\n1. Add sorbate, and KMBS or ground campden tablet to a clean and sanitized third container\n2. Add extra honey (there is some math and personal flavor involved here but I aim for a FG of 1.015 - 1.010 usually)\n3. Age for at least one month to mellow\n4. Bottle or serve\n\nHopefully your head isn't spinning with all this info and very dense ending. Please reach out if you have questions about my writing and keep learning about your craft.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck!\n\nSKÅL",

For my finicky skin, it's usually several things. So I was ***shocked*** when not only did everything from my recent AB haul work for me, but it all worked ***really*** well. So well that I wanted to share my excitement with all of you! I'm still mildly in disbelief right now, this never happens. \n\nCVS was having a BOGO 50% off sale so I decided to try a couple things that I’ve had my eye on. I thought these reviews might be helpful for those in this sub that aren’t very familiar with AB products. My routine is a mix of different types of brands (I do love my French pharmacy products) but I’ve had a lot more luck finding things that work for my skin type in the AB world. Some people get scared off at the idea of ordering things from overseas - either because of shipping cost or the length of shipping times. Since these are all products carried at CVS, they are a lot more accessible for those in the US. \n\n**Skin type:** Oily, dehydration-prone, sometimes sensitive (depends on its mood that day), with a very low tolerance for silicones. \n\n**Holika Holika Aloe Cleansing Foam -** I've had rough luck with foaming cleansers as they all seem to strip my skin (other than my HG LRP Toleraine but it's fun to switch it up sometimes). Not this guy! My skin loves anything aloe and this did not disappoint (aloe is the best humectant for oily skin imo). It has a very dense, thick foam that feels very nice on my skin. The scent is very fresh, it almost reminds me of fresh-cut watermelon and aloe mixed together. It leaves my skin very soft and not remotely stripped. No squeaky-clean feeling here! I'm not positive of the pH but it does contain potassium hydroxide (a pH adjuster) so I'm assuming it's in the normal range and not on the higher end. I think this is going to make a great AM cleanser since it's so gentle. \n\nIngredients: \nAloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Water, Lauryl Hydroxysultaine, Myristic Acid, Lauric Acid, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Chlorphenesin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Palmitic Acid, Capric Acid, Butylene Glycol, Betula Platyphylla Japonica Juice, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Potassium Sorbate.\n\n(*Ah-ha! I just saw the watermelon extract as I was adding this, so that explains the lovely scent.)\n\n**Peach Slices Citrus-Honey Aqua Glow Hydrating Moisture Gel -** Holy shit you guys, this is ***everything*** I've been looking for in a winter moisturizer. It's lightweight, a gel, has ceramides, is hydrating *and* moisturizing and doesn't make me oily. The search is over! Seriously, I've been trying to find the perfect moisturizer for about 8 months now. I thought I had the perfect one (Etude House Moistfull Collagen Water Jelly Cream) but turns out it was perfect *for summer*. Once winters cold, dry air came it just wasn't enough. I've desperately wanted to add ceramides to my routine with no luck (Rosette Ceramide Gel was a greasy disaster). The inclusion of ceramides is what originally caught my eye and also the lack of any -cones. My skin is sensitive to silicones and finding a heavier winter moisturizer without any has been virtually impossible. This does include a couple -anes so I was skeptical at first but they don’t seem to bother me as much as straight up dimethicone. Dimethicone + my skin = a greasy mess and lots of clogged pores (and fun little whiteheads all over). The first time I used it, I squeezed out too much but thought 'what the heck, I'll see what happens'. As I began to spread it around, I realized that it was *way* too much product and figured I was doomed for an oily face that night. Cut to a few minutes later, when I was shocked to find that it had ***all*** absorbed. It dries down quickly to a soft, almost-matte finish. It legit gives my skin a healthy glow without making it oily, something that I didn't think was possible. The first time I wore it to work, I was ***incredibly*** impressed by the fact that my skin was still matte at the end of the day. My work's super dry air usually drives my dehydrated skin nuts and by the end of the day, it's over-produced a ton of oil to compensate. But not with this!! It gives my skin the hydration it always needs with just enough moisture to seal it all in. I am absolutely over-the-moon in love with this product and I can't recommend it enough! \n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Polysorbate 60, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Honey Extract, Ceramide Np, Sorbitan Stearate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, 1, 2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Isohexadecane, Tromethamine, Hydroxyacetophenone, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Polysorbate 80, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitan Oleate, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Oil, Disodium EDTA, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Butylene Glycol, Bixa Orellana Seed Oil, Tocopherol.\n\n**The Saem Iceland Hydrating Soothing Gel -** The name pretty much says it all and it lives up to those claims. It's very hydrating, soothing and feels very refreshing. The fascinating thing about this product is how it dries down. It leaves an almost undetectable finish. I've never had anything disappear into my skin before - and I say that in the best way possible. It doesn't leave a tacky film the way most gels do. I use the Skinfood aloe gel daily (which does leave a bit of stickiness) and out of curiosity, I applied this on top of it. The combo dried down to almost nothing! It took away the stickiness all together. I am highly impressed with this gel! It is definitely a staple in my routine now and (*gasp*) may just replace my beloved Skinfood aloe (at least in the AM).\n\nIngredients: Water, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate 20, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Perfume, Sodium Acrylates Crosspolymer-2, Potassium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Disodium EDTA, Silica, Betaine, Heptane, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Propylene Glycol, Butylene glycol, Cetraria Islandica Extract, Sorbitol, Citric acid, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Prunus Mume Fruit Extract, Lactic acid.\n\n**Elisha Coy Refreshing Ampoule Solution Sheet Mask -** Another product that lives up to its name. I was nervous because these are on the cheaper side and usually the quality reflects that. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised! The mask itself fit very well. It's on the thinner side and it reminds me a lot of my fav sheet masks, the Etude House 0.2mm Air Therapy. It stayed in place and despite the essence being very watery, it didn't drip everywhere. The mask really seemed to hold onto the essence. After I took it off, I patted in the remaining essence from the pouch and it all absorbed completely. I was able to continue my routine with no issues. My skin was left hydrated, soothed and happy. \n\nIngredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Magnolia Kobus Bark Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Betula Alba Juice, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower Extract, Chrysanthellum Indicum Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Fragrance.\n\nI haven’t had the chance yet to try the rest of the sheet masks yet but I am very excited to do so!! If anyone has any questions, I’m happy to help! :)\n",

    "body": "Collie Bears\n\nIngredients:\n-3/4 cup water\n-1/4 cup corn syrup\n-1/4 cup sugar\n-3 tablespoons gelatin\n-1 tablespoon infused cannabutter *3,000-5,000mgs of thc*\n (coconut oil works as well but risks separating without an emulsion)\n-1/2 half pack of Jello\n-1 teaspoon Loranns Flavor oil\n-2 teaspoons citric acid\n-1 teaspoon potassium sorbate mixture\n-Gel food coloring\n\nYou will also need:\n-Candy thermometer\n-Silicone gummy molds\n-Candy dropper bottle\n-silicone spatula\n-parchment paper\n-Smallest thinnest non stick pot possible\n-packaging/bags\n\n\nThe first step is to bloom the gelatin. For this recipe I do 2 seperate blooms to maximize surface area of gelatin to water. In each of these I start by adding 1/4 cup of ice cold water. Then I spread about 1.5 tablespoon of unflavored gelatin over each dish. After that I spread 1/4 of a packet of flavored Jello on top. Finally I add 1 teaspoon of citric acid and 1/2 teaspoon of potassium sorbate to each dish. I then set this aside to begin the corn syrup mixture.\n\nWhile the gelatin is blooming begin your corn syrup mixture by adding 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup hot water, and 1/4 cup corn syrup to a very small pot. It is important that the pot is small enough for the candy thermometer to be submerged. Add the candy thermometer to the mixture and slowly bring the temperature up to high. You are shooting for “firm ball” (245ish degrees F). Once this temperature is reached, immediately pull the mixture from the heat. If the temperature goes beyond firm ball, start over. To keep the temperature from increasing I partially submerge the bottom of the pot in cold water. Taking the pot to an open freezer will have a similar but less effective effect.\n\nOnce the pot has been pulled from the heat and has not surpassed “firm ball”, I add my tablespoon of infused cannabutter. I allow the temperature to come down to around 200F before I add all of the bloomed gelatin and mix on low heat. Once everything is fully melted into a consistent liquid I add 1 teaspoon of Loranns extra strength flavor oil and mix thoroughly. At this point I use gel food coloring to create the color I want.\n\nOnce everything is mixed together thoroughly I use candy droppers to fill silicone molds of my choice. Once they are all full I place them into the fridge for about 1 hour to set. After they have set in the fridge I pull them from their molds and place the gummies onto parchment paper. I then place a piece of parchment paper over the top of the gummies to protect them from too much open air. They then need to set at room temperature for 24 hours. Once they are fully set, dry, and not sticky I put them into individual bags dosed at around 200-500mg per bag.\n\n*Notes*\n-The total amount of gelatin and corn syrup isn’t set in stone. Different combinations will result in different textures.\n-Don’t bother with a coating. It is a pain in the ass and melts your candy every time\n-To approximate thc mgs accurately I tend to use concentrates with set thc percentages in my cannabutter\n-When approximating thc mgs it is important to do an efficient infusion with your cannabutter\n-When allowing to set ensure the room is well ventilated and clean as possible\n-Gel food coloring beats standard food coloring everytime\n-The potassium sorbate mixture should keep these gummies mold free for up to 9 months, although I have only tested as far as 2 months at room temperature. \n-Do not add flavoring oil until the mixture has lowered in temperature below 200F or it will burn\n\n\nI hope this recipe helps anybody in any way to make a better and more enjoyable cannabis infused gummy. I have spent a lot of time and money refining my recipe with trial and error. This is the one that has worked best for me the most consistently. They feel and look as good as store bought gummies and in my opinion taste much better. If anybody has any questions please feel free to shoot me a DM.\n\n\nHappy confectioning!\nLove,\n    Colin",

    "body": "Basically, I've been on the hunt for affordable, daily wear sunscreens. In my dream world these would come in a big bottle, not these ant-sized 40 or 50ml bottles, but we can't have everything :(\n\nControversial I know, but I quite like alcohol in sunscreens for that quick drying effect and easy wear. All of the sunscreens I'm reviewing here are more indoorsy/low-exposure - I wear the Ambre Solaire Super UV Face Fluid for walks and light outdoors seeing as the UV index isn't super high nor is it very sunny at the moment. Neither are waterproof though so not suitable for long outdoors wear.\n\nAlso, because I'm a massive cheapskate I wear an ultra-cheap/failed sunscreen on my neck so these are for face only.\n\n**MY SKIN:** sensitive to fragrance, dry, acne-prone, kinda starting to get a Differin glow after 2 weeks on Differin so idk what's going on there, but it does make the sunscreens look a bit glowier than usual.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**GARNIER AMBRE SOLAIRE SUPER UV FACE FLUID**\n\n**Price + purchasing:** I bought this at Boots (drugstore in the UK) so obviously very convenient. It cost £8 for 40ml or £0.2 per use.\n\n**Packaging:** IMO the texture of this is a bit too fluid for the nozzle tip, so it has a tendency to run out too much if you're not careful. Also, why is this so small???\n\n**Ingredients:**  Aqua / Water, Alcohol Denat. Diisopropyl Sebacate, Silica, Isopropyl Myristate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Glycerin, C12-22 Alkyl Acrylate/Hydroxyethylacrylate Copolymer, Propanediol, Drometrizole Trisiloxane, Perlite, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Tocopherol, Hydroxyacetophenone Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Hyaluronate, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Phenoxyethanol, Triethanolamine, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Caprylyl Glycol, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Potassium Sorbate\n\n6 UV filters - octisalate, uvinul T150, tinosorb S, avobenzone, mexoryl XL, mexoryl SX\n\nSome tocopherol as an antixoxidant as well.\n\nThis is a dupe of the LRP Shaka Fluid/Invisible Fluid, which is waterproof and has a PPD of 46.6. If the filter concentrations are the same here, then we have 5% octinoxate, 4.5% uvinul T150, 4% tinosorb S, 3.5% avobenzone, 2% mexoryl XL, 0.495% mexoryl SX, total filter concentration 19.495%.\n\nThis isn't marketed as waterproof but the LRP version is, so idk? Maybe they just cheaped out and didn't want to do waterproof testing.\n\n**Feel + finish:** as you apply this it feels very liquid. Dries down quickly and easily (no surprise thanks to the alcohol), with no sticky residue on the skin. This is shinier than the Anti-Age but definitely still quite natural on my skin, more of a slightly glowy finish. No pilling, clumping or settling around the nose bridge of my glasses.\n\n**Overall thoughts:** this is pretty good I have to admit. I feel pretty secure in the protection of this when I'm out and about for shorter periods of time, but again I'm not sure I would wear this to the beach/outdoorsy holidays because it's not confirmed as water-resistant. The finish is so much better than I expected, but it isn't as good as the one below. **4.5/5**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**GARNIER AMBRE SOLAIRE SUPER UV ANTI-AGE FACE PROTECTION CREAM**\n\n**Price + purchasing:** I bought this at Boots (drugstore in the UK) so obviously very convenient. It cost £10 for 50ml or £0.2 per use.\n\n**Packaging:** a very sleek and convenient tube. Apparently it uses 49% less plastic than a conventional Garnier tube and it's got a very slim cap which is space-saving. Only 50ml though :(\n\n**Ingredients:**  Aqua / Water, C12-15alkyl Benzoate, Glycerin, Octocrylene, Niacinamide, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Dimethicone, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Silica, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Vinyldimethicone / Methicone Silsesquioxanecrosspolymer, Terephthalate Tricolicilicolylene Triphetylsilicolylene Stearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Tocopherol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Phenylethylresorcinol, Triethanolamine, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Poloxamer 338, Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, 2 Caprylic Acid\n\n3 UV filters - octocrylene, avobenzone, uvinul T150. This is a fragrance-free dupe of LRP Age-Correct SPF50, which has a PPD of 20. IMO this is plenty for indoorsy, everyday wear so I'm pretty happy with that.\n\nThis also has niacinamide and tocopherol + phenylethyl resorcinol as antioxidants.\n\n**Feel + finish:** this is a medium-weight cream which is definitely moisturising enough to wear without a moisturiser for me in summer, probably perfect for combo-oily skin all year round as well. No white cast and it absorbs very quickly and easily. It leaves a non-sticky, satin finish on my skin, which is very elegant and reminiscent of Purito (which I hated because that didn't absorb well at all, but even more elegant in terms of appearance - this is less glowy for me). No pilling or clumping around the nose bridge. Honestly such a pleasant experience from a fragrance and alcohol free Euro sunscreen - I was shocked.\n\n**Overall thoughts:** ok I'm in love with this as a daily sunscreen. So easy to wear, so pretty on the skin and non-drying! The only con is the small bottle, although it's accessible and I don't have to spend money on shipping which is a major plus. **4.9/5 (every-day HG)**\n\nIf you got to the end of this thanks for reading - please correct me on anything if I'm wrong!",

    "body": "Please welcome today's contestants:\n\n- Michele, a family law attorney, avoided Florida alligators but instead broke her elbow;\n- Jeff, a university administrator, has an \"inclusion\" license plate; and\n- Jon, a musician-screenwriter, approves of the Jeopardy! theme. Jon is a one-day champ with winnings of $37,201.\n\nJon found DD3 very late in DJ, but didn't wager quite enough on it to put the game away, leading into FJ with $22,400 vs. $11,400 for Michele and $8,400 for Jeff.\n\nDD1 - $400 - MOUNTAINS - This highest mountain in Japan is actually a volcano that last erupted in 1707 (On the last clue of round one, Michele won $1,000 from her score of $2,800 vs. $6,800 for Jon.)\n\nDD2 - $2,000 - ALTERNATE HISTORY NOVELS - In \"The Alteration\" by Kingsley Amis, this man became Pope Germanicus I in the 16th century so the Reformation never happened (Michele won $2,000 from her total of $8,600 vs. $12,000 for Jon.)\n\nDD3 - $1,200 - COMPOUNDS - Potassium Sorbate, which inhibits the growth of molds and yeasts, is mainly used in foods as this (With two other clues remaining, Jon won $2,000 from his score of $20,400 vs. $11,400 for Michele.)\n\nFJ - WORLD LEADERS ADDRESS CONGRESS - The 2 to address 3 joint sessions are Churchill & this leader, his non-European country’s longest-serving PM, in 1996, 2011 & 2015\n\nFor the second straight game only Jon was correct on FJ, adding $401 to win with $22,801 for a two-day total of $60,002.\n\nTriple Stumper of the day: No one knew the baseball groundbreaker who was Rookie of the Year in 1947 was Jackie Robinson.\n\nClue selection strategy: Musician Jon was confident enough in a category about guitars to open the game by going bottom-up. But like yesterday, late in DJ with DD3 on the board and two untouched categories, it was played top-down with no DD shopping to be found. \n\nOne more thing: In the opening, Mike mentioned that 150,000 people took the Jeopardy! online test last year, the implication being that no one should feel bad about not being lucky enough to get on the show.\n\nCorrect Qs: DD1 - What is Mt. Fuji? DD2 - Who was Martin Luther? DD3 - What is a preservative? FJ - Who is Netanyahu?",

I said Gaddafi--I remembered that he infamously addressed the UN during the Obama era, but it turns out that was in 2009--and then realized that was wrong because he died earlier than 2015. Without knowing the answer outright, it's a difficult clue because the years and \"longest-serving\" made me think that the PM in question served continuously for that entire time (which I knew Netanyahu did not), so I was thinking of dictator-for-life types instead.\n\nEdit: As has been pointed out, I just realized that I completely misread the clue/category.

It doesn’t take Einstein to figure out all the products from Avant are crap, even if this were $5 it would still be crap. There’s nothing wrong with the ingredients, its just the formulation and ingredients for the moisturizer isn’t worth more than $5, it has no high levels of any active ingredients/patented technology (almost all moisturizers at that price point has patents). If this were ingredients for a dollar store hand cream, then i would buy it, unfortunately it’s $134.  Avant products AREN’T EVEN WORTH the $12 Boxycharm add on/pop up price.\n\nLook at the ingredients for Acure Radically Rejuvenating Whipped Night Cream ($15.99 on iherb.com) \n\nWATER/AQUA/EAU, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CETEARYL OLIVATE, SORBITAN OLIVATE, SCLEROCARYA BIRREA (MARULA) SEED OIL, NYMPHAEA ALBA ROOT EXTRACT, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-1, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-2, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-1, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-9, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-11, COPPER PALMITOYL HEPTAPEPTIDE-14, HEPTAPEPTIDE-15 PALMITATE, PALMITOYL TETRAPEPTIDE-7, PALMITOYL TRIPEPTIDE-1 (PEPTIDE BLEND), FERULIC ACID, ASCORBIC GLUCOSIDE (VITAMIN C), COCONUT ALKANES, PSEUDOALTEROMONAS FERMENT EXTRACT (GLACIAL GLYCOPROTEINS), SALICYLIC ACID COCO-CAPRYLATE/CAPRATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ASPARTIC ACID, LINOLEIC ACID, LINOLENIC ACID, LECITHIN, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, LACTIC ACID/GLYCOLIC ACID COPOLYMER, CURCUMA LONGA (TURMERIC) ROOT EXTRACT, SYMPHYTUM OFFICINALE CALLUS CULTURE EXTRACT.\n\nBesides the fact that this has way more antioxidants/age prevention/hydrating ingredients.  This ingredients list for a $16 moisturizer might look familiar to some people because it’s like 95% the same as a certain Drunk Elephant Moisturizer(it’s just missing a few amino acids at the end of the ingredients list but all the important ingredients are exactly the same, even the peptides are the same).  Looks a thousand times better than all the crappy $130 Avant Moisturizers, and this is just one example, there’s CeraVe, Elf, tons of Korean brand moisturizers, all around or under $20. \n\nDECIEM’s hand cream $16 for 100ML\nAqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Propanediol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Copper Lysinate/Prolinate, Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Methylglucoside Phosphate, Proline, Alanine, Serine, Pseudoalteromonas Ferment Extract, Tremella Fuciformis Sporocarp Extract, Tocopherol, Betaine, Cellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Sodium Phosphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Parfum (Fragrance), Limonene, Linalool.\n\nThere’s copper peptide (the next big thing in anti aging), snow mushrooms, amino acids, algae ferment, and Plantago Lanceolata which can reduce dark spots, all this from a hand cream, people were using this as a facial moisturizer cos it’s that good. \n\nMoisturizers which are around $134\n\n- Guerlain’s Abeille Royale Creams (has patent on formulas and also the frigging jar the moisturizer comes in) \n\n* Sisley Black Rose Cream Mask (really this needs no introduction) \n\n* Charlotte Tilbury’s Night Cream\n\n* Dior Capture Totale Firming and Wrinkle Correcting Cream (Again patented formula, with a lot of research and clinical trials)\n\n* Lancer Skincare the Nourish (Dr. Lancer dermatologists for Hollywood Stars) \n\n* Fresh Creme Ancienne Moisturizer (Literally made by hand in a Monastery in Europe) \n\n* Chanel Le Lift Restorative Cream (clinical and in vitro testing, patented formula) \n\n* Caudalie Premium Cru Rich/Normal Cream (again patented formula, developed with Harvard Medical School) \n\n* If you check out CultBeauty the Eve Lom holiday set (the one with the Moisture Cream and cleanser (all full size) are basically the same RV as the stupid Avant moisturizer. \n\nThe list can go on forever, also Anti pollution micellar water from Chanel only costs $45. If you take a look at the ingredients for Avant’s Micellar Water it’s missing a very crucial ingredient that the majority of “high end/effective” micellar water contain, PEG-6 Caprylic/ Capric Glycerides.  Seriously this is not even worth $1. \nLastly someone from this subreddit did some research on this company, I think she concluded it was being used to launder money. But the fact that they’re selling you crap for $100+ is enough proof for me.\n\nNow the 111skin products we get from boxycharm or Ipsy are NOT the same as the ones sold in retail stores or 111skin’s online site.  The hydra gel moisturizer that came from Ipsy for example has a completely different ingredients list from the “real” moisturizer.\n\nIngredients from 111skin Cryo Activating Hydra Gel Ipsy version: \nAloe Barbadensis Gel, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Butylene Glycol, Isohexadecane, Dipropylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond / Amande Douce) Oil, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Betaine, Lecithin, Pyrus Malus (Apple / Pomme) Fruit Water, Allantoin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Hydroxyacetophenone, Trehalose, Propanediol, Glyceryl Caprylate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Aluminium Dicetyl Phosphate, BHT, Tetrasodium EDTA, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol, Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow / Achillée) Extract, Xanthan Gum, Menthol, Menthyl Lactate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Fragrance / Parfum, Limonene, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Linalool.\n\nIngredients from 111skin’s site for the Hydra Gel:\nAQUA / WATER / EAU, NELUMBO NUCIFERA (LOTUS) ROOT WATER, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, GLYCERIN, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND / AMANDE DOUCE) OIL, SODIUM ACRYLATES COPOLYMER, CARBOMER, TETRAHEXYLDECYL ASCORBATE, ETHYLHEXYL PALMITATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, BETAINE, LECITHIN, PROPANEDIOL, BENZYL ALCOHOL, HORDEUM VULGARE (BARLEY / ORGE) SEED EXTRACT, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PRUNUS PERSICA (PEACH / PÊCHE) JUICE, PYRUS MALUS (APPLE / POMME) JUICE, TRITICUM VULGARE (WHEAT / BLÉ) SEED EXTRACT, DISODIUM EDTA, PANAX GINSENG ROOT EXTRACT, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, TRIHYDROXYSTEARIN, ACHILLEA MILLEFOLIUM (YARROW / ACHILÉE) EXTRACT, SODIUM HYALURONATE, MENTHOL, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, ALOE VERA LEAF EXTRACT, GLYCERYL UNDECYLENATE, MENTHYL LACTATE, XANTHAN GUM, GLUCOMANNAN, FRAGRANCE / PARFUM, BENZYL SALICYLATE, LIMONENE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL.\n\nSee the difference? The Ipsy one although it advertises that it’s made with lotus water, there’s no lotus anything in the ingredients. It’s full of texture enhancers and solvents, IMO they were mainly trying to copy the “gel texture” of the real moisturizer.  The real moisturizer that’s $200 isn’t that much better. No expensive ingredients or actives....Check out the Rovectin Lotus Water Cream, made from 75% lotus flower extract (I’m assuming extracts holds a lot more nutrients than lotus root water), and it’s $20 but it goes on sale for $10, has similar light texture etc etc.  Usually the “made for beauty boxes 111skin products” will have “Made in China for 111skin” on the packaging. The real products use to be made in Bulgaria and now I think it’s made in UK, and some are made in the US.  Even if the ingredients line up like the 111skin vitamin c serum from Ipsy and the old formula of the vitamin c from 111skin’s site, the texture, colour, smell are completely different.  The real one had a serum like texture, transparent, had some kind of smell (I forgot the smell, I compared the products like a year ago).  The Ipsy version has the texture of water, yellow tint, no smell I think. Even the real products from 111skin are total ripoffs...what the hell does that say about the “fake” ones? \n\nTL:DR - both Avant and 111skin products are crap, 111skin sends out fakes to beauty boxes but even the real products are crap.  Avant is a sketchy company and their products aren’t even worth the $12 add on price.  It doesn’t matter if Avant’s website looks legitimate, every MLM website looks a thousand times more legitimate than Avant but it’s still a scam.",

On their Instagram they even have a FAQ where someone asks who the CEO/Founder is, and they say that \"They don't focus on the CEO/Founder but the brand only\"\n\nNot to mention their website copy is absolute garbage and super vague, and though they say they're back by science it seriously just seems like they are using science-washing terms. \n\nCame on reddit and saw this post that validated everything I was feeling.",

With my last tattoo, I used Lush’s elbow grease while it healed and used dream cream (pricey stuff I think) after a week. That tattoo healed beautifully imo. People say you’re not supposed to use heavily fragranced products on tattoos until after it’s totally healed. I checked with my artist at the time and she okayed the products for me.",

It’s incredibly lightweight and doesn’t live shiny finish, it’s semi-matte. It has a light creamy gel texture. It is very easy to reapply. It contains fragrance, but it’s very subtle and goes away quickly. It never makes me look like a greasy mess, there i salso no pilling under makeup! Most importantly, it never irritates my skin. There was no irritation, I noticed that it actually calms down the redness and helps with healing my acne scars.\n\nI can confidently say that it quickly become my HG sunscreen!",

As of right now base on the price of $24, I’m incline to believe the 111SKIN Meso Infusion Leave On Overnight Mask shown on the picture would be a “real” 111SKIN item, made in the same factory in UK as the other 111SKIN items that gets sent to Saks, SpaceNK, CultBeauty, their actual website.  So yay no fake “made in China for 111SKIN” crap, where the ingredients for the same 2 products are miles apart and completely different (see my post on Avant and 111skin, if you’re interested). \n\nSo is the real 111SKIN made in UK Meso Infusion Leave On Overnight Mask that has a RV of $200 worth it? Let’s have a look.  \n\nFor people who aren’t skincare nerds, a moisturizer/night mask (basically the same, especially this one since it tells you to apply on dry skin, I’m guessing 111SKIN wants you to use this instead of a moisturizer at night) should always contain these 3 different types of ingredients, occlusives, humectants, and emollients. (For more detailed info on these types of ingredients, read the long explanation at the end).  \n\nFor now I’ll get to the short definitions\n\n- Occlusives are ingredients that form a seal around the skin and traps water in order to prevent transepidermal water loss.  Having hydrated skin is very important in age prevention.  Depending on the occlusive ingredient, it can also prevent irritants, pollution, dirt, etc from. coming in contact with the skin.  Common occlusive ingredients: sunflower seed oil, silicones, squalane, beeswax and carnauba wax, Shea, cocoa, mango butters, mineral oil (nothing wrong with mineral oil I go further into details about this later on), lanolin. \n\n- Humectants are “compounds that attract and bind water. They can help hydrate the skin by drawing water from the deeper epidermis and dermis (layers of your skin) or from the air if the humidity is greater than 75%.” (Definition taken from National Centre for Biotechnology Information).  Common humectants used in moisturizers: glycerin, hyaluronic acid (and its many forms such as sodium hyaluronate, sodium acetylated hyaluronate, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid etc), amino acids, hexylene glycol, butylene glycol, pentylene glycol, aloe vera.  \n\n- Finally we have emollient type ingredients, they are used in moisturizers to soften and smooth the skin, also it acts as a lubricating agent, if you have cracked and flaky skin emollients can help fill the the open spaces with fatty acids (lipids) and prevent water loss.  Now many occlusive ingredients are also going to be emollient ingredients as well (like beeswax and carnauba wax) common emollient ingredients used, borage seed oil, Shea butter, almond oil, avocado oil, caprylic/capric, triglyceride, cetyl alcohol, cholesterol. \n\nSo now we’ve listed the 3 types of ingredients that make up moisturizers (obviously other types of ingredients like antioxidants, texture enhancer, preservatives etc are also in moisturizers but these 3 are the building blocks/foundation of any moisturizer).  \n\nIngredients of the 111SKIN Meso Infusion Leave On Overnight Mask (ingredients list taken from 111skin.com):\n\nAQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN (a very good start, glycerin is one of the best humectants, and it’s the 2nd ingredient which probably means they are going for the gel like texture for this product), PANTHENOL (Vitamin B5, like glycerin it’s a great humectant.  Draws water from the air and from the deeper layers of the skin to the top layer so that it can plump out the skin thus wrinkles and fine lines look less visible and skin feels smoother.  Its also an excellent soothing ingredient, helping reduce inflammation, redness, irritation.  It helps to repair and strengthen the skin’s protective barrier and its a great antioxidant.), XANTHAN GUM (and here’s where the good for skin ingredients end, xanthan gum excellent thickening agent and texture enhancer It’ll make formulas that’s too watery more gel like.  However the typical concentration of xanthan gum in products are between 0.1% to 0.5%, now this being the 4th ingredient means again 111SKIN wants a gel texture for this overnight mask, cos this is most likely 2 or 1%.  Xanthan gum is perfectly safe and natural it’s just a chain of sugar molecules), ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER (another ingredient used to thicken products/viscosity control.  Now the presence of xanthan gum in high concentrations, and now this ingredient makes me think the Meso Overnight Mask is mostly made of water hence why there’s all these thickening agents, even glycerin has a syrup like texture, so not watery), SODIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE (a vitamin c derivative that’s very stable and is used in Olehenriksen’s Truth Serum, it’s an antioxidant and an active ingredient that should be the 2nd or 3rd on the list, as the 6th ingredient I’m guessing the concentration is below 1%, what is the point of having below 1% vitamin c derivative especially since they are less effective than vitamin c (Ascorbic acid) plus I don’t see any other powerful antioxidants in this product, yes there’s panthenol but that doesn’t require vitamin c derivative to boost its effectiveness, unlike having vitamin e will increase the effectiveness of vitamin c), NATTO GUM (created through the fermentation of a proprietary strain of bacteria (the safe kinds), not enough research on this one, may become a potent antioxidant), PHENOXYETHANOL (preservatives), SODIUM POLYSTYRENE SULFONATE(another bloody ingredient that’s used to make something more viscous in texture, so basically it thickens the formula to form a gel, okay we get it 111SKIN you like gel textures), SODIUM HYALURONATE (wow a humectant, salt form of hyaluronic acid), PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL (an emulsifier that’s amber/yellowish in colour (and that’s the colour of the Meso Overnight Mask) its used to solubilized fragrances into water based formulas, it really seems like there’s a lot of water in this product), SORGHUM BICOLOR STALK JUICE (not much information on this one besides skin conditioning agent, soften and hydrates, maybe? But some sites will tell you that it’ll tighten skin and creates a immediate lifting effect.  Again until I find a study or a ton of anecdotal evidence, I’ll call bs on the tightening and lifting claims for now), ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN (preservative), SODIUM HYDROXIDE (a very alkaline pH adjuster), SODIUM BENZOATE (preservative against fungi, not strong enough to work by itself so it’s usually combined with the next ingredient, works best at acidic pH of 3-5, our skin’s natural pH levels are usually between 5.5 to 6.5), POTASSIUM SORBATE (preservative thats not strong and often is paired with the previous ingredient) PENTYLENE GLYCOL (a humectant, also makes product feel nice on the skin), HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) LEAF EXTRACT (antioxidant, antibacterial, not sure why it’s at the end of the ingredients list in such low concentrations), CAPRYLYL GLYCOL (it’s a humectant, but it’s mainly used cos of its ability to boost the effectiveness of other preservatives mainly phenoxyethanol, there are sure a lot of preservatives on this ingredient list), PARFUM / FRAGRANCE.\n\nSo here’s the breakdown of the $200 111SKIN Meso Infusion Leave On Overnight Mask. NO OCCLUSIVES, NO EMOLLIENTS, the best ingredient is the panthenol, but without any occlusive/emollients ingredients everything will evaporate right off the skin that also will take moisture from your own skin too!  After analyzing the ingredients list of this lovely $200 product I’m incline to believe it’s basically water.  I like the panthenol but La Roche Pasay Cicaplast Balm B5 is so better, and it also has a gel version, it’s also $15. \n\nSeriously wtf is 111SKIN thinking? I can’t even consider this as a moisturizer or serum or overnight mask or toner, I don’t know what kind of product this is....cos from looking at the ingredients it’s just water with panthenol and a lot of THICKENING AGENTS to get that gel texture.  \n\nBelow are more information on occlusives, humectants and emollients if you’re interested feel free to have a look: \n\nOcclusives are ingredients that form a physical barrier around your face so that all the moisture from serums and moisturizer won’t evaporate off the skin making it drier, you’ll often hear dermatologists refer to this as transepidermal water loss (TEWL), for obvious reasons having a hydrated skin will contribute greatly to age prevention.  They also act as a shield protecting the skin from physical irritates, pollution, etc, think of occlusive ingredients as a saran wrap for your face or body, except it only traps the water and keep out irritates especially for people who have compromised skin barriers.  Some examples of widely used occlusives are: \n\n- Shea butter, cocoa butter, mango butter \n\n- Petroleum jelly and by default mineral oil since it’s derived from petroleum, for reasons unknown the Clean Beauty Movement has demonized Vaseline (and mineral oil) and it’s been made out to be this monster that’ll take your first born and use it as a sacrifice, but it’s still one of the best occlusive ingredients we have, quote from one study on moisturizers “Petrolatum in a minimum concentration of 5% reduces TEWL by more than 98% followed by lanolin, mineral oil, and silicones which only reduce TEWL by 20–30%.”obviously it’s less cosmetically elegant (it’s grease) but perfectly safe to use the molecules are too big to get into the skin that’s why it makes such a good barrier ESPECIALLY for people who suffer from compromised skin barrier issues (eczema, psoriasis etc) and when you’ve messed up your skin barrier with too much retinol and exfoliating acids.  The new trend in Korea is I think called “slipping”? Where people put on a layer of Vaseline before bed to stop TEWL.  As for people with oily skin maybe stay away from this one. \n\n- Squalane, soy, sunflower oil, lecithin\n\n- Cholesterol and ceramides (two important skin lipids that can be found in the famous Skinceuticals moisturizer 2:4:2 (the first 2 are two different ceramides, 4 is 4% cholesterol, and the last 2 are fatty acids, it looks like they used sunflower seed oil)\n\n- Beeswax, candelilla wax, carnauba wax\n\n- Lanolin, silicones \n\nSorry for rambling, next important class of ingredients are humectants, “compounds that attract and bind water. They can help hydrate the skin by drawing water from the deeper epidermis and dermis (layers of your skin) or from the air if the humidity is greater than 75%.” (Definition taken from National Centre for Biotechnology Information). Common humectants used are:\n\n- Glycerin \n\n- Propylene glycol (again the Clean Beauty Industry has labelled this one as antifreeze and brake fluid....long story short, it’s not and safe to use), hexylene glycol, butylene glycol.\n\n- Hyaluronic acid and it’s many forms, like sodium hyaluronate, sodium acetylated hyaluronate etc \n\n- Lactic acid, PHA (the acids that’s in Glow Recipe’s toner, or Olehenriksen’s Phat Mask) it’s a very gentle exfoliating acid and they also retain moisture. \n\n- Urea, amino acids \n\n- Aloe Vera \n\nFinally we get to last category of ingredients, emollient ingredients are used in moisturizer to make your skin soft and smooth like a new born baby (I wish it were that easy). They are usually lipids (fatty acids, which are super important to a healthy skin barrier) and oils,  a lot of occlusives are also emollients.  Common emollients found in moisturizers (some are also occlusives) \n\n- Lanolin \n\n- beeswax \n\n- Shea butter \n\n- Jojoba oil \n\n- Castor oil \n\n- Moringa seed oil \n\n- Linoleic acid\n\nTL:DR : even if the 111SKIN Overnight Mask in the pop up spoiler is real as in made in UK with all the other real products that’s going to be sold in Saks, CultBeauty, SpaceNK etc, it’s still junk, beyond junk, it’s basically water, and then a lot of ingredients to make the water into a gel, the ONLY beneficial ingredients are panthenol (vitamin B5), glycerin, and hyaluronic acid....seriously that’s it, all those ingredients are available in the Ordinary’s Hyaluronic Acid Serum.",

From what I understand, if the specific gravity stayed the same, then this should be stable and it shouldn't be necessary to add the potassium sorbate with your campden tablet, unless you did some back sweetening. Did you back sweeten any or did you just want to incorporate potassium sorbate just to be sure that the mead was stabilized?\n\nThanks for sharing your recipe! 🙂",

I got it for free from Myntra App along with their Vitamin C Serum.\n\n**Ingredients:** Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Octocrylene, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Diisopropyl Adipate, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Isododecane, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Silica, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Squalane, Solanum Lycopersicum (Tomato) Fruit Extract, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Microcrystalline Wax, Tocopheryl Acetate, Silica Silylate, Quaternium-90 Sepiolite, Quaternium-90 Montmorillonite, BHT\n\n**Packaging:** Tube \n\n**Texture:** White P\nOpaque Gel\n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\n**My Experience:** I didn't use this regularly, it was mostly kept in my office bag for applying during evenings while leaving work. \n\nAs the name suggests, there was never an issue of white cast due to its texture and colour. With invisible sunscreen, you gotta know till when you to massage the sunscreen. I feel with other sunscreens, you've an idea on how long to blend or massage. With invisible sunscreen, if not applied properly, it starts pilling off.\n\nThe texture was matte, so probably it felt on my face for a while post application. My biggest issue with this was that it irritated my eyes if I accidentally brushed over anywhere near my eye area (I didn't directly touch my eyes). And seeing as it happened multiple times, I think i was turned off this product, wanting to never purchase it.\n\nWhich won't be an issue coz I don't see this product anywhere. It's probably discontinued.\n\n**(2)Cosiq Airgel Nmf-15% Moisturiser For Oily Skin**\n\n**Price:** Rs. 599/- for 100 ml\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Aloe Vera Leaf Extract, Bacillus/Carrot Root Ferment Filtrate, Glycerine, Sorbitol, Propanediol, Hyaluronic Acid, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Sodium Lactate, Sodium Gluconate, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Betaine, Sodium Carbomer, Allantoin, Betaine, Sodium PCA, Sodium Lactate, Pca, Serine, Alanine, Glycine, Glutamic Acid, Lysine Hcl, Threonine, Arginine, Proline, Water, Saccharide Isomerate, Sodium PCA, Vitamin E, Sodium Gluconate, Menthyl Lactate, Menthol\n\n**Packaging:** Airpump in a Tube\n\n**Texture:** Lightweight Airy gel.\n\n**My Experience:** I was influenced to buy this from this Oily Moisturizer guide of one of the IG influencers. \n\nPros - Very affordable and comes in good quantity. It's a steal for its price. Very lightweight, blends easily , gives a matte finish but doesn't feel that it's sitting on your skin (like many matte products). \n\nIf your skin type is combination leaning to dry side, this won't be sufficient for you. As it states, it's great for oily skin as it feels nothing when you apply, and works wonderfully for Summers. \n\nCons: Tbh, None. It's not as great as some other moisturizers that I've used, but for the price, it's a great product.\n\nI might repurchase it again unless I get some k-beauty products on good discount.\n\n**3)Vaseline Gluta Hya Antioxidant SPF 50 PA+++ Sunscreen**\n\n**Price:** 699/- for 175ml\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Disodium Phenyl Dibenzimidazole Tetrasulfonate, Triethanolamine, Dimethicone, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Hydroxide, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Cystine, Glycine, Sodium PCA, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glutathione, Cyclopentasiloxane, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Polysorbate 20, Perfume, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Cyclomethicone, Petrolatum, BHT, Tocopherol\n\n**Texture:** Serum like lotion\n\n**Fragrance:** Yes\n\n**My Experience:** It's a wonderful sunscreen at a very decent price. \n\nPros are that it's  very lightweight, has a serum like texture that blends in seconds. It's claim of serum bursting into water and absorbing quickly, is true. It always gives a very dewy and shiny finish.\n\nCons - Very sticky, though it does feels normal after a few minutes. \nIt doesn't prevent tanning. My hands are quite tanned, and since its texture is like a serum, I did use quite a lot of product while applying it on my hands. There was no pilling, but no saving from tan.\n\nI would repurchase it for other seasons like winters or monsoons. For now, I've purchased Nivea sunscreen again, my HG for body sunscreen.\n\nDo share your experiences if you've tried these or similar products.\n\n",

The taste is really nice. The apple comes through with a strong (but not overwhelming) winey and cinnamon taste, with a little bit of vanilla in the background. The aroma is similar but it has more vanilla notes. I think the back sweetening is just good, at least for my taste, it's enough to make the wine less dry with a very little sweetness. I also surprised how clear it became, and I'm not sure, but I think the brown sugar gave this beautiful darker color. \n\n\n(not sure if the conversions are accurate. :D)",

    "body": "Ingredients:\n\n1. Three boxes of preferred jello flavor\n2. Two packets or 14 grams of unflavored gelatin \n3. 150mls of water or juice\n4. 100mls of preferred cooking oil (I use coconut oil)\n5. A literal PINCH of Potassium Sorbate \n\nOptional ingredients but highly recommended:\n6. Two LorAnn flavorings for extra flavor punch!\n7. Spoonful of Marshmallow Fluff \n\nThe reason my recipe is the greatest is because it allows you to make shelf stable gummies in a day or less without worrying about them melting or sweating later. The other tutorials I've seen so far are great but lack longevity when it comes to storage and gave me problems when I tired to sugar coat them so I took all those recipes and turned em into one simple process to create the GREATEST GUMMIES EVER! \n\nMy tutorial provides you with instructions to create gummies that not only resemble store bought gummies in texture and shelf stability but also gives you the freedom to custom make any flavors you want!!! \nPlease feel free to share this recipe with all your friends and family!!!💚\n\nRecipe Instructions:\nThis recipe creates about 400-420mls of melted gummy mix. So use the proper mould sizes or buy extra moulds in case you run out of space when pouring or injecting. \n*Start to finish takes around 7-8 hours* *Cook time is around 1 hour*\n\nStep 1. Take the 150mls of juice or water and pour 100mls of it into a double boiler setup with the stove set on low. You add in the PINCH of Potassium Sorbate now, it'll melt in by itself like magic!\n\nStep 2. Take the remaining 50mls and put it into a small bowl and dump in the 2 packets or 14 grams unflavored gelatin and mix it well with a fork. If you're using the lorAnns flavorings you need to add them into the 50mls of water or juice before you add the gelatin. Make sure you get all the dry gelatin bits mixed and soaked. You'll notice it clumps together after you have mixed it for a little while. Clump it all together to one side of your bowl for easy removal later. Let this sit for at least 5 minutes to bloom properly.  \n\nStep 3. Dump in all 3 boxes of your favorite jello mix into the now heated 100mls of water or juice in your double boiler setup. Let this cook for 45 minutes, you can probably do it less but I like to ensure all the jello is melted.\n\nStep 4. At the end of the 45 minutes you can add in your bloomed gelatin that we set to the side, it should come out all together in one piece. Just let it melt down and then mix it all in really well.\nFun fact: gelatin smells like straight donkey ass if you don't add flavorings. \n\nStep 5. Now the optional Marshmallow Fluff. You can do as big or small of a spoonful as you want! Doesn't really matter unless you don't want Cream Saver style gummies and if that's the case just skip this step. Make sure you mix it in really well. If you're noticing it's not all one color then you need to mix more until it's all one unison color. \n\nStep 6. Now that you have combined the flavored jello and unflavored gelatin you can add in your choice of cooking oil. Now this step was specifically adapted to my previous recipe to make medicated gummies and when I tried making it without the oil I noticed the gummies didn't feel as smooth as they normally do so that's why I'm using oil in this recipe, you can use any type but I've found coconut oil to work the best!\n\nStep 7. Get it all mixed together really well!!! At first the oil will be reluctant to mix but once the temperatures of both liquids reach equilibrium it will start to mix in. Just keep mixing until you see it stop separating.\n\nStep 8. Your gummy mix is now ready to pour or inject!!! I inject with a turkey injector. It holds 50mls at a time and allows me to precisely fill the cavities without making too much of a mess. \n\nStep 9. Once you've gotten all the gummy mix poured or injected you need to let them sit in the moulds at ROOM TEMPERATURE for at least 3 hours. After the initial 3 hours are up you can pop them out the moulds and set them out on some parchment paper to finish drying out. They need to dry for another 3 hours once they come out the moulds before they are ready for your friends and family.\n\nStep 10. If you want to coat them in sugar you need to do it right after they come out the moulds so as soon as they've sat in the moulds for 3 hours and you pop them out, you should immediately start coating them in sugar, once they're coated they need to sit out for another 3 hours to form a nice shell on the outside. After this last step you are good to go and can enjoy the fruits of your labor!!! 🙏🏼\n\nNow in my picture you probably noticed it's not a normal sugar coating and you're partly right! It is still sugar but it's colored sugar!!! I recently came across this in my gummy adventures and realized they take my gummies to a whole new aesthetic level so I couldn't resist!!! If you want your gummies to really pop you should match the color of the gummy to the color of the sugar and that will create an almost neon colored gummy that will literally look like little shiny crystalized bears. I appreciate everyone that takes the time to read and check out my recipe and I hope it helps you in your journey! 💚💚💚\n\n🦍🫱🏻‍🫲🏿💪",

    "body": "*See Part I of this project [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYBeauty/comments/7renp7/acid_toner_biologique_recherche_lotion_p50_dupe/)*\n\nAfter more or less figuring out the Lotion P50 formula — see my final breakdown of it in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/DIYBeauty/comments/7renp7/acid_toner_biologique_recherche_lotion_p50_dupe/dszhoo4/) — I drafted a recipe and assembled  the ingredients. Last week, I set about making a version of my own. Here's how I did it.\n\nVirtually all the active ingredients — including the acids that do the heavy lifting: gluconolactone, lactic acid, and salicylic acid — are the same, and present in the same concentrations, in my version as in P50. So are all of the solvents and the stabilizers/thickeners. I did substitute a few ingredients due to supplier availability and my own personal preferences, but whenever I made substitutions I tried to replace like with like. \n\nMore information about the differences between my dupe and the original product formula, plus the recipe and technique I used to make my version, is below. \n\nTable of Contents, because this post is long:\n\n**1. Changes I made from Lotion P50 to my draft recipe**\n\n* **1.1. What's the same between my version and P50**\n* **1.2. What I substituted**\n* **1.3. What I left out**\n* **1.4 Full ingredients list for Lotion P50 and full ingredients list for my dupe**\n\n**2. Full recipe**\n\n**3. Instructions**\n\n**4. My notes and feedback about this version** \n\n* **4.1. Things I love** \n* **4.2. Things I don't love**\n* **4.3. A note on pH**\n* **4.4. About ingredients and sourcing** \n* **4.5. Possible changes and optimizations** \n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\n***********\n\n**1. Changes I made from Lotion P50 to my draft recipe**\n\n**1.1. What's the same between my version and P50:**\n\n* All the same solvents used in P50 are used in my version. They are all used in (my guesstimates of) the same concentrations. These are: **Water, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, and Ethoxydiglycol**. \n* The same AHAs, PHA, and BHA are used in the same concentrations: **Gluconolactone (PHA), Lactic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, and Apple Cider Vinegar (AHAs), and Salicylic Acid (BHA)**. \n* The same ingredients with chelating activity: **Citric Acid and Gluconolactone**. \n* The same thickeners/stabilizers: **Sorbitol and Magnesium Chloride**. \n* The same anti-inflammatory, skin-brightener, moisture-barrier-repairer, and all-around great, skin-friendly ingredient: **Niacinamide**.\n\n**1.2. What I substituted:**\n\n* I used a different preservative. P50 is preserved with Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, and Potassium Sorbate, which together (at least according to my Googling) make up a preservative called **KEM NK** made by the company Akema Chemical. Although Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, and Potassium Sorbate are sold individually at Lotion Crafter, I chose to use the preservative **Euxyl PE 9010**. Euxyl PE contains Phenoxyethanol and Ethylhexylglycerin, and it's a broad-spectrum preservative effective in products of pH 0-12. I chose it over Liquid Germall Plus because of its effectiveness at low pH; LG+ is recommended only in products over pH 3. My target pH was exactly 3, so while LG+ should technically cut it, I didn't want to be that close to its lower limit. Euxyl PE can be used at up to 1.1%; I used it at an even 1%.\n* The botanical extracts in P50 are a real grab-bag: **Cochlearia Armoracia (Horseradish) Root Extract, Arctium Lappa Root (Burdock Root) Extract, Rumex Acetosa (Sorrel) Leaf Extract, Myrtus Communis (Myrtle) Extract, Commiphora Myrrha (Myrrh) Resin Extract, and Allium Cepa (Onion) Bulb Extract**. There is also **Thymus Vulgaris (Thyme) Leaf/Flower Oil**, an essential oil. All of these are used in P50 at far less than 1%, and I guesstimated the total concentration of all botanical extracts at roughly 2.5%. Most of these extracts are fairly esoteric and I could not find them at my usual suppliers. In addition, many of these substances have only modest scientific literature behind them, if any. I substituted water-soluble **chamomile, calendula, and centella extracts** for the original botanical extracts in P50. I chose those three extracts because I like and use them regularly, and they all have anti-inflammatory, skin-soothing effects. In an AHA-heavy product like this toner, I wanted to do as much as possible to mitigate the potential inflammation of the acids. Also, it's my preference when formulating to go for just a couple extracts and use them at a decent percentage, rather than a droplet each of nine or ten different things. I used my three picks at 0.75% each for a total of 2.25% extracts in the formula. \n* I substituted **myrrh essential oil** for **myrrh extract**. I used it at 0.25%, to bring the total amount of extracts and oils to 2.5%. I figured since thyme essential oil, which I planned to omit, was in the original formula, that the solvents present should be sufficient to solubilize a small amount of oil. I also couldn't obtain myrrh resin extract, but I happened to have on hand myrrh essential oil, which is distilled from myrrh resin. I wasn't sure if they were truly equivalent, but I decided to use this token amount of myrrh oil basically as an experiment.\n\n**1.3. What I left out:**\n\n* As mentioned previously, I omitted **thyme essential oil**. \n* I also omitted **sulfur**. I had trouble sourcing sulfur and I figured such a tiny amount of it wouldn't make any difference in the final product, except possibly to make it smell. \n* I omitted **Phytic Acid.** I could not find a source for it anywhere (other than AliBaba, that is, where it's for sale by the barrel). Phytic Acid is a skin brightener, anti-inflammatory, and chelating agent. Despite its common name, it's not an \"acid\" in the same way that Lactic Acid, Glycolic Acid, and Salicylic Acid, etc, are acids — i.e., it's not an AHA or a BHA. It does not exfoliate. At first, I wasn't sure what Phytic Acid was doing in Lotion P50. Is it there to be a chelating agent? Maybe, but there are already other chelating ingredients present. As a tyrosinase inhibitor, could it be used for its skin-brightening potential? Perhaps, but the well-known brightening ingredient Niacinamide is already present. \n\nA book titled *Textbook of Chemical Peels, Second Edition* by Dr. Philippe Deprez (CRC Press, 2016) may have provided the answer. This passage gave me the key insight that Phytic Acid can be useful in a high-AHA product because it's an antioxidant that can scavenge free radicals before they damage skin:\n\n>Phytic acid is not an AHA but is a large molecule of inositol hexaphosphoric acid that is considered an excellent antioxidant and an antityrosinase. It binds out iron. Phytic acid cannot produce a peeling effect. So why is it in this peeling formula? Every peeling produces an inflammation; this inflammation produces free radicals (FRs) and vasodilation. FRs bind immediately with the closest structure, damaging it. Therefore, a peeling always promotes skin regeneration but induces many FRs that can damage the structures that are supposed to regenerate the skin during the postpeel period. Science generally identifies FRs as among the major causes of cell degeneration in the aging process. It is important to fight these FRs during the postpeel period. Phytic acid slowly penetrates the skin after the other acids: It is present in the skin when FRs are produced, when inflammation develops. Scavenging FRs stop the vicious cycle of inflammation-vasodilation-FR. \n\nThis passage discusses Phytic Acid in the context of an actual AHA peel (containing Glycolic, Lactic, and Mandelic Acid, to be precise), rather than an everyday AHA product like an exfoliating toner, but I think it's likely Phytic Acid is used in Lotion P50 for its antioxidant/anti-free-radical capabilities, and not just because of its effects on tyrosinase or because it's a chelating agent. \n\nSo, I had figured out what Phytic Acid *did*. But I still couldn't find cosmetic-grade Phytic Acid for sale, anywhere. Because I couldn't get it, I prioritized antioxidant potential in the other ingredients I used, especially the botanical extracts that I chose to substitute. \n\n**1.4 Full ingredients list for Lotion P50 and full ingredients list for my dupe**\n\nLotion P50: Water, Gluconolactone, Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Citric Acid, Ethoxydiglycol, Magnesium Chloride, Malic Acid, Vinegar (Acetum), Phytic Acid, Salicylic Acid, Cochlearia Armoracia (Horseradish) Root Extract, Arctium Lappa Root (Burdock Root) Extract, Rumex Acetosa Leaf Extract, Myrtus Communis Extract, Commiphora Myrrha Resin Extract, Allium Cepa (Onion) Bulb Extract, Thymus Vulgaris (Thyme) Flower/Leaf Oil, Sulfur, Sorbitol, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate\n\nMy dupe: Water, Gluconolactone, Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Citric Acid, Ethoxydiglycol, Magnesium Chloride, Malic Acid, Vinegar (Acetum), Salicylic Acid, Calendula Officinalis Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Commiphora Myrrha Oil, Sorbitol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**2. The full recipe I drafted:**\n\nIngredient|Percentage|Phase\n:--|:--|:--\nDistilled Water|70.58%|Water\nGluconolactone|5.00%|Water\nLactic Acid 88% Solution|5.12%|Water\nGlycerin|4.00%|Water\nPropylene Glycol|3.50%|Water\nCitric Acid|1.50%|Water\nEthoxydiglycol|1.50%|Water\nMagnesium Chloride|0.75%|Water\nMalic Acid|0.50%|Water\nApple Cider Vinegar|0.50%|Water\nSalicylic Acid|0.35%|Water\nSorbitol|0.20%|Water\nChamomile Extract|0.75%|Cool-down\nCentella Extract|0.75%|Cool-down\nCalendula Extract|0.75%|Cool-down\nMyrrh Essential Oil|0.25%|Cool-down\nNiacinamide|3.00%|Cool-down\nEuxyl PE|1.00%|Cool-down \n\nN.b.: A solution of 88% Lactic Acid and 12% Distilled Water is used here at 5.12% to give this product a total Lactic Acid content of 4.5%. Use an [acid calculator](http://www.lotioncrafter.com/lotioncrafter-premium-ingredients-calculate-convert.html) to adjust for solutions of other concentrations.\n\n**3. Instructions**\n\n**DO NOT ATTEMPT TO MAKE THIS RECIPE WITHOUT PROPER SAFETY EQUIPMENT!** I wore goggles and a carpenter's mask, plus my usual long sleeves and latex gloves. \n\nYou do NOT want to inhale any of these acidic powders or have ANY of these acidic solutions splash on your skin. Or, God forbid, in your eyes. \n\nDo not skimp out on safety precautions. These raw cosmetic ingredients could give you a chemical burn! \n\nBreathing, skin, and eye protection are a must. So is a precise way to measure pH. I recommend using a properly calibrated pH meter — not strips — to measure the final pH, because 3 is such a low pH.\n\n1. Prepare your work space and materials. You will need a glass beaker, a glass stirring rod, a precise scale, and a bottle to decant the final mixture into. Sanitize your workspace and everything you will use with 70% isopropyl alcohol. If you're making this recipe, you should already know this drill. Prepare a hot water bath heated to 70 C. \n2. In a glass beaker, dissolve the Salicylic Acid in the Propylene Glycol, with heat if necessary. Stir with a glass stirring rod. Dip the bottom of the beaker in the water bath if heat is needed to help the Salicylic Acid dissolve. Stir very thoroughly until the mixture is completely clear. This took me a couple minutes.\n3. Add all the other ingredients in the water phase to the beaker and stir. Weigh the beaker and everything in it, and write down the total weight. Then heat and hold the beaker and its contents at 70 C for 20 minutes.\n4. Weigh the beaker again and add back distilled water to replace any moisture that may have evaporated during the heating and holding. Stir the mixture with the glass rod, and let it sit at room temperature to cool down below 40 C. Then add the heat-sensitive ingredients in the cool-down phase, and stir until they dissolve completely. The mixture should be ever so slightly cloudy, with a whitish-yellow tinge. \n5. Test the pH; aim for a pH of 3. Adjust pH using a basic buffer, such as Triethanolamine, as needed. After getting the product to the target pH, patch test, and decant into your bottle. \n\n**4. My notes and feedback about this version** \n\n**4.1. Things I love:** \n\nI've been using this toner in place of Lotion P50 in my routine for about a week. It seems to work the same in terms of exfoliation; I love the results. It has a very similar texture and skin-feel. Overall, it really looks and acts like the real thing. One thing it does not have is the distinctive aroma of P50 — you know the one: some people call it \"vinegar-y,\" other people say it's more like \"trash juice.\" Instead, this dupe smells of myrrh. \n\nKept at room temperature for a week, nothing has fallen out of solution. (Based on [past threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYBeauty/comments/499u7j/salicylic_acid_toner_aqueous_solution_with/) about how hard it is to work with Salicylic Acid, I was worried that might settle out, but my toner seems to be stable.) \n\nAnother thing I love is that, overall, this was only a moderately difficult product to make, suitable for a medium or advanced DIY-er — or even an ambitious and very careful beginner. You do need to commit to some extra safety precautions though, including goggles and a mask, and the utmost precision in measuring. \n\nMy recipe included a lot of ingredients I'd never worked with before, so I did a ton of research into formulating with each, but I really didn't know what to expect from my first DIY session. What if it was a nightmare? I was so relieved when it wasn't! The whole thing took less time than making a lotion, and it was a lot less hassle than making, for example, a Vitamin C serum. \n \n**4.2. Things I don't love:**\n\nIncluding the myrrh oil was an experiment, and I have to conclude it has failed. For one thing, 0.25% myrrh oil, as small as it is, seems to be just too much oil to be solubilized in this formula. Some of the oil dissolved, but a lot sits on the top of my toner. That's fine for a first run at this — I just shake the bottle before I use it — but it's obviously not ideal, and it also means that when I open the bottle, I get a heady whiff of myrrh. (Maybe not as bad as trash juice, but...) Next time I make this, I'm going to either cut the myrrh essential oil down to 0.1% or leave it out entirely. If I decide to keep it, I may also experiment with dispersing the myrrh oil in a little bit of a solvent before adding it to the mixture. And I'll adjust the botanical extracts upwards to compensate. \n\nOther than that, nothing. I really love this formula. \n\n**4.3. A note on pH:** \n\nI chose to make this product at a target pH of 3. For me, it came out right at 3 without extra adjusting, but PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO PH AND ADJUST AS NECESSARY IF YOU MAKE THIS. The pH of an AHA product determines to a large extent the amount of acid that will penetrate your skin, and the amount of inflammation you experience (more info on that [here](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)). A product at a too-low pH can cause side effects like stinging, redness, itchiness, and peeling, or even give you a straight-up chemical burn. (Even a well-formulated exfoliating acid product needs to be introduced gradually into your routine, to minimize side effects and prevent over-exfoliation.)\n\nHere's how I arrived at a target pH of 3 for this product: I tested my bottle of Lotion P50 and it came out at pH 3. However, my bottle had been open for a few months by the time I thought to test it, and I have seen [other people](https://www.fanserviced-b.com/the-hunt-for-a-good-genes-dupe-17-lactic-acid-reviews/) test Lotion P50 (reliably test, with a pH meter) and get results as low as pH 2.4. I think it's possible that when it's freshly made, Lotion P50 has a pH of 2.4 or thereabouts, and that it maybe slowly rises over time after it's been opened. \n\nI could have set 2.4 or 2.5 as my target for this toner, but I simply didn't want to make anything with a pH that low. It's one thing to use a pH 2.4 product that's made by professionals in a lab. It's quite another to think you can do it in your kitchen. A pH of 3 is plenty low enough for me. \n\n**4.4. About ingredients and sourcing:** \n\nI got everything I needed to make this recipe from a combination of **Lotion Crafter, Making Cosmetics, and Amazon**. YMMV. A few things I simply couldn't find. Most I didn't miss in the end, but if I ever do track down Phytic Acid, I'd love to try a version of this that includes it, just for kicks. \n\n**4.5. Possible changes and optimizations:** \n\nAs I continue to make this, I will no doubt iterate on this recipe. For example, I'm already thinking about making a version with slightly more Lactic Acid and less Citric Acid and no Apple Cider Vinegar, since I don't think those last two ingredients add a lot, comparatively. I'd like to adjust the Propylene Glycol and increase the Salicylic Acid to 0.5%, since 0.35% is actually below the typical effective range of 0.5-2%. Those and whatever other changes I make will move this product away from being a straight \"dupe\" of P50 and towards becoming more of my own creation, which reflects my own tastes and preferences. You too could make adjustments and substitutions, including by substituting the botanical extracts of your choice in this product. Please let me know if you make it, and any changes and improvements you make!\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nI consider this recipe a first draft. But since — surplus myrrh oil aside — it worked, I thought I'd share the formula and my notes on this project. I'm thrilled that I managed to come up with a formulation that pretty accurately mimics Lotion P50. If you're looking for a dupe of that product, this recipe will get you there (just watch out for the oil). Best of luck and happy DIY-ing!",

I did not see ANY change on my Hyperpigmentation whatsoever after finishing two and a half bottles. I use it in the morning after washing my face with the Faceshop rice cleansing foam, the Tonymoly Mochi toner, this serum, , the Tonymoly watermelon soothing moisturizer, and either the UV Doux or the Re'equil Blue sunscreen. \n\nThe texture of the product is good, like a very lightweight milky emulsion, lighter than the plum niacinamide 10% serum, it's fragrance free and did not break me out. I did notice a hydrating effect with this product, but that's it. For reference, the Minimalist anti- pigmentation active started showing results by the three weeks mark, so did The Ordinary AA serum(which I used almost two years ago). Also, I don't understand why the product description mentions 'plant derived arbutin' on FirstCry, my understanding was that arbutin is always plant-derived, I would be glad to know if there are any other sources of arbutin that I don't know of.\n\n\nSo, yes not going to buy this product again, and will go back to either the Minimalist or TO AA.\n\nPS.

I've been interested in Vilvah for a while now, because their susncreens have new age filters  (just ordered one of them 😆) so it seems there's some intentionality behind their products. \n\nThis serum sounds pretty nice. Their \"plant-derived thing\" is probably just to caater to the \"natural\" demographic of consumers 😑 Sucks, because they also kind of misrepresent their sunscreens as \"natural\" and talk about the benefits of mineral sunscreen... but their sunscreens are hybrid? 🙃 I wish they'd get their messaging clear, because the products seem promising.\n\nGotta say, though, I don't think any single-ingredient product for PIH will ever stack up against a product with multiple tyrosinase inhibitors like the 8% Anti-Pigmentation Actives 😅 Like, that's a high, high bar. And the approach to treating PIH effectively (fast, without irritation) is down to using multiple angles and ingredients that serve that purpose. I see a lot of people disappointed or impatient with their results from just an AA serum, for example.\n\nSince they discontinued the 8% actives, I've been using a combo of multiple products (at different times during the week) to get similar results. Kind of tangential to your review, OP, just something that occurred to me ☺️ Thanks so much for sharing! I learn so much from y'all, had no idea this product existed 😂❤️\n\nEdit: also, the product that Minimalist created to replace the 8% is available online, its the Minimalist P10 Advance Pigmentation Corrector Face Cream 👀 It's not fungal-safe, but maybe you'd be interested, OP",

Made using 350g fresh raspberries, 350g fresh blueberries and 500g fresh strawberries. \n\nI washed and chopped up the fruit, put them into a ziplock bag and put them in the freezer for 48 hours. I then defrosted them and once at room temperature i added pectic enzyme to help with juice production and left for 24 hours. \n\nAfter that i strained through a seive to remove the solids and then filtered using a coffee filter. I then turned the juice into a syrup using a 3:2 sugar to juice ratio and gently heating until the sugar had fully disolved. I then left to cool. \n\nOnce cooled i added a small amount of acid blend to give it a little bit more tartness and i also added a small amount of potassium sorbate to stabilise. \n\nIt is very sweet but also full of flavour so i am pleased with my results. I am intending to use it to back-sweeten a mixed berry cider that i have been aging for the last couple of months. ",

    "body": "My eating disorder gives me resilience, organization, adrenaline, and confidence.\n\nThe crazy highs and lows of my eating disorder are long gone. At 13, a graham cracker would break my spirit. At 29, I ballroom dance with my eating disorder with fortitude and grace, leading and always a step ahead.\n\nI hate to admit this, but hey, you’re the internet. I’m a licensed and registered dietitian. Also a certified personal trainer. I made that decision when I was “better” and I wanted to help others. I’ve always enjoyed biology and sports, so I thought it was a good idea. (*Laughs in hindsight*)\n\nIn case you don’t know, dietitians do more than weight loss and counseling. I actually manage a food service operation: food biology and sanitation, menu spreads, training food staff, cooking procedures, ensuring compliance with state/federal regulations, and then clinical nutrition (think: I monitor your electrolytes for your kidney disease).\n\nI’m a manager. I walk around and help my employees daily; anywhere from 14,000-29,000 steps per day. I’m the Go-To person for food questions. Cooking? Cleaning? Taste? Appearance? Combination? Caloric value? Protein value? Me, me, me. I decide which color plate the dinner is served on. I decide if so-so and can have that texture for their particular diet. I decide everything in relation to food. I’m in control. The physician speaks to me when she has questions regarding nutrition. The nurse practitioner asks me for the latest research regarding nutrition. The patient asks me how to incorporate more fiber into his diet.\n\nI can no longer categorize myself as an anorectic due to DSMV guidelines; my BMI is in normal range. Orthorexic? I can taste the potassium sorbate preservative in the prunes at work and it makes my skin crawl. It has to be real, whole, food.\n\n* I work out early in the morning, before work, daily: What a great athlete and dietitian! Makes sense.\n* My body fat is in the teens: Makes sense! She’s a dietitian!\n* I eat healthy and I’m applauded: What a great dietitian! What an example!\n* I’m analytical about food: She’s a great manager, really pays attention to detail. That’s why she has that job.\n* I eat cake in pre-portioned/ already calculated in my head/ pre-determined amounts/fits my limit: She’s real! She eats cake without care!\n\nI have been dropping weight. As my body fat percentage drops downward, my concentration has increased. I feel sharp as a tack. I have a cup of coffee on my empty stomach and I feel invincible. A little Patrick Bateman. I multi-task, I finish what I start, I always follow-through, and I do it all with a big smile. I’m always on time, I’ll always go the extra mile. And best of all, I’m NOT a doormat. I’m actually a pretty confident, straight-forward, logical, and ethical person. (less Patrick Bateman)\n\nI calculated everything: I can still eat my cake, my ice cream, and other crap. A graham cracker is okay, I’ve budgeted for mistakes. I’m like a robot. And it feels quite stale to say that out loud. But what is the alternative? My messy, stupid, emotions? No, thank you.\n\nI’ve done this so many times. I’m 29, for fucks sake. My emotions don’t get me anywhere. I’m done with my emotions.\n\nI’m zoning out my boyfriend. Why isn’t he accomplishing everything like me? I’m too concentrated on my To Do list that is literally never-ending. But if I’m not doing the To Do list, who is?! I have to! I have to set the alarms! Check the cabinets for our stock of foods. Water the plants. Grocery shop! Cook! Clean! Arrange the pillows on the couch! Get up at 6am to diligently work on my mobility. Laundry twice a week. Cut my own hair once a month. I count our money down to the quarters; it all counts. I have to prune all our plants. I have to call my grandma weekly! I have to dust because I can’t stand it. I have to smile at everyone at work with precision—enough to let them know I’m friendly but not too much to let them think I’m brainless. Dishes can’t sit in the sink. I can’t sit anywhere. I have to move!\n\nI’m not even sad. This is life. And when I fall off the wagon, which I know I will, it’s okay too. Get up and dust yourself off. I think that’s the strangest fact of all this: I am not even fazed anymore.\n\nMy eating disorder is no longer only food. My eating disorder is 18 years old, mature and aged. It has spread into every facet of my life, spread out like lightning bolts. I can see my eating disorder so clearly. I feel like I’m floating above my own body, watching everything unfold.\n\nWhat came first- the chicken or the egg? What came first- my eating disorder or my personality? Who am I?\n\nI've calculated for these feelings too. It's okay to question. But the only thing to do is keep moving. I can't sit in these questions.",

I decided to check out the differences in the formula ingredients between Sam’s and charlottes. NO SHADE INTENDED. Let’s compare! \n\nCharlotte Tilbury Hollywood Flawless Filter ingredients: \n\nAQUA/WATER/EAU, HYDROGENATED DIDECENE, MICA, GLYCERIN, PROPANEDIOL, SQUALANE, CETYL PEG/PPG-10/1 DIMETHICONE, ISOAMYL LAURATE, HYDROGENATED STYRENE/ISOPRENE COPOLYMER, SODIUM CHLORIDE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HYDROXYACETOPHENONE, POLYGLYCERYL-4 ISOSTEARATE, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, GLYCOSAMINOGLYCANS, HOYA LACUNOSA FLOWER EXTRACT, [+/- IRON OXIDES (CI 77491, CI 77492, CI 77499), BISMUTH OXYCHLORIDE (CI 77163), TITANIUM DIOXIDE (CI 77891)]\n\nCharlotte even uses this specific flower extract. (Porcelain flower extract, I’m assuming the Hoya lacunosa) \n\nAuric Glowlust ingredients:\n\nWATER (AQUA), HYDROGENATED DIDECENE, MICA, GLYCERIN, PROPANEDIOL, SQUALANE, CETYL PEG/PPG-10/1 DIMETHICONE, POLYDECENE, HYDROGENATED STYRENE/ISOPRENE COPOLYMER, SODIUM CHLORIDE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, PHENOXYETHANOL, POLYGLYCERYL-4 ISOSTEARATE, SODIUM DEHYDROACETATE, CETYL DIMETHICONE/BIS-VINYLDIMETHICONE CROSSPOLYMER, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, GLYCOSAMINOGLYCANS, TRIETHOXYCAPRYLYLSILANE, TROPOLONE, HOYA LACUNOSA FLOWER EXTRACT, PENTAERYTHRITYL TETRA-DI-T-BUTYL HYDROXYHYDROCINNAMATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, (+/-) TITANIUM DIOXIDE (CI 77891), BISMUTH OXYCHLORIDE (CI 77163), IRON OXIDES (CI 77492, CI 77491)\n\nHers definitely has more ingredients but it’s VERY similar and even has the same flower extract! 🧐\n\nI know so many cosmetic formulas are stupidly similar especially when comparing eyeshadows and powder products, I just thought this was interesting! Had to share my nerdy detective observations with someone. 🤓\n\nRegardless, my CT flawless filter is definitely expired, and I bought Aurics to replace it. Also, I definitely prefer and love to support Sam instead. I’m excited to try it and feel and see the differences in person.",

    "body": "I’ve seen a couple of posts with questions from other amateur cider producers. I’m an amateur, but I suspect a relatively serious one. I ferment in 300L batches or 1000L batches between 8 and 10 batches a year, all for our personal consumption.\n\nFirst, we have cider orchards whose 760 trees vary in age from 5 to 125 years old. There are 57 varieties (like Heinz!), mostly cider or cooking, but a few eaters. We harvest and press those apples when they fall - I do not pick any except the Dabinett.\n\nSince harvest times vary per variety, as does acidity, sugar and tannin, we check the acidity and OG when we press. A September apple is usually pH of 4 (or more!!) so we stabilise that (chemically, with sodium metabisulfite) and store it for later. I do not acidulate.\n\nBy now (early December) there are very few apples left. Acidity is about 2.8, OG is 1.065, and the Dabinetts will be pressed so we’ll have a good source of tannin.\n\nI add extra tannin if the tannin isn’t high enough. We test tannin levels in the time honoured fashion of trying the juice and making a call. We find this the best way now, but up until maybe two years ago we would both taste and titrate.\n\nPotassium permanganate and indigo carmine can’t tell the difference between hard and soft tannins, and some apples grow here with great tannins that we don’t want to change. Your tongue knows. Keep making cider and you’ll gain this skill.\n\nWe don’t keeve (yet), but after trying some of Tom Oliver’s ridiculously good keeved cider, we’re going to give it a bash.\n\nFerments are spontaneous. We don’t add yeast.\n\nI’ve never had a stuck fermentation in our cider. I frequently let it freeze and restart after a thaw with no ill effects.\n\nWe don’t oxygenate or add a nutrient anymore, but years ago we did experiment with them, and they made less good cider, but finished faster.\n\nInstead of accelerants, we let the ferment run all winter. The cidery isn’t heated. We’re in the Scottish Highlands, so it gets chilly, -13 C in Feb but it is usually between 12 C and 16 C. If it gets too warm, we chill. We don’t like temperatures above 22 C because it produces off notes.\n\nWe have installed warmers but never used them.\n\nOnce fermentation is complete, we sterilise with potassium sorbate and barrel age in used Bourbon barrels from the US for six months to two years.\n\nThe cider is very sour when unaged. Sometimes, we backsweeten a bit with fresh juice and bottle it for a few bottles of early cider, but honestly that’s for the young, impatient lads, not for me. I just wait.\n\nWe have done malolactic fermentation, but can’t get bacteria right now because of Brexit. Malolactic fermentation is pretty good for balancing acidity without destroying the structure like chalk can, but time on oak works too.\n\nMost of what we’re making ends up dry and about 7%, varies from year to year, and some years are pretty good, but never as good as Tom Oliver.\n\nI hope this helps some people, and I’m happy to answer questions.",

This was my first sunscreen I bought after leaning about photoaging! My first baby! And we were off to a good start. It’s a white watery gel-like texture, light weight, invisible, but quite shiny (some might call this a dewy finish, but I prefer a skin-like finish). A good poster child for the typical Asian sunscreen, I guess. It is not water resistant, and you'll notice this as you sweat throughout the day: It’s like your sweat becomes heavier since it mixes with the sunscreen (you can’t see this of course, but it sure feels like it). I was also worried about touching my face throughout the day, because I felt I might rub the sunscreen off. I can’t remember it ever stinging my eyes, but I’m not entirely sure. The biggest drawback for me was the prize and how inaccessible it is in my country. At this point in time, I also hadn’t learnt about the proper amount of sunscreen you have to use, so I was probably underapplying, and the sunscreen can therefore have appeared lighter-textured in my memory. It contains a lot of fragrance and many ingredients, in general, so that could be irritating. A little bit of science: If you look at the UV filters, there are several UVB filters; many UVB (290-320 wavelength/nm) filters also “bleed into” and filter some UVA II (320-340) as well. The Uvinul A plus filters both UVA II and I (340-400), but it’s also the only UVA filter in this sunscreen, and it’s also the last ranking UV filter on the ingredient list, even though I’ve read that the upper limit for Uvinul A plus is 10% (of the total product). So, is there enough UVA protection? I don’t know, but it’s probably okay since the Pa is four pluses, so I wouldn’t worry too much about it. Packaging is nice and it has a pump, and you get 75 ml, not only the standard 50 ml.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Avène Hydrance OPTIMALE UV RICHE Rich hydrating cream**\n\n* \\- **SPF 20, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **40 ml/1.35 Fl.OZ**\n* \\- **Probably suitable for darker skin tones**\n* \\- **France**\n* \\- **Ingredients:** AVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA).

It does not have high enough UV protection, and it is not designed to be used as a sunscreen, and therefore you will end up underapplying. I bought it because I was looking for a day cream at the time. I wanted something for my dry skin and this day cream worked in that regard. But never did I ever apply close to the amount of sunscreen you have to apply to get the labelled SPF and UVA protection. It is on the heavier side, so applying a quarter teaspoon to your face would not feel nice. Trust me. And even then, you’d only get SPF 20. I would not recommend anyone to use this product as a daily SPF product. It also contains fragrance even though it says it’s suitable for sensitive skin.\n* \\- **Score:** 2/5\n\n**NIVEA SUN UV FACE ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS SPF 30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

I must have gone though three of these. It has a lot in common with the MAKE P:REM one, and it also shares some of the same problems. It has a similar texture: white watery-gel, which turns translucent on top of the skin. It’s like a glycerine-rich moisturiser. I think it’s less shiny as well – more skin-like finish. The problem arises when you sweat: your sweat starts feeling even heavier than normal. I think I experienced some eye stinging with this sunscreen (nothing major), largely caused by it not being water resistant. It’s important to note that the reason it is so cosmetically elegant is also why it’s not water resistant. I was also scared to touch my face and accidently rub it off while wearing this one, too. It’s smells like sunscreen. If you’ve ever purchased a NIVEA sunscreen, you’ll know what I mean. And the fragrance doesn’t go away immediately either. My biggest problem at the time, was also that I wanted to find a SPF 50 sunscreen, and this one is only SPF 30. I think I’ve recently seen a SPF 50 version of this since, so if you live in Europe, I guess it’s worth giving it a shot. Looking at the ingredient list now, I see that it contains a lot of avobenzone. Avobenzone has a bad rep, but you cannot deny how effectively it protects against UVA when photostable. Avobenzone on its own is not photostable and will start degrading (and be used up) when exposed to the sun or UV light. In this sunscreen, however, (and most non-American sunscreens) it has been stabilised by another UV filter: In this case by Tinosorb S. I think this sunscreen might have much higher UVA protection than the EU requirement, which makes sense since it’s advertised as “ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS”.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Piz Buin Ultra Light Dry Touch Face Fluid SPF 30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Sweat and water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

This sunscreen survived me walking all around Madrid for a week in the middle of summer. Boom. What a trooper. The texture is a thick liquid, not a cream, so the opening is narrow so you can pour some into your hand or tilt your head backwards and pour it directly on your face. It dries to an almost powdery finish – it truly is dry touch. If you have dry skin, you should probably moisturise beforehand. It was also easy enough to reapply when I was out and about in Madrid; So, layering it wasn’t a chore. If you don’t apply it evenly it might dry down with some flakes even – that’s how dry it is. But I didn’t feel like it dried out my skin in the process, but that is of course a very personal observation. I would have been perfect if it was SPF 50, a little less expensive, and fragrance free. If you’ve ever tried a Piz Buin sunscreen, you’ll recognise their trademark fragrance at once: masculine and sunscreen-like. It does bring back good memories of summer and beaches for me personally, though.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**THE BODY SHOP Vitamin E Day Lotion SPF30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

And it’s not water-resistant, so it will on glide on your face as you sweat. But the absolute worst thing about this is how much it stings your eyes. I could barely open them in broad daylight, and I had to go back home and wash my face to get it off. Do not, under any circumstances apply this close to your eyes. I don’t know what caused it: maybe all the perfume, or the UV filters? Also, the way this product smells, is absolutely abhorrent. Old lady perfume, and it’s so strong.

I have very pale skin (and am therefore really scared of “universal tints”), but it blended perfectly into my skin tone, perhaps with the slightest bit of coverage. Since it’s a mineral sunscreen, I’m sceptical if it’ll blend into darker skin, even with the tint, so that’s something to keep in mind. It might also have photo flashback, you have been warned. Even though it is silicone based, I wouldn’t describe it as “silicone-y”, if you know what I mean; it has a skin like finish. However, I don’t think I ever applied enough of it to truly know what its finish is like… First and foremost: the packaging. When I bought it, they still used a dropper – I repeat a dropper. This did not work, as the product would spill over, clump up at the inner edges of the bottle’s mouth, etc. And since it clumped up at the sides, I honestly don’t know if I’ve lost some of the UV protection of the product, since it’s no longer a completely homogenous liquid. They later changed the dropper to a pump, but it’s still embarrassing that they ever sold it with a dropper. What were they thinking? You also spend quite a bit of time applying it evenly on your skin, due to its consistency and tint. You kind of have to apply it like a foundation. Since it’s only 30 ml, it means that you should be finishing one of these in less than a month – and only if you’re just applying it to your face. At least it doesn’t have any fragrance! It does have an iffy smell to it, which goes away. Taking into consideration the cost, the packaging (even though it has improved) the fact that it’s not a SPF 50, PA++++ product, you’re left with a very mediocre sunscreen. It could however serve as a daily serum on top of your sunscreen, if you’re very extra.\n* \\- **Score:** 3/5\n\n**Altruist Dermatologist Sunscreen SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I had really high expectations for Altruist, same as many others, and I was let down. It isn’t that bad of a sunscreen, but it’s also not that good. At this point in my quest for the Holy grail sunscreen, I realised I had to up my UV game. SPF 30 wasn’t enough, and I wanted as high of an UVA protection as possible. With the EU’s regulation of UVA protection (in a nutshell the UVA protection has to be 1/3 of the SPF), you could, in theory, end up with SPF 30 sunscreens that had higher UVA protection than your SPF 50 sunscreen. And as a consumer, you simply wouldn’t know the difference. Anyway, Altruist SPF 50, has perfect UV protection, and no fragrance and such. In theory it’s the perfect sunscreen. I mean, look at all those filters (seriously why are there so many, did the chemists make a bet or something?) But in practice? Not so much. First and foremost, if you have darker skin, this might leave a white cast due to the titanium dioxide. Some people have mentioned this in their reviews and some people have also mentioned it stinging their eyes (I can’t remember noticing this). Secondly, the reason I didn’t like it, is because of the texture. It’s the same sort of texture as the MAKE P:REM and NIVEA mentioned above, just less cosmetically elegant. I thought it would dry down or sink into my face, but it never did. I would wait for 20 minutes, and I would still be sticky and a little bit shiny. What worked was putting a lot of translucent powder on top, then I would finally achieve a more skin like finish. Pro tip: Translucent powder can actually make most sunscreens bearable. Since it didn’t dry down, I felt as I would rub it off if my face touched anything. Maybe this sunscreen would work for people with dry skin? Since applying this sunscreen, waiting, applying powder, would take such a long time, I ended up just using a different sunscreen. And I guess that says it all. It also has a “chemical” smell to it, but that didn’t bother me.

This sunscreen utilises a new technology called Organogel™. It contains no water, and thus it doesn’t have to dry down, and you only need 1/5 the amount of a normal sunscreen. You heard that right: 1/5! So, you only need a pea-sized amount for your entire face! But I used a little bit more than that, because real peas are actually very small, so when people say pea-sized, they usually mean 2-3 real peas. A photo from their website illustrating what they meant by pea-sized confirmed my suspicion. But it’s still a very small amount! The texture is that of a see-through slightly orange-y gel. It’s oily, but it doesn’t move on your skin (also when you sweat). And it’s completely see-though so I can with confidence say it’ll suit every skin tone. It doesn’t completely dry down, though, but it does seem to sink into your skin a little bit, if you wait a couple of minutes. You can feel the gel on your skin when you touch it, but you wouldn’t notice you had anything on otherwise. Since it isn’t water based it also feels sturdier than the others I’ve tried, so I wasn’t as scared of it rubbing off when touching my skin. I think it might work very well as a primer. It has a slight “chemical” smell, it also doesn’t contain any perfume or any nonsense like that. It’s on the pricier side, but one 100ml bottle is actually the equivalent of 500ml of normal sunscreen, when you think about it, so I think the prize is justifiable. This was the sunscreen I kept on using when the Altruist one wasn’t working for me, by the way. It’s definitely the quickest sunscreen to apply of all the sunscreens I’ve ever used. A con is that is a little bit difficult to gauge if you are using enough, and that you’ve applied it evenly. Turns out there are two versions of this sunscreen: An American one and a New Zealand one. I somehow ended up with the American one, and it has worked just fine for me. The NZ version uses non-FDA approved filters, but it still has the same UVB and UVA protection listed, but I would still recommend you buy the NZ version, since there must be a reason why they chose to not just use the same formulation as the American one, right? Since I bought my bottle, they have also released many new products, like an SPF 50+. If the SPF 50+ behaves the same way as this one, I think I might have given it a score of 5/5. But keep in mind that it does not have a dry-touch finish (more of an immovable oily finish), but at least it has a sturdy one.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**The Balm BALMSHELTER TINTED MOISTURIZER (Shade: Lighter Than Light)**\n\n* \\- **SPF 18, broad spectrum**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **64 ml/ 2.15 Fl.

Note that this tinted moisturiser is much lighter than any of The Balm’s other products labelled “Lighter Than Light”. It’s really is a pale shade (it appears darker before you spread it over your skin), and it blends perfectly into my skin: I’ve never seen a tinted moisturiser or BB cream this fair before. However, it is so sheer, that the tint almost doesn’t matter. A little goes a long way, and that’s why you shouldn’t really use BB creams, tinted moisturisers and foundation as UV shields. I intended on using this on top of my sunscreen, but since it has next to none coverage, I never find myself reaching for it. If you’re pale as I am, and you want to experience the novelty of owning a tinted moisturiser, this is a good pick. No fragrance, and I haven’t used it close to my eyes.\n* \\- **Score: 2/5**\n\n**La Roche-Posay ANTHELIOS SHAKA ULTRA-LIGHT SPF 50+**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50+, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), PPD 42**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

This sunscreen was bought in Europe. America/Canada/Australia/Asia might have a different version of this sunscreen, because of the country’s different restrictions on UV filters and sunscreen criteria (especially American sunscreens). These versions are not always equal, both in UV protection and cosmetic elegance. It also turns out that I have bought two versions of this sunscreen: A new and an older version. I actually bought the newest version first – and I loved it. I couldn’t understand how people hated it (the skincare community is very split when it comes to the Shaka fluid). Of course, everyone’s skin is difference and can have a lot to say on how a sunscreen feels and behaves on the skin. It’s a fluid, so you have to shake it thoroughly. It takes a little bit longer to apply, since it’s a fluid. It dries down matte, and you can’t see that you’re wearing anything. Easy peasy. Its biggest downfall is the prize (I bought it on sale) and that it only comes in a tiny 50ml, so you can’t buy it in bulk, so to speak. But this was the newest version (as of this year)… and then I ended up accidently buying the older version online (which might still be in production?), and oh boy, was that a different experience! Not dry-touch, but oily! They looked so similar, but I instantly felt the difference on my face, because it didn’t dry down. Absolutely horrible in comparison, I felt so gross. You can tell the new version from the old from the packaging: The newest version has “ANTI-OXYDANT” written underneath the “UVB + UVA” text. It has a similar texture as the Piz Buin mentioned above, but I personally think the Piz Buin is superior in texture: even more dry-touch. But the shaka outshines almost all sunscreens in terms of UVB and UVA protection, and it doesn’t have any irritating fragrance to boot. I thought this would be my final HG sunscreen, because it couldn’t get any better in terms of UV protection and cosmetic elegance.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5 (new “ANTI-OXYDANT” version, 2019) (old version: 4/5, because it still has great UV protection, okay?)\n\n**EVY TECHNOLOGY SUNSCREEN MOUSSE SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I found it. Perfect texture, high UV protection, and relatively affordable. It also comes in a 100 ml bottle, not a 50 ml, which I appreciate. According to EVY, their sunscreens work differently than other sunscreens, because they don’t lay on top of your skin and form a film, but instead they sink into the skin (stratum corneum, I presume). Because of this, they’re very water resistant and sturdy. You shake the bottle, turn it upside down, and squeeze out a golf ball-sized blob of mousse. (This mousse holds its shape pretty well and you can play with it.) Then I just rub the mousse into my face: first it turns into a light-weight white cream… and then it disappears into the skin. After a couple of minutes, there is no trace of it, but if I’ve applied to much there might be some stickiness. It certainly feels like it sinks into the skin, because it’s very hydrating. The other sunscreens I’ve liked, I’ve liked for their dry-touch finish, but with EVY I don’t need to worry about it, because I can’t feel it on my face when I touch (well, technically my face feels like it’s been hydrated) and it doesn’t do anything when I sweat. A Youtuber reviewed EVY and said that the Boots star system is only marketing – it’s not. While we have a universal measurement of UVB: SPF, we’ve later realised that UVA also causes skin damage and cancer, but we still haven’t been able to agree on one universal measurement or requirement. The Boots Star Rating system with a maximum of 5 stars requires much higher UVA protection than the European Recommendation, where the UVA protection only needs to be 1/3 of the SPF. Gothamista, however, really liked EVY. It has no fragrance, but a light aerosol smell that goes away. Because of the packaging, no preservatives are needed. It also contains some antioxidants. I’m already on my third bottle of EVY, and I will continue to purchase it in the future.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5\n\nSome sunscreens I’ve heard good things about and might want to try one day: Anessa sunscreens, Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF 50 PA ++++, Ultrasun sunscreens, Bioderma Photoderm Max Cream SPF50+.",

    "body": "Hi everyone!\n\nI have accumulated a great deal of different shampoos from various indie companies throughout my time here and I thought it might be helpful to share my thoughts on them!\n\nSince everyone's hair is different, your experiences might differ from mine, so just keep that in mind! For reference, My hair is a little past my shoulders and heavily layered. It is generally limp, fine, and very straight. I find that my hair gets easily weighed down by a lot of products. I dye it red about every 5 weeks with henna and, a few times a year, I will have balayage highlights added in or touched up. My hair gets oily at the roots, in my bangs, and around my face, but the bleached ends become very dry. I wash the bangs and top of my head every day and the full length every 2 to 3 days. I blow dry, straighten, and/or curl my hair several times a week. The water in my house is on the “softer” side.\n\n**[ Cocoa Pink ]**\n\n**Shampink Conditioning Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  A favorite amongst the IMAM community, Shampink (formally Princess Poo) provides gentle cleansing without stripping or drying. The absence of sulfates means that it won’t be as likely to pull dye prematurely out of your hair. I find that this shampoo does not lather very much unless you use a generous amount, but it still cleans well enough. It is highly moisturizing, which unfortunately means that it does not provide me with a lot of lift or volume at the roots; my hair looks a little limp when I use this product, so I have to coax it more with the blow dryer to keep it from falling too flat. I tend to use this shampoo on days when I know I am going to be putting my hair up, braiding it, or doing some sort of up-do where a lot of slip is required. This is also nice to use for washing my bangs every day, as it doesn’t dry them out.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 6 oz. and 10 oz. plastic bottles with attractive labeling. Shampoo is thick and clear. Minimal lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $7.50 for 6 oz. ($1.25 per oz.) and $14.00 for 10 oz. ($1.40 per oz.).\n\n*Scents:*  Shampink comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Not as generously scented as CP’s Argan Conditioner. Also available in unscented. I have this in Cereal Killer (fruit loop type scent) and Cake on Mondays (delicious cinnamon almond cake, but beware if you are sensitive to cinnamon).\n\n*I recommend this for:*  Normal-Dry hair types, frequent washers, color-treated hair, damaged hair.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Water, Sodium Glucose Carboxylate and Lauryl Glucoside (natural surfactants), Rosemary Extract, Lavender Extract, Rose Extract, Lemon Grass Extract, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Fragrance, Mica, Phenoxyethanol and Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid (Paraben Free Preservation System).\n\n**Squeaky Clarifying Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  This is a nice alternative to CP’s Shampink if you have oily or limp hair, but still desire more gentle cleansing than most sulfate-based shampoos. I find that this formula lathers a bit better than its counterpart. It is more clarifying than Shampink, but I still would not consider it a \"clarifying shampoo\" as it is quite moisturizing. I like this when my hair is feeling a little oilier at the roots, I previously used hair spray or a scrunching product, or I got sweaty from working out at the gym.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 4.5 oz. and 10 oz. plastic bottles with attractive labeling. Shampoo is thick and light pink in color. Medium lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $6.50 for 4.5 oz. ($1.44 per oz.) and $13.00 for 10 oz. ($1.30 per oz.)\n\n*Scents:*  Squeaky comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Not as generously scented as CP’s Argan Conditioner. Also available in unscented. I have this in Lychee Rose Macaroons (sweet rose with a hint of coconut).\n\n*I recommend this for:* All hair types, gentle clarifying.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Water, Sodium Lauryl Glucose Carboxylate, Lauryl Glucoside, Rosemary Extract, Lavender Extract, Rose Extract, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium, Modified Cornstarch, Fragrance, Mica, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid (preservatives).\n\n**[ Savor Soaps ]**\n\n**Creme Fraiche Whipped Soap**\n\n*Overview:*  I have found that a lot of people use Savor’s Whipped Soap in place of shampoo. I find that it lathers very well and clarifies my hair, leaving it feeling light, bouncy, and smooth; however, I experienced a lot of dryness on my scalp and some frizziness on the ends of my hair. Many people have had great success with this and I may end up giving it another try this summer, when my scalp is especially oily. A little bit goes a long way and it is definitely a multi-use product (shampoo, body soap, shaving cream, etc.), so it is a great value! I did find a lot of unblended pieces of what looks like shea butter throughout the mixture, although this is not listed in the ingredients so I'm not sure what it is. Didn’t really bother me as it dissolves in water, but I thought I would note this. The scent lingers for quite a while after it's rinsed out!\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 2 oz. and 8 oz. plastic jars with attractive labeling. Soap is thick with a butter-like texture. Interestingly, the sugar scrub soaps had a softer texture. Generous lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $4.50 for 2 oz. ($2.25 per oz.) and $10.00 for 8 oz. ($1.25 per oz.)\n\n*Scents:*  There are a variety of scents to choose from, most of which are sweet and fruity, but there are also more masculine options available. I did not find an unscented version of the whipped soap, but you may be able to request it. Generously scented and remains in hair after rinsing. I have this in Honey (perfumey honey floral).\n\n*I recommend this for:* Normal-Oily hair types, thick hair.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Distilled water, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Sodium cocoyl isethionate, Disodium lauryl sulfosuccinate, Sodium chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Tetrasodium edta, Sweet almond oil, Fragrance, Color\n\n**[ Fortune Cookie Soap ]**\n\n**Shampoo Bar**\n\n*Overview:*  I have not had much success with sulfate-free shampoo bars in the past, so I was pleasantly surprised at how well Fortune Cookie’s shampoo bar worked for me! It lathers easily, smells great, and doesn’t leave a weird film on my hair that I sometimes get with other shampoo bars. This product provides gentle cleansing and it is very economical as a little bit goes a very long way. I find the scent to be quite long lasting as well. I use this when traveling as it takes up very little room in my bag.\n\n*Product details:*  Couldn’t find the size dimensions on the website. Bar is square and colored/decorated according to scent. Generous lather. It seems that it will last a long time.\n\n*Cost:*  $8.99 for one bar.\n\n*Scents:*  There are a small handful of scents available and good portion of them change with the seasons. They are mostly sweet, fruity, and fresh scents. I did not see an unscented version. I have this in Oh Hair (peach nectar, grapefruit, sprig of thyme) and it is pleasant and long lasting.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  All hair types, travel.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Sodium Coco Sulfate, Fractionated Coconut Oil, Kokum Butter, Cosmetic Grade Silicone (Moisturizer), Shea Butter, blend of Palm and Coconut Oils (Saponified), Purified Water, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Vitamin E (Tocopherol), Fragrance and/or Essential Oils, Cosmetic Color\n\n**[ Toadstool Soaps ]**\n\n**Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  This shampoo provides superb lather and great cleansing power without leaving my hair parched. It removes any kind of product or oil build-up easily. It is more clarifying than many other indie brands, so I always make sure to follow up with a conditioner. It is fantastic at removing grime, styling products, and skin oil. The foaming power is very impressive considering this is a sulfate-free product. A little bit goes a LONG way. The shampoo leaves my hair super clean, fluffy, and full of volume. The packaging is very basic. The larger bottle size is definitely the way to go as it is the most economical of all of the shampoos I’ve tried.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 3 oz. and 10.5 oz. plastic bottles with minimalist labeling. Shampoo is medium-consistency and clear (type of fragrance may alter color). Very generous lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $6.50 for 3 oz. ($2.17 per oz.) and $9.75 for 10.5 oz. ($0.93 per oz.) Some of the shampoos containing essential oils are a little more expensive.\n\n*Scents:*  The shampoo comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Most are very generously scented, but more subtle scents are available as well. Also available in unscented. I have this in Milk and Honey (comforting almond milk and honey) and it is one of the more subtle scents.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  Normal-Oily hair types, limp hair.\n\n*Ingredients:* Distilled Water, Coconut Oil, Cocoa Butter, Saponified Olive Oil, Vegetable Oil & is enhanced with 100% Raw Honey and Lemon Juice for a healthy shine, Fragrance Oil & Potassium Sorbate as a preservative. *Note: There is lemon juice in the ingredients, but I do not find that it lightens my hair color at all. I have read on other message boards that this is because when it is \"cooked\" the lightening quality is diminished.*\n\n**Wheat and Oat Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  I love the ingredients in this shampoo! My hair really likes marshmallow root and the slippery elm was a nice surprise (both give a lot of natural “slip” to the hair). This is a great formula that would suit most hair types, particularly if your hair likes protein. Protein can be somewhat drying if it’s used in excess, so keep this in mind when deciding what conditioner to pair it with. Toadstool also has an accompanying rinse-out conditioner that works very well with this, but if you have especially dry hair, you may want something more intense. This shampoo isn’t scented; it has its own natural scent from the ingredients, which pretty much smells lightly of grain. Not unpleasant, but I’ve just become so accustomed to crazy-scented products that it was a little bit of a surprise!\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 10.5 oz. plastic bottles with minimalist labeling. Shampoo is medium-consistency and light yellow. Good lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $10.50 for 10.5 oz. ($1 per oz.).\n\n*Scents:*  Natural scent of wheat.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  All hair types, protein lovers.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Aloe barbadensis (Organic Aloe) Juice, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Vegetable Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Avena sativa (Oat) Extract, dl-Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5), Camellia sinensis (Organic Green Tea) Extract, Urtica dioica (Organic Nettle Leaf) Extract, Stellaria media (Organic Chickweed) Extract, Ulmus fulva (Organic Slippery Elm) Extract, Silybum marianum (Organic Milk Thistle) Extract, Althea officinalis (Organic Marshmallow Root) Extract, Aphanizomenon flos-aqua (Blue Green Algae), Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid\n\n**[ Winner ] Toadstool Soap's regular shampoo because of the affordable cost, excellent lather, and availability of scents.**\n\nStay tuned for my review of indie conditioners!\n\nWhat shampoos have you tried? How did you like them? If you would like to share your thoughts, that'd be great! It would also be helpful if you included your hair type so that people with similar hair can decide if that product will (or won't) work for them.",

Like many of you fellow redditors, I enjoy learning, discussing and sharing.  This is my opportunity to contribute to this community. Please be kind to one another while debating.*\n\nBACKSTORY:\n\nI am fulfilling a prior reddit comment about doing a comparison between older and newer Huy Fong Foods sriracha, plus Underwood Ranches's Dragon Sriracha.\n\nFor those not aware, Underwood Farms was the original pepper supplier to Huy Fong Foods.  Legal actions and business decisions appear to have impacted Huy Fong's product.\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jun/05/sriracha-sauce-lawsuit-huy-fong-underwood](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jun/05/sriracha-sauce-lawsuit-huy-fong-underwood)\n\n[https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/2021/b303096.html](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/2021/b303096.html)\n\nUnderwood has released their own sriracha (\"Dragon Sriracha\") which uses peppers formerly used by Huy Fong Foods.  I had to purchase their product via their website, as their grocery store distribution is limited.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nABOUT THE PRODUCTS:\n\nThis reddit community has opinions on taste differences between the older and newer Huy Fong srirachas. I happen to have bottles of older and newer Huy Fong Srirachas (28oz version);  I recently bought the Underwood Ranch sriracha (17oz).\n\n* The older bottle (expiration 2018) was opened some time during Summer 2023, then subsequently refrigerated.\n* The newer bottle (expiration 2025) was opened some time during December 202**3**, then subsequently refrigerated.\n* I purchased the 17oz Underwood Ranch \"Dragon Sriracha\" in December 2023, opening it December 26, 2023 and refrigerating for several hours before using.  This is also my FIRST TIME tasting the Dragon Sriracha.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTASTE TESTS:\n\n1. I cooked Grade AA eggs *as scrambled eggs*; nothing added to the whisked eggs, e.g. milk, butter, spices.  I added real bacon (precooked Kirkland-brand from Costco) to the eggs as they cooked.  Each of the srirachas was added to a section of the cooked scrambled eggs/bacon for a mid-day meal. (See photo)\n2. I used three separate spoons to taste each of the srirachas.  Given the strength of hot sauce, I used a small amount which I ate/swallowed from the spoons.  (I drank water as a rinse/spit between each test.)\n\nThese tests are imperfect, as each taste may have had some affect on the other tastings.  BUT I consider myself to have good taste buds;  I was able to gauge both heat and flavors without a problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMY OPINION:\n\nThe older Huy Fong sriracha has had time to ferment, due to age.  This may have altered the taste to a degree. It still retained its peppery sharpness, its slight sweetness and the familiar refridgerated consistency.  The bottle was almost empty when I used it. It was delicious.\n\nThe newer Huy Fong sriracha IS DIFFERENT.  The flavor possesses something slightly saltier mixed with the sweetness.  The sharp pepper flavor is largely absent; the heat is more mild than the older version.  It is still delicious, although I can actually taste not one type of salt, but actually make out different salt tastes infused in the sauce.\n\nThe winner?  **Underwood Ranch's \"Dragon Sriracha\".**\n\n*OMG, this stuff is INCREDIBLY OG!!!*  Yes, it's fresh, compared to the older Huy Fong sriracha I had.  But it is flavor from Heaven!  (I've tried other srirachas, including Dynasty, Sky Valley, Tabasco, among others. Not in the same category.)\n\nThe flavor is intense, warm (even hot) and wonderful!!  The consistency is akin to Huy Fong sriracha; the color is slightly darker, though.  And I got more pepper and garlic taste than sweetness--which was noticeable, but not like the newer Huy Fong sriracha.  I wasn't overwhelmed with salt flavor(s), which is kinda surprising after viewing the ingredients.\n\nIf you're familiar with the original Huy Fong Foods sriracha, then you will get that 'taste flashback' since Underwood produced peppers which were used (past tense) for Huy Fong Foods sriracha. (Oh, how the mighty have indeed fallen!)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNOTE THE INGREDIENTS FOR Huy Fong srirachas:\n\n(Expiration 2018)\n\nChili, Sugar, Salt, Garlic, Distilled Vinegar, Potassium Sorbate, contains Sodium Bisulfite as preservatives, and Xanthan Gum\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Expiration 2025)\n\nChili, Sugar, Salt, Garlic, Acetic Acid, Potassium Sorbate and Sodium Bisulfite as preservatives, Xanthan Gum\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegarding Acetic Acid:  Vinegar is at least 4% acetic acid by volume, making acetic acid the main component of vinegar apart from water. It has been used, as a component of vinegar throughout history from at least the third century BC.\n\nNo idea why Huy Fong chose \"Distilled Vinegar\" for the older ingredients vs. \"Acetic Acid\" in the newer (even though acetic acid is in vinegar).\n\nNote that the older Huy Fong sriracha says \"MADE IN U.S.A. WITH CALIFORNIA PRODUCE\" while the newer Huy Fong sriracha only says \"MADE IN U.S.A.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So, fellow redditors, there you go!**  Hope more of you will consider posting your thoughts/experiences, too.  For the price, Huy Fong is a much less expensive option.  But for true quality, *Underwood Ranch is the BEST, imho.*  I \\*will\\* be purchasing more of their product!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qu8qpqzzjp8c1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b4d9b76ddab1e9c9a15919748b9a99e206e2be3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/76au80zzjp8c1.png?width=4032&format=png&auto=webp&s=dceacf9365abfdb149b6d0fcbda65815c638c72e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4clqh7zzjp8c1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=024e0298f97aac7225028a5e5398c5721b93a8f8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/anrsirzzjp8c1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0fd5b9d3a23a59617180bc2c7b86a94112fa4f5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m1r4fgzzjp8c1.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=328c52595dc23d6dc9a41ce28592790c3e262259",

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nI wanted to create a space to discuss the new reformulation of Stratia's Interface moisturizer, and how it compares to Drunk Elephant's Protini. The new Stratia formula seems quite similar to Protini, at a much lower price point. It launched last week, so I imagine most people haven't been able to try it out yet, but if you have - please share your experiences as well! There's a lot of good info about the new formula on Stratia's Instagram but I'll recap some of it here.\n\n**Ingredient lists (Peptides/Growth Factors are in bold):**\n\n* Stratia Interface (Old Formula): Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Squalane, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Panthenol, Ethoxydiglycol, Propylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Rosa Mosqueta (Rose) Hip Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, **Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-27, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide-78, Palmitoyl Octapeptide-24, Copper Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-14, Heptapeptide-15 Palmitate**, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Lactic Acid/​Glycolic Acid Copolymer, Disodium EDTA, Polyacrylamide, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Tocopherol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Laureth-7, Diazolidinyl Urea, Xanthan Gum\n* Stratia Interface (New Formula): Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Squalane, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Panthenol, Ethoxydiglycol, Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Dimethicone, Rosa Mosqueta (Rose) Hip Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lecithin, Acetyl Glutamine, **Sh-Oligopeptide-1, Sh-Oligopeptide-2, Sh-Polypeptide-1, Sh-Polypeptide-9, Sh-Polypeptide-11, Copper Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-14, Heptapeptide-15 Palmitate**, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Allantoin, Bacillus/Folic Acid Ferment Filtrate Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lactic Acid/Glycolic Acid Copolymer, Disodium EDTA, Polyacrylamide, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Tocopherol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Laureth-7, Diazolidinyl Urea, Xanthan Gum\n* Drunk Elephant Protini: Water/Aqua/Eau, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Bacillus/ Folic Acid Ferment Filtrate Extract, Nymphaea Alba Root Extract, **sh-Oligopeptide-1, sh-Oligopeptide-2, sh-Polypeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-9, sh-Polypeptide-11, Copper Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-14, Heptapeptide-15 Palmitate, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Alanine, Arginine, Glycine, Histidine, Isoleucine, Phenylalanine, Proline, Serine, Threonine, Valine, Acetyl Glutamine, Coconut Alkanes, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Aspartic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Sodium Lactate, Sodium PCA, PCA, Sorbitan Isostearate, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, Polysorbate 60, Lactic Acid/Glycolic Acid Copolymer, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Isomalt, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Chlorphenesin, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, Sodium Benzoate, Phenylpropanol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Symphytum Officinale Callus Culture Extract.\n\n**General info + thoughts I have on comparisons between the two:**\n\n* Stratia reformulated Interface because some of the peptides in the old formulation were discontinued. According to their IG, they used this as an opportunity to upgrade the formula and have now incorporated a different mix of peptides and have also added growth factors (the ingredients that start with Sh-). This makes the formula quite similar to Protini, at a lower price point.\n* Comparisons:\n   * The two formulas now contain the same mix of growth factors, as well as Copper Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-14 and Heptapeptide-15 Palmitate. The main difference now between the two formulas is that Protini contains Matrixyl 3000 (Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1 and Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7), while Interface doesn't. Protini also has a diverse mix of amino acids in their formula (alanine, arginine, glycine, etc), while Interface does not.\n   * Stratia mentions that their peptides are \"encapsulated,\" which allows the Interface formula to be used alongside other actives (like Vit C, retinoids, acids, etc). Traditionally, from what I've read, peptides are finicky and work best on their own while not being used with other actives. Stratia says that their encapsulation technology allows Interface to be used at any time, and with any active. Protini does not claim any sort of encapsulation (to my knowledge).\n* I haven't tried the new Interface formula, but I have tried the old Interface formula as well as Protini. On IG, Stratia said that the new Interface formula texture should feel exactly like the old one, just with improved long-term benefits. Formula-wise, the old Interface feels a bit more lightweight than Protini. Neither are heavy-duty moisturizers and if you have dry skin, you may need to layer an oil or something heavier duty on top at night. In terms of differences in my skin - peptides/growth factors are more of a long-game, and in my experience, don't produce quick improvements in my skin that I can notice (like with AHAs or retinoids, for example). I use peptides because of their long-term benefits for the skin.\n\n**Questions I have:**\n\n* I'm wondering how much of an impact the \"encapsulation\" technology in Interface will truly make a difference in terms of it being able to be used with other actives - I'm not a product formulator so I'm not sure about the science behind this. At the moment, I avoid using peptides with any other active (I use them on nights when I'm taking a break from tret or acids). If the peptides in Interface truly are protected and can be used with actives (as Stratia claims on its website), then it truly is a game changer in terms of simplifying ones routine. Does anyone have more insight about encapsulation? Can peptides truly be \"protected\" from other actives?\n* Does the addition of amino acids in the Protini formula make a difference for anti-aging benefits?\n* Does anyone have experiences with the new Interface formula? Please share! :)\n\nFeel free to add any thoughts / info about these two products! Thanks everyone!",

I was using these and testing them out while I was writing my previous sunscreen post , so I couldn't include these back then heheh. enjoy and I hope this helps you out!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/un9cxl/shelfie_sunscreens_more_info/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**preliminary info**\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wvluy9fctp691.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d3dc4f6ac986e712bf9b297f7f11882f59c62e78\n\n* **The Derma Co.**  **1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum**  \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\]\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 30 ml (bought from amazon)\n\n**For skin type** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid. fragrance free. really watery and leaves a dewy-shiny finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfsq89eetp691.jpg?width=2064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44d6b8bae83040943583a5eb4b1167f006397a41\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gneguawetp691.jpg?width=2693&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=310db1edebf494a6ddcbc27c6d5bd31261b1ee84\n\n**ingredient list** :  Purified Water, Glycerin, Avena Strigosa Seed Extract, Lecithin, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Silica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Decyl Glucoside, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7 & Disodium EDTA.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was....okay-ish? idk but I was really excited for this since their HA sun gel is one of my HGs. This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less 😖 if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation. I found this really mediocre.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Axis-Y Complete No-Stress Physical Sunscreen \\[SPF 50+ PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1450 for 50ml (bought for Rs.999 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily combo skin types. those with dry skin like mine, might find it a bit more drying. good one for sensitive skins since it has a lot of calming ingredients as well!\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick white cream. fragrance free but has very strong ayurvedic smell. matte finish. physical sunscreen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0lmry60ntp691.jpg?width=2284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=87ba8e26163d69608b5908427942392e037340cf\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k16vk0tntp691.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e5842c13a2344fb14bbe8cb6275e1b6355354b19\n\n**ingredients list** :  Water, Zinc Oxide, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propanediol, Titanium Dioxide, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Caprylyl Methicone, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Disiloxane, Niacinamide, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Water, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Stearic Acid, Aluminum Hydroxide, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Copaifera Officinalis (Balsam Copaiba) Resin, Tocopherol, Squalane, Allantoin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5\n\n**filters** :\n\n* zinc oxide (mineral filter)\n* titanium dioxide (mineral filter)\n\nthis had been on my 'to buy' list for such a long time! and I finally got it during a march beauty barn sale! when I first tried it, I was really skeptical since it gave me a pretty bad whitecast and smelt so weird. I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop 😭. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :( but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nrating : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uglx4tvptp691.jpg?width=3027&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1edc1b4cadce02af8a7cdc6b1c061b01ce3df5ce\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sjk70mlqtp691.jpg?width=3234&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9624dd3003686cc5cf39097b7f271e1643502dd5\n\n**ingredients list** :  Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/​PPG-10/​1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is 🔥🔥🔥. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool 🤤 only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure!  in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty 😖 I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao 😌 so you can guess I go out a lot heheh. I feel like this one is getting over sooner than others in my ss ki theli 😫 but either way, if you find a good deal on it, blindly add this to your cart and order it. you wont be dissappointed!\n\nrating : 5/5 and WRP on reduced mrp only.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand that's all I have to share with you all today! there are so many other ss I want to try like the BOJ one and the Beplain nonnano one, but I want to finish my current stock before buying anymore! do feel free to ask any questions related in the comments and I hope you enjoyed reading these!",

I love physical sunscreens for indooors mainly due to the whitecast, I’ve been using the Neutrogena Sheer zinc for a while because it not only gives me a sun protection but also soothes my skin and reduces oil production. But the biggest drawback is it’s whitecast :/ and I totally get you when you mention the white cast around mouth. The Neutrogena one makes me looking like a ghost all day.",

I've never had a huge dry skin issue on my face (everywhere else is frikking reptilian) so I haven't given it a huge thought.

    "body": "After seeing [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/r613jf/my_experience_with_prose_finethin_curlywavy_hair/) on here, I was inspired to share my thoughts about my experience with Prose.\n\n**My hair:** 2A, fine-medium strands and medium density. It's at about mid/upper back in length, and the only color I have is very very grown out highlights that are near the ends. I'm pretty oily at the roots, I wash my hair every 2 days or so, and cannot go longer than that despite my many attempts to try the hair training myth.\n\n**The goals I set with my subscription:** Oil Control, shine, volume, moisture\n\n**The “factors” they included based on my zip code:** UV protection, humidity, water hardness, pollution, wind. (who knows how much of this they actually factor in but whatever lol.)\n\n**Full Ingredients lists:**\n\n*Shampoo:*  Water, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Decyl- Glucoside, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Jasmin Flower Water, Propanediol Dicaprylate, Fragrance, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Tocopherol, PPG-Caprylyl Ether, Pyridoxine, Panthenol, Jujube Bark Extract, Peppermint Leaf Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Polyquaternium-10, Tropolone, Hydrolyzed Quinoa, Kale Leaf Extract, Citric Acid, Spirulina Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Hydrolyzed Pea Protein, Yucca Stem Extract, Arginine, Cannabidiol, Cocamidopropyl PG- dimonium Chloride, Grape Seed Extract\n\n*Conditioner:* Water, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Octyldodecanol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Chloride, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Fragrance, Cetrimonium Chloride, Birch Juice, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, PEG-7 Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Laureth-7, Polyquaternium-10, Tocopherol, Polysorbate 20, Poppy Seed Oil, Plum Seed Oil, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Cocamidopropyl PG-dimonium Chloride, Potassium Sorbate\n\n**(These lists look pretty basic to me. But I am curious on your thoughts on them.)**\n\n**The story:** I received the first order of Prose a few months ago. I genuinely liked the idea of customized haircare, so I was hopeful. Like many other people, they were *all over* my fucking IG ads, and this annoyed me but I (unfortunately) love trying new products way too much to ignore them 🙄. The set was good. I loved the scent, I loved how my hair looked, and it felt healthy & clean with each wash. It was spring at the time, and there was enough humidity in the air for my hair to have some volume in addition to these other perks. As the weather got cooler, I noticed that the formula seemed almost too conditioning for winter where humidity was much lower. This lead me to believe they did not in fact update it based on the weather in my area. My hair was very flat and limp, and occasionally felt weighed down. There was absolutely no help with the sebum control, but that was to be expected.\n\n**Flash forward to yesterday's post-** I read that the OP had very similar experiences to me *but* experienced more shedding with this product. Andddd I got to thinking. ***I, in fact, was noticing a lot more shedding than I was used to.*** I can't really recall when this increase in shedding started, because my hair was shorter when I first started using it (tiny past shoulder length)- so less hair showed in my shower drain cover. Now, my ponytail just feels a bit less thick. I can't see any bald spots or anything like that, and it is not something very severe- but the combo of seeing a lot of shedding in the shower and this less dense feeling in my ponytail made me feel just a little off. Like something just wasn't quite right. \n\nToday I decided to wash my hair with a different shampoo, a higher end drugstore one from Target called “Odele Volumizing Shampoo” which I used before Prose. And yall… The shedding was much less. Like, MUCH less. I am still shocked.\n\n\\***Let me just say\\*:**\n\n* ***I know that it is not common that a product alone causes more hairfall, and that usually there is a different or underlying reason.***\n* ***I recently had bloods and a physical and all is well with my health***\n* I highly doubt this product is actually harmful, so I am guessing that it simply caused more breakage to happen and that’s what I was seeing in the shower. But I will never really know.\n* ***This product caused no irritation or visible signs of it not agreeing with me, or I would have stopped using it.***\n* I normally would not jump to conclusions, but after seeing such a consistent amount of hairfall each time, it was too different of a result for me to not take into account. I am going to continue to use the regular shampoo and see if anything changes.\n\n**What's my point?:** Prose is ultimately a gimmick. They have very convincing ads that pray on people's fears about cosmetics and their hair health. My hair *looks* great with it, but I shed more for whatever reason and I'm not into that. I'm not sure I trust they are real chemists, either. \n\nThank you for reading!",

    "body": "*I was curious if there are any animal products used in the making of e-liquid and after some google and searching forums, i read about the infamous 'castoreum', said to be used as a vanilla flavouring, and even claims that some PG and VG could've been made with ingredients of animal origin. I still don't know if that might be true, but i asked the more popular flavour companies about their products.\nAny further insights are also welcome to be shared in the comments!*\n\n**The Perfumers Apprentice:**\n\n> Our PG is produced through a wholly synthetic process; there are no animal products involved at all.\n\n> Some flavors do contain milk solids, though; here's the list of those:\n\n> * Cheesecake Flavor\n* Waffle Flavor \n* Gingerbread Flavor\n* Butterscotch Flavor\n* Holiday Spice Flavor\n* Papaya Flavor\n\n> All of our flavor products, outside of those that I mentioned, are vegan!\n\n*Since Cheesecake was on the list, i had to ask about Cheesecake (Graham Crust).*\n\n> That's a good question! I'll admit these names can be a bit confusing sometimes.\nCheesecake and Cheesecake Graham Crust are totally different flavors. Only the first one has animal ingredients!\n\n**Capella:**\n\n> Our products are used in many different industries and we use only the purest, high-quality ingredients in our flavor concentrates. When you use Capella Flavor Drops you can rest assured and enjoy pure, concentrated flavor.\n\n> * Flavor Drops are Corn & Peanut derivative free!\n* Flavor Drops are Vegan Friendly (NO Animal ingredients of any kind)\n* Flavor Drops are Gluten-Free!\n* Flavor Drops are Caffeine-Free!\n* Flavor Drops are Preservative Free (No Potassium Sorbate)!\n\n**LorAnn:**\n\n*They sent me their 'vegan statement' PDF:*\n\n> Although our products do not contain animal products, we do not guarantee that one or more of our ingredients are 100% free of animal origin. Many natural flavor chemicals are found in a variety of sources which may incur a source that could contain animal (ie. a fruit flavor may contain a smoothing effect from a chemical with a dairy or egg origin). Please note that all of the flavors we produce, with the exception of products containing dairy, do not contain animal proteins; however, may subsequently have origins from dairy or eggs.\n\n*Very fair answer. I sent a second mail to ask if they can maybe clarify and list some products that are definitely vegan and some that definitely aren't.*\n\n> This statement is as clear as we can make it.  We don’t have lists sorted by what product contains (or doesn’t contain) certain ingredients.  If you would like to send a list of the products you are interested in, and what ingredient(s) you are checking on, we can have them researched for you.\n\n**Flavor West:**\n\n> We do not use animal products in anything we sell at Flavor West. \n\n*Since they only gave such a short answer, i wrote a second mail to ask if they're also sure that the products they might get from their suppliers also don't contain animal products like milk solids or 'hidden' or 'unexpected' ingredients like castoreum and the like.*\n\n> We do not use Milk Solids, the flavorings are N&A.\n\n*I'm afraid the person i mailed with might not know much about the matter. But neither do i, so maybe i'm wrong here. Either way, it feels to me like the request wasn't taken too seriously and more information could've been provided.*\n\n**Flavour Art:**\n\n*(translated from german)*\n\n> FlavourArt Aromas contain no Ingredients of animal origin. Our aromas are extracted only from base material that grows in nature. The used Plants are not genetically manipulated.\n\n*I decided to write a second mail to ask if they're also sure that the products they might get from their suppliers also don't contain animal products like milk solids or 'hidden' or 'unexpected' ingredients like castoreum and the like.*\n\n*They didn't reply anymore.*\n\n**Atmost Lab:**\n\n> First of all I have to make clear that we use 100% products made by Chemical Industry.\nAs you see in our website, we do not use \"Claims\" for Organic, Bio- and other marketing lies....\nAnimal products is not a root for our materials.\nNicotine is extracted of tobacco, PG is made by synthesis and VG has energy-plant as the first raw materials to be produced.\nNo animals invoilved in our suppliers' procedure.\nImagine also that this think you talked about, is not possible to happen in any other competitor.\nWe all buy the same raw materials and the diffrence has to do with origin and purity (so the cost).\nBut generally, animals are not involved.\n\n*That \"generally\" made me sceptical so i asked again if they're sure.*\n\n> All raw materials for flavours come from chemical industry.\nNo extraction from animals.\nThe cost is such big and not propriate. So, even in case we had to choose, we would choose PURE CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS.\nWe love animals too.\n\n> PS: We do not offer home-made products. No milk, no fruit juice is added..... Think about it.\n\n**Inawera:**\n\n> Even if they are made from oil then they surely have animals' origin as oil was created from prehistoric animals or plants\n\n*Didn't really answer my question at all, not sure what that was about. So i decided to ask again.*\n\n*They didn't reply anymore*\n",

    "body": "So I've been testing this product over the past month, and since I haven't seen any other reviews of it I figured I would write one myself!\n\nI have combination skin with dry cheeks and an oily t-zone, and my skin is dehydrated from tret. I am very acne prone, and also very prone to PIH. I started using tret in november of last year, and had 5-6 weeks of purging consisting of cystic acne on both cheeks, which resulted in pretty bad PIH. My persistent acne has since cleared up, but I still get random spots that pop up here and there, and they usually end up in PIH regardless of whether or not I picked at it. For reference, here is my full routine:\n\nFANCL mild cleansing oil (PM)   \nCosrx low ph cleanser  \nEpiduo (AM)  \nCosrx bha liquid (PM)    \n.025% tretinoin (PM)  \nMissha FTE Intensive  \nMuji light toning water  \nNR white vita capsule essence    \nNR snail solution emulsion  \nCosrx honey sleeping pack  \n\nBoth the Missha FTE and the NR emulsion contain niacinamide, but they didn't make a significant difference in fading my PIH, which is why I decided to try out the capsule essence. For some reason, I can't find the product on the nature republic website right now, but when I last checked the site it states that the product contains 5% niacinamide! The product packaging also states 5%. The other products in the white vita line, if I remember correctly, contain 2%.  \n\n\n**Edited to add** Ingredients: Water, Niacinamide (5%), Methylpropanediol, Betaine, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Piper Methysticum Leaf/Root/Stem Extract, Phellinus Linteus Extract, Articum Lappa Root Extract, Pancratium Maritimum Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Leaf Extract, Nymphaea Alba Flower Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Tranexamic Acid, Panthenol, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Gelatin, Carbomer, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Tromethamine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-51, Glycosyl Trehalose, Glycerin, Cellulose Gum, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Raffinose, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Disodium EDTA, Lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Calcium Alginate, Agar, Gellan Gum, Propanediol, Acetic Acid, Dipropylene Glycol, Lactic Acid, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Zinc PCA, Sodium Palmitoyl Proline, Inositol, Bisabolol, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate, Bioflavonoids, Ascorbic Acid, Tocopherol, Hesperidin, Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate  \n\nThe essence is a clear, slightly runny gel. You can see tiny bead-like capsules in the bottle, but they aren't so noticeable when you pump out the product and apply it. It sinks in quickly and provides light hydration. There is a slight tackiness after it absorbs, but it goes away after I apply the rest of my routine. The essence does contain fragrance, but the scent is surprisingly very subtle and clean. I barely notice it, unlike with the other NR products I've used. Also the essence came in a set with mini versions of the white vita toner and emulsion (I don't think NR sells the essence by itself, although some other online sellers might). Unfortunately they both contain alcohol, which I am sensitive to, so I couldn't test those.\n\nSo, does the essence work? For me, yes! I've noticed that over the past few weeks, my PIH is fading much faster than usual. The stubborn marks all over my cheeks have become noticeably lighter. Now that the PIH is finally going away, I barely need to use concealer for them. I haven't introduced any other products over the past month, so for now I'm attributing the improvement to this essence. I'm hoping this improvement continues, and if it does, this essence might find a permanent spot in my routine.\n",

I'm currently using TO 10% LA but want to add in SA so I might get this. And the Niacinamide is a plus.\n\n\n\nHere is what is on Sephora...\n\n\n-Glycerin: Helps hydrate and restore skin’s moisture.\n\n-Niacinamide: Reduces the appearance of fine lines and dullness.\n\n-Salicylic Acid: Supports natural cell renewal and is ideal for acne-prone skin.\n\n-Lactic Acid: Exfoliates dead skin cells and is gentle enough for those with sensitive skin.\n\nWater, niacinamide, lactic acid, citric acid, propanediol, glycerin, gluconolactone, malic acid, phytic acid, salicylic acid, sodium benzoate, magnesium chloride, acetic acid, potassium sorbate, allium cepa (onion) bulb extract, calcium gluconate, cochlearia armoracia (horseradish) root extract, commiphora myrrha resin extract, myrtus communis extract, rumex acetosa leaf extract, thymus vulgaris (thyme) flower/leaf extract, calcium chloride, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sulfur.\n\n\n**Is anyone interested in getting this?**\n\nI have a feeling 2018 is going to be all about the chemical exfoliation, which I think is due to SR, DE and mainly TO.",

Bentonite has a negative charge and so will cling to positively charged proteins/bits, you may want to add a positively charged clarifying agent as a double whammy. Personally, I like to use both Kiselsol (negative charge) and Chitosan (positive charge) to expedite the clarification of my mead, it works exceptionally well. \n\nIf in the future you are looking to add fruit to a brew add in some pectin, that’ll help break down the proteins in the fruit. Alternatively you can also make a simple syrup by boiling down fruit in sugar water & straining the crap out of it. \n\nSeriously though that colour looks AMAZING.

    "body": "So I am still searching how Wingstop makes their atomic sauce, and found out that it is Cajun Chef Buffalo sauce, few drops of Dave's hot Habanero sauce, roasted red bell peppers and some Whirl butter oil.\n\nI have provided 2 recipes that maybe close, or maybe even better wing sauces:\n\nMango Habanero Hot Sauce:\n\nRoast veg ingredients - 2 x shallots - 12 x cloves of garlic - 4-5 roast red peppers (from a jar) - Yellow Habaneros x 4 (de-seeded) - Salt 1/4 teaspoon - Olive oil teaspoon Other ingredients - 2 cans of mango in syrup - 510g (drained weight) - 1 fresh mango - Limes x 2 (juiced) - Water - 400ml - White wine vinegar - 130ml - Light brown sugar - 6 tablespoons - Honey - 100g - Salt - 1/2 teaspoon - Chicken bullion - 1 heaped tablespoon - Cornflour- 1 teaspoon dissolved in 2 tablespoons of cold water - (Add addition salt to taste if needed) 1. Roast the garlic, shallots, peppers and habaneros. Add the veg into a bowl mix with the olive oil and salt. Then place onto a greaseproof paper lined air fryer tray or basket. Air fry at 180°C for 10 minutes. 2. Add the mango, lime juice, water and roast veg into a food processor/blender. Blend until smooth, it’s okay if there’s still visible bits in the sauce at this stage. 3. Pass the sauce through a fine mesh strainer. Use a spoon or spatula to do this. 4. Pour the strained sauce into a pot, add in the sugar, honey, salt, chicken bouillon and cornstarch slurry. Whisk continuously while bringing to the boil, then drop the heat low and simmer/reduce for 15 - 20 minutes. Stir frequently.

I have found few candidates which are: Arizona Gunslinger Mega Diablo Extra Hot Pepper sauce.\n\nHot Sauce (Louisiana peppers, distilled vinegar, guar, sodium alginate & xantham gum, yellow 4, red 40). I have found Cajun Chef Louisiana's Hot sauce. This comes in  6 oz bottles or 1 gallon jugs.\n\n++++\n\ni found out that Korean Q sauce is Kogi's Sticky Spicy Wing sauce plus butter oil or melted butter.\n\n1/2 cup melted butter + 3 tbsps Kogi's Sticky spicy wing sauce. Blend together until it emulsifies and comes together.\n\nThe Orange Szechuan is Kogi's Orange sauce, Morimoto's Sichuan Pepper BBQ Rub = 1/2 cup melted butter + 1/4 cup Kogi's Orange Sauce + 1 Tbsp Morimoto's Sc=ichuan Pepper BBQ Rub (adjust by starting 1 tsp for a milder taste, then if not increase by 1 tsp until you get your desired spicy taste).\n\nI just want to claim these are just copycat recipes not the official corporate recipes.\n\nNowadays, every national wings and fried chicken restaurant chains. Taste every hot sauce, pepper sauce and bbq dry rubs to be used as a wings sauce to make different flavors and a variety of products out there. The NDA between Wingstop and the small businesses and companies they work with is common among restaurants introducing new flavors, textures and what can be used  as a marinade or wing sauce flavor.\n\nWe may never know the recipe unless a former employees discloses the ingredients list or if they want to share recipes on how they made it Good luck out there trying out these recipes.\n\n++++\n\nBrazilian Citrus Pepper- follow Ash baber's recipe on making the Brazilian citrus pepper.\n\n++++\n\nBayou BBQ - 1/2 cup melted butter, 1/4 cup Sweet Baby Ray's Original Hickory BBQ Sauce and 1-2 tbsps Cajun Seasoning (Cajun Chef or another type of Cajun seasoning).\n\n++++\n\nGeorgia Gold BBQ - 1/2 cup melted butter + 1/4 cup Mr. Talley's Sweet Georgia Gold BBQ Sauce.\n\n+++++\n\nMy speculation is Fire & Smoke Morning Buzz HOt Honey BBQ Dry Rub for the Hot Honey Rub.\n\n++++\n\nAlso another tip is to taste the hot pepper sauce to see how salty but flavorful it is. Then adjust accordingly with the melted butter and sauce needed to flavor the newly prepared wings sauce.\n\nFor every 24 wings, or 3 large chicken tenders or 15 chicken nuggets, put 2 oz ladle or 1/4 cup sauce of your choice. Then tossed them vigorously into the bowl until coated well. Enjoy!\n\n",

    "body": "I had been wanting to try the old NR FTE for a long time, but it was discontinued earlier this year. Since I really liked the white vita capsule essence, I decided to take a chance on the white vita first essence after my Missha FTE intensive ran out. Since I haven't seen reviews for this product, I figured it would be good to post one myself.\n\nI have combination skin with dry cheeks and an oily t-zone, and my skin is extremely dehydrated. I am very acne prone, and also very prone to PIH. My main concerns are keeping my skin hydrated, fading PIH, decreasing redness, and acne prevention. For reference, here is my full routine:  \n\nFANCL mild cleansing oil (PM)  \nCosrx low ph cleanser  \nEpiduo (AM)  \nCosrx bha liquid (PM)  \n.025% tretinoin (PM)  \nNR white vita first essence  \nMuji light toning water  \nNR white vita capsule essence  \nNR snail solution emulsion  \nDr. Jart ceramidin cream    \n\nIngredients: Saccharomyces ferment (edited to add: 87.8%), methylpropanediol, propanediol, niacinamide (2%), betaine, phellinus linteus extract, articum lappa root extract, dioscorea japonica root extract, pancratium maritimum extract, nymphaea alba flower extract, olea europaea (olive) leaf extract, sodium hyaluronate, argania spinosa kernel oil, hydrogenated lecithin, 1,2-hexanediol, peg-40 hydrogenated castor oil, water, glycerin, sodium citrate, bifida ferment lysate, ethylhexylglycerin, citric acid, polyquaternium-51, glycosyl trehalose, hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, raffinose, biosaccharide gum-1, butylene glycol, lecithin, dipropylene glycol, sodium palmitoyl proline, bisabolol, acetic acid, lactic acid, dicaprylyl carbonate, ascorbyl glucoside, zinc pca, sucrose distearate, ceramide np, retinyl palmitate, bioflavonoids, ascorbic acid, tocopherol, hesperidin, fragrance, phenoxyethanol, potassium sorbate  \n\nTexture: The first essence is a runny liquid, but has a slight viscosity to it when compared to water. It isn't as runny as the Missha FTE. It sinks in well and provides light hydration, definitely more hydrating than the Missha. The first essence has the same light fragrance as the white vita capsule essence.  \n\nEffect: Glow! The NR first essence has given my skin much more glow than the Missha FTE did. In addition to the glow, the NR has helped with reducing PIH (the Missha had no effect on PIH). My white vita capsule essence was already doing a good job of lightening PIH, and using the first essence along with it has boosted the speed at which the PIH fades. I'm really glad I took a chance and tried the white vita first essence.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "*Update: See the conclusion of this project, with a formula and notes, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYBeauty/comments/7yzsqd/acid_toner_biologique_recherche_p50_dupe_part_ii/).* \n\nHi all, I'm trying to formulate an exfoliating acid toner akin to Biologique Recherche's Lotion P50 (the \"new\" formula — without phenol).\n\nI've done research and searched the archives on this subreddit, but can I ask the wise heads here for their input? \n\nI'm going to break this exfoliating toner project into a series of posts. Step one, obviously, is to analyze Lotion P50's ingredient list and try to reconstruct its formula, based on each ingredient's safe and recommended usage level, and its position on the list. \n\nI would love feedback on this step, especially if you have a lot of experience formulating with acids. The draft ingredient breakdown is below, and a few questions follow. Thank you in advance!\n\n**Biologique Recherche Lotion P50 Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Gluconolactone, Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Citric Acid, Ethoxydiglycol, Magnesium Chloride, Malic Acid, Vinegar (Acetum), Phytic Acid, Salicylic Acid, Cochlearia Armoracia (Horseradish) Root Extract, Arctium Lappa Root (Burdock Root) Extract, Rumex Acetosa Leaf Extract, Myrtus Communis Extract, Commiphora Myrrha Resin Extract, Allium Cepa (Onion) Bulb Extract, Thymus Vulgaris (Thyme) Flower/Leaf Oil, Sulfur, Sorbitol, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate\n\nLotion P50 has a pH of 3.0 (I tested). \n\nLotion P50 contains a PHA, a BHA, and several AHAs. I don't know the percentage of acid ingredients, but I believe it's greater than 10%. Here's why: Biologique Recherche had to reformulate Lotion P50 (as \"Lotion P50T\") for the Canadian market, because in Canada, over-the-counter skincare products cannot contain more than 10% AHAs. The company also had to raise the pH slightly. (More info about that here: https://beautyeditor.ca/2016/10/27/lotion-p50)\n\n**Here's my attempt at breaking down BR's formula:**\n\n* **Distilled water**: Solvent for all the water-soluble ingredients. Q.s.\n* **Gluconolactone**: PHA. A key active ingredient, an exfoliant that helps with cell turnover in the skin. LotionCrafter gives the recommended usage of gluconolactone at up to 5%, but as it's the second ingredient listed here, I suspect it must be present at a higher concentration than that. Guesstimate: 6-8%? \n* **Lactic Acid**: AHA. Another key active ingredient. Lactic acid is an effective exfoliant, but it is gentler than its fellow popular AHA glycolic acid because it has larger molecules that can't penetrate skin as deeply. It's also not as drying or irritating as glycolic acid can be. Because of this gentleness, lactic acid can typically be used at up to 10% concentration. But here, because it's below gluconolactone, it must be lower than that. Guesstimate: 5-7%?\n* **Glycerin**: Humectant, solvent. Guesstimate: 4-6% \n* **Propylene Glycol**: Solvent for oil-soluble ingredients. Presumably here to dissolve the **salicylic acid**. Guesstimate: 4-5%\n* **Niacinamide**: Vitamin B3. Helps with skin barrier maintenance and repair, anti-acneic, and gentle skin lightener (it's a melanosome inhibitor). Usually present in formulations at up to 6%. Guesstimate: 3-5%?\n* **Citric Acid**: Technically an AHA, but research shows it to have negligible skin benefits, compared to glycolic and lactic acid (see: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16469079). Consequently, it is most often used in cosmetics as a buffering agent to adjust pH or a chelating agent. Guesstimate: from the position on the ingredients list, 3-5%? Although that's high for a pH adjustor/chelator\n* **Ethoxydiglycol**: Solvent. Guesstimate: 3-5%?\n* **Magnesium Chloride**: Thickener. Guesstimate: 2%? \n* **Malic Acid**: AHA. An active ingredient, but according to studies, malic acid is not as effective an exfoliant as glycolic or lactic acid (see: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19245467). Guesstimate: 2%? \n* **Acetum**: Vinegar, or a solution of water and 5% acetic acid. P50 uses Apple Cider Vinegar, for whatever reason. Guesstimate: 1-2% (ie 0.05-0.1% acetic acid)\n* **Phytic Acid**: Not actually an AHA. Primarily used in skincare for its antioxidant and skin lightening properties (it's a tyrosinase inhibitor), and as a chelating agent. Guesstimate: 1%\n* **Salicylic Acid**: BHA. Salicylic acid is typically used in OTC products at 0.5-2%. Based on its low position in the ingredients list, and the position of its solvent, **propylene glycol**, (and referring to this past thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYBeauty/comments/6so5t3/had_clumping_dissolving_issues_today_need_advice/), I'm guesstimating salicylic acid at about 0.5%\n* **Cochlearia Armoracia (Horseradish) Root Extract**: Botanical extract. Possibly anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory but evidence seems slim. BR seems to be about the only skincare company that uses this ingredient. Guesstimate <0.5%\n* **Arctium Lappa Root (Burdock Root) Extract**: Botanical extract with some antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Guesstimate <0.5%\n* **Rumex Acetosa (Sorrel) Leaf Extract**: Botanical extract. Apparently an emollient, but it doesn't seem like there's a ton of info on this ingredient. Guesstimate <0.5%\n* **Myrtus Communis (Myrtle) Extract**: Extract. Antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, but some evidence it can be a skin irritant. Guesstimate <0.5%\n* **Commiphora Myrrha (Myrrh) Resin Extract**: Extract. Astringent and disinfectant; strongly fragranced, with some irritant potential. Guesstimate <0.5%\n* **Allium Cepa (Onion) Bulb Extract**: Extract. Antibacterial, anti-acneic, possibly has an impact on scar formation (it's the main ingredient of Mederma). Guesstimate <0.5%\n* **Thymus Vulgaris (Thyme) Flower/Leaf Oil**: Essential oil. Possibly an irritant. Guesstimate <0.5% \n* **Sulfur**: Antifungal, antibacterial and keratolytic. Not sure what it's doing here, especially so low on the ingredients list I can't imagine it's adding a lot, but perhaps they didn't use it in any higher concentration because of the odor. Guesstimate: <0.5%\n* **Sorbitol**: Thickener. Probably also here to stabilize the emulsion. Guesstimate <0.5%\n* **Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate**: This is P50's preservative system\n\nOK, questions:\n\n1) I'm a little confused about what niacinamide is doing here. I've read that Niacinamide is most effective in products with a pH of around 6. Lotion P50's pH is 3. In addition, I've read that in very acidic formulations, Niacinamide should be avoided because it can hydrolyze to form Nicotinic Acid (a skin irritant). Despite this, Niacinamide is here, and it is pretty high on the ingredients list (sixth, barely below the two major active ingredients). **Can anyone tell me what I'm missing?** \n\n2) I have the same question about Citric Acid. It's usually a buffering agent or chelating agent, but from its position on the ingredients list (seventh, just above the emulsifier), it must be used here in a much higher concentration. Not to mention, Lotion P50 is full of acids already; if it needed a buffering agent to reach its target pH, surely it would need a base, not another acid, right? **Does anyone know why citric acid would be here, and be so high on the ingredients list?** \n\n3) I'd also expect to find Magnesium Chloride much farther down the list — like the other thickener (Sorbitol) is. I even searched PubMed to see if Magnesium Chloride might have some kind of synergistic effect with AHAs, and found nothing. **Does anyone know what it's doing here, and in such a concentration?** \n\n4) Same question about vinegar. I'm only familiar with using vinegar in cosmetic formulations as a buffering agent. **Why would you need so much of it, in a product that is already so acidic?**\n\n5) **Could 4-5% Propylene Glycol dissolve 0.5% Salicylic Acid?** That's 1 part SA to 8 or 10 parts PG. I've studied solubility charts and I *think* it should, but I'm not positive. If that ratio can't work, then either there must be a lot more Propylene Glycol in this product (and therefore a lot more Lactic Acid and Gluconolactone, too), or there must be even less than 0.5% Salicylic Acid. Or it's possible Biologique Recherche has some special process or technique for solubilizing SA that I probably can't replicate at home. \n\n6) **Overall, does my draft breakdown of ingredients and percentages make sense?**\n\nThanks everyone for the time taken to read, and comment on any aspect of this! I *really* appreciate it. I promise to post updates. ",

This would also possibly explain why there's niacinamide high on the list. Which would make a little more sense to me since glycerin can get too damn sticky i personally wouldn't use it in a toner any more than 3%.\n\nAgain, i'm by no means an expert so please take my comment with a grain of salt. :) Otherwise, i love the effort you put into this.

But haven't seen a lot regarding calming masks for when you are having a bit of a skin meltdown. Not only does he react to a lot of products, he is allergic to most ingredients derived from bee wax such as ceramide which ironically is often suggested on AB for people with extremely dry flaky skin like him. He has a bit of what we've been told is most likely eczema which is worse during the summer, and one of the things that really used to help calm down the itchiness and irritation was the old Etude I Need You masks (particularly the green tea one). Thinking that the new formula was the same I bought a pack of 10 of the Air Therapy Green Tea sheet masks, and his whole face went red... I'm now looking for suggestions for any masks (sheet or otherwise) which are good at really soothing skin when it's itchy and irritated, just so he can have a bit of relief when it's at it's worst. Any suggestions are helpful!\nIngredients he must avoid:\n\n* Most things with the word CERA\n* Bee wax\n* Potassium Sorbate\n* Most things ending with -sothiazolinone\n\nEDIT: I've been trying to figure out what ingredient in the new Air Therapy masks are making his face all red and there it is in tiny letters at the very end of the ingredients list \"CERAMIDE\".

    "body": "I did a [first impressions](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/fc7lcw/regimen_lab_skincare_first_impressions_ingredient/) on the Regimen skincare kit I got almost 3 months ago. \n\nI got a little overexcited (blame my ADHD) but after using them for like 2 months and 3 weeks or so, I have a better idea about how they worked out for me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*My skin type:* Dehydrated, **SUPER dry** skin. I mean, **REALLY dry.** Already had dry skin but with tret every other day, it's crazy, crazy dry. I can't do regular tret either, gotta be microsphere. \n\n*Climate:* Dry, desert Cali. Not too cool but not disgustingly hot as of yet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, let me eat my words. I figured out that my skin does best with many different hydrating AND nourishing/fatty layers. Trying to simplify my routine made my skin drier and drier and I found myself missing my old products. Anyways.\n\n\\------------------------------------------\n\n# LEVEL Serum\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Propanediol, Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Betaine, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tranexamic acid, NAG, Alpha Arbutin, Undecylenoyl Phenylalanine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Hexanediol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizinate, Tetrahydrodiferuloylmethane, Hexylresorcinol, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Salix Alba Bark Extract, Salix Nigra (Willow) Bark Extract, Dimethylmethoxy Chromanol, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** Light, liquidy, slightly gel-like. Has a \"glycol\" feel rather than completely water-like. I think people who have never felt the raw glycols before describe it as something slightly \"oily\". Dimethyl isosorbide also feels similar to glycols, but much lighter and not sticky like them. Absorbs quickly. Non-sticky. Layers well with others. \n\n**COLOR:** Pale yellow-tinted transparent gel.\n\n**SCENT:** None.\n\n**RESULTS:** Light texture/pore refinement. Noticeable, but not hugely so. \n\nI am ***extremely*** prone to dark spots. I only get breakouts on my chin. The PIE/PIH that gets left over from acne are only on my chin. The other spots are from sun damage. Aaaand, as you can see from the before and after pictures, my dark spots have actually gotten slightly worse, and more numerous. It's easier to tell irl than in pictures. \n\n[Before/After pics](https://imgur.com/a/SAWwCqK)\n\nI feel like I haven't given it enough time to see real results since I used it for less than 3 months. 3 months is the standard time you should give skin-brightening products time to work. But from the results I can glean from this limited time, I am not super impressed. \n\nHowever, I'm willing to give it another try if it comes out for $35 instead of $45, because I *mostly blame the switch to a new sunscreen* on my spots darkening/getting more dark spots. \n\nI know many people love the Purito centella sunscreen, but it just is not protective enough for my skin type. I am super diligent about sun protection, and the 99% of the sun I get is from commuting in the car once or twice a week (\\~20 min) and sitting in front of windows for meals. I have blackout curtains in my room and only exercise during the night. \n\nSorry for the rant, but I'm honestly kind of upset that the progress on my dark spots that I worked so hard on for years have been reversed a little. \n\nAnyways, the ingredient list is absolutely fantastic. It's definitely a much better deal than Skinceuticals' 3% tranexamic + 5% niacinamide serum. So perhaps if I use a better sunscreen and give it longer, LEVEL may work better for me. \n\n**PRICE:** *$35-45 /30ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** Maybe. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# VITAMIN X Serum\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Propanediol, Ascorbic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Propylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Acetyl Zingerone, Glycerin, Hexanediol, Tocopherol, Epigallocatechin Gallate, Ferulic Acid, Resveratrol, Genistein, Glutathione, Quercetin, Silymarin, Hesperidin Methyl Chalcone, Dimethylmethoxy Chromanol, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol, Citric Acid.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** Also has a \"glycol feel\". Lightweight, absorbs quickly. Feels like I should use it after watery toners, but since it's vitamin C, I used it before anything else. \n\n**COLOR:** Orange tinted transparent gel. It did not change color the entire time I have had it, but I can't be sure of course, because of the original color. I imagine I will only be able to tell once it oxidizes heavily and turns brownish. \n\n**SCENT:** None.\n\n**RESULTS:** Light texture refinement. Like the LEVEL serum, I started out only using it once a day. Then I switched to using it twice a day after about almost a month in or so. \n\nGave my skin a subtle, soft glow. \n\nCompared to the Timeless Vitamin C serum, I just didn't see nearly as much texture/pore refinement and glow factor. I have the type of skin that sees zero results from ascorbic acid derivatives (SAP, MAP, etc).\n\nA bit disappointing on the visual results department, but perhaps other people may like it for all the other antioxidants loaded in this serum that may be protecting the skin without visual refinement. \n\nI was still happily using it up, BUT, I had to stop several days ago. I noticed that it was suddenly filled with tons of little grains??? \n\nI'm not sure if you can [**see it in the pictures**](https://imgur.com/a/PkTvttF), but it almost seems like the vitamin C in the serum spontaneously changed back to powder form.\n\nWhat the hell happened? Stability issue? I am not sure. \n\nAmbitious little serum, but it didn't work out for me in practice.\n\nI'm testing out Maelove Glow Maker at the moment, and so far Timeless is winning out but since it's only been a very short time, we'll see. Am planning to try a Skinceuticals sample next. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$50-60 / 30ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** No. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# WAVE Serum\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Betaine, Glycerin, Urea, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Saccharide Isomerate, Sodium PCA, Sodium Lactate, Sorbitol, Lactic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Pectin, Proline, Serine, Arginine, Glucose, Fructose, Maltose, Trehalose, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Chloride, Allantoin, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** A thin gel. Thicker and heavier-feeling than LEVEL & VITAMIN X. Absorbs a little slower. Still lightweight.  \n\n**COLOR:** A slightly cloudy, transparent.\n\n**SCENT:** None.\n\n**RESULTS:** It has a ton of beneficial ingredients, and was pretty hydrating. But for some reason, I found myself reaching for this less than my other, more watery hydrating essences/toners. \n\nIt may just be my personal preference, but I've been more into thinner, watery layers more than thicker ones as of late. \n\nFelt similar to Hada Labo Premium lotion but a little less hydrating? I still quite enjoyed using it. \n\nThis would be plenty of hydration for most people probably, but I have exceptionally dry skin, and this by itself was not enough to really plump out my skin. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$40-50 / 30ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** Maybe, if it was cheaper. Urea in serum form is a really rare find. But I can probably get a similar effect with a couple of different serums and a urea moisturizer combined for cheaper. If my skin wasn't so darn dehydrated and dry, this would be a fantastic all-in-one sort of convenient step for me since it really has every humectant your skin can use/has naturally. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TABULA RASA Cleanser\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Betaine, Propanediol, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate (and) Aqua (and) PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Acrylates Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium EDTA, Phenylpropanol, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic acid, Citric Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexylglycerin.* \n\n**TEXTURE:** A fluid gel. It doesn't foam up a whoooole lot, but the ideal amount foams up to a thick, luxurious feeling foam if you keep rubbing. It has more \"slip\" than Sunday Riley's Ceramic Slip cleanser if you've used that before. (If you use too little, it fails to foam.)\n\nIt feels really similar to my drugstore HG cleanser, Garnier SkinActive Gentle Sulfate-Free Cleanser initially. But that one doesn't create nice, thick feeling foam. That one cleans well but foams out to very small, non-substantial foam. \n\n**COLOR:** A opaque, white gel. \n\n**SCENT:** A strong, glue-like smell? No masking fragrance. \n\n**RESULTS:** I'm not always a gel-cleanser type of gal, but I actually really enjoy using this cleanser. It really *does* feel MOIST after washing, like my initial assessment. I personally have not used a cleanser with that sort of after-feel before. As a dry-skinned person, I *really* like that!\n\nIt didn't end up drying me out. I found it a really nice, hydrating second cleanser. The only issue was the strong smell, but I have a sensitive nose. I prefer it to smell a little weird than it be loaded with fragrance, personally. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$17-20 /100ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** Yes, I really like this cleanser and would not mind having it on my sink if it came in pretty packaging! I can find other cleansers that can do the job just fine, but if it was pretty and maybe came in a bigger size, I can definitely see myself repurchasing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# C.R.E.A.M.\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Squalane, Capric/Caprylic Triglycerides, Propanediol, Glycerin, Glyceryl Glucoside, Isosorbide Dicaprylate, Phospholipids, Ursolic Acid, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Ceramide NP, Ceramide EOP, Bisabolol, Isoamyl Laurate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Cholesterol, Stearic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Tocopherol, Dimethoxymethyl Chromanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** Picture of texture [here](https://imgur.com/EhE4aHM). A *very* thick, nourishing cream. A little hard to spread. Layered well with other things, cosmetically elegant.\n\n**COLOR:** White, opaque. \n\n**SCENT:** None. \n\n**RESULTS:** I have this MIGHTY NEED to try out as many ceramide/pseudo-ceramide/barrier repair creams as I can get my hands on. So I was REALLY excited to try this cream out. \n\nThis cream was really moisturizing and felt protective on the skin. However, I had to use quite a lot to moisturize my skin. So I ran out of it pretty fast. \n\nIt felt really good, but it failed to keep my skin completely flake-free under sunscreen & makeup and throughout the night by itself. \n\nBut **please** keep in mind that I have *incredibly* dry skin; My skin is an asshole and it's not enough to merely slug life with Vaseline/Aquaphor/CeraVe Healing ointment. It needs lots of humectants and lots of FATS & occlusives to keep it from feeling tight. (I have eczema-prone body skin as well and go through moisturizers by the bucketloads..)\n\nNone of these creams *by themselves* can prevent me from waking up to skin tighter-feeling than I'd like despite *slathering* them on: CeraVe cream & First Aid Beauty UR creams - *way* too light & matte, Atopalm MLE, Zeroid Intensive, Zeroid Oint-Cream (almost!), Real Barrier Extreme, Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Cream, La Roche Posay Lipikar AP+ Baume, Udderly Smooth, etc. \n\nI have to layer multiple of these on in order to wake up to moisturized skin. The only ones applied by themselves that give me the same results as layering multiple on are Aveeno eczema therapy cream & Ceradan barrier repair cream so far.\n\n(I have a big review post coming up sometime in the future on all these but it's gonna take a while.\\^)\n\nI've seen other reviews saying how much this C.R.E.A.M. has helped their dry skin, so I think it should work well for most folks. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$45-55 / 50ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** No, unless somehow they come out with an actual bucket-sized option for cheap lmao. \n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\nHope that helps! I had a lot of fun trying this kit. The company's customer service was incredibly helpful and nice. I hope they can tweak and improve on some things and their actual release goes well!",

I tried a bunch of the zeroid products (oint cream, soothing cream, and 5% urea cream) and the oint-cream is my favorite for night time, urea for day, and the soothing cream is alright but has a stickier consistency that I don’t like as much. Would repurchase the other 2 probably but none of them made me go WOW. \n\nMeanwhile I’m still hoarding the tiny sample of the skinceuticals cream I got and it’s been my go-to whenever I get a random dry patch.

    "body": "♦️ **Skin type:** Oily, slightly dehydrated\n\nSensitive (inflammation and acne-prone, malassezia/fungal acne-prone, slow healing). Ever present PIH+PIE. Currently a few weeks recovered from barrier damage because of an allergic reaction, and a bit less oily and more dehydrated because of it.\n\n♦️ **Climate:** Mumbai. Humid, currently in the middle of October heat.\n\n♦️ **Current routine:**\n\n☀️ AM: \n\n+ Simple Refreshing Face Wash\n\n+ Earth Rhythm Moisture Punch serum\n\n+ WOW Aloe vera gel (with a tiny bit of Purenso colloidal oatmeal powder mixed in)\n\n+ Earth Rhythm 100% Sugar squalane\n\n+ This sunscreen\n\n🌙 PM: \n\n+ DIY cleansing balm (if wearing makeup)\n\n+ Simple Refreshing Face Wash\n\n+ Earth Rhythm Moisture Punch serum\n\n+ Aziderm gel 15% (⚠️ prescription product) OR Minimalist AHA BHA 10% exfoliator OR skip actives\n\n+ Dr. Sheth’s Aloe & Panthenol Hydrating Gel (with a tiny bit of Purenso colloidal oatmeal powder mixed in)\n\n+ Earth Rhythm 100% Sugar squalane\n\n+ Boroline to seal it all in.\n\nI usually don't use the hydrating serum if I'm using the AHA serum (AHA is hydrating enough). I've been using the AC at night, so the Boroline is mostly because of that.\n\n♦️ **Age:** Early 30s\n\n♦️ **Usage timeline:** From May 2023 to Oct 2023, so almost 5 months. Initially used as an indoor sunscreen. For the last month, used whenever I leave the house or sit directly in front of the window. Currently on the last bits of the 50ml tube.\n\nI use about a finger-length for face and neck, but it's a fat finger-length of a pretty thick formulation, so it does cover everything.\n\n#✨️Ingredient list: \nAqua, *Tinosorb M, *Tinosorb S, Zinc Micronised, **Carrot seed extract, **Apricot extract, **Basil extract, **Soy milk extract, Sodium benzoate & Potassium sorbate (ECOCERT approved ingredient) \n\n*Certified Organic | ** Plant-derived \n\nA minimal ingredient list. Oil-free, fragrance-free and silicone-free. Notably, contains nano zinc oxide and new age UV filters. \n\nNo oxybenzone etc. And no titanium dioxide.\n\nAll features that held my interest ☺️ Despite the \"clean\" branding and marketing, the ingredients and formulation are science-based. I wish all clean brands were as responsible!\n\nNote that the PA rating is 3 pluses, not 4.\n\n♦️ **Price:** MRP ₹549 for 50ml. Not usually available at much discount.\n\n#✨️Texture, consistency and fragrance\n\n[TEXTURE AND PACKAGING SHOTS.](https://imgur.com/a/cuJ2geR)\n\n♦️ Fragrance - no added fragrance, but smells distinctly herbal. It's not overwhelming, and does dissipate quixkly enough. The smell is mostly from carrotseed extract, which they've included as an antioxidant I suppose. I've used the essential oil in the past, and it's quite recognizable. The basil extract can also be smelled in there, a little hint of green. \n\nI doubt most people will consider the smell pleasant. Unless, like me, you're a bit hippy dippy and favour stuff that smells like herbs and dirt 😂 But it's fairly mild, so I wouldn't consider it a problem unless you're very particular about the smell of your products.\n\n♦️ Consistency - It's a thick white cream with a pasty consistency. Not oily or greasy at all. Spreads smoothly but not in a super thin or silky way. \n\n♦️ Packaging - a soft matte tube with a flip-top cap. Practical, nice to touch. \n\nI think a slightly pointed nozzle would be an improvement and make it easier to dispense more exact amounts with less mess. It hasn't gotten messy to the point of being a problem, just would be nicer ☺️\n\n\n#✨️Application & finish\n\nWhile the label calls it a \"lotion\", it's definitely not. I'd call it a mattifying sun cream.\n\nIt goes on quite smoothly and spreads easily, despite the pasty texture, and there's a very slight cooling sensation once applied. Stays blendable and white cast-y for the initial minute or so, long enough to apply it nicely. Then it dries down and \"sets\", almost like a foundation would, within a couple minutes. Pretty fast! After which there's very little visble white cast, only where the product is over hair - the hairline and brows. Easily blended away ☺️👍🏼\n\nIf you're already sweaty, though, it doesn't set as fast, and can feel a bit unpleasant. But that goes for applying anything while sweaty. In summer, I'd need to sit under the fan for a few minutes till it settled - but not a whole ten minutes or anything, not too long.\n\nThe resulting finish is quite mattified without being powdery, cracky, or even 100% matte. Its almost exactly like a natural matte foundation, on me. Doesn't take away ALL the natural shine, but does subdue it quite a bit - I was intrigued to find that the finish stayed throughout the day. I do get somewhat oily by the end of the day, as usual, but not nearly as much.\n\nI would not use the word \"lightweight\" to describe it, I'd use the word \"mattifying\". While it doesn't feel oily or waxy, it does feel like a layer or a coating over your skin. I'd initially bought it at the end of summer, to use as an indoor sunscreen, but this sensation made me avoid it 🙃 It feels a bit like wearing CC cream or makeup (and I usually avoid those because I dislike the sensation). It almost feels like your eyebrows have been laid down a bit, like with a soft, flexible pomade or something 😂 I legit use a spoolie to shape them and skip brow gel, because it stays!\n\nIt does create the Moustache Sweat Feeling™️. Like, you apply it, its nice and settled, and then you go out and start sweating as usual... but it feels like all the sweat glands on your face have become confined to your upper lip and sideburns for some reason?? 😂😂😂 If you know, you know! Happens whether there's hair there or not. BUT, thankfully, it doesn't run off your face in white rivulets 🙏🏼 Splash testing with water doesn't visibly dissolve it, even with vigorous rubbing. Can't say the sunscreen film is intact after wet rubbing, but at least you're not gonna be visibly sweating off sunscreen 😌👍🏼\n\n[Here's an image of my hairline on a sweaty day](https://imgur.com/a/h06Lles). I didnt blend the sunscreen at all at my hairline (my fringe covers it and I was in a hurry 😂) and I used extra because I accidentally squeezed out too much trying to get the last bits from the tube. No white streaks.\n\nIt's only when you use cleanser that you can actually see it getting emulsified and the lather turning milky.\n\nThe brand claims \"water-resistant\", and I'd agree. Despite that, it is easily washable with a foaming face wash and can be fully removed with a single cleanse. One of the reasons I (spoiler alert) grew to like it so much \n\n#✨️My experience\n\nI've ben wearing it outdoors for over a month now. Not every day, and not the strongest direct sun exposure, but I haven't noticed any tanning or sun irritation. I know it's a Sunscreen Commanment that SPF50 is for outside, SPF30 for inside... what all rules we come up with 🙃 But what happened was, my skin was recovering from barrier damage, and when I used my silicone-based SPF50 sunscreen (UVDoux) for a day, it regressed and developed those tiny pinpoint pustules and bumpiness. Irritant dermatitis, basically.\n\nMy other option was Episoft AC, and that stuff is so watery I don't think it stands a chance against sweat. Plus, the new age filters are meant to be less irritating. So rather than skip sunscreen altogether, I weighed my pros and cons and used the coating-y sunscreen with the good ingredients that I'd been avoiding 😂 And I'm so glad, because I've come to really rely on it.\n\nIt didn't worsen my barrier damage. Huge plus right there. I liked the natural, mattified finish it gave my oily skin. It didn't sweat off. And it does seem to provide effective sun protection. I also feel like using an SPF30 outside with no issue (despite my regular use of exfoliating acids) kind of made me feel less rigid and anxious about getting the \"right number\" product. If an SPF30 PA+++ product works for me, and I'm not outside for very long, I think that's okay and good enough ☺️\n\n#✨️ Final thoughts\n\nI think people with oily skin that is sensitive and/or acne-prone would most appreciate this product. People with drier skin could also probably make it work, but would definitely need to moisturize adequately beforehand.\n\nI don't think any particular skin type would be totally unable to use it. Preferences like scent or feel might be a con, but the short ingredient list and newer filters reduce the chances of allergy or irritation. \n\nIf you're someone who cannot stand the feeling of makeup or CC cream on your face, you may feel slightly conscious of it, but I did get used to it. The easy wash part made it less of a hassle (no need to double cleanse) so I actually don't mind using it indoors now. The fact that I can feel it even contributes to a reassuring sense of beung protected 😂 I don't use it unless I'm in front of a window, though ☺️\n\nI will say, matte makeup does not blend very well on top of it (powders seem fine). My matte concealer (Lakmé 9to5 liquid concealer) usually blends easily with a finger, but I had to either use a brush to pat it out, or use a less matte concealer. I also didn't have to powder as much, overall. It functions like a mattifying primer, so you can use dewier products on top... I haven't observed it, but logically it would increase the longevity of cream blush, etc. Just some points to note if you wear makeup ☺️\n\n♦️ **Repurchase status:**\n\nWRP, gonna repurchase once I fully run out. I'd rate it 4/5. One point off because it's not lightweight or \"weightless\". It's not a reapplication style product... but you could easily wash it off and reapply. And yeah, ideally it would be PA++++.\n\nI may get the SPF50 one... It's also PA 3 pluses only, but I think that's acceptable considering how little time I spend in strong sunlight. Who knows, maybe I'll end up with the SPF30 _and_ SPF50 ones! Opportunity to compare!\n\nPretty sure I got every single detail from the last four months into this essay 😂 Hope this was interesting and/or useful. Byee!\n\nEdit: recently got the SPF50 version for outdoor use, and first impression is that it's very similar only thicker, stiffer, and slightly more matte. I've used it twice and it's been fine. I did experience some slight itching in the nose creases (doesnt hapoen with the SPF30), which is probably because of my skin's current barrier damage/sensitivity. That area is well known for being irritated easily. It wears off in a couple minutes. Will do a whole review once I finish the tube.",

NO. So you still need a 'Deep Clean',  It should kill a lot of Periodontal bacteria in the pockets and help healing.**\n\nDr Phillips does seem to make the claim in her YouTube video on Gingivitis ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkDqr7C6DJc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkDqr7C6DJc)) at min 16, that 3 months of her system of xylitol and mouthwashes will remove periodontal bacteria from pockets ***and gradually shrink the pockets to normal in 3 months*** for otherwise healthy people.\n\nSo how much does it cost to try her system of supermarket mouthwashes and xylitol?

It is very penetrative and non viscous liquid like water, but the more viscous alchohol based Listerine will also kill a lot of periodontal bacteria - the longer on the gums the better the periodontal bacteria are killed at a high rate...\\[2\\] .

Also I have to go down to one mouthwash per brushing as 3 mouthwashes twice a day is absolutely wrecking havoc on my mouth and I think worsening the sensitivity. I will report back if this solves the problem. \n\nAlso the concept of using a different toothbrush night and day and disonfecting and letting dry before the next use 24 hours later is something that makes total sense. \n\nAlso I’m finding that xylitol crystals are easier on the mouth than mints.

I’ve spent tens of thousands of dollars on dental work and also all these fancy toothbrushes and toothpastes etc. but I have NEVER seen such quick changes as I’ve seen when I saw her viral video the other week and gave it a try. \n\nAlready my bad perio breath alone has been completely wiped out after a week. I mean that alone is worth the price of admission for life as far as I’m concerned. It gets rid of raw onion breath instantly too. I never heard of this Closys product before. And her system is described for FREE on her YouTube videos and she is not affiliated with any of the companies other than her own Zellies mints which I am trying to buy on her store. The Cherry Berry is always sold out tho.\n\nThe cheap crest toothpaste she recommends (have to get that exact one) is way more effective than the Tom’s or Sensodyne one I was using. I still have sensitivity issues and I’m dealing with that by adding Mi Paste or the GC Tooth Mousse, after the fluoride rinse. Hope not to need it after a while. I do not think the sainsbury toothpaste is a good substitute for the Crest. Crest has trisodium phosphate and Sains doesn’t.  I wish she would explain WHY that particular toothpaste but maybe she does in her book, I dunno.\n\nDr Ellie says the most crucial part is the xylitol but I feel like all the components are crucial. \n\nHer videos also provide further details on what periodontitis is and how it progresses, how to avoid. She said something about bacteria on toothbrushes that made total sense to me and why she dries them out between uses. I am now spraying my toothbrushes with Listerine after every use on top of drying them. I can’t bring myself to toss toothbrushes after travel but I’m definitely disinfecting them with listerine now.",

I love to do double cleanse to make sure I remove all the sunscreen and makeup at the end of the day. Over the years, I have tried quite a few of first cleansers/cleansing balms so I thought I would do a quick review here for anyone who is interested. My standards when it comes to a good cleansing balm/oil: fragrance-free, effective, but gentle on the skin, doesn’t over-dry the skin and doesn’t sting my eyes. My skin is sensitive and acne-prone.\n\nAll the products I buy and review here completely fragrance free, contain no masking fragrance, no “natural” fragrances or essential oils, no photo-sensitizing, potentially irritating plant oil/extracts (lavender, eucalyptus, citrus). So here we go:\n\n**Versed Gentle Cycle Hydrating Milky Cleanser:**  **•**\n\n**Ingredients**: Water/Aqua/EauOlea Europaea (Olive) Fruit OilHelianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed OilPropanediolVitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed OilGlycerinCaprylic/Capric TriglycerideMusa Sapientum (Banana) ExtractMagnesium Aluminum SilicateLactobacillus Ferment LysateSclerocarya Birrea (Marula) Seed OilAvena Sativa (Oat) Kernel ExtractRubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit ExtractLeuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment FiltrateTocopherolCitric AcidSodium Lauroyl SarcosinateXanthan GumEthylhexylglycerinSodium BenzoatePotassium SorbateSodium Hydroxide\n\n**My thought:** This product has a milky texture that is easy to use, effective and also gentle on the skin and doesn’t sting my eyes, but there are a few things to note: 1/ It doesn’t spread very far on the skin so you have to use quite a lot of product to cover the entire face so the bottle doesn’t last very long. 2/Even though the product is fragrance free, there’s a light banana scent due to the banana extract in the formula. So if you’re not fond of the banana smell, you might not like it.  Overall, it’s a great , gentle formula and one that I might repurchase.\n\n**Updated review (11/10/22): I recently repurchased this product again and noticed there are little grainy particles like sand in the product. I'm not sure what they did to the product but my sensitive skin can't tolerate scrubs or any physical exfoliant so I won't be using or repurchase this product again.**\n\n**Good Molecule Instant Cleansing Balm:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Polyethylene, PEG-8 Isostearate, 1,2-hexanediol, Butyrospermum Parkii (shea) Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Caprylic/capric Triglyceride, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Citric Acid.\n\n**My thought:** This product used to be only available in the scented version (loaded with potentially irritating essential oils), but due to customer demand, they decided to make a fragrance free version (thank you very much). I’m not sure if the scented version is still out there, so make sure you check the ingredients carefully before purchasing. This product come in a tub with a small spatula that you can use to scoop up the product. I do like this cleansing balm, I think it’s very effective and a little goes a long way. You don’t need to use much to cleanse the entire face. It’s also gentle enough to use around my eyes without any irritation. One con I can think of about this product is the smell. Even though it’s fragrance free, it has a chemical smell that is quite strong which I guess comes from one of the raw ingredients in the formula (though I’m not sure which one exactly). I think some people might find it unpleasant, but it’s still better than adding fragrance or essential oils.\n\n**The Ordinary Squalene Cleanser:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Squalane, Aqua (Water), Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Glycerin, Sucrose Stearate, Ethyl Macadamiate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Sucrose Laurate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Isoceteth-20, Sodium Polyacrylate, Tocopherol, Hydroxymethoxyphenyl Decanone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Malic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Chlorphenesin.\n\n**My thought:** This product has a cream texture that is quite thick coming out of the tube, and once it’s on the skin, it does require a lot of massaging, then the texture changes to oil as you work it in. Even though it’s gentle on the skin, I find it a lot less effective than other products on this list. This is not a product I would recommend for someone that wears a lot of makeup or doesn’t like to take a long time removing makeup at the end of the day. Even if you don’t wear a lot of makeup, I think there are better products out there. Personally, I wouldn’t repurchase it because: 1/It requires too much rubbing and effort to make it work. 2/I find it does irritate my eyes a little. 3/you have to use a lot of product to cleanse the entire face and the tube doesn’t last very long.\n\n**The Inkey List Oat Cleansing Balm:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Oil, Candelilla Cera (Cire de candelilla), Silica,Sorbitan Stearate, Tribehenin, PEG-60 Almond Glycerides, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Flour, Aqua (Water/Eau), Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Lecithin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Biosaccharide Gum-4, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil.\n\n**My thought:** This product comes in a tube, similar to the packaging of the ordinary squalene cleanser, but the texture is different. It comes out of the tube like petrolatum jelly. Because it’s quite thick, it doesn’t spread very far, so you have to use quite a lot of product to cleanse the entire face. It’s gentle on the skin and eyes, and leave my skin very soft afterward, but I think it will not work well for someone that wear a lot of makeup. I consider myself a minimal makeup wearer and this product couldn’t remove my eyeshadow completely. I also notice that the texture of the cleanser is not completely smooth, it’s slightly grainy due to the small pieces of oat which I do not like. I will not be repurchasing this product.\n\n**Jordan Samuel Skin The After Show Treatment Cleanser for Sensitive Skin:**\n\n**Ingredients**: Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Glycerin, Aqua/Water, Sucrose Laurate, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobiliss Flower Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Propanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**My thought:** This has to be the worse balm cleanser I have ever tried. It has a jelly-like texture coming out of the tube, and it goes on the skin just fine, but it just doesn’t cleanse off when I rinse my face with water. It barely remove makeup and leaves my face with a layer of residue that feels oily. I feel like I have to follow up with another cleanser right away or risk breaking out. I hate wasting product but I couldn’t make myself use this one so I threw it out after trying a few times. Sadly, I cannot recommend this product to anyone.\n\n**Hada Labo Gokujun Oil Cleanser:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Triethylhexanoin, Sorbeth-30 Tetraisostearate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olive Fruit Oil, Water, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate(Super Hyaluronic Acid), Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate (Skin-adsorbed Hyaluronic Acid), Jojoba Seed Oil, Ceresin, Dextrin Palmitate/Ethylhexanoate, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, BHT\n\n**My thought:** this product is a very popular Japanese cleansing oil, and for a good reason. It’s affordable, cleanses quickly and effectively, without leaving any residue behind. 2 pumps are what needed to cleanse my entire face. If you’re someone that wear a lot of makeup and need something that can remove make up fast and effortlessly, you will love this product. Some cons about this product: 1/ it can bother my eyes sometimes if I get it too close to the eyes. I thought i just throw this out there in case anyone has super sensitive eyes. 2/ It might be hard to get in in store. You have to order it online and it might take some time to arrive.\n\n**Isnt Tree Micellar Melting Cleansing Oil:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Sap , Opuntia Ficus-Indica Seed Oil , Camellia Sinensis Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Squalane\n\n**My thought:** This is a liquidy cleansing oil that comes in a pump bottle. It’s thin in texture and gentle, but effective. It’s also non irritating to the eyes, and rinses off well. Compare to the hada labo, it’s a thinner oil, and I have to use more product than Hada Labo to cleanse my entire face. I need 3 pumps for Isnt Tree as opposed to only 2 pumps for Hada Labo. If you are deciding between the 2, I would recommend Hada Labo. It’s just as effective if not more, the bottle lasts longer, and more cost effective as well.\n\n**Purito from Green Cleansing Oil:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Glyceryl Caprylate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Vegetable Oil, Tocopherol\n\n**My thought:** This oil cleanser come in a pump bottle similar to the ones from Hada Labo and Isnt Tree, but the texture is thicker than the other 2 brands. It’s effective, but gentle and doesn’t irritate my eyes. I need about 3 pumps to cleanse my entire face. Overall, it’s a good cleanser but I still prefer the Hada Labo because it’s cheaper, works just as well, and the bottle lasts longer.\n\n**Paula’s Choice Omega + Complex Cleansing Balm:**\n\n**Ingredients**: Ethylhexyl Palmitate (emollient solvent), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (skin-replenishing), PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate (emollient cleansing agent), Diisooctyl Succinate (emollient), Olive Oil PEG-7 Esters (emollient cleansing agent/emulsifier), Trihydroxystearin (texture enhancer), Glyceryl Stearate (emulsifier), Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil (non-fragrant antioxidant/skin-softening omega fatty acid), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (non-fragrant antioxidant/skin-softening omega fatty acid), Hydrogenated Rapeseed Oil (non-fragrant antioxidant/skin-softening omega fatty acid), Tocopheryl Acetate (vitamin E/antioxidant).\n\n**My thought:** This one has a balm like texture coming out of the tube and spread easily on the skin. There’s no residue left behind after cleansing. This product is gentle on my skin, doesn’t sting my eyes and is also effective. It has no discernible smell, which is nice since some fragrance-free products can still have an unpleasant smell due to the raw ingredients used in the formula.\n\n**Beauty of Joseon Radiance Cleansing Balm** \n\n**Ingredients:** Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-10 Isostearate, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Seed Water, Avena Sativa (Oat) Meal Extract, Coix Lacryma-Jobi Ma-yuen Seed Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Water, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Glycerin, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**My thought:** This is the most recent product that I've tried and is my current favorite. If I have to choose only 1 balm/oil cleanser to use, this would be the one. It replaces my previous favorite cleansing balm from Paula's Choice. The texture is smooth and gentle on the skin. It spreads more easily than Paula's Choice's and has no detectable scent. \n\n**Other plain oil options I’ve tried that work well:** When I run out of my balm cleanser and haven’t purchased a replacement in time. I usually use plain oils to remove my makeup. But because plain oils do not contain emulsifier, they don’t come off with water, so I have to immediately follow up with a water based cleanser to rinse off the oil residue on my face. Here are 2 oils that I like to use:\n\n**Coconut oil**: thicker oil, best for people with normal to dry skin\n\n**Jojoba Oil:** thinner in texture than coconut oil, best for oily and combo skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My Top 3:** \n\n**Beauty of Joseon Radiance Cleansing Balm** \n\n**Paula’s Choice Omega + Complex Cleansing Balm**\n\n**Hada Labo Gokujun Oil Cleanser**\n\nIf you have a favorite oil/balm cleansers that are not on this list, please share with me in the comment :)\n\n&#x200B;",

        "body": "This is so cool! I love seeing people as committed to zero fragrance/irritants as I am! I'm definitely going to keep these in mind for reccing balms in the future since I don't usually mess with those.\n\nFor context, I'm dry skin and sensitive + acne prone, plus have keratosis pilaris. A cleansing oil I would highly suggest to try out is\n\nKOSE SPEEDY cleansing oil. Here is the current ingredient list https://incidecoder.com/products/kose-speedy-cleansing-oil\n\n you'll see a lot of different listings since they reformulated a lot but this is the right one. \nIt is a very light, well emulsified oil that rinses cleanly and doesn't overstrip. Spreads very well. Doesn't leave a residue. It is even good as a solo cleanse! This is my default recc for any skin type or with any condition. I have people with rosacea, eczema, and ichthyosis using it so I'm very confident in its gentleness. In the US, there's 1pack 7.8oz for $13 or 2pack with 1 full and 1 refill for $20 on Amazon. Some have mentioned being able to find it at Daiso stores in US and other countries. \n\nSo this second one I've only used for a week but I begrudgingly have been pretty into it as I'm more on the dry side. It's the Neutrogena lightweight body oil fragrance-free https://www.neutrogena.com/products/skincare/body-oil-fragrance-free/6861830.html\n\nIt's a very low-viscosity watery-freling oil and it has good spreadability. Works really well at getting into pore for that deep but gentle clean you want from oils. It's probably the gentlest one I've tried even more so than my DIY sunflower/grapeseed + Polysorbate 80 I've made. The \"problem\" is that the Neutrogena oil does not rinse well at all. However I think it might good alternative for people who have tried other oil cleanser and found the emulsifiers just made it too much for their skin but don't want to use a pure oil. It does mostly come off with the gentle second cleanse. It will leave a bit behind in your skin, but as someone dry I quite appreciate that slight buffer for the cleanser and it hasn't caused any issues or broken me out. My skin does actually feel quite a bit more comfortable and less dry since introducing this when this was the only change. It does feel decently nourishing without being overwhelming. It definitrly lives up to its claims if used this way. Normal price is $13 for 8.5oz but can be found for $9-10 on sale sometimes. I'm still not sure how I feel about it but my skin has already decided it likes this, so... 😒\n\nAs my gentle water-based cleanser, my current favorite is the Pipette baby wash and shampoo fragrance-free https://www.target.com/p/pipette-baby-shampoo-wash-fragrance-free-11-8-fl-oz/-/A-79503241. I get a lot of funny looks when I recc this but it's genuinely the best thing I've found that is on par in gentleness with some of the better non-foaming cleansers like the Aveeno calm and restore oat cleanser and is more affordable. It has amazing spreadability and you don't need a lot. I have gone through 4 bottles and am about to repurchase because I'm too hooked and it's insanely cost effective compared to most facial cleansers. Normal price is $8 for 12oz, it's commonly on sale for $6.50ish and one time I caught it for $4 so I stocked up hard. But I'd be happy paying $8. I also use it for body and hair so 😳 I felt it was worth mentioning since it's the second cleanse I follow with.\n\nI'm definitely gonna be taking a look at more of your content now as well! Thanks :)",

Only to realise that there's a common food item to which they have been mildly allergic this whole time.\n\nReally common ones I see are:\n\n* Tomato (mouth ulcers, cracked lips, itchy tongue).\n\n* Preservatives in supermarket bread (indigestion and reflux, nausea, bloating).\n\n* Annatto - a \"natural\" colour found in some cheeses and snack foods (rashes, headaches, asthma).\n\n*  FODMAPs (bloating, indigestion, abdominal pain, diarrhoea - often mistaken for the psuedosciencientiffic \"non-coeliac gluten intolerance\") \n\n* Potassium sorbate - a preservative in some pickles, soy sauces and other things that shouldn't need preservatives in the first place (rash, cracked lips, stinging mouth after food)\n\nThese are the most common, but by no means the only ones.\n\nThe problem is, this sort of thing is INUNDATED with psuedoscience so the key takeaway:\n\nMake a food diary!\n\nI cannot stress this enough. For at least a month, record every meal you eat and, if possible, every ingredient in every meal.\n\nTry and see if you get symptoms more on some days than others and see if there's a food correlation. Then, remove the offending item and see if the symptoms go away.\n\nIt can be trial and error, and it won't always be a magic bullet, but for people who can go from 4 mouth ulcers a month to 2 a year, the quality of life improvement is immeasurable.",

Tell me it’s not true.\n\nDid you know Pfizer owns “Centrum?” Did you know Bayer owns “One-a-Day?” Walking into a nutritional nightmare is easy if you don’t know the “low down” on supplements. Dangerous supplements can reverse what you are trying to accomplish. Also, many multivitamins, especially the chewable ones, contain Aspartame, one of the leading causes of Fibromyalgia and IBS (irritable bowel syndrome).\n\nHave you really read the label, researched any of the synthetic additives, or checked out the “other ingredients,” or did you just figure that was irrelevant? If you are guilty of taking any of the aforementioned supplements, it’s time to buy some liver, kidney, and colon detoxification, and you better educate yourself about those too, because “The Man” wants you sick and dying, not avoiding toxic vitamin imposters that are NOT ABSORBABLE by the body. Dangerous, mind-blowing additives in your crappy vitamins that are listed as “other ingredients” include: talc, dyes, sodium benzoate, methylcellulose, carnauba wax, silicon and/or titanium dioxide. In all of these cases, what you don’t know WILL hurt you!\n\nMost vitamins in supplements are petroleum extracts, coal tar derivatives, and chemically processed sugar (plus sometimes industrially processed fish oils), with other acids and industrial chemicals (such as formaldehyde) used to process them. Synthetic vitamins were originally developed because they cost less. Assuming the non-food product does not contain fish oils, most synthetic, petroleum-derived.\n\nIf your vitamins come in the form of gelatin capsules, you are more than likely consuming the skin, cartilage, connective tissues and bones of diseased animals. On top of that, if your vitamins contain the artificial sweeteners Aspartame, Acesulfame Potassium, Sucralose or Sorbitol, you could be developing artificial sweetener disease (cancer) and mutating your cells, your DNA, and passing that mutagenic DNA along to future generations.\n\nDon’t feel dumb if you did not know that synthetic B-12 comes from activated sewage sludge just don’t be a repeat offender! Your “corporate” made vitamins are made by pharmaceutical and chemical companies who also concocted chemotherapy. It’s just another angle to handle the threat of people getting healthy from nutritional information, and so you’ve been deceived.\n\nEggs---\nOne large egg contains about 0.45mcg of vitamin B12, or about 19 percent of the recommended daily intake, according to the USDA National Nutrient Database. They are also abundant sources of vitamin A, as well as niacin, iron, pantothenic acid, sodium and selenium.\nSynthetic vitamin B-12, cyanocobalamin, is made from ground up toxic cow livers and activated sewage sludge. These cow livers are overloaded with steroids and antibiotics, and the pesticides the cow assimilates from eating GMO feed, and these cows are living in CAFO’s (confined animal feeding operations), where they often collapse and die slowly, while lying in their own “sludge” or fecal matter. Synthetic vitamin B also comes from coal tar and petro-chemicals, known to depress the central nervous system and cause respiratory ailments.\n\nVitamins are not individual molecular compounds. Vitamins are natural biological complexes. Vitamins are living complexes which contribute to other higher living complexes – like cell repair, collagen manufacture, and maintenance of blood circulation.\n\n**Most vitamins sold are not food–they are synthetically processed petroleum and/or hydrogenated sugar extracts**–even if they say “natural” on the label. They are not in the same chemical form or structural form as real vitamins are in foods; thus they are not natural for the human body. True natural food vitamins are superior to synthetic ones. Food vitamins are functionally superior to non-food vitamins as they tend to be preferentially absorbed and/or retained by the body. Isolated, non-food vitamins, even when not chemically different are only fractionated nutrients.\n\nEven though natural health professionals agree that humans should not try to consume petroleum derivatives or hydrogenated sugars, most seem to overlook this fact when vitamin supplementation is involved.\n\nMost non-food vitamins are isolated substances which are crystalline in structure. Vitamins naturally in food are not crystalline and never isolated. Vitamins found in any real food are chemically and structurally different from those commonly found in ‘natural vitamin’ formulas. Since they are different, we should consider non-food vitamins as vitamin analogues (imitations) and not actually vitamins.\n\nA vitamin is--\n\n“a working process consisting of the nutrient, enzymes, coenzymes, antioxidants, and trace minerals activators.”\n\n- Royal Lee “What Is a Vitamin?” Applied Trophology Aug 1956\n\nPolarized Light, A True Reflection\n\nThe difference between synthetic and natural vitamins becomes apparent when viewing their response to a beam of polarized light. The light when passing through a natural vitamin will always bend to the right due to it’s molecular rotation. Thus the letter “d” (representing “dextro” which means “right”) often appears on labels. However, the same light ray when passing through a synthetic vitamin will split into two parts, one part bending to the right and the other to the left. Because the synthetic vitamin is half “dextro” (right) and half “levo” (left), the letters “dl” often appear on labels at the beginning of the synthetic name.\n\nA synthetic vitamin is like the image in a mirror. It looks like the real thing but doesn’t function like the real thing. Half of it will work in the body and the other half won’t work as well. Dr. Charles Schneider, Ph.D., professor of Chemistry, University of Cincinnati concluded wisely, “Get the vitamins that say natural. There is a difference. The “dl” (synthetic) will be cheaper, but if you could figure it out per energy unit or per use, the natural one will be cheaper.”\n\nWhich would you rather have, the food in the mirror … or the real food?\n\nToxic Ingredients\n\ntoxic dyes\nChemical dyes in vitamins can be carcinogenic\nCheck the labels on your nutritional supplements – do they list magnesium stearate or stearic acid as ingredients? “Natural“ Flavours? Sodium Benzoate or Potassium Sorbate? Stearates have been shown to suppress the immune system.  Natural flavours is often used when the product contains MSG, or monosodium-glutamate, a known brain neurotoxin.  Sodium benzoate is carcinogenic.  Stearates are used in many capsules and tablets; “Natural” flavors in lots of protein drinks, and sodium benzoate as a preservative in many liquid vitamin supplements or juice drinks.\n\nIt is also common to find ingredients in vitamins and nutritional supplements that have been irradiated, fumigated or contaminated with pesticide residues.  In fact, up to 70% of raw materials that are imported into the US today are irradiated.  This irradiation process creates toxic radiation by-products, that remain in the ingredients that you ingest.\n\nThe Merriam-Webster dictionary defines an excipient as:  an usually inert substance (such as gum arabic or starch) that forms a vehicle (as for a drug).  The International Pharmaceutical Council of the Americas states that “excipients are substances other than the pharmacologically active ingredients which are included in the manufacturing process or are contained in a finished product.  In many products, excipients make up the bulk of the total dosage form.”\n\nExcipients are used in nutritional supplements and vitamins for many reasons, as fillers, lubricants, colors that liven up the product, preservatives, sweeteners, and  coatings and glazes that make it easier to swallow.  Many of the excipients, especially the lubricants, are used to make it easier and cheaper  for the company to manufacture.\n\nOne example is talc, a suspected carcinogen, that is used in many capsules for vitamins and other nutritional supplements today when they are manufactured with a high-speed encapsulator.  It makes the ingredients flow faster and therefore it is much cheaper to make when the talc is included.\n\nAlthough many doctors have been taught that food and non-food vitamins have the same chemical composition, this is simply untrue for most vitamins. As the chemical forms of food and synthetic nutrients are normally different. Its important to understand that since there is no mandated definition of the term ‘natural’; just seeing that term on a label does not mean that the supplement contains only natural food substances. One of the best ways to tell whether or not a vitamin supplement contains natural vitamins as found in food is to know the chemical differences between food and non-food vitamins (sometimes called USP vitamins).",

        "body": "Continued 2...\n\nORP---Let’s take vitamin C for an example. Even if one were to take 3.2 times as much of the so-called natural, non-food, ascorbic acid than food vitamin C, although the antioxidant effects might be similar in vitro, the ascorbic acid still will not contain DHAA, nor will it ever have negative oxidative reductive potential (ORP). A simple in vitro study with a digital ORP meter demonstrated that a citrus food vitamin C has negative ORP, but that ascorbic acid had positive ORP.\n\nIt takes negative ORP to clean up oxidative damage, and since ascorbic acid has positive ORP (as well as positive redox potential, it can never replace food vitamin C no matter what the quantity! Furthermore, foods which are high in vitamin C tend to have high Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC, another test which measures the ability of foods and other compounds to subdue oxygen free radicals. A US government study which compared the in vivo effects of a high vitamin C food (containing 80 mg of vitamin C) compared to about 15.6 times as much isolated ascorbic acid (1250 mg) found that the vitamin C-containing food produced the greatest increase in blood antioxidant levels (it is believed that bioflavonoids and other food factors are responsible).\n\nPublished scientific research has concluded, “natural vitamins are nutritionally superior to synthetic ones”.\n\nFood vitamins are in the physiochemical forms which the body recognizes, generally are not crystalline in structure, contain food factors that affect bioavailability, and appear to have smaller particle sizes. This does not mean that non-food vitamins do not have any value (they clearly do), but it is important to understand that natural food complex vitamins have actually been shown to be better than isolated, non-food, vitamins.\n\nEach of the other synergists in the C complex has a separate function:\n\n– P factors for blood vessel strength,\n– J factors for oxygen-carrying capacity of red cells,\n– tyrosinase as an essential enzyme for enhancing white blood cell effectiveness.\n\nAscorbic acid is just the antioxidant outer shell – the protector of all these other synergists so that they will be able to perform their individual functions.\n\nNo matter how much isolated ascorbic acid one takes orally it will never saturate plasma and/or tissue vitamin C levels significantly more than can be obtained by consuming sufficient vitamin C containing foods.\n-It will never have negative ORP, thus can never ‘clean-up’ oxidative damage like food vitamin C can.\n-It will never have the free radical fightin))g capacity of food vitamin C.\n-It will never contain DHAA (the other ‘half’ of vitamin C) or the promoting food factors.\n-It will never have the same effect on health issues, such as aging and cardiovascular disease as high vitamin C foods can.\n-It will not ever be utilized the way food vitamin C is.\n-It will always be a synthetic.\nreal-food-versus-vitamin-supplements\n\nLet’s take vitamin E as another example—the body has a specific liver transport for the type of vitamin E found in food—it does not have this for the synthetic vitamin E forms (nor for the ‘new’ vitamin E analogues that are frequently marketed)—thus no amount of synthetic vitamin E can truly equal food vitamin E—the human body actually tries to rid itself of synthetic vitamin E as quickly as possible. As another example, it should be understood that certain forms of vitamin analogues of B-6, D, and biotin have been shown to have almost no vitamin activity.\n\nWhat are the best sources of Food Vitamins?\n\nCarrots, yellow and green leafy vegetables, and turmeric contain natural betacarotene along with multiple carotenoids. Natural betacarotene was found to significantly decrease serum conjugated diene levels for children exposed to high levels of irradiation.\n\nMost fruits contain vitamin A, but the following fruits have a significant amount: Cantaloupes, Grapefruit, Guava, Mango, Papaya, Passionfruit Tomatoes, Watermelon. Vegetables: Amaranth Leaves, Bok Choy, Broccoli, Brussels Sprouts, Butternut Squash, Carrots, Chinese Broccoli, Chinese Cabbage, Kale\nBeef, legumes, cereal grains, yeast, and fish are significant natural food sources of vitamin B.\nThe vegetarian foods which are highest in natural pantothenate (B-5) are nutritional yeast, brown rice, peanuts, and broccoli. Specifically, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (nutritional yeast not brewers yeast) is one of the best natural sources of food pantothenate\nThe highest concentrations of folate (B- 9) exist in yeast and brocolli.\nPABA (B co-factor) is found in foods such as kidney, liver, molasses, fungal foods, spinach, and whole grains.\nVitamin B7 is generally produced in the intestine, in the presence of healthy intestinal flora. Cereals, pulses and legumes, vegetables, nuts and beef liver contain biotin. Rice bran, rice germ, barley, whole wheat and brown rice are rich sources of biotin. Vegetable sources include mushrooms and cauliflower, while walnuts, peanuts, peanut butter and almonds also contain this vitamin.\nWhile nutritional yeast is probably the best source of inositol (B co-factor), it is also found in fruits, lecithin, legumes, meats, milk, unrefined molasses, raisins, vegetables, and whole grains.\nPhosphatidyl-choline is the major delivery form of choline (B co-factor), and is naturally found in many foods such as beef liver, egg yolks, and soya. Specially grown nutritional yeast appears to be the best food form for supplements.\n\nVitamin C naturally occurs in fruits, (especially citrus fruits like oranges and limes) in two ascorbate forms with bioflavonoids. Whole food vitamin C is also found in potatoes, onions. Also, Black Currants, Breadfruit, Grapefruit, Guava, Kiwi, Lychee, Mango, Mulberries, Papaya, Passionfruit, Pineapple, Strawberries, Amaranth Leaves, Bok Choy, Broccoli, Brussels Sprouts, Butternut Squash, Green Pepper, Kale, Cod, Perch, Goat Milk.\n\nVitamin D is known as the “sunshine vitamin” since it is manufactured by the body after being exposed to sunshine. Ten to fifteen minutes of good sunshine three times weekly is adequate to produce the body’s requirement of vitamin D. This means that we don’t need to obtain vitamin D from our diet unless we get very little sunlight. Mushrooms are a good source of Vitamin D.\n\nNatural vitamin E “as found in foods is [d]-alpha tocopherol. Vitamin E content is highest in vegetable oils, also relatively high in avocados.\nDark leafy vegetables, as well as cabbage, appear to be the primary food source of vitamin K.\nFruits and vegetables shoppingThe bioavailability of food vitamins is better than that of most isolated USP vitamins, that they may have better effects on maintaining aspects of human health beyond traditional vitamin deficiency syndromes, and at least some seem to be preferentially retained by the human body. It is not always clear if these advantages are due to the physiochemical form of the vitamin, with the other food constituents that are naturally found with them, or some combination. Regardless, it seems logical to conclude that for purposes of maintaining normal health, natural vitamins are superior to synthetic ones. Unlike some synthetic vitamins, no natural vitamin has been found to not perform all of its natural functions. The truth is that only foods, or supplements composed of 100% foods, can be counted on as not containing non-food vitamin analogues. So the best way to build health is from foods or nutrients contained in foods.\n\n**Most vitamins cannot be made by the body**. They must be taken in as food. The best sources then are obviously whole foods, rich in vitamins. Because of soil depletion, mineral depletion, pesticides, air pollution, and erosion, it is common knowledge that foods grown in many of the world’s commercially farmed soils today have only a fraction of the nutrient value of 50 years ago.\n\n\nVitamins and minerals are not functionally separable. They make each other work. Example: vitamin D is necessary for the body to absorb calcium. Copper is necessary for vitamin C activity. And so on. Mineral deficiencies can cause vitamin deficiencies, and vice versa. So that is the other prime difference between whole food vitamins and synthetics: whole food vitamins contain within them many essential trace minerals necessary for their synergistic operation. Synthetic vitamins contain no trace minerals, relying on, and depleting, the body’s own mineral reserves.\n\nThe earth’s immune system is its soil. To be vital and capable of growing vital foods, **soil must be rich in both minerals and soil-based organisms** – life forms. Healthy produce naturally resists insects. Insects are like bad bacteria in the body: they are attracted to diseased tissue, though they do not cause it.\n\nWhether or not we need supplementation is no longer an issue, except for one who is totally out of touch. The issue is what kind and how much.",

Fruits, vegetables, meat, butter, and lard. \n\nBut none of it was processed with drugs and chemicals.\n\nToday one in three dies of cancer. One in two dies of heart disease. Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S. (Vital Statistics) For anyone born after 2003, there is a one in 3 chance of Type 2 diabetes. Is that progress? If you are a food manufacturer it is, and especially if you are a drug manufacturer. In 2007 the WHO ranked the US as #39 in the world in infant mortality. Male sperm count is less than 20% of what it was in 1929. (1981 University of Florida report, Natural vs. Synthetic) Infant mortality is up; birth defects are up.

Right: drug companies and food manufacturers. Do they want to keep the ball rolling? You bet. Will they kill you to do it? You bet. Do they want people to take charge of their own health by natural inexpensive foods and supplements? Negative. A cure for cancer has been “right around the corner” since Nixon.

In the text, Medical Mycology John Rippon (Ph.D., Mycology, University of Chicago) wrote, “There are over 500 known species of yeast, all distinctly different. And although the so-called bad yeasts do exist, the controversy in the natural foods industry regarding yeast related to health problems which is causing many health-conscious people to eliminate all yeast products from their diet is ridiculous.? It should also be noted, that W. Crook, M.D., perhaps the nation’s best known expert on Candida albicans, wrote, “yeasty foods don’t encourage candida growth…Eating a yeast-containing food does not make candida organisms multiply”. Some people, however, are allergic to the cell-wall of yeast and concerned supplement companies which have nutrient-containing yeast normally have had the cell-wall enzymatically processed to reduce even this unlikely occurrence.\n\nFood Vitamins are Superior to Non-Food Vitamins\n\nAlthough many mainstream health professionals believe, “The body cannot tell whether a vitamin in the bloodstream came from an organically grown cantaloupe or from a chemist’s laboratory”, this belief is quite misleading for several reasons. First it seems to assume that the process of getting the amount of the vitamin into the bloodstream is the same (which is frequently not the case. Secondly, scientists understand that particle size is an important factor in nutrient absorption even though particle size is not detected by chemical assessment. Thirdly, scientists also understand that, “The food factors that influence the absorption of nutrients relate not only to the nature of the nutrients themselves, but also their interaction with each other and with the nonabsorbable components of food”. Fourthly, “the physiochemical form of a nutrient is a major factor in bioavailability” (and food and non-food vitamins are not normally in the same form). Fifthly, most non-food vitamins are crystalline in structure.\n\nThe Food & Drug laws seem to be suspended where synthetic imitations of good foods are concerned, and actually perverted to prosecute makers and sellers of real products…The synthetic product is always a simple chemical substance, while the natural is a complex mixture of related and similar materials…Pure natural Vitamin E was found three times as potent as pure synthetic Vitamin E. Of course the poisonous nature of the synthetic Vitamin D…is well established. These facts are almost always hidden or suppressed by the Big Pharma cartel and their complicit media, and most in the medical profession are never properly educated about these facts.\n\nThe difference is more than quantitative.",

The spices are a little too powerful, next time I may add less or just add them during secondary. Theres still a touch of mustiness in the flavor: I intend to backsweeten with 2 oz of honey tn (stabilized it with potassium sorbate last night)  and bottle age thru Lent to get rid of the last little bit of mustiness.\n\nAny advice and tips are appreciated!",

Do you like it that dry?\n\nAdding more sweetness may balance the spice level.  \n\nOn the other hand, there will be some cloudiness added by back sweetening with honey.  It will eventually settle down as sediment, but you will want to plan for clearing that (either by using clearing agents, or by allowing it time)\n\nHoney can also have natural yeast in it. Using it to back sweeten can restart fermentation.  Although, if you’re already at 12%+, I don’t know how likely that is.",

I started using this into my third week of tret and oh boy, i had super dry skin!\n\nWhen you apply this, you get a cooling sensation and it blends into the skin very nicely and doesn’t leave you looking super shining. (You might not like this if you have dry skin and want some glow from your moisturizer.) This product has a hight amount of dimethicone and if you’re prone to clogged pores, I would say avoid this even though it claims to be “non-comedogenic”. The instructions on the box also say to massage until fully absorbed into the skin. \n\nNo pilling issues with sunscreens which was surprising because I was expecting it for some reason lol😆\n\nIt definitely kept my skin moisturized for good 5-6 hours and after that, my skin wasn’t like super dry but I still felt that I needed some hydration. What I observed though, I think this baby might have repaired my barrier which may have been a teeny bit compromised from tretinoin use at that time but I am not entirely sure. My skin now is no longer very dry. Either the product works really well or my retinization process is complete. I think this’ll work well for most skin types except maybe super dry and super oily folks. \n\n\n**Rating**: 4/5 Might repurchase only because I rarely repurchase stuff and always on the hunt for the next best thing. Also, the quantity you get is depressing😭😭 and the packaging was very inconvenient (feeble plastic tub container)",

My sister has an oily skin type and it works for her just fine so everyone’s different. I don’t think it gives me enough moisture since my skin still gets dried and flakey-looking around my nose and chin aside from breaking me out. It’s been 2-3 weeks on this thing so far. It also leaves my skin looking matte, so prolly better for oily skin. I like the dewy look better. \n\nBefore buying this, I had a trader joe’s gel moisturizer, that broke me out too since it had coconut. I used to have the cosrx snail mucin cream moisturizer and that seemed to work much better than either of these for me, and bonus points for that dewy look (if I recall, I think it did started breaking me out slightly towards the end of the jar likely bc of contamination). I’m done with gels. They don’t give me enough moisture. But also, too much moisture breaks me out so idk 😭. \n\nNow I’m looking for a light cream, not in a jar. Any suggestions?",

I went for something that I thought would be simple. 1 gallon carboy with 1.25kg of honey, 350g of blueberries and about 46g of raisins. \n\nBefore I started the brew I really was not aware of the differences between each yeast, I just thought I needed any wine yeast which brought me to Lalvin EC-1118. Which I now believe can potentially be too high a tolerance for a good mead. I also used Fermaid K nutrient on day 2 and day 5.\n\nAnyway more to my point now. I started the brew on the 16th of December with a gravity reading of what I believed to be 1.108, fast forward to today. 1st of January and the gravity reading is 0.906. That leaves my ABV up at 26%??? Which is way higher than the yeasts window of 18%?? I know this will be harsh tasting and it already smells a lot like a very dry wine. \n\nI’m curious to know not only if I’m correct on calculations but also what the best route to salvage is? Will potassium sorbate and a campden tab with a back sweeten stage help?\n\nThanks for any input at all.",

    "body": "Warning: Long post because I might be slightly insane. I think I put way too much thought into researching products than necessary...\n\nI’ve been curious about the hype surrounding peeling gels lately and began hunting through information on the interwebs where the general consensus amongst industry experts like [The Beauty Brains](http://thebeautybrains.com/2014/02/cure-natural-aqua-gel-look-at-the-label/) and [Colin’s Beauty Pages](http://colinsbeautypages.co.uk/skin-peeling-from-peeling-gels/) seems to be that they function on the mechanism of the acrylates/C10-30 and akyl acrylate crosspolymer (specifically referring to the formula of Cure aqua peeling gel) balling up as the water evaporates when rubbed again skin. \n\nHowever, the comment sections and many other blog posts insist that the gel *does* remove dead skin, many even insisting that their skin has never been better while using the gel. [This](http://www.labmuffin.com/2014/02/fact-check-friday-do-peeling-gels-really-peel-off-my-skin/) photo experiment reveals that gels still ball up when rubbed on a non-skin surface - albeit more slowly - and concludes that they function more as a physical exfoliant as the beads are gently rubbed, especially when mixed with oil on the skin. \n\nAnyway, I was doing my nails last night and used this [gel cuticle remover](http://www.amazon.com/Sally-Hansen-Cuticle-Remover-0-9oz/dp/B003VDGIU4/ref=sr_1_4_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1459262400&sr=8-4&keywords=gel+cuticle+remover)(not affiliate link) from Sally Hansen to remove my cuticles and noticed that the formula begins balling up when I am scraping my cuticles with a wooden stick. I tried a blob on my hand, began to rub it, and it balls up as well! It occurred to me that this could somehow be similar to peeling gels, so I looked up its ingredient list. \n\n\n**Sally Hansen gel cuticle remover:** Water, **Trisodium Phosphate**, **Polyethylene**, Butylene Glycol, Laureth 4, **Acrylates/C10 30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer**, **Urea**, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, **Sodium Hydroxide**, Disodium EDTA, Actinidia Chinensis (Kiwi) Fruit Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Extract, Melaleuca Altemifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, 1 2 Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Fragrance, Potassium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Green 3, Yellow 5 Lake\n\n\n**Cure natural aqua gel:** Water (activated hydrogen water^lol, non-acidic and purified), glycerin, **acrylates/C10-30, alkyl acrylate crosspolymer**, dicocodimonium, chloride, steartrimonium bromide, aloe barbadensis leaf extract, gingko biloba extract, rosmarinus officinalis/rosemary leaf extract, butylene glycol\n\n\nOk, so they both have acrylates/C10-30 and alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, which doesn’t mean anything yet. It just means that they both ball up. The cuticle remover also has trisodium phosphate and sodium hydroxide, which makes the formula very basic (~pH12-14) and breaks down dead skin (i.e. the cuticle) and urea which softens skin. The peeling gel does not have such elements to facilitate the breaking down of skin (imagine the horror! Us pH lifers will fall over catatonic). I checked out the ingredient lists of other cuticle removers, and the basic functioning formulas are to include either basic cleaning agents like potassium hydroxide/sodium hydroxide and/or gentler AHAs to exfoliate dead skin off. I also checked the ingredient lists of other peeling gels - they are all very different, but they all seem to contain the basic mechanism of some kind of plasticky compound that will ball up when the water evaporates. \n\n*I’m not sure what to make of all of this, but here are my questions:*\n\nWhy does my cuticle remover contain acrylates/C10-30 and alkyl acrylate crosspolymer when the basic compounds are enough to dissolve dead skin? \n\nIs it just to affect the consistency of the product? But there are so many other ways to make a gel formula without it balling up! \n\nOr does the balling up make consumers think that it’s all dead cuticle coming off instead of just *some* dead cuticle coming off? The cuticle gel does work - my cuticle comes off, but what I mean is if the balling-up action gives the *impression* that more gunk is being removed than not?\n\nJUST LIKE HOW THEY MAKE CONSUMERS THINK THAT ALL THE BALLS ARE THEIR SKIN COMING OFF WITH PEELING GELS?!\n\nI'm having an existential crisis, u gaiz. \n\nTo be fair, I do think that peeling gels probably work, but just not as advertised. I’ve personally not used one yet as I don’t need another product in my routine. I believe the ingredients just ball up, physically exfoliate the skin, and dead skin cells start to adhere to the balls. The stickiness of the balls is what differentiates peeling gels from regular scrubs, as scrubs essentially lift some dead skin and move it around the face and hence give the impression that they are less effective. Some peeling gels have fruit enzymes and AHAs that claim to exfoliate skin, so I can see how those have both physical and chemical mechanisms to make skin smoother. \n\nI don’t know, what was my question/concern again? I really would like people with a chemistry background to weigh in on this (I vaguely remember titration in high school and that's about it) It’s burning a hole in my brain. Am I completely off-base here, or does this absurdly random connection I made have any merit? People with peeling gel experience - what do you think? \n\n...\n\nI think I just spent my breakfast period attempting to debunk the peeling gel myth for the *nth+1* time by comparing it to a cuticle remover. Thank god I mostly work from home. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME.\n",

Because a lot of us here are more informed than the average consumer, products are often developed by look and feel. Test markets reveal all kinds of weird things consumers think makes a product *seem* like it is working more so than, if it actually is. \n\nI used to work for a cosmetics company that also had a shampoo line. People would try to return the shampoo all the time because there was \"not enough foam\" (p.s.-that's often a GOOD thing in a shampoo and was also in this case) because to them, more foam=more clean, even if that isn't the case. Later when said company was sold, new company made the shampoo more \"foamy\" because, people are dumb but, I am sure they sell more of it, so.\n\nAs for peeling gels, I personally think they are bogus but, I just don't use them.

Almost all cuticle gels and callus removing products are full of sodium hydroxide (which you listed as an ingredient). This is lye, and the pH is high, very high. As in, burn your skin off and kill you high pH. It's the exact same chemical used to emulsify fat and oils to create plain soaps. (I used to buy sodium hydroxide because I made soap.) the pH is so high that you use vinegar to counteract it if it gets on your skin. This is how it literally dissolves skin anywhere you put it. \n\nTd;dr : Don't put sodium hydroxide on your face! Sodium hydroxide is buffered to some extent in these products, but at the least it will harshly remove your moisture barrier as it emulsify/soaponifies it... At the worst, you will get a serious chemical burn and scarring on your fragile facial skin!",

An inch or two shorter than classic length (Aka mid butt length hair), High Porosity\n* **Hair concerns:** Split ends, normal amount of hairfall, prone to frizz, can look dry and damaged if I don't take care of it.\n* **Scalp type:** Normal, I think. Gets oily 2nd day night or 3rd day morning after hairwash\n* **Scalp concerns:** I don't use any product on my scalp but I feel like it's prone to build up and if I don't use an anti-dandruff shampoo every few washes, I get CCs on my forehead. Whatever causes my CCs are particularly invisible but my then derm insisted it was dandruff and following her regimen did get rid of the CCs without any skincare topical or prescription.\n* **Age/age range** \\- 25 to 35\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Current Haircare routine:**\n\n1. Pre Shampoo - Some homemade oil concoction (I add a lot of tiny oil bottles, I needed to empty, so I just mixed them all together.) or Plum Avocado Hair Mask\n2. Anti dandruff - Scalpe pro (I got L'oreal pure clay a while ago, to see if that will work instead of this, but haven't fully tested it out yet)\n3. Scalp shampoo - Alpecin Double Effect\n4. Length of the hair - Dove hydrating shampoo for curly hair (early days, haven't formed any impression yet.)\n5. Protein conditioner - Plum Olive and Macadamia Hair Mask (as and when necessary)\n6. Conditioner - Garnier Hair Food Papaya variant or Banana variant ( I like Papaya way better than banana, but neither of them are worth full price and Im still mourning the discontinuation of Matrix biolage purple cap)\n\nI've reviewed quite a few of the products I use, including Alpecin [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/vqot48/my_current_haircare_routine_reviews_reequil/), but Alpecin deserves its own review.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Climatic conditions under which the product was tested:** All. Summer, What passes for winter in the south, Monsoon.\n* **Usage timeline:** 1.5 years atleast. Almost done with my second bottle. And I've purchased it in Mid-September, this bottle has lasted me 8 months.\n* **Ingredient List:** [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n* **Price:** MRP 699 for 200 ml. Never seen this on discount. :(\n* **Texture, Consistency details:** Normal shampoo consistency, A blueish grey colour, so definitely added colour. You can see a hit of the colour and consistency [here](https://imgur.com/CVTsVhO.jpg)\n* **Fragrance:** HEAVILY fragranced. It's marketed towards Men, I think, so it smells of Men's aftershave.\n* **Usage:** I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply **on scalp only (Never below nape)**. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp. If I've oiled twice, I shampoo twice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Effect on hair issues and result of using the product:** Shiny frizz free hair, but definite loss of volume. If I had to use 1 word to describe it \"sleek\".\n* **Experience and thoughts in detail:**\n\n***Old Review, copied from my previous post and slightly edited***\n\nThis shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation.\n\nAlpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (obvious conflict of interests. I remember reading the study but can only find the [abstract](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17396054/) now) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit this for it. Maybe it'll work for others but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Updated Review***\n\nBarely anything to update if I'm honest. I stand by everything I said above, and they still hold true.\n\nAbout hairfall, I definitely don't think it helps. SO still thinks it helps, but acknowledges that he likes the user experience of it so much that he may be biased. Don't trust him.\n\nIn 2018, the UK Advertising Standards Authority ruled that caffeine shampoo Alpecin must no longer advertise that it can \"help to reduce hair loss\" as there was no adequate evidence to support the claim.  ***I definitely don't recommend buying this hoping it'll cure your hairfall issues.***\n\nThe main reason, I wanted to re-review this, is to post [this video](https://imgur.com/pt98TCe)\n\nI took these too [Pic 1](https://imgur.com/Sb7u13B.jpg), [Pic 2](https://imgur.com/fZMkSHb.jpg), but even though they are from back cam, quality is super bad. The video is a decent representation of what it looks like.  I'll update this post with better pics when I'm able to take them.\n\n**Other things to add**\n\n* The whole time I used Alpecin, I also used Scalpe pro. ie I used scalpe pro every few washes most of the year, but peak summer and winter or if I see signs of CCs, I used it every single wash and followed it up with Alpecin.  So every wash I used Alpecin but every few washes I used Scalpe pro + Alpecin.\n* u/santa96 has commented below that it didn't work for them, so I was running over possibilities. And one theory is the AD shampoo was actually stripping than I thought (I have used it alone, only for experimenting / testing purposes.  I originally thought it wasn't as stripping as most other AD shampoos but still drying compared to regular shampoos. Which is why I followed it up with Alpecin. But it could be that continued usage, caused dryness and the protein in the Alpecin was immediate damage control and THAT's why I love it so much.\n* This is just a hypothesis and is of now, untested. But my scalpe pro is almost over and I should know in a couple of months if I right.\n* Anyone for now, I obviously need to test it out under more conditions. This review is moot. I mean I still love it, but it needs to have more information for anyone else to judge if it'll work for you and I currently don't have that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ETA on 10/02/24: \n\nI had previously tagged this as OP-ED because I wanted to test out the following.\n\na) If I use Alpecin with no stripping products will it cause protein overload\n\nAnswer: No. It doesn't. 9 months later I still use Alpecin every single wash.\n\n* I've used it with the following variables affecting it\n   * Oiled hair\n   * Oiled hair + Clarifying shampoo (Loreal Pure Clay)\n   * Oiled hair + Normal shampoo (Loreal Hyaluronic acid)\n   * Unoiled hair\n   * Unoiled hair + Normal shampoo (Loreal Hyaluronic acid)\n\nand no protein overload. In fact except for a couple of months in the middle where I damaged my hair in beach vacations, my hair is way way way more healthier now than it was before.\n\nb) If I use it with a garden variety clarifying shampoo instead of a stripping anti-dandruff shampoo, will I still rave about it.\n\nAnswer: Yes. I would and I am. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Anything that you think others might find a con:** Price probably\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:** Holy Grail, Forever repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;",

My inexperience led me to make this with Billybee honey from Walmart (lol) but surprisingly its very delicious. perfect amount of tart and sweetness. We ensured fermentation was over then properly stabilized with potassium metabisulfite and potassium sorbate before back sweetening with wildflower honey and mashed up blueberry juice. I cant help but feel worried about bottle bombs once we start gifting these away. I made very sure to add exactly the right amounts of stabilizers and I have the bottles stored in a watertight cooler. I opened one bottle 24hrs after bottling and it had a very distinct pop. is this a bad indicator? \n\ncurrently fermenting peach mead, pure honey mead, and mulled winter spice mead.

[It's now finally up on the website](https://www.superdrug.com/search?text=calm+skin), meaning I can post about it without having to type out all the ingredients by hand ;)\n\nThe range has a night mask, a facial oil, a cleanser, a 'rescue gel', a hydrating spray and a 2-in-1 serum/moisturiser. They're all £2.99, and they're all on buy 1 get 1 half price. I bought 4 products - the mask, the rescue gel, the spray and the serum/moisturiser. I skipped on the cleanser, as it has SLS, and I couldn't be bothered with the oil at the time, especially since I wanted even numbers because of the offer. \n\nI also emailed Superdrug's customer support to enquire about the % of niacinamide, as I was worried it would be insufficient. After some back-and-forth, the customer service rep contacted the new product team and got this response:\n\n\"I cannot give out specific information regarding our formulations but I can confirm that the percentage of niacinamide is >5% in all of the below.\"\n\nThe below being the four products I was asking about, I imagine. (The oil doesn't have niacinamide, btw - it's only soluble in water)\n\nAnyway, nice!\n\nAfter a month or so of testing on and off, here's my mini reviews of the ones that I got:\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin De-Stress Refreshing Facial Spritz 100ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Cleansing-Lotion/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-De-Stress-Refreshing-Facial-Spritz-100ml/p/741142)**\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua, Glycerin, Niacinamide, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Trideceth-9, Betaine, Sodium Benzoate, Parfum, Potassium Sorbate, Bisabolol, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Citric Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid), Sodium Hydroxide, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** Moisturising spray? It's kind of weird. There's a slight oiliness to it, and a definite stickiness which is probably the large amount of glycerin. \n\n**Scent:** Definitely floral, vaguely chamomile-y\n\n**Overall Experience:** So, this is... a bit weird? I've mostly been using it as a hydrating toner. The difficulty is that it plays nice with some serums/moisturisers, but with others it seems to lead to bobbling. But I am rather bobble-prone, so it might just be me. Anyway, if I can get it to go on okay it definitely makes me feel more hydrated, particularly when I'm in the dry-aired office I keep complaining about. One day I was feeling kinda bored so I tried out the '7 skin' method by spraying it on every few minutes until it wouldn't absorb any more. I think I got to about six? It definitely hydrated my skin! And probably calmed it down as well. Is it a bad idea to put so much niacinamide on your skin? I don't know, but it's unlikely I'm going to be doing this on a regular basis.\n\n**Will I repurchase?** Well, it's a very cheap, very hydrating toner, so probably.\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin Hydrating 2in1 Serum & Moisturiser 50ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Face-Cream/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-Hydrating-2in1-Serum-%26-Moisturiser-50ml/p/741125)**\n\n**Ingredients:**Aqua, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Isopropyl Myristate, Niacinamide, ‭Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Polyacrylamide, Butylene Glycol, ‭Phenoxyethanol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Dimethiconol, Parfum, Betaine, Laureth-7, ‭Bisabolol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Alcohol, ‭Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid), Cimicifuga Racemosa ‭Root Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower ‭Extract, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, ‭Sodium Benzoate, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** So siliconey it's vaguely unnerving\n\n**Scent:** Heady floral, not unpleasant but kinda odd to find in this context. It's not at all chamomile-like? More of a tuberose, kinda luxe-y but definitely not one for people who don't like heavy scent\n\n**Overall Experience:** So, I think the reason it's described as a 2-in-1 is that there's SO MUCH SILICONE you really can't use much else with it or it will turn into a peeling gel, which is what it did to me several times. I think it might be a good thing for me in the summer when I need something very light, but right now I want to use a heavier, more wintery moisturiser and to layer stuff and this isn't meant for that at allll\n\n**Will I repurchase?** I don't know, let me try it out in the summer and see if I can find a sunscreen that'll play nice with it.\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin Rescue Gel 15ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Cleansing-Lotion/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-Rescue-Gel-15ml/p/741146)**\n\n**Ingredients:**Aqua, Alcohol Denat., Niacinamide, Citric Acid, Glycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Salicylic Acid, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Trideceth-9, Sodium Benzoate, Parfum, Bisabolol, Potassium Sorbate, Allantoin, Alcohol, Propylene Glycol, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile)Flower Extract, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** Gel\n\n**Scent:** Alcohol\n\n**Overall Experience:** Okay, so in the cold light of day I should have looked at that ingredient list and run screaming. Why are they trying to combine salicylic acid (works best at pH <3.5) and niacinamide (becomes irritating at pH<4.5)? Why is the fourth ingredient citric acid? Did putting on an alcohol gel ever help a single spot?\nI did actually try this a couple of times and it did nothing much, which honestly is better than I should have expected, by rights it should have made my face fall off.\n\n**Will I repurchase?** Nope\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin Overnight Face Mask 100ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Cleansing-Lotion/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-Overnight-Face-Mask-100ml/p/741143)**\n\n**Ingredients:**Aqua, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, ‭Dimethicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, Prunus ‭Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, ‭Phenoxyethanol, Polyacrylamide, Parfum, Sodium ‭Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Betaine, ‭Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Isohexadecane, C13-14 ‭Isoparaffin, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 80, Bisabolol, ‭Ethylhexylglycerin, Alcohol, Laureth-7, Sodium Hyaluronate ‭(Hyaluronic Acid), Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Sorbitan ‭Oleate, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, ‭Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium ‭Benzoate, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** Gloop.

It goes on nicely even over other stuff (eg Scinic Honey AIO), is nice and occlusive, smells okay and - the kicker - actually leaves my skin looking better in the morning, with red marks noticeably diminished. My only complaint is that it's tiny, considering you'll want to use a hefty glop of the stuff.\n\n**Will I repurchase?** Almost certainly",

Why are they trying to combine salicylic acid (works best at pH <3.5) and niacinamide (becomes irritating at pH<4.5)? Why is the fourth ingredient citric acid? Did putting on an alcohol gel ever help a single spot? \n\nSalicylic acid isn't just a chemical exfoliant, it's also anti-inflammatory, which would make it calming on inflammation. Niacinamide isn't necessarily irritating in higher pH products, otherwise the vast majority of skincare products with niacinamide would be irritating, since most products aren't formulated at <pH 4.5. Alcohol denat. is a penetration enhancer and many people don't have issues with alcohol in skincare, particularly if their skin is in good condition to begin with and/or if they don't have alcohol in every single product. Citric acid is a pH adjuster. It's almost impossible just by looking at an ingredient list to be able to talk at length about the overall formula, and none of these ingredients in a normal product are 'face falling off' level of concern.

    "body": "Hello fellow kiwis. I'm sure I'm not the only one who has been on this subreddit for a while, exasperated and disheartened at the lack of products we have access to. I'm going to share a bit of information about the products I have found available in supermarkets and nationwide stores, due to my obsession with poring through skincare aisles.\n\n**BHAs:**\n\n[Clean & Clear Advantage Fast Clearing Spot Gel 10g](http://www.thewarehouse.co.nz/red/catalog/product/Clean-%26-Clear-Advantage-Fast-Clearing-Spot-Gel-10g?SKU=1336248): Available at the Warehouse for $10.99. Countdown doesn't carry this on its own, it sells the combined pack of 4 kit with a cleanser + whatever else. 10g seems small but it has lasted me ages! I used it as a nightly or twice daily spot treatment, and I put it on my T zone where my SFs are. It doesn't burn or anything.\n\nIngredients\n\nActive ingredient: **salicylic acid** 2%-acne medication. Inactive ingredients: alcohol, ammonium hydroxide, benzalkonium chloride, butylene glycol, c12-15 alkyl lactate, c13-14 isoparaffin, capryloyl glycine, cedrus atlantica bark extract, cetyl lactate, cinnamomum zeylanicum bark extract, cocamidopropyl pg-dimonium chloride phosphate, cyclopentasiloxane, dehydroxanthan gum, denatonium benzoate, fragrance, glycerin, hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel)\n\nClearasil Ultra - Rapid Action Pads. 65 Pads.\nThese are available at countdown. I can't remember the exact price but they're around $12-15. A few downsides - there is a lot of liquid in this pot and it leaked when I was travelling, so I had to keep it in a plastic bag. It does mean though that you could probably use half a pad, and use any excess liquid in the bottom with cotton pads. This kind of stings when it goes on, and the pads are textured for some reason so it's best to pat your face with them. \n\nIngredients\n\nActive Ingredients: **Salicylic Acid** (2%) (Purpose: Acne medication) Inactive Ingredients: Water, Alcohol Denatured, Isoceteth 20, Hydrogen Peroxide, Fragrance, Sodium Hydroxide, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Propylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Dipropylene Glycol, Methylparaben, EDTA (Ethylenediamine-Tetra-Acetic Acid), Potassium Sorbate, Butylparaben, Ethylparaben, Propylparaben\n\nThese both have denatured alcohol in them, so might not be ideal for those are sensitive to that.\n\n**AHA**\n\nThis is the reason I made this post! This is the first thing I have found with an AHA in it. I really want to try the St Ives pads but ordering them online is a mission. The only AHA I can get my hands on is lactic acid in the form of milk and yoghurt, but I'm not keen on putting those on my face every night. I found these today:\n\n[Skinfood Facial Cleansing Wipes](http://www.skinfood.co.nz/skin-care/all-products/facial-cleansing-wipes.html) - $10.19 online, or I found them in countdown for approximately the same, or $8.90 on special with onecard today anyway. Bloody good ingredient list if I don't say so myself. I tried one tonight and they are very soft, and big. 25 in a pack. I am not sure whether this contains a good concentration of AHA, but it is an option.\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Glycerine Cocoglucoside, Aloe Vera Extract Chamomile Extract, **Lactic Acid**, Methylisothiazolinone, Methylchloroisothiazolinone.\n\n**Clay Mask**\n\n[Freeman Avocado & Oatmeal Facial Clay Mask](http://www.freemanbeauty.com/product/avocado-oatmeal-facial-clay-mask)\n\nDon't get excited about the price on that website - I found this in farmers and if I remember correctly it was about $20 - but definitely worth it. They have different kinds of masks, I think I remember seeing the Pomegranate Facial Revealing Peel-Off Mask and one other one, and they also have them all in sample packets for about $2. This one comes out green, smells lovely, and dries really quickly. \n\n**Things that I use, and other info**\n\nBenzac AC in a white tube is probably the cheapest **benzoyl peroxide** product - the 5% one I've seen in Countdown and Pak'n'Save, but Pharmacies have it in 2.5% and 10% as well. I got the 5% one and I use it very very sparingly as a spot treatment on my hormonal acne when it flares up, and it does a good job of clearing it, although I wish I had found the 2.5% first. It is about $20 in Countdown. Use too much though and you'll risk flakiness and redness like I got. I would recommend not making this a habit, only a spot treatment if necessary. Clearasil also does a benzoyl peroxide cream as well, which I have seen in countdown.\n\nI also use Cetaphil Gentle Skin **Cleanser** which is in countdown and farmers, it doesn't dry my skin out or give it a tight feeling. I got the biggest size bottle and it will last me AGES. Cetaphil moisturiser isn't my favourite though - it leaves quite a waxy feeling on my skin.\n\nI use Aveeno SPF 30 **moisturiser** which is in all supermarkets, which is a chemical sunscreen. This stings my face when I have irritated my skin too much though, and sometimes pills on my sin. I have a tonne of Neutrogena SPF 50/70/80/100 chemical sunscreens that I use on my face as well, which are good, albeit make me very shiny. \n\nI found jojoba **oil** in Farmers - there are two sizes, and both are fairly expensive - I think I bought the 30ml one for around $30? The pumps squirt out the oil really inefficiently. I'm not sure if I'll buy it again. They have some argan oil there as well - only one brand though and it is expensive. If you really want to buy oils, I recommend checking out Iherb, linked to further down in the post.\n\nI bought the Olay Regenerist vibrating brush face cleanser thing from the warehouse for $35.99. I've used it about three times cautiously. I have been told by someone on this sub that it causes microtears in the skin due to the way it vibrates. When using it on my face I do notice that it kind of moves my skin in different directions, so I can see how it might be a bit rough and cause abrasions. I'm not sure I want to risk microtears so I might not use it on my face any more.\n\nI bought [DermaLab Super Hydrating Moisturiser](http://www.dermalab.co.nz/moisturiser/) from farmers and love it.\n\nThe Warehouse has huge bulk packs of cotton pads and balls for like $3. \n\nYou can find CeraVE on Amazon, but I haven't given that a try yet. Some places don't ship to NZ, PM me/leave a comment if you want to order some and I will find my bookmark of the ones that ship to NZ.\n\n\n**Websites that ship to NZ:**\n\n[Paula's Choice no longer has a NZ site, but does ship to NZ for a flat rate of $15US, arriving in about 8 days](http://www.paulaschoice.com). They regularly have specials and discounts. PM me if you are a new purchaser who would like $10 off your first purchase. PC usually has discount codes that give 20% off - PRPAULA20 currently works as of May 2014.\n\n[Garden of Wisdom](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/mandelicacids.html) ships to NZ, as well as [Silk Naturals](http://host.silknaturals.com/creb/toners-c-107_122.html). Iherb has a [LOT](http://www.iherb.com/search?kw=aha&x=0&y=0#p=1), like that [Aztec Clay](http://www.iherb.com/Aztec-Secret-Indian-Healing-Clay-1-lb-454-g/29363#p=1&oos=1&disc=0&lc=en-US&w=st%20ives&rc=22&sr=null&ic=2) and even raw ACV, but is lacking certain brands like St Ives. Not sure about shipping costs or times for any of these sites. It's not as ideal as buying things instore, but it's there if you want certain things.\n\nI have used [Iherb](http://www.iherb.com/) twice now and it is great. Use the search bar for recommendations as to what to buy from there. Choose the $8 shipping and it will arrive in about a week. This is where you should go if you are looking for **cheap AHAs** - look for the Alpha Hydrox brand. It also has a tonne of cheap ELF products, as well as Raw Apple Cider Vinegar, Aquaphor, Aztec Clay Mask, Mint Julep Mask, Coconut oil, etc.\n\nPLEASE add your own products that you use! I want to have a good idea of what works for people and what we have in NZ. \n",

And although I try to be aware and work on it...sugar is a nice option as it slowly dissolves as it's being massaged (making it pretty foolproof for this fool). \n\nWhen my favorite sugar scrub/mask from Skinfood was discontinued last year I was really bummed. Finding that coconut sugar dream was a surprise in that it was just the right amount of exfoliation mixed with a rather nourishing formulation.\n\nBut, the team over at Beauty Within came through with their recommendation of the Fresh Sugar Strawberry Exfoliating Face Wash!\n\nThis product acts very similar to my long lost love in that it applies with a slight thickness and weight. The amount of scrubbing action can be customized by applying more or less water to the skin before the scrub.\n\nAfter about 15-30 seconds of massaging the sugar breaks down into a wonderful sugary face wash...although there is no lather here (I found myself following this up with my regular water based cleanser).\n\nThe result for me has been super smooth, soft, and resurfaced skin. The Fresh Sugar Strawberry Exfoliating Face Wash has helped to reduce some texture issues and seems to allow other products in my routine (toner/essence/serum) to absorb a bit more thoroughly.\n\nI’m so happy to have found this product and the strawberry/cream soda scent doesn't hurt either. This is one that I will be repurchasing and keeping in my routine for the foreseeable future.\n\nI can’t wait to try out the other offerings from Fresh. Let me know what some of your favorites are!\n\nFull Ingredients List: Glycerin, Sucrose, Butylene Glycol, Fragaria Vesca (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Ribes Nigrum (Black Currant) Fruit Extract, Zea Mays (Corn) Starch, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Fragaria Ananassa (Strawberry) Fruit Juice, Sapindus Mukorossi Peel Extract, Tocopherol, Parfum (Fragrance), Water, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, BHT, Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Limonene, Citral, Benzyl Alcohol, Linalool\n\nWhere To Buy ($33.00 USD - Sephora - 125ml): [https://www.sephora.com/product/sugar-strawberry-exfoliating-face-wash-P445827?icid2=products%20grid:p445827&skuId=2223592](https://www.sephora.com/product/sugar-strawberry-exfoliating-face-wash-P445827?icid2=products%20grid:p445827&skuId=2223592) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fjp7pya5p4q51.jpg?width=5307&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=294c10bd4605c96bd8b8f226c2450c3e7c911289",

It was like a cup of real honey, and the bamboo all settled to the bottom, and you’d stir it up and it made my face so incredibly smooth. Every current product on the market just doesn’t look close, but if anyone has found a dupe I’d love to hear about it!",

    "body": "It has come to my attention that a lot of you want to have sex with my wife Tingyun. That is bad because she is my wife. I don't want to see any of you near my wife, especially when she's pregnant. If any of you try to have sex with my wife, I will kill you with my musket (yes it's for home defense.) To keep you horny bastards away from my wife, I have created a device for you all to fuck to get essentially, what is the same experience as fucking Tingyun.\n\nNote that Tingyun is my loyal wife of 3 years, and she is pregnant with my child. And in foxian culture, cheating is seen as not just scandalous, but pure evil and punishable by death. And she is very much that traditional woman in that regard. \n\nSo, here's what you're gonna need. \nMashed potatoes, flour, bananas, Calcium disodium, Sodium benzoate, Potassium sorbate, 2 Wendy's cups (no other will do), spray paint (light pink, red, gold), strawberry flavored condoms, duct tape, hot glue, a knife, and a taxidermy fox. \n\nFirst, take the taxidermy fox and cut off the tail. \n\nSecond, spray paint the tail pink and the tip red. \n\nThird, take the cup and cup out the bottom. \n\nFourth, put the condom over the hole and pull it through. \n\nFifth, duct tape the condom to the cup and put the hot glue on for extra security, if needed. \n\nSixth, gluegule the tail on the sofe on the cup, the top in the directionthe thr condom opening. \n\nSeventh, make the mashed potatoes, and add flour to stiffen it up as it cools. When completely cool, mix in the bananas.\n\nEighth, mix in the Calcium disodium Sodium benzoate and Potassium sorbate to the mashed potatoes to preserve the potatoe mixture. \n\nNinth, add the potato mixture to the cup and pull the condom to the top. \n\nTenth, hot glue the lid on to the cup. \n\nYou have now made the Tingyun fleshlight. If you wouldn't even better experience, spray the gold spray paint in the extra cup and huff it because you're only gonna be able to have sex with my wife in your high dreams.\n\nThis should help quell you horny bastards because if i see another one of you get near my wife with you dick in you hand, you're gonna learn about my newest invention I like to call pineapple shot. \n\n(Also, happy new years buddies.)",
