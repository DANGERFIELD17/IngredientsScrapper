Obviously food products were targets, but also she would suck on your toothbrush if it was where she could find it. Had to warn guests not to bring any gum or mints in their purses because she would stalk them like a wild cat and go PRIMAL on any purse with peppermint flavor inside. She chewed up a tube of toothpaste once and got pretty sick, barfing up rainbow colored Aquafresh and Meow Mix all over the house... and then licking it back up because it was still minty.",

It's tail got about as thick as a roll of breakfast sausage, and it sprinted around the house as fast as it could.  After that, it would do whatever it could to get any mint it could smell. It ruined several people's purses; many packages of orbit; and after it found out toothpaste was mint flavored, we had to keep our toothpaste in a drawer.\n\n It was a good cat.  It also literally went to the farm in it's waning years.  I had pictures to prove it at one point.",

(I fill it to about an inch and a half below the top)\n\nA few shakes of cinnamon powder. (cinnamon sticks if you wanna get fancy)\n\nAs many drops of essential oil as you like. I use peppermint oil, balsam fir needle, or orange oil.\n\nIf you don't have essential oils and don't want to buy any, cinnamon alone smells really great and festive as well!\n\nYou can also add sliced fruit like apples or oranges if you wanna go all out. \n\nEnjoy feeling like a festive ass adult who's killin it at having your shit together and making your house smell like Christmas.",

    "body": "OR Nurse here.  This is kind of a long one...\n\nI was taking call one night, and woke up at two in the morning for a \"general surgery\" call.  Pretty vague, but at the time, I lived in a town that had large populations of young military guys and avid meth users, so late-night emergencies were common.\n\nGot to the hospital, where a few more details awaited me -- \"Perirectal abscess.\"  For the uninitiated, this means that somewhere in the immediate vicinity of the asshole, there was a pocket of pus that needed draining.  Needless to say our entire crew was less than thrilled.\n\nI went down to the Emergency Room to transport the patient, and the only thing the ER nurse said as she handed me the chart was \"Have fun with this one.\" Amongst healthcare professionals, vague statements like that are a bad sign. \n\nMy patient was a 314lb Native American woman who barely fit on the stretcher I was transporting her on. She was rolling frantically side to side and moaning in pain, pulling at her clothes and muttering Hail Mary's.  I could barely get her name out of her after a few minutes of questioning, so after I confirmed her identity and what we were working on, I figured it was best just to get her to the anesthesiologist so we could knock her out and get this circus started.  \n\nShe continued her theatrics the entire ten-minute ride to the O.R., nearly falling off the surgical table as we were trying to put her under anesthetic.  We see patients like this a lot, though, chronic drug abusers who don't handle pain well and who have used so many drugs that even increased levels of pain medication don't touch simply because of high tolerance levels.  \n\nIt should be noted, tonight's surgical team was not exactly wet behind the ears.  I'd been working in healthcare for several years already, mostly psych and medical settings.  I've watched an 88-year-old man tear a 1\"-diameter catheter balloon out of his penis while screaming \"You'll never make me talk!\".  I've been attacked by an HIV-positive neo-Nazi.  I've seen some shit.  The other nurse had been in the OR as a trauma specialist for over ten years; the anesthesiologist had done residency at a Level 1 trauma center, or as we call them, \"Knife and Gun Clubs\".  The surgeon was ex-Army, and averaged about eight words and two facial expressions a week.  None of us expected what was about to happen next.\n\nWe got the lady off to sleep, put her into the stirrups, and I began washing off the rectal area.  It was red and inflamed, a little bit of pus was seeping through, but it was all pretty standard. Her chart had noted that she'd been injecting IV drugs through her perineum, so this was obviously an infection from dirty needles or bad drugs, but overall, it didn't seem to warrant her repeated cries of \"Oh Jesus, kill me now.\"\n\nThe surgeon steps up with a scalpel, sinks just the tip in, and at the exact same moment, the patient had a muscle twitch in her diaphragm, and just like that, all hell broke loose. \n\nUnbeknownst to us, the infection had actually tunneled nearly a foot into her abdomen, creating a vast cavern full of pus, rotten tissue, and fecal matter that had seeped outside of her colon.  This godforsaken mixture came rocketing out of that little incision like we were recreating the funeral scene from Jane Austen's \"Mafia!\".  \n\nWe all wear waterproof gowns, face masks, gloves, hats, the works -- all of which were as helpful was rainboots against a firehose.  The bed was in the middle of the room, an easy seven feet from the nearest wall, but by the time we were done, I was still finding bits of rotten flesh pasted against the back wall.  As the surgeon continued to advance his blade, the torrent just continued.  The patient kept seizing against the ventilator (not uncommon in surgery), and with every muscle contraction, she shot more of this brackish gray-brown fluid out onto the floor until, within minutes, it was seeping into the other nurse's shoes. \n\nI was nearly twelve feet away, jaw dropped open within my surgical mask, watching the second nurse dry-heaving and the surgeon standing on tip-toes to keep this stuff from soaking his socks any further. The smell hit them first. \"Oh god, I just threw up in my mask!\"  The other nurse was out, she tore off her mask and sprinted out of the room, shoulders still heaving.   Then it hit me, mouth still wide open, not able to believe the volume of fluid this woman's body contained.  It was like getting a great big bite of the despair and apathy that permeated this woman's life.  I couldn't fucking breath, my lungs simply refused to pull anymore of that stuff in.  The anesthesiologist went down next, an ex-NCAA D1 tailback, his six-foot-two frame shaking as he threw open the door to the OR suite in an attempt to get more air in, letting me glimpse the second nurse still throwing up in the sinks outside the door.  Another geyser of pus splashed across the front of the surgeon.  The YouTube clip of \"David at the dentist\" keeps playing in my head -- \"Is this real life?\"\n\nIn all operating rooms, everywhere in the world, regardless of socialized or privatized, secular or religious, big or small, there is one thing the same:  Somewhere, there is a bottle of peppermint concentrate.  Everyone in the department knows where it is, everyone knows what it is for, and everyone prays to their gods they never have to use it.  In times like this, we rub it on the inside of our masks to keep the outside smells at bay long enough to finish the procedure and shower off.\n\nI sprinted to the our central supply, ripping open the drawer where this vial of ambrosia was kept, and was greeted by -- an empty fucking box.  The bottle had been emptied and not replaced.  Somewhere out there was a godless bastard who had used the last of the peppermint oil, and not replaced a single fucking drop of it.  To this day, if I figure out who it was, I'll kill them with my bare hands, but not before cramming their head up the colon of every last meth user I can find, just so we're even.\n\nI darted back into the room with the next best thing I can find -- a vial of Mastisol, which is an adhesive rub we use sometimes for bandaging.  It's not as good as peppermint, but considering that over one-third of the floor was now thoroughly coated in what could easily be mistaken for a combination of bovine after-birth and maple syrup, we were out of options.  \n\nI started rubbing as much of the Mastisol as I could get on the inside of my mask, just glad to be smelling anything except whatever slimy demon spawn we'd just cut out of this woman.  The anesthesiologist grabbed the vial next, dowsing the front of his mask in it so he could stand next to his machines long enough to make sure this woman didn't die on the table.  It wasn't until later that we realized that Mastisol can give you a mild high from huffing it like this, but in retrospect, that's probably what got us through.  \n\nBy this time, the smell had permeated out of our OR suite, and down the forty-foot hallway to the front desk, where the other nurse still sat, eyes bloodshot and watery, clenching her stomach desperately.  Our suite looked like the underground river of ooze from Ghostbusters II, except dirty.  Oh so dirty.\n\nI stepped back into the OR suite, not wanting to leave the surgeon by himself in case he genuinely needed help.  It was like one of those overly-artistic representations of a zombie apocalypse you see on fan-forums.  Here's this one guy, in blue surgical garb, standing nearly ankle deep in lumps of dead tissue, fecal matter, and several liters of syrupy infection.  He was performing surgery in the swamps of Dagobah, except the swamps had just come out of this woman's ass and there was no Yoda.  He and I didn't say a word for the next ten minutes as he scraped the inside of the abscess until all the dead tissue was out, the front of his gown a gruesome mixture of brown and red, his eyes squinted against the stinging vapors originating directly in front of him.  I finished my required paperwork as quickly as I could, helped him stuff the recently-vacated opening full of gauze, taped this woman's buttocks closed to hold the dressing for as long as possible, woke her up, and immediately shipped off to the recovery ward. \n\nUntil then, I'd only heard of \"alcohol showers.\"  Turns out 70% isopropyl alcohol is about the only thing that can even touch a scent like that once its soaked into your skin.  It takes four or five bottles to get really clean, but it's worth it.  It's probably the only scenario I can honestly endorse drinking a little of it, too.\n\nAs we left the locker room, the surgeon and I looked at each other, and he said the only negative sentence I heard him utter in two and a half years of working together:\n\n\"That was bad.\"\n\nThe next morning the entire department (a fairly large floor within the hospital) still smelled.  The housekeepers told me later that it took them nearly an hour to suction up all of the fluid and debris left behind.  The OR suite itself was closed off and quarantined for two more days just to let the smell finally clear out.\n\nI laugh now when I hear new recruits to healthcare talk about the worst thing they've seen.  You ain't seen shit, kid.\n\ntl;dr Don't shoot IV drugs into your taint.",

        "body": "OR Nurse here.  This is kind of a long one...\n\nI was taking call one night, and woke up at two in the morning for a \"general surgery\" call.  Pretty vague, but at the time, I lived in a town that had large populations of young military guys and avid meth users, so late-night emergencies were common.\n\nGot to the hospital, where a few more details awaited me -- \"Perirectal abscess.\"  For the uninitiated, this means that somewhere in the immediate vicinity of the asshole, there was a pocket of pus that needed draining.  Needless to say our entire crew was less than thrilled.\n\nI went down to the Emergency Room to transport the patient, and the only thing the ER nurse said as she handed me the chart was \"Have fun with this one.\" Amongst healthcare professionals, vague statements like that are a bad sign. \n\nMy patient was a 314lb Native American woman who barely fit on the stretcher I was transporting her on. She was rolling frantically side to side and moaning in pain, pulling at her clothes and muttering Hail Mary's.  I could barely get her name out of her after a few minutes of questioning, so after I confirmed her identity and what we were working on, I figured it was best just to get her to the anesthesiologist so we could knock her out and get this circus started.  \n\nShe continued her theatrics the entire ten-minute ride to the O.R., nearly falling off the surgical table as we were trying to put her under anesthetic.  We see patients like this a lot, though, chronic drug abusers who don't handle pain well and who have used so many drugs that even increased levels of pain medication don't touch simply because of high tolerance levels.  \n\nIt should be noted, tonight's surgical team was not exactly wet behind the ears.  I'd been working in healthcare for several years already, mostly psych and medical settings.  I've watched an 88-year-old man tear a 1\"-diameter catheter balloon out of his penis while screaming \"You'll never make me talk!\".  I've been attacked by an HIV-positive neo-Nazi.  I've seen some shit.  The other nurse had been in the OR as a trauma specialist for over ten years; the anesthesiologist had done residency at a Level 1 trauma center, or as we call them, \"Knife and Gun Clubs\".  The surgeon was ex-Army, and averaged about eight words and two facial expressions a week.  None of us expected what was about to happen next.\n\nWe got the lady off to sleep, put her into the stirrups, and I began washing off the rectal area.  It was red and inflamed, a little bit of pus was seeping through, but it was all pretty standard. Her chart had noted that she'd been injecting IV drugs through her perineum, so this was obviously an infection from dirty needles or bad drugs, but overall, it didn't seem to warrant her repeated cries of \"Oh Jesus, kill me now.\"\n\nThe surgeon steps up with a scalpel, sinks just the tip in, and at the exact same moment, the patient had a muscle twitch in her diaphragm, and just like that, all hell broke loose. \n\nUnbeknownst to us, the infection had actually tunneled nearly a foot into her abdomen, creating a vast cavern full of pus, rotten tissue, and fecal matter that had seeped outside of her colon.  This godforsaken mixture came rocketing out of that little incision like we were recreating the funeral scene from Jane Austen's \"Mafia!\".  \n\nWe all wear waterproof gowns, face masks, gloves, hats, the works -- all of which were as helpful was rainboots against a firehose.

It's been commented on that my hair looks thicker and healthier, and none of the potential side effects of the other stuff.\n\nEdit - to all those asking:\nI use \"Shea Moisture - Raw Shea Butter (not coconut oil) Moisture Retention Shampoo\" from Amazon and about 20-30ml of peppermint oil for the 350ml bottle. Tbh I do it by scent and how it feels, too much will burn, but you want to feel it tingle - so I do i put in a small amount and mix it, if it doesn't do anything at all I'll add a couple more drops to the bottle for next time. The longer it's left on the better but I try for 2-3 minutes in a quick morning shower, so at the weekend if I've got time I'll do about 10-15.\nThe Shea butter, and the lack of SLS also go a long way to help the scalp and the hair.\nHope it helps.",

Posted on my birthcenter mom group looking for advice and was told to try essential oils after I had tried pretty much everything else I could. Yes, I actaully listened to them: I didn't know what I was walking into and it was my first experience hearing of them. I needed relief. \n\nThe ones that i was told to use were lemon and peppermint oil. I was supposed to put some of that on a cotton ball and just stick it up there and it was *supposedly* supposed to calm the inflammation and pain.\n\nWell I tried it and **SON OF A BITCH** have you ever felt the same sensation as 1,000 bees stinging your asshole at the same time, inside and out? I was HOWLING. My asshole and entire ass was red and blotchy. Tears were streaming down my face. I was laying in a puddle of sweat, paralyzed on the bathroom floor wondering what I had done to God to piss him off so bad that he felt the need to punish my asshole like this.\n\nThis shit lasted for **over an hour** and the entire time I was seriously toying with the idea of going to the emergency room and spreading my cheeks on display for them so they could let me know if my asshole was literally burning off. \n\nThe pain eventually went away, but my trauma didn't. I haven't joined a mom group since. \n\nAnytime someone even *attempts* to talk to me about essential oils all I say is, \"I stay far away from those. They make my asshole burn.\"\n\nAnd that's that. \n\n\nEdit: well, my first gold and most upvoted post is for an in-depth description about how I destroyed my asshole. So that's an accomplishment. For your viewing pleasure, I trifled through my medicine closet and found the [lemon oil](http://imgur.com/gallery/S48kCcv), but it looks like I lost the peppermint when I moved.\n\nYes guys, I had tried Witch hazel and hydrocortisone cream but really nothing was helping to the point that I needed and I was desperate.  I read the instructions to dilute it, but the person I got it from said to ignore those (**thanks** *you dirty bitch*) and after making this post I realised it did in fact come from a MLM. \n\nSevere desperation for relief, *I couldn't even sit down ya'll*, mixed with late term pregnancy brain really failed my chocolate starfish on this one.

I felt around with eyes closed for water (also a bad idea) poured it all over my eye and waited till the burning and pain stopped. \nSo bot only did I see my date the next day with a chalazion but also with a bright red irritated eye. Also I still CANNOT stand lavender oil to this day. \n\nProtip: NEVER USE WATER! if you need to wash oil off yourself use milk, whole milk, oil and water don't mix so it's not going to help, oil sticks to the fats in the milk and will wash it away.

Peppermint oil is a very strong smell and the mice can't handle its intensity. Eventually, I didn't even have to use the cotton balls anymore because the mice had learned to avoid my apartment!

        "body": "I have pet mice and can give you a few tips. You can do whatever you wish with this info (like kill them, trap and set them free, etc). \n\n* Heat peanut butter in a microwave (5 seconds, stir, 5 seconds, stir) until it's soft. Then mash up some low sugar type cereals like rice krispies or corn chex, and mix them together. Peanut butter is a mouse favorite and the cereal chunks keep them from choking. \n\n* Mice also like almonds. Buy some no salt, slivered almonds and spread them around (near/in your poison) or put them on your trap. \n\n* Mice love the dark during the day. If you're hunting down a mouse, do it at night. Mice are blind (they see up to about 4 feet tops) and so they see better at night. This means you need to put all your traps up on the wall. \n\n* Mice mark their territory and pee a smell that is very much like popcorn (if I pick my mouse up too quickly he will produce a liquid that smells just like a movie theater). Their pee can also smell of ammonia because it contains ammonia. If you smell a bunch of popcorn in your house and you haven't made any recently, that's is where they poop/pee. They do not potty near their nest if they can help it. Mice can't really hold it but they generally refuse to potty near in their nest.\n\n* Mice need to eat every few hours so they will find food at night and bring it back to their nest. If you find a large stash of nuts or cereal (or most likely empty shells of seeds) in your house, you know they are close by. They will eat just about anything (mostly seeds and nuts and grains) so make sure your food is sealed tightly. You could always use this knowledge to your advantage and spread black sunflower seeds around your house and then look for the shells. They are very messy eaters.\n\n*Mice need fresh water quite often. They can't eat too much salt or they will dehydrate and die. They also can't handle any citrus, hot peppers or mint. Set some traps around where they could be getting water. \n\n* My  mice love toilet paper, cloth, yarn, dirt or sand, grass and many other soft things to burrow into and make a nest.\n\n* Their teeth continue to grow so they must chew. If they don't, their teeth will prevent them from eating and they will die. Lucky for them, your house has plenty of things to chew. \n\n* Mice have a great sense of smell because they can't see very well. They aren't very trustful of humans (especially wild or older mice) and so your smell will tell them you're nearby. They also use their nose to find food and water. This could mean your poison isn't working because it smells bad.\n\n* Mice can have babies in a very short amount of time (I forget the actual number but it's something less than 2 months). They also can have up to 14 at a time. This means if you leave them alone, you will have hundreds of mice in a short amount of time. The babies open their eyes around 9 weeks old.\n\n* They can find anywhere their skull can. We learned this the funny way when we cut a tiny hole (we thought it was big enough) in a cardboard box and our 2 year old, really overweight mouse fit through it (we think he's overweight because he is alone and during winter they really stock up. Now he has loose skin and it's still pretty funny watching him fit through tiny  holes). It was hilarious watching him. \n\nI currently have one pet mouse and we just discovered a mouse in our shed. I haven't decided what to do about it yet (we just discovered a hole in our bird feed yesterday). It's a tough decision what to to with a mouse, not only because I have them as pets and don't want to kill them, but I also don't want to take them away from their families. Mice live together in nests because it's easier to do it as a society (the mice don't associate with other families, and males will fight to the death unless they were raised together). So I was originally planning to live trap and drive them a few miles away but I don't want it to die because it's alone (girl mice will often become depressed and die from loneliness in captivity). Personally if it's in your house and eating your food, this can make you pretty sick, and I would bring out the traps. If it's in a barn or something without wiring, I would try OP's advice and soak some cotton balls in peppermint, or look for alternatives. \n\nHopefully I helped you narrow down where they are living (close to water, food, and things to use as nests) and you can find their general area (perhaps video tape them at night to see where they come out of/go into). Make sure you look for poop and keep a nose out for the smell of popcorn near the walls (again mice are blind and hug tightly to walls when they search for food and water and pee/poop  along the way).",

What do you think is going to attract the mice, dummy? That's right. Open food on the floor where they can get to it.\n\nSolution:\nWhat you'll need:\n-Tracking powder. The mice run into this and ingest it when they clean themselves.\n-Copper coated steel wool. Mice can chew right through regular steel wool. Copper coated is thicker and they don't like the taste.\n-Mouse traps. Sticky and mechanical. (get Victor brand)\n\nHow to use.\nFind mouse entrance/exit holes (under sinks, along walls). You can usually locate them by \"rub marks\" which are dark greasy marks left from their constant traffic.\n\nSpray a good amount of tracking powder into the holes using a squeeze bulb. You can also toss some poison blocks in there if the hole's big enough. Stuff hole with copper coated steel wool.\n\nSet traps along baseboards. The sticky kind fold up into tents. Put a dollop of peanut butter right in the middle and stick them along the edge by corners (especially under the sink and by refrigerator). Mechanical traps (peanut butter works well) you can place against common travel areas as well. Check them regularly and replace as needed.\n\nSource: dad was exterminator for 25 years and i helped on a bunch of mouse jobs as a kid",

    "body": "Hey y'all. I've been wanting to share these stories for a while now, but I haven't had the time to sit down and type them up until now. So, here ya go! I hope your head spins on its axis as much as mine did<3\n\nI've been an EMT for a while, mostly working on ambulances and I'd never seen any  MLM huns crazy enough to merit sharing until recently. I took a break from the ambo life for a bit for health reasons, and when I saw an opening for a K-12 summer camp looking for an EMT I jumped on it, thinking it would be fun. I was ready to trade heart attacks and fractured hips and cranky old folks in diapers for sprained ankles and crying, vomiting children (don't get me wrong, as horrible as I make it sound I truly love my job)! What I did NOT expect, as I should have if I had listened to anything this sub has taught me, was the wild arm-chair doctor Plexus and Doterra huns. Now, down to the good stuff: I have three stories and I'll separate this post into 3 parts accordingly, saving the best story for last.\n\n**PART I:**\n\nPart of this job was to hold onto and administer daily medications to those kids that needed them (important note: there were no parents at this camp. Kids were sent by themselves, save for one group leader per 5-10 kids). So, if your kid needed to take a medication, you were to send it in with their group leader, who would give it to me at the beginning of camp to catalog and hold onto so I could administer it to them when necessary. NOW, some of these kids took ACTUAL medications that they truly needed to take (read: ADHD meds, seizure meds, inhalers, etc.). But then there were huns that sent in MULTIPLE Plexus or DoTerra \"medicines\" - the most noteworthy being one poor child whose mother sent in SEVEN different Plexus \"medications,\" along with a note stating that the child were to take one of each three times a day. But if little BillyBob (obviously not his real name) were to forget to take them? I was instructed to HUNT HIM DOWN, to stop what I'm doing and go on a wild goose chase around the (10-square mile) camp in order to make sure he doesn't miss a single dose of his \"BioCleanse\" (just one awful example). It was a matter of LIFE or DEATH, you see. She also included BillyBob's past 6 school pictures, just in case someone else's kid had the exact same meds, I suppose. \n\nBut not only was BillyBob the only child who religiously came to the medical station during every meal to take his (7) pills, he was also the sweetest and most polite little boy at the entire camp. I was baffled. When I asked him why he had to take all of these medications he told me this: His older cousin has cancer, and his mom sells these \"medications\" because, like the modern-day Mother Theresa she was, she wants to make sure that no one else on this earth gets cancer, either. His mom told him that Plexus \"medications\" can both PREVENT and CURE cancer. I was shell-shocked, I didn't know what to say, so I just gave him my condolences for his cousin and he went on his way (I had too many other kids in line behind him to sit him down and explain how wrong his mom was, but later that day I learned that his mom was a SAHM and she called herself a \"pharmacist\").\n\n**PART II:**\n\nOn the first day of camp, a young girl around 9 years old came to me with her group leader complaining of a headache and an upset stomach. The girl was sobbing and in obvious pain. After a quick examination, I determined she probably had a migraine (this was a Christian camp, and the worship sessions were incredibly loud and bright and could trigger migraines and headaches easily). I offered her Advil and Pepto Bismol. The girl wanted to accept but her leader would not let her, saying something along the lines of how she needed to ask her parents first, and that the girl \"just needed to lay down in a dark room, she didn't need no nasty chemicals.\" Oooookay. I wanted to ask why they even came to me in the first place but I didn't, so I just told the girl that if she started feeling worse, or if she throws up or passes out she needs to come back to me, no questions asked. She agreed and off they went. The next day at breakfast however, she comes back looking even worse - same nausea and crippling headache, but she's obviously had no sleep. I ask her leader what had happened, if they had given her anything at all, if she had vomited, etc. - what the leader says next makes my blood boil still, to this day. She says, \"oh yeah, I gave her ten drops each of my special peppermint oil and lemon oil on her tongue before bed and when she woke up - they have such *wonderful* healing properties, you know! They're from DoTerra, so they're all natural; don't worry!\"\n\nI shit you not. I. Saw. Red. I practically screamed, \"WAIT, so she told you her *stomach was upset* and you poured *essential oils* down her throat?!? What would possess you to do that?? \" She turned tomato red, sputters out something about how she sells the oils so she knows they're certified \\~\\~*all-natural\\~\\~* and they have healing properties, I just want to shove harmful chemicals down the poor young girl's throat, yadda yadda yadda. I'm steaming out of my ears, but I quickly pull up a scholarly article on my phone about how it is harmful to ingest essential oils and I give it to her to read while I evaluate the girl, who now has a high fever and is showing signs of the start of an ear infection. I direct the leader to take the girl to a nearby urgent care, as she has an infection and to under no circumstances feed her more oils (she agreed to take her for some reason). \n\nWhen I saw the girl two days later, she looked much better. Her leader didn't apologize (not that I expected it), but she did at least say that she now believes that \"artificial chemicals\" (read: actual medicine) can have their benefits sometimes. It's a minor victory but I'll take it. \n\n**PART III:**\n\nLast but not least. If you've made it this far, thanks for sticking with me. On the last day of camp, a young girl (again, about 9 yrs old) comes to me complaining of a really painful sunburn on her chest. I pull her shirt collar down a bit to take a peek at it and, lo and behold, she has a  gnarly PARTIAL-THICKNESS (second degree) burn from clavicle to clavicle, in various stages of healing. I go slack-jawed, because she doesn't even appear to be in any pain. It's puss-y, bleeding, blistering, red and raw, *all over her chest.* I asked her how long she's had this burn for, and she tells me since the *first day of camp* (for about 5 days). \n\nMe: \"Sweetie, why didn't you come to me as soon as you got it? I have some pretty magic stuff, it's called aloe vera and it makes sunburns feel so much better!\"\n\nGirl: \"My group leader told me that she could heal it and that I shouldn't ask you for help because you'll put chemicals on it and chemicals give me cancer.\"\n\nMe: \\*starting to get a sinking feeling in my stomach\\* \"Well...what did your leader give you to heal it?\"\n\nGirl: \"She put oils on it every time I went outside. They burned really bad but she said that meant they were working and protecting me.\"\n\nI sigh, since I have a feeling who I'm about to have a chat with, but I begin to apply aloe and neosporin/bandages as necessary while explaining to the girl the importance of using your own judgement about what your body needs, especially when you think an adult might be doing something that is harmful to you, when the leader comes over and, yup, it's none other than DoTerra-Hun herself. I have to restrain myself from headbutting the wall until I pass out and get a break from this insanity.\n\nMe: \\*somewhat calmly\\* \"Ma'am...I thought we discussed this. Essential oils are not meant to be used as a medical intervention. By putting oils on this child's sunburn you have not only halted her body's natural healing processes but you have also caused her further harm by literally *burning her burn*. I have no choice but to speak to your church's pastor and advise that you do not be allowed on future camp trips as you have continuously denied medical aid to children who need it.\"\n\nI did report her to both the camp and to her church leader, who were equally appalled as I was. I also caught her trying to sell DoTerra to other group leaders and even camp staffers the entire time she was there.\n\nEdit: I have reported these incidents to CPS.",

I know cranky elderly people can be frustrating at times, but I want to thank you and all other EMTs for powering through it. My grandfather just passed a few weeks ago and he was suffering from Parkinson’s and dementia. He would often roll out of bed at night or just fall in general. He was 6’9 and at least 300 lbs, so when he fell, my petite grandmother could never manage to help him back up by herself. My grandparents lived also lived in rural area, so there weren’t a lot of people around to lend a hand. She always called the EMTs to help her get him back in bed or back on his feet, but she started to become very embarrassed as she thought they may view helping her and my grandfather as a waste of time. However, they were always so patient and gracious, regardless of the time of night. They told  her “call us any time you need help. We’ll be here.” I’m telling you, that just meant the world to her to know they were happy to help her out. I’m sure being an EMT is just like any other job, you have good days, bad days, and everything in between. But thank you for always making sure patients come first and conducting yourself professionally. Even when you have to pick the same octogenarian up off the kitchen floor for the 3rd time this month, or a DōTerra hun refuses to listen to reason! Lol",

    "body": "*Edit* \n\nHere's the general food poisoning advice from this thread as this has blown up:\n\nAs people have said, if you can't peel it, cook it or boil it then forget it. Food should be hot and fresh. Same advice as in this post also applies to uncooked salads / pre cut veggies / washed veggies (unless you can confirm they've been washed and grown in clean water). Also important is to only drink filtered or bottled water, avoid ice and only brush teeth with filtered water too. Good advice to go to a place with some turnover and don't order something which may have been stored for a long time and not frequently ordered and also uncooked (E.g. a burger bun at an Indian restaurant in a non tourist area, got food poisoning from that in 2020 believe it or not). Meat also carries it's own unique risks, but as I'm a vegetarian you'll have to do your own research on that one. Take probiotics and stock a bunch of stuff that can help control indigestion too (e.g. peppermint oil caps, calcium carbonate, buscopan, pepto etc). Watch out for unpasteurized milk. Carry hand sanitizer. Get travel insurance and have extra money to front immediate costs. Get your travel vaccinations. \n\nAnd last but not least... don't be scared or put off by all of this! You should still be cautious and follow some guidelines, but follow this advice and you should be sweet! So jump in and get traveling food poisoning FREE.\n\n*Original story* \n\nI can't believe I made such a rookie mistake. In Bangalore, India I bought a bowl of pre cut fruit (papaya, watermelon, banana) from a street stall. I assumed it had just been cut recently and it was fine. It also wasn't refrigerated but it looked totally fresh. I got some SERIOUS food poisoning that day. I wrongly assumed that it was from a curry that I ate that same day, so 5 days later I got some from a different stall and got food poisoning again...\n\nAfter researching I discovered that pre cut fruit is something you should avoid, especially in developing countries. The rind or peel protects the inside of the fruit or vegetable from bacteria. As soon as you cut it it's shelf life goes way down too. Pre cut fruit is often handled with no gloves and also not cooked so any bacteria can grow on it easily. It's also often out in the open so bacteria can build up over time, and often it is washed in local tap water. So if you want to eat fruit while you're traveling you should just buy something you can peel yourself.",

When the fruit is hand-cut with a knife, you also have to worry about how/if the blade was washed (was the water potable?) and what the blade touched before cutting your fruit (is this also the knife used for cutting raw meat?).

    "body": "Hello all. I’m the woman with the MIL who covered her infant son (now a toddler) in what we thought was peppermint oil while watching him for 20 minutes; was super squirrelly and evasive for several months when we asked her what she did exactly; and then finally “apologized” to us and told us what she actually put on our son, which was shockingly even worse than peppermint oil. \n\nI wasn’t planning on writing anything here, at least for a while, but I just happened to check out this page for the first time in a couple months. I saw someone ask about Peopermint Boil on the where are they now thread and I was shocked to see how my situation was getting so misconstrued. My comments kept getting eaten so here’s the latest!\n\nFirst: yes I deleted my account (though I think all the peppermint Boil stories are still under Peppermint Boil) but not because my husband made me. I deleted my account because I was feeling super raw and vulnerable after I found out what PB actually did to my son and didn’t want to deal with any more comments, even well meaning ones, telling me what I needed to do about the situation. I mentioned in my last post that my husband didn’t want me talking about the situation because he was paranoid about us getting investigated due to her stupid actions. I knew he was being a little over the top but I respected his wishes until he was ready to talk about it with others, which we since have. Somehow this got translated into my husband being a mommy’s boy deep in the FOG. Nothing can be further from the truth.\n\nAnyway, long story short: We cut Peppermint Boil from our life and everyone is fully aware of the situation and nobody bothers us about it because they know she is kooky dooks. She spent Thanksgiving alone as far as I know.\n\nWe have no intention of talking to her ever again. Life is good. I still get weird flare ups of guilt where I feel bad for her, but then I remember what she did and think nope, fuck her.\n\nKiddo is 16 months, healthy and happy.",

    "body": "\n\nHi Just no MIL. Throwaway cause I dont want both SIL's(avid redditors) to find my main account.\n\nMy 3 month old son has extremely sensitive skin. Its gradually been getting better thankfully. But DW and I still have to be careful. I can't wear cologne, my wife cannot wear perfume, if we put on deodorant we have to thoroughly wash and rinse our hands, etc. MIL(henceforth called Babysnatcher for her interactions with my 5y/o daughter, which I may post about later).\n\nBabysnatcher has somehow conditioned herself to believe she can do no wrong with children since SILs(6 and 9 years older than DW with kids of their own) let her have free reign. Much to Babysnatchers irritation, I am not the same way. \n\nNow we were at Babysnatchers house for thanksgiving and I see the little bowls of potpourri she loves so much. The house smells like peppermint and dinner. I dont take much notice but I see her mixing peppermint oil into one of the bowls bare handed. A few minutes later I have my son set up in his little playard, tucked up and napping(it was his first long car ride), and so I go to mingle, cause not all of DWs family is intolerable.\n\nSome thirty minutes later I hear my son start to cry. I figure he woke up and needed attention so I start to cut off my conversations but Im in no huge rush. When I hear that crying turn into almost screaming I go into full dad-mode. I run over to see Babysnatcher holding my son, barehanded, reeking of perfume and, you guessed it, peppermint. She didnt wash her hands and has just rubbed peppermint oil all over my son with sensitive skin. Now in case youve never handled it before, peppermint oil can cause mild irritation even on adults. I freak and grab my kid away from her. I rush to the bathroom to start washing him off in simple warm water. Babysnatcher comes in like a harpy shrieking about how she \"has never been so insulted in her entire life!\" I ignore her and continue rinsing off my son. Once I'm convinced I got all of it off as best I could I lift him up and turn around to face the crowd that has gathered, DW included. I tell her to get our daughter, and we are leaving. Babysnatcher starts shrieking again and I lose it. Not yelling so I dont hurt my sons ears, I tell her very clearly she is not allowed in my house or to touch my son ever again. I shove past her and wait in the car. The rash is slowly spreading on his skin but at least he's not crying. DW and I go home and I do my best to make a good dinner in the few hours I have left while DW tends to our son.\n\nThe next day the rash had blistered and we took him to the hospital. \n\n\nTL;DR- MIL gets peppermint oil on my sons sensitive skin. Gets mad when I freak out.",

    "body": "The whole saga started in my home town on a warmer day in late December. With everyone coming home for the holidays, we decided it would be the perfect opportunity to link up and trip on some magic mushrooms. Unfortunately all I was able to find was some psilocybin chocolate bars, Multiverse Milkchocolates. After a nice trip with the homies, I stored the leftover chocolate in my car’s glovebox.\n\nFast forward a few days. I’m driving, looking in my rear view mirror and see a brown ball dash across the corner of my eye. Upon realizing that it was in fact inside my car, I start screaming like a some sort of alarm. Oh my god there’s a mouse in my car! I pull over as soon as humanly possible and jump out of my car. After timidly checking all the visible areas it could hide, I call up my friend Jack for advice. After a few laughs and teasing me for being scared of a tiny mouse, he recommends using peppermint oil in an effort to deter it. Damn, no immediate solution. So I get some coffee and breakfast then search my car for clues to where he is. Fuck that bastard shit on my masks! There’s poop in trunk, turds on my battery! How in the hell did he get in the glove box? Oh my god he ate some of the chocolate!\n\nI head back to my parents house laughing my ass off with the thought of a field mouse having an ego death inside my Kia. I decide to blast music as loud as I can and drive slowly through a neighborhood in an effort to scare the fucker out. I got what I hoped for, a mouse dashing through my peripherals into the passenger seat. Another round of screaming and I quickly pull over. As I’m slamming doors and ripping through my car, a lady with her dog walks by. I explain my conundrum and she jokingly asks her dog if it wants to catch a mouse. I looked her dead in the eyes and said “if you’re willing I would want nothing more than for your dog to search my car”. 30 seconds of a wagging tail and muddy footprints on my seat later, no mouse was found. Where is that fucker hiding??\n\nI get back and douse a bunch of cotton balls in peppermint oil. Damn my car smells good. A night goes by soaking my car with the scent supposed to deter mice, but new poop still appears in the morning. I spend the whole day trying to make my car as uncomfortable as possible, Plan A is to get the mouse to leave on it’s own free will. I honk my horn, blast all kinds of music, set portable lights in every dark crevice, bang around my car and leave the trunk and hood open to the elements. My mom suggests poisoning it or kill traps but I can’t kill a mouse that has shared my shroom consciousness.\n\nSick of all the bullshit and realizing it’s just a mouse, I decide to drive to Canton to see my cousin Nate. As I’m getting close to Nate’s house the bastard makes another appearance out of the back seat. He’s getting ballsier by the minute. Leaving my cousins house I get ready to drive to my house in Columbus but it’s rainy and dark. 10 minutes into the drive he pops out for a long period of time and even stares me straight in the eyes. I plead with him to leave me alone and decide I can’t drive like this any longer. So I decide spend the night in Canton and to my surprise there’s no new poop in the morning. A full two hour drive to Columbus and no mouse in sight. Things are looking up! \n\nUnfortunately this peace doesn’t last. As the next morning, poop is sitting on the driver seat. I need a new strategy. Time for Plan B, forcibly capturing this mouse and taking it away from my car. I ask my neighbor if they have a bucket and they lend me a large plastic bin, so I put some nuts in it and tape a ramp onto it. I also get a pre made trap and put it in my trunk as backup. Though when I check out the bin every single nut was gone. It is now a battle of intelligence between me and the mouse I decide to nickname “Brain”. Alright a bigger container it is. I head to the local Ace hardware to grab a bucket and another premade trap for good measure. He got out of this one too. I’m basically feeding him at this point. With my last hope I decide to get a huge 5 gallon bucket and craft a makeshift plank drop. There is no way Brain could escape this. \n\nBut this mouse is no ordinary mouse. This mouse has reached a new level of consciousness, it has seen the light and experienced the oneness of everything. This mouse has taken the human equivalent of an ounce of mushrooms. Brain truly is a super mouse. \n\nThis fucker cleaned out that huge 5 gallon bucket and even left a me a few turds in the bottom. It was funny before but I’m having it no longer. I brainstormed a bit and decided that oil in the bottom of the bucket is the necessary next step in the evolution of my trap. Hopefully, it would make this super mouse too slippery to climb and too heavy to jump out. With my newly improved trap set, all that was left was to wait. An anxious hour later I open my car to see oil splashing everywhere. I did it! I finally outsmarted this fucking field mouse! I took the oily bastard to Tuttle park and drove away as fast as I could. Here’s to starting 2022 completely rodent free and thanking god I didn’t have to resort to plan C\n\n\nTL;DR I left some psychedelic chocolates in my car, which attracted a mouse. The Mouse eats an unholy amount of the chocolate and decides to start living in my car. After a week of being terrorized, my 5th attempt to catch the bastard works and I set the overly intelligent mouse free.",

Reader discretion advised.**)\n\nThank you all, for all of the support, and the kinds words about my last entry. I said there was more, and there is. Tonight, I will try to get something heavy off of my mind, so this may be a long post. Buckle up, grab a few drinks, and a good cigar, and lets get to it.\n\nThis call out still gives me nightmares, and I can still smell the fucking place too. Major and violent crimes are not, or at least weren't, that common where I was. Very rarely would things escalate beyond the average bar fight, or family reunion brawl. We did get a couple murders a year, maybe a kidnapping. Lots and lots of plain simple disappearing.\n\nThe disappearances were usually chalked up to foolishly getting lost off the walking trails, and not being able to find their way back out. We tried, every single time, we tried to find them. Many, many, manhunts and search parties went out. Never once did we find them alive. Sometimes we didn't even find bodies. Then, sometimes we would find bodies, without getting to know where  they came from. \n\nAt this time, I would like to dive into the story of the night. It was the summer of 79' and I was on duty on a Monday morning, still feeling the earth shattering effects of my massive hangover. The Friday prior, I had pulled over a vehicle transporting 12 quart jars of straight moonshine.  That wasn't good, as we were in a dry county. So, the perpetrator and I came up with a solution. Since she was young, had a child, and no husband, she  was doing whatever she could to earn some extra cash. Including run moonshine for some nasty ass people. \n\nBetween the two of us, we hatched a plan. I would keep the liquor and actually pay for it, she would take the money back to the shiner, and me and three other cruisers would storm the place, claiming to have seen them load the shine, and know who bought it. No heat landed on the girl, and she became my house cleaner for many years after that. I made the mistake that first weekend to test the shine. Never again, did I drink straight corn liquor, without proofing it down.  \n\nI was sitting at my desk, in the court house, sweating through my uniform, desperate to get a way to cool down. The building wasn't air conditioned at the time, and the only way we had to keep cool, was a tiny desk fan on our desks. They made lots of noise, but they did not move a lot of air. \n\nSo, when my phone actually rang, I was a little excited, and hoping I would have an excuse to take a drive. The call was a distress call, from a young woman. She reported being able to smell death and rot from her neighbors home, and reported she hadn't seen the neighbors for several days. Caller reported the neighbors to be an elderly couple. She asked if I could do a welfare check, because she couldn't get them to answer the door or phone.\n\nI agreed, and informed dispatch I was rolling to a WC scene, nd asked to have EMS on standby, just in case. In my experience the vast majority of these calks were overly cautious friends and family, and the people being checked on were usually fine. Sometimes folks talk vacations, and not telling the neighborhood was considered security. Simpler times, heh?\n\nI jumped into my cruiser and flipped the lights on, siren too, mainly so I could actually drive fast enough to get a good strong breeze in the car. It didn't take me long to reach the address I had been given. The house was old, and decrepit, needing many repairs, but still habitable. As I approached the domicile, I noted the smell of death. I could tell instantly that I wasn't smelling a dead pet or even a dead deer. I was smelling a deceased human being. \n\nI radioed to dispatch telling them to alert the EMS and the county coroner. Also told her to send another car, with a detective. I informed dispatch I was entering the home, and ended the transmission. I knocked loudly, using my MagLite, to beat against the front door. I cupped my hands around my face, trying to peer inside, but the windows appeared to be painted, and I could not see through them. Thinking nothing of it, I proceed to check the other windows for a line of sight into the home, and found them covered, or painted like the rest. \n\nI made my way back to the back side of the house, looking for an unlocked door, or window, or even the cellar being open. I was met with locks, drapes and brown paint on every possible point of entry. By the time I came to the rotten back porch, the smell was nearly a physical being. I could almost reach out and touch it. I remembered the peppermint oil that the coroner gave us, and ran to my cruiser to get it. As I applied a very generous glob to my upper lip and nostrils, I radioed dispatch to check the progress of the coroners arrival, and that of the back up I had just requested. I was assured they all should be arriving in short time.\n\n\nI decided to enter the house via the rear door, just in case I was badly wrong about what I expected to find inside, that way we could try to ensure nobody burglarized the home, after we left. I mule kicked the old wooden door just under the knob twice before the jamb shattered. The swung open, and violently hit the wall behind it. The smell rolled out of that house as a sticky wet fog of nasty. The peppermint oil was now doing fuck all to help the stench.\n\nAs my eyes watered and adjusted to the dim light inside the home, I noticed a sound. A constant droning noise. I knew that I knew the sound, but at the moment my hangover was truly kicking my ass, and my brain was in a deep fog. I made my way through the door, and into the small cramped utility room. \n\nI made my way into the next room, which turned out to be the kitchen. I was using my flashlight to look around, and felt something warm and wet plop on the back of my neck, followed by the intense smell of rot and human shit. I knew what it was, but my hand had a mind of its own, and swept the nasty glob off my neck. I tried to fling the stuff off my finger as well as I could as the realization of what that stuff was hit me. Putrescine and skatole. Two chemicals produced when a body decomposes. \n\nGaging, and fighting back bile, I staggered into the dining room, where the noise I mentioned seemed to originate. Through teary eyes, I looked around the room, and almost wept when I saw the source of the noise. What had to be millions of flies and beetles covered everything inside the dining room. The ceiling was moving and fluttering, and although it took me a second, I realized the flies and bugs was what had the windows covered. They were so dense I could not see through them. As I steppes through the door way, the covering of bugs shifted out of my way, the few remaining in place squished audibly under foot. As they shifted and moved, I realized why they were covering everything.\n\nThe walls, ceiling, and floor of the dining room was covered in blood and viscera. I could see intestines, smeared across the dining table, fecal matter oozing out in a streak of greenish brown. The walls were completely covered, as if someone took a bit of time to paint the walls with the blood and fluids from their victims. I carefully made my way through the room, impervious to the sounds emanating from under my feet. \n\nThe living room was attached to the dining room, and was absolutely spotless. Not a drop of blood or anything to indicate the nightmare in the other room.  The stairwell, which would lead to the bedrooms was in one corner of the living room. I carefully made my way to the front door, unlocking it for my backup and the coroner. I tried to radio dispatch but my portable would not reach out, and was only receiving static. \n\nI carefully ascended the steps, making my way upstairs. At the top if the landing was three doors. One directly in front of me, one to the left and one the right. I entered the door directly in front if me first. It must have been the spare bedroom at one point. Now however it was macabre storage room for bones, cartilage and other hard bits. I backed out of the room, and vomited in the hall. I could no longer fight the odor, sights, nor my hang over at that time. \n\nAfter copious amounts of vomiting, I decided to try the left hand side door. I slowly opened the door, and peeked in. This room must have been the killers organ room, because I discovered several pairs of lungs, all different sizes. There was four brains that I saw, before I backed out and closed that door as well. Key the second round of seemingly endless vomitous escaping my throat at Mach three.\n\nThe door on the right.  The door that chose the title to this story, nearly forty years later. I slowly opened this door, weapon drawn, more for my own comfort than any protection, and as the door opened, I got glimpse into hells true kitchen. Human bodies, minus the skin and bones, were staples to the walls, and floor as well as to the ceiling fan. \n\nI counted seven bodies, before I had to leave. I was sitting on the front stoop, again giving control of my stomach to the hellish hangover,  when my backup and the county coroner arrived. I couldn't speak, so I just raised a shaking finger and pointed into the house. I remember feeling lightheaded, then hearing the detective, a twenty year cop, scream like a girl, before I passed out.\n\nI awoke some hours later, laying on a bed i. the towns doctor office. I sat up, and made my way out to the front, where I found the detective, the coroner, the mayor, and several other local officials. As I walked into the lobby, the coroner, who was also the town doctor ( told you it was a small rural town! ) turned to me and asked how I felt.\n\n\" Well, Doc, I really don't know to be honest.\" I answered, not wanting to broadcast my terrible hangover.\n\n\" Ah, Son, you'll be right as rain, once you get home and take a few drinks. Or, wait around and you cam sample my collection.\" He whispered in a joking manner. \n\nI nervously laughed and nodded, having no intentions of hanging around any longer than I needed to.\n\nI walked around and mingled for a moment, before I went back to the coroner and asked what he thought of that house.\n\n\" Well, Son, Ill tell ya. I ain't never seen nothin' like it. Counted eleven different corpses. No obvious cause of death to either, and the down stairs room. That place was coated in, in my best guess, a mixture of pureed skin, fat, and bodily fluids.\"\n\nI fought back another surge of bile, before seeking my Sergeant out of the crowd, and asking to leave early that day. Of course, after what had happened he agreed, under the condition I had my report ready by nine in the morning, and on his desk. \n\nThat night, I had the first dream. I was stumbling through an unfamiliar house. It was dark, hit and damp, every surface coated in a thick visceral fluid. I stumble through a cramped hallway,  and finally find a light switch. I flip the switch and scream. The entire house is made of meat. I can see veins and arteries pumping a dark brown blood through the walls. Looking up, I see that the light is spilling forth from a chandelier  made of human skulls. I try to run from the house, to escape, but there is no door. \n\nI try to run at the walls, to crash through. Each time I hit the wall with a sickening \" splorch \" and bounce back. Every time. I run to the opposite  side of the house, trying to find a door. Instead I find, what can only be described as King Kong's sphincter, grown into the wall. Part of my brain tries to tell me that I'll have to crawl through that giant pulsating ass hole to escape this place, but another part of me thinks its a trap. I frantically look around for something to use to stab the walls, and I see a bone, growing up the wall. \n\nWith a lot of effort, and an unforgettable sound, he bone wrests free. I hold it like a spear, and run at the wall, stabbing the meat house. I hear and feel an incredibly deep rumble, and am thrown backwards as the wall leaps forward, spitting the bone back to the floor.  With a dribble of brown blood, the wall seals the puncture wound. Desperate to escape, I stab the giant sphincter with the same bone I tore from the wall. With another deep rumble, I am slammed back, not back against the wall, but back into the room with the skull lights. That's when I wake up screaming hard enough to taste blood.\n\nThe next morning after turning in my report, the Sergeant drags me to his office, where he tells me the following. \n\n\" Look, we have a problem. If we tell the public what happened there, or hell, even what we found, the locals would panic. We would have drunk red necks running around all vigilante. We have to keep this covered up. The house has been condemned, the coroner manages to come up with a good enough cover for the barrels of nasty ass shit we have to take out of there, and the smell. Apparently the owners of the home, died in their sleep, and the pets died shortly after, because of a gas leak,  and as soon as the investigation is done, we will burn it down.  Officially, its going to be an accidental death, for both of the residents. The Doc is going to try to use dental records,  to identify the others, but he's not optimistic. Just remember the cover, and don't talk to anyone except me, Detective Lawson, or the Doc.\"\n\nAnd that's what the papers said the following day. Officially it was an accidental death, causes by an unchecked gas leak in the kitchen. Unofficially, we discovered a total of thirteen bodies. None of them showed a cause of death, there was no foreign chemicals in the blood, or body parts. Using every tool available to us, we were unable to identify any of the bodies. The home owners were put to rest in a sealed empty coffin. We had access to the databases of the Feds, for an unrelated matter, and still could not find an identity to either of the bodies. \n\nThat's that.  We never figured out what happened there, and it never happened again. I still have that nightmare, or a twisted version of it at least twice a month.  \n\nThere's more  to come, just bear with me y'all.\n\n[PART3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8xwbje/tales_from_a_rural_leo_3/?utm_source=reddit-android)\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tales_From_The_County/?utm_source=reddit-android) [Y](http://www.Patreon.com/UnLuckyKenTucky)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It's very frustrating when you plant brand new seeds and right along the line that you buried them in is dug up the next morning! Lol. \n\nI've been using hot pepper flakes that you buy at the store. It's better than cayenne pepper because it doesn't wash away that easily.  It stays in the yard and garden for 2 or 3 weeks and it actually kind of helps. And yes we planted sunflower seeds too and about half of them got pushed over and the buds eaten right off of them. So I feel your pain🐿️",

    "body": "This sub has experienced some mind-boggling growth. Since July, we've gone from a measly [1,000 subscribers to over 66,000](http://redditmetrics.com/r/antiMLM). That's insane. It's also really exciting that we've become a place for people hurt by MLM to congregate. Whether you're annoyed at the person who bullied you in high school and now wants you on their team, have had family relationships strained, or personally lost thousands of dollars to MLM schemes yourself, we're glad you're here.\n\nWith that explosive growth, though, we've also gone from a small, easy-to-moderate community to something more akin to the wild west. With this many voices, the breadth of content and comments is vast, and the anti-MLM focus is becoming as diluted as your aunt's peppermint oil sunscreen recipe. There have also been some trends that myself and the rest of the mod team are concerned about, and judging by the volume of mod messages we're getting, many of you have the same concerns.\n\nThe time has come to focus this sub. Beginning today, we're laying out some content guidelines about what does and doesn't belong here.\n\n\n##Things We Want to See More Of##\n\n1. Rational Arguments Against the Business Model - MLM is built for failure. Whether it's ugly leggings or the best knives in the world, the product doesn't matter when the business model is busted and abusive.\n2. Business or Mathematical Delusion - People down the rabbit hole will come up with preposterous ways to justify their \"business.\" Highlight this irrational thinking.\n2. Relational Abuse - Is your boss leaning on you to buy oils you don't want? Did your MIL ruin Christmas by photoshopping your kid into her ad? Tell your story here.\n3. Tone-Deaf Advertising - MLM puts enormous pressure on participants to push their stuff at all times, and sometimes \"all times\" means \"the worst times.\" If your friend is posting the lipstick she's wearing to her grandpa's funeral, it belongs here.\n4. Legal News - The legality of MLMs is a constant battleground. News about these companies being [prosecuted](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2016/12/vemma-agrees-ban-pyramid-scheme-practices-settle-ftc-charges) or [investigated](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2016/07/herbalife-will-restructure-its-multi-level-marketing-operations) totally belongs here.\n5. Your Personal Experiences - There's a good chance you're here because you've escaped the madness of one of these companies. Share your experience, what you've learned, and especially how you saw the light and decided to get out.\n\n##What We'll Be Heavily Moderating##\n\n1. Items *Associated* With MLM, But Not Actually MLM - Essential oils, for example, are not in and of themselves a Terrible Thing.\n2. Things That *Remind* You of MLM - A cloud formation that looks like the Pampered Chef hat deserves a forum that will *truly* appreciate it. Like [r/clouds](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLOUDS).\n3. Ugly Products - Yes, LuLaRoe has some *horrendous* patterns, but at the end of the day, it's subjective. There are lots of places to buy ugly clothes. The ugliness of the products is not what makes MLM bad.\n4. Ugly Uses of Products - Store-bought makeup can be badly done, and though \"pattern matching\" is a prevalent part of LLR culture, it is not a problem unique to MLM.\n\n##But the Elephant in the Room ... ##\n\nWith the explosive growth of the sub, there has also been a tremendous influx of both content and comments that are not about MLM, but rather about the unattractiveness of people in photographs. Let us be exceedingly clear right now today: **That's not what this sub is for.** Going forward, we will be *aggressively* moderating posts we deem to have been made to highlight a person's unattractiveness. Similarly, comments along these lines will be removed as well, along with sexually-charged derogatory terms (e.g., LuLaHoe, etc). \n\nWe'll probably go after it quite hard at least for a while to get the problem under control. A rule of thumb we'll be applying and ask you to apply to is this: Does this comment highlight, expose, or explain a fundamental flaw of MLM? Because if we're in the weeds of commenting on physical appearances, we've probably strayed from what's wrong with MLM to begin with. For the time being, if we think it's even borderline, we're probably going to err on the side of removal. If you have a post removed, don't sweat it. It doesn't make you a bad person. If you find you're consistently having things removed, though ... well, maybe you are.\n\n##Looking Ahead##\n\nWith the growth we've experienced, we can't actively monitor every conversation, so there are two other things we'll be doing:\n\n1. Heavily relying on the community to alert us to problems. Please feel free to flag liberally in accordance with these guidelines. We've actually defined the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/about/rules) now, so flags no longer have to be submitted as \"Logical Fallacy.\" ;)\n2. We will be bringing on some additional moderators. A number of you have already messaged us, volunteering. We'll be in touch.\n\nNow ... thank you all for being the best downline we could ask for. Get out there and keep #CrushingIt!\n\n**EDIT:** One other thing to note: I do want to recognize that one of the categories of posts we enumerated above *is* very popular: ugly patterns and products. The irony is not lost on me that as I make this announcement, the top post on the board with 3800 karma is 4 truly horrendous LLR patterns. I personally do enjoy this content, but it's separate from the purpose of this sub. If someone else wants to start a sub specifically for such things, though, we'd gladly support that and link to it in the sidebar!",

    "body": "Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/s/sPZSOFQzsn\n\nSo I read all 416 comments on the previous post. You all collectively agreed that I was not overreacting, that my husband is a shitty father and husband, that I married a loser, and that I should leave if he doesn't change his ways. \n\nSo after he got home from work last night the baby needed to be changed so I asked him to come into the other room and simply observe while I change the diaper and he agreed. I said he could observe a few diaper changes and then when it was just a plain pee diaper I would let him know that it's his turn and he once again argued about not wanting to change diapers. I told him that he will eventually have to suck it up because he is a parent now and if he didn't want to be a parent he shouldn't have agreed to become one. He said he didn't want to be a dad as bad as I wanted him to be, and that he only got me pregnant because i wanted to be a mom so bad. I reminded him that he was the one who got the conversation about kids started several years ago when he said he \"wouldn't mind having a kid\" he said yeah I wouldn't mind, and then i cut him off and said but you only want the fun parts and not any of the gross nonfun parts? I told him that I'm on the verge of being burnt out and that I feel like a married single mom. He said I was bashing him and I said I wasn't bashing, but simply pointing out the obvious and then I left the room because the baby was crying to be fed. He joined me in the other room a few minutes later to apologize, and restated that's he just doesn't want to change diapers. I asked him what the issue is with changing diapers and he said he feels like a man shouldn't change little girls diapers. He is afraid people will see him as a pedophile. I told him nobody will see him as a pedophile because that is his child. It would be different if he volunteered to change a little girl that wasn't his child. I told him that he should start sooner rather than later because the diapers won't get any easier, they will only become nastier. In the end he agreed to observe a few diaper changes to learn what to do, and then start with pee diapers and maybe eventually change poopy diapers. He seems to have a serious issue with the poop part, but I told him we could get some rubber gloves and some masks and put Peppermint oil on the mask so he won't have to smell it (one of you recommended the Peppermint oil on the mask, good idea by the way) I will be asking him to join me for every diaper change between the time he gets home from work and the time we go to bed. Since I am a SAHM and he works, I will not ask him to get up during the night unless he just wants to. I know some (most) of you will probably not like that, but for now that is what we will do until he gets comfortable with Daytime diaper changes. In a few days, on a night where he doesn't have to work the next day I will ask him to get up and join us for the midnight diaper changes. I hope he will change and become a more active parent in our baby's life. To all of you who said I should leave because being a single mom is better than being a married single mom: I would rather be a married single mom who doesn't have to leave my baby with a stranger and go to work. At least this way he goes to work and makes money and I get to stay home with my baby. I will keep pushing him and working on him to make him a more active parent. I know we are too young to be having children but I felt like I was more than ready. My oldest sister is special needs to the highest degree and has to wear diapers. So all my life I have been changing diapers. I have helped several family members with their babies from newborn to age 2-3 so I have helped raise several babies (around 6 babies) so I knew being a mom was all I've ever wanted, I was just waiting for him to be ready, and I thought he was, but I guess not. Thank you for reading this update and the original post. I appreciate all advice and help. I apologize for my shitshow of a life lol ",

She didn’t say what (though she had been talking the past few days of making banana bread.) She asked me to pull out the basic ingredients, saying something like “flour, sugar, baking powder, salt… not entirely sure what we need but it’s easy enough to pull it all out.” \n\nAnd with that phrase in mind I did! I started with the stuff she listed, but as she saw me doing that she went to go find her recipe and I went back for a few more loads of other ingredients. Cocoa powder, peppermint oil was thrown in there, for some reason we have potato flour? Corn starch, vanilla bean paste, Quaker oats…\n\nOnce I decided I’d done enough I went to finish drying the dishes like she wanted me to, and waited. \n\nOver the next 20 minutes, she periodically exclaimed “oatmeal? Seriously?” Or “potato flour! For banana bread?!” In increasingly exasperated tones. I just sat there giggling, and quoted what she said: “I didn’t know what we were making and didn’t know what we would need, and it’s easy enough to pull everything out!” \n\nI don’t think she was as amused as I was, but it riled her up so it was worth it, even if she made me put everything back and help her with the banana bread… which I ended up making by myself. Either way, yay banana bread!\n\nEdit: thanks for the silver, kind stranger!",

My husband refuses to change our baby's diapers**\n\n\n\nMy husband (23m) and I (22f) have a beautiful 8 week old daughter. He seemed somewhat excited to be a dad throughout my pregnancy but I feel like maybe he wasn't as excited as I thought/hoped. We had a miscarriage in November of 2023 and he seemed more excited during that pregnancy than he did this time. Throughout the pregnancy he would say he is excited but that he doesn't want to change diapers because it's \"gross.\"\n\nI had a talk with him about how I understand why it can be intimidating because he is a man and she is a baby girl and she has different parts than he does and it can feel intimidating to clean those parts correctly because he has never changed a diaper before. I reassured him that I would be here to help and show him what to do, he even practiced putting a diaper on a stuffed teddy bear before I had the baby.\n\nI thought he would get over it after I had the baby, but he did not. He refuses to even be in the room while I change her. Every time I bring it up and ask \"so when do you want to start changing her diaper?\" He just says \"we're doing this again ? 😒\" I do not regret having my baby, I have always wanted a baby and was definitely ready but I feel like he was not ready. Am I overreacting? How can I talk with him about this?\n\nEdit to add: i asked him what is so gross about changing diapers and he said \"everything. The different parts..\" and then kinda trailed off like there was more to that sentence than what was said. He said that she is never away from me so why should he have to do it? He said \"why would I take her from you to change her and then bring her back when you could just do it.\" And I said \"because you're her dad. What if something happened to me? Or what if I had to leave her with you for an hour or two?\" And he said at that point he would look it up on YouTube and wouldn't leave her sitting in a soiled diaper.\n\n\n\n**Comments**\n\n\n\n**Intrepid\\_Parsley\\_655**\n\nProfile Badge for the Achievement Top 1% Commenter Top 1% Commenter NOR - I think you need to keep pushing him. I’d start by digging into what he thinks is gross about it. Touching poop? The smell? Female parts?\n\nTalk about what would he do if you were incapacitated and the options were to change the diaper himself or have her physically harmed with a rash? What will he do when you get sick and need more rest?\n\nIf he’s willing to try, will he stay in the room while you do it as a first step? Then do it with you watching as another baby step? Or does he refuse to be in room at all?\n\nIf he won’t try, I think I’d insist on therapy… you can’t just opt out of parts of parenting that are essential to a baby’s health.\n\n>OOP: I have mentioned the incapacitated part and he acts like \"Oh that will never happen\" but you never know what can happen. I will keep pushing him and try to get him to at least stay in the room and then move forward from there.\n\n**kizzie264**\n\n*NOR Honestly, fake being sick for a day or two. Mans gotta learn somehow, better to do a soft launch when you can still step in to help than wait for actual issues to arise and baby girl to suffer an incompetent parent forevermore. Also, as the bestie of a momma (and godparent of the best lil dude) who is currently going through the first steps of separation/divorce, I must implore you to start your boundaries and forcing hard limits NOW. This is just the first red flag of many red flags to potentially come, and if you don't nip it in the bud now, then he's gonna think he has the right to refuse a lot more, like chores, feeds, actual parenting, any and all decision making, etc. in the future. It might sound like I'm projecting a bit, but that's because I am - I don't want you going through what my bestie is going through right now. Trust me, you need to protect your girl by making sure her dad knows how to be a dad.*\n\n>OOP: Lately I've been struggling to remember to drink enough water and getting dehydrated which comes with dizziness, fatigue, and feeling shaky/weak. When I tell him I don't feel good he will take her and keep her company by holding her or talking to her until I feel well enough to take her back. So I know he's definitely capable and will do it but he just has to WANT to do it more often than what he does. I will talk with him about this as well.\n\n\n\n**Update - 1 day later**\n\n\n\nSo I read all 416 comments on the previous post. You all collectively agreed that I was not overreacting, that my husband is a shitty father and husband, that I married a loser, and that I should leave if he doesn't change his ways.\n\nSo after he got home from work last night the baby needed to be changed so I asked him to come into the other room and simply observe while I change the diaper and he agreed. I said he could observe a few diaper changes and then when it was just a plain pee diaper I would let him know that it's his turn and he once again argued about not wanting to change diapers.\n\nI told him that he will eventually have to suck it up because he is a parent now and if he didn't want to be a parent he shouldn't have agreed to become one. He said he didn't want to be a dad as bad as I wanted him to be, and that he only got me pregnant because i wanted to be a mom so bad. I reminded him that he was the one who got the conversation about kids started several years ago when he said he \"wouldn't mind having a kid\" he said yeah I wouldn't mind, and then i cut him off and said but you only want the fun parts and not any of the gross nonfun parts?\n\nI told him that I'm on the verge of being burnt out and that I feel like a married single mom. He said I was bashing him and I said I wasn't bashing, but simply pointing out the obvious and then I left the room because the baby was crying to be fed. He joined me in the other room a few minutes later to apologize, and restated that's he just doesn't want to change diapers. I asked him what the issue is with changing diapers and he said he feels like a man shouldn't change little girls diapers.\n\nHe is afraid people will see him as a pedophile. I told him nobody will see him as a pedophile because that is his child. It would be different if he volunteered to change a little girl that wasn't his child. I told him that he should start sooner rather than later because the diapers won't get any easier, they will only become nastier. In the end he agreed to observe a few diaper changes to learn what to do, and then start with pee diapers and maybe eventually change poopy diapers.\n\nHe seems to have a serious issue with the poop part, but I told him we could get some rubber gloves and some masks and put Peppermint oil on the mask so he won't have to smell it (one of you recommended the Peppermint oil on the mask, good idea by the way) I will be asking him to join me for every diaper change between the time he gets home from work and the time we go to bed.\n\nSince I am a SAHM and he works, I will not ask him to get up during the night unless he just wants to. I know some (most) of you will probably not like that, but for now that is what we will do until he gets comfortable with Daytime diaper changes. In a few days, on a night where he doesn't have to work the next day I will ask him to get up and join us for the midnight diaper changes.\n\nI hope he will change and become a more active parent in our baby's life. To all of you who said I should leave because being a single mom is better than being a married single mom: I would rather be a married single mom who doesn't have to leave my baby with a stranger and go to work. At least this way he goes to work and makes money and I get to stay home with my baby. I will keep pushing him and working on him to make him a more active parent. I know we are too young to be having children but I felt like I was more than ready.\n\nMy oldest sister is special needs to the highest degree and has to wear diapers. So all my life I have been changing diapers. I have helped several family members with their babies from newborn to age 2-3 so I have helped raise several babies (around 6 babies) so I knew being a mom was all I've ever wanted, I was just waiting for him to be ready, and I thought he was, but I guess not. Thank you for reading this update and the original post. I appreciate all advice and help. I apologize for my shitshow of a life lol\n\n\n\n**Comments**\n\n\n\n**el\\_grande\\_ricardo**\n\n*If you are breastfeeding only, hand him the baby after she eats. He needs to know how to burp her as well. If you do any bottles, let him feed her. Babies can be gross, but taking care of them is how we bond with them. He doesn't know how much he would regret missing out on that. (Like when you leave them alone together and all she does is cry for mom for 3 hours straight.)*\n\n>OOP: He does better at burping her than I do actually. I always joke that it's because his hands are bigger than mine and covers more surface area of her little back. I usually hand her off to him to burp her unless it's the middle of the night and he's asleep.\n\n\n\n**Update - 1.5 months later**\n\n\n\nSo its been about a month. I've talked it over with him again and again. We've argued about it a few times, the most recent argument being a few days ago.\n\nHe has watched me change a handful of diapers and I kept reminding him that he needs to do it and that he can start with pee diapers and eventually work his way to the \"gross\" poopy diapers\n\nI started small. When I would change her, I would get her all cleaned up and when the only step left was putting on a clean diaper I would bring her to him with no diaper on, lay her on our bed, hand him the clean diaper and say, \"here, do it.\" Of course he complained but I made him do it. After a few times of that, I brought it up again. That was when we had the most recent argument.\n\nWe argued for a few minutes. He gave the same bullshit excuses about how its \"gross\" and he \"doesn't want to do it\" and I reminded him that being an adult and especially a parent means doing things you don't want to do sometimes. He feels like just because he goes to work he is exempt from housework and taking care of our baby. I reminded him that I can't do 100% of the baby care and 100% of the housework.\n\nIf he expects me to do 100% of the housework, then we will be a team and he will help with baby care. If he refuses to help with baby, then he needs to help with the housework. The argument didn't end well and I gave him the cold shoulder and some attitude for a few days.\n\nI also completely stopped doing housework. Laundry was piling up. Sink full of dirty dishes. The house was a wreck. It was bothering me because I hate for it to look like that but I knew I had to stand my ground. For a few days I did nothing but baby care.\n\nThen yesterday, he did a few loads of laundry because we barely had anything clean left.\n\nHe finished eating his dinner before me. I asked him to take her so I could finish eating. He agreed and took her out of the room.\n\nA few minutes later he pokes his head in the room, holding a diaper and asks \"is this the right diaper?\" (There were 2 different brands on the changing table and we had to size up recently because our little lady is a chonk so I guess he got confused) I said yes and immediately followed him into the other room to observe the diaper change and give direction if needed. He did a decent job on his own without my help.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised that he did it without me asking or arguing. I started to say thank you but decided against it because it's not like he's doing me a favor. He is doing what a dad is supposed to do. So instead I gave him a fist bump and said good job. I asked him what made him decide to do it after all this time and he said he was tired of me being on his ass about it all the time.\n\nSo I guess I will stay on his ass about it and make sure he continues on his path of improvement.\n\nThank you all for all the advice and help you have given. I'm slightly happy with this recent improvement but wish it had come along way sooner.\n\nTl:dr - after several arguments over the last month he finally changed a diaper for the first time yesterday\n\n\n\n**Comments**\n\n\n\n**Subspaceisgoodspace**\n\n*I’m so glad he realised he needs to participate in raising his own daughter. Good on you for managing to make your point without yelling and screaming. I hope things continue to improve.*\n\n**anonymouse12222**\n\n*But he didn’t realise he needs to participate? In her own words he did it because “he was tired of me being on his ass about it all the time”. So now her solution is to “stay on his ass about it”. So she gets to be a mother to a man child. I’m glad you’re happy OP but I hope you have financial security for when you eventually get sick of mothering a grown adult.*\n\n>OOP: Thank you. I was almost ready to give up. I was tired of having the same argument over and over with no results. I mentioned staying with my parents and said I doubted he would even miss us and he said he would. So maybe the idea of us not being around made him sad and he decided to be an active parent? I'm not 100% sure what happens in that man's brain but as long as there's improvement I won't question it.\n\n**OkAd8976**\n\n*I want to know what he thinks will happen if you leave him for being unsupportive? Will he just not see his daughter at all? Or, let her sit in a filthy diaper the entire visit so he gets in trouble for neglect? Or, will he have to step his ass up because no one else is there to do it for him? Maybe he needs a new perspective and you need a lunch date with friends.*\n\n>OOP: We discussed potential divorce and I asked him how he thinks he will get to see her when he won't (and doesn't know how to) change her, bathe her, feed her, or rock her to sleep. He said he would do it if we divorced and I asked why he won't do it now and his dumbass response was \"Why would I do it when you can just do it?\" I know a lot of comments are saying that \"this isn't a win\" but it is what it is.\n\n**TheSwearJarIsMy401k**\n\n*“Why would I do it if you can just do it? See how foolish that is? Why would I be married to a man making more work for me and contributing nothing but a paycheck and a bad attitude? I can avoid all of the mess you create, have my own paycheck, and my daughter and I can live without the extra work and complaining you provide.” Seriously, what did he expect his role was in a marriage? I’m single at 40 and it sucks, I dearly wanted a husband and kids. But every single relationship got to this point- the point where I had to look at the man in my life and ask “What the fuck is the point of you?” And there isn’t a single one I regret leaving, fuck being someone’s kitchen appliance for life.*\n\n>OOP: I'm almost to that point. If he doesn't get his shit together and continue improving I'm done. My mom has a spare room and would love nothing more than getting to see her grand baby on a daily basis\n\n\n\n**I am not the OOP. Please do not harass the OOP.**\n\n**Please remember the No Brigading Rule and to be civil in the comments**",

He hadn’t done a single overnight feeding or anything until I forced the issue, and even when I did I found him with her in a bouncing chair, with blankets a toys propping up her bottle up in her mouth. He couldn’t have been arsed to even hold her.\n\nMy breaking point wasn’t long after that. I went out for my first haircut and it was later in the evening. I had picked her up from daycare at 4pm, where they had just given her a fresh diaper as she had a diaper rash starting, fed her and told him all she needed was a bath, bottle and the medicated diaper cream and to be laid down to bed at 7 or so. \n\nI came home before 8 and she was out so I assumed all was good. Until 3 am she woke me up with that pained screaming at the top of her lungs. I went in and found her circled in a wet spot. When I opened her pj’s I found the daycare diaper still on her (different brand than what I kept at home), but it was bursting with silica from being overfilled. When I got all it off of her, she was raw where her mild diaper rash was.\n\nI bathed, fed, dressed and changed her bed and then walked into my bedroom and woke him up and kicked him out right there and then. I couldn’t trust him with the most basic of care, and wouldn’t trust him with anything more important ever again.\n\nWhen we were in court for custody he wasn’t taking care of her even then, but would hand her over to his mother to care for. That cost him. Then he tried to claim I was negligent because of a “rash” he found on her lower back, that at a year old at that point he had failed to notice was her birth mark. That cost him. The entire affair just put in on display how uninvolved and uninterested he was in being an active parent. \n\n16 years later she’s thriving.

The risk of hallucinations or incorrect data is too high. And of course, it should not replace a medical consultation, only act as an addition to one. I would hate for a patient to start taking medication for a condition they don’t have based purely on ChatGPT’s advice.\n\nVery glad to hear that it has helped you OP, I hope you can get a formal diagnosis as well if necessary, and your condition continues to improve!",

    "body": "Well, I’m back again. It finally happened — an encounter with a completely wild Karen. It just happened today, and I’m still fuming about it. Obligatory “on mobile” warning. \n\nFriday’s are my day off from work, and as such I use them to run errands and such. Today I needed to go to the library and Walmart, so I hopped on the bus and started my day. Library went as normal— I picked up a few books to read over the work week and sipped on a latte before heading on the bus to Walmart. \n\nToday, a couple Girl Scouts had set up a table selling cookies outside, so I decided to grab a few boxes for me and my partners after my initial shopping was done. I got two boxes of Samoas and one box each of Thin Mints, Tagalongs, and Lemon-Ups. I didn’t have any room for the boxes in my backpack or in my Walmart bag, so I got an empty cardboard box from the stand to put my cookies in. Then I hopped back on the bus to go home. \n\nMy clearly-marked Girl Scout cookie box attracted the attention of the classic Karen — middle aged white lady with an “I want to speak to your manager” haircut. With her were two kids, EK (about 5), and a quieter kid QK who was around twelve. EK was eyeing my box, and tugged on his mom’s sleeve to point it out to her. \n\nEM: Excuse me, my son is hungry. Can he have a box of your cookies?\n\nMe: Uh, no? I bought these. They’re mine. If he asks nicely, he may have ONE cookie, but certainly not a box. \n\nEM: Oh come on, no one can just have ONE Girl Scout cookie. \n\nMe: Then you can go buy him a box. There’s —\n\nEM: *cuts me off* Give him a damn box! Go pick out what kind you want, sweetie. \n\nAt this point, I close the cardboard box and tell EK no directly, telling him I bought these cookies and I plan on sharing them with my girlfriend, to which EM gasps loudly. \n\nEM: How DARE you talk to my child about your gayness!\n\nMe: Well, I assumed EK could see the buttons on my backpack (I had three Pride buttons, a big rainbow one, one that read “Yay for Gay,” and one that has my they/them pronouns on it). The point is, these are my cookies and your behavior is setting an awful example for your kids. \n\nEM: HOW DARE YOU CALL ME A BAD MOTHER, YOU FAGGOT???\n\nMaybe someone calmer would have simply gotten off the bus, but it was nowhere near the station and I had to transfer to get home. I simply looked EM in the eye and said, with the sweetest smile on my face, “Girl Scouts have been enlisting trans girls since their founding. So if you hate ‘faggots’ so much, maybe don’t beg a stranger for cookies that support gay rights, lady.”\n\nQK spoke up: Mom, it’s almost our stop. And you can make Thin Mints at home, you did it before. \n\nMe: That’s a good idea. Just don’t use essential oils unless they’re specifically marked food safe, my mom is a nurse and had someone come in after accidentally ingesting peppermint oil (not entirely true, I read a post about it online, and my mom is a phlebotomist, but Karen didn’t need to know that). \n\nEM: Don’t tell me what to do!\n\nShe snatches up her purse and gets off the bus at the next stop, and I proceeded to type out this post. Stay safe from the wild Karen’s out there, folks. And don’t make cookies with essential oils.",

We LEGALLY can't open a box of cookies we didn't buy\n3. Alot of people who take free samples are teenagers or Karens that end up buying nothing. When girl scouts only gives a troop 75¢ per every box sold, it's important to sell as many boxes as possible.\nEvery year, I take the leftover troop funds along with the money from cookie season to take the girls somewhere nice in the summer; as a reward for their hard work. I can't do that if people take free samples and don't pay. So please, as a rule of thumb, don't ask for free samples.

I go to a small community college and most of the time I dread my classes not because of the content, but all the people who smell horrifically of marijuana. It's legal here for ages 21+, but most of these people are not 21. What's even worse is the people who I encounter that use it are the most rude and unpleasant classmates. At this point I think I'd rather smell body odor all day. It's to the point where I wear gloves (because I'm cold) but put peppermint oil on them so I can hold it to my nose when the people around me smell. \n\nThis isn't a hit on people who smoke weed, but a) most are doing it illegally and b) yes, you do smell. Please spare us. \n\nI'm transferring in the fall to a university, someone please tell me if it's the same everywhere or is it just my campus. \n\nTLDR: People are smelling up the classrooms with marijuana and I hate it.

But every year that went by it only got worse even though I was feeling happy and healthy. My sister was the one who realized we have genetic AGA.\n\nOnce I realized what was causing it, I went down the Reddit rabbit hole trying to find solutions. The problem for me was that nearly every post was of someone using minoxidil or finasteride.\n\nFor a number of reasons, I have not and don't plan to use either of these. And so I wanted to make a post for other people who are in the same boat and want to see what results look like without those drugs.\n\nRegimen:\n\nI microneedled with a 1.5 mm dermaroller one time between these two photos, about two weeks ago. The first picture was taken December 21st, 2020, and the second today January 14th, 2021.\n\nRoughly every third night, I also put about 10 drops each of Rosemary oil and peppermint oil in a little bit of rosehip seed oil to carry it, and rubbed it all through my scalp. then I would put a towel or muslin blanket on my pillow, and sleep with it in overnight. Then I shampooed in the morning.\n\nI think I've only used the oils five times in the span of these pictures. And my microneedled once. I'm pretty happy with the results and I'm looking forward to what the next 6 months will bring!\n\nI plan to start microneedling a bit more often, and I'm also thinking about purchasing the i Restore laser helmet. I will do my best to keep adding updates as I go along.\n\nIf it's been a few months and there's no update, feel free to respond here and I will try to get new photos lined up.",

He immediately offered his help - Thank Nico!. Then we cleaned ~3 hours. 250 bottles of wine, and even more wine boxes. At first i thought that he was sitting in bread crumbs/grains, but after a closer look they turned out to be insects eggs and larvae. Shit and piss stained all over the clothes, bathroom and floor. The toilet - i don't even know how to create such a mess. Tomorrow we finish the job...i want the apartment to be clean before he goes into hospital on tuesday, otherwise the infestation will take over the whole place. \n\n\nThis human being doesn't function anymore - he needs permanent help. He possesses nearly nothing in clothes (all dirty), a TV and a couch. All he got is his bad health. This happens regularly, but this was my first experience with him, since he refused my visits in the past.\nSince yesterday I had a troubled mind (mental problems, my nerves are tickling), Cleaning up that shithole really put me in another place, so i'd consider it an overall success, if only the stank wouldn't persist to stay in my nose. \nThanks for reading.\n\nedit: Thank you very much for all the positive response. \n       I'd especially like to thank Nico for helping me and the kind redditor that gave me my first gold ever.\n\nMultiple people suggested peppermint oil & mask. - thank you very much - we will use that tomorrow for sure.\nI will also involve social services as i cannot leave him on his own and i cannot take care of him permanently.",

    "body": "**2024 HUGE UPDATE (AI + DERMATOLOGISTS)**\n\nWE'VE BUILT AN AI THAT CAN HELP DETECT YOUR HAIR LOSS WITHIN SECONDS: [TrichoAI](https://scandinavianbiolabs.com/pages/hair-loss-ai)\n\nThis update is aimed at providing a more practical go-to guide on what goes where as compared to a list of all possible treatments. The old guide has been archived [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12nvg2scUcaZdH-wNFhUtQwhPM3cWU6PCiQQNOQp9C6I/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nPlease don't comment or message me to add A, B, or C treatment - the writer only included those that he has worked with and saw results.\n\n^(Disclaimer: Although written by a board-certified dermatologist, this is not a substitute for any medical advice. Please visit your healthcare specialist.)\n\nHair loss is a common issue affecting millions of people worldwide. Understanding its causes, treatments, and prevention methods can help you take control of your hair health. In this comprehensive guide, we will discuss various factors contributing to hair loss, different hair loss conditions, their effective treatments, and other steps you can take to maintain healthy hair.\n\n# What factors can cause hair loss?\n\n1. **Genetic Factors:** Hereditary hair loss, also known as androgenetic alopecia, is the most common cause of hair loss. It affects both men and women and is characterized by a receding hairline and thinning hair.\n2. **Hormonal Imbalances:** Hormonal fluctuations due to pregnancy, menopause, or conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can lead to hair loss.\n3. **Nutritional Factors:** A balanced diet is crucial for hair health. Deficiencies in nutrients such as iron, zinc, vitamin D, and B vitamins can contribute to hair loss.\n4. **Medical Conditions:** Thyroid disorders, autoimmune diseases like alopecia areata, and scalp infections can cause hair loss.\n5. **Medications and Treatments:** Certain medications and treatments, including chemotherapy, can lead to temporary or permanent hair loss.\n6. **Stress:** Both physical and emotional stress can cause hair loss by triggering telogen effluvium, a temporary hair-shedding condition.\n\n# Identifying your type of hair loss\n\nThere are many hair loss types, and knowing which one you have can be very beneficial when treating it.\n\nFirst, it's essential to understand the difference between androgenetic alopecia (male or female pattern baldness) and non-androgenetic alopecia (non-pattern hair loss).\n\nThe former affects men and women differently - men generally have a receding hairline at their temples, while women tend to experience general thinning throughout the scalp.\n\nThe latter includes rarer forms, such as alopecia totalis (total scalp baldness), alopecia universalis (total body baldness), and telogen effluvium (i.e. brief shedding after childbirth or major surgery).\n\n# How to treat your hair condition?\n\nThis is designed so you know the most effective treatments for each condition. This is by no means an exhaustive list, it's just a list of the most popular ones.\n\n# Receding hairline\n\nA receding hairline is a common condition that affects millions of men worldwide, typically caused by heredity, hormones, aging, and other factors. The condition usually appears in males between 30 and 40 years old.\n\n# Symptoms of a receding hairline include:\n\n* Thinning or balding on the top of the head\n* Widening part line and sparse hair on the temples\n* Itchy, flaky scalp\n* Patches of thicker, darker hair or bald spots near the back of the scalp where new hairs do not grow\n* Increased shedding from other parts of the body, such as eyebrows and eyelashes\n* Weaker or finer hair on the scalp leading to breakage\n\n# Recommended treatments for a receding hairline:\n\n1. Essential oils: Natural treatment options like peppermint oil, rosemary oil, and lavender oil can help stimulate blood circulation, reduce inflammation, and promote healthy scalp conditions. Massage these oils into the scalp twice daily for the best results.\n2. Minoxidil: This over-the-counter medication can be applied directly to the scalp to promote the growth of new hairs in areas affected by receding hairlines. Use minoxidil as directed for optimal results.\n3. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) treatment: PRP therapy involves drawing a patient's blood, processing it to concentrate the platelets, and then injecting the platelets into the scalp. This treatment can promote hair growth but may be expensive and suitable only for some individuals.\n\n# Male Pattern Baldness (MPB):\n\nMale pattern baldness is a common form of hair loss among men caused by genetic and hormonal factors. It usually begins with the thinning of hair on the temples and crown of the head, resulting in a receding hairline or bald spots. In some cases, it can even lead to complete baldness.\n\n# Symptoms of male pattern baldness:\n\n* Gradual thinning of hair at the crown or top of the head\n* Receding hairline around the temples and a generally sparse appearance\n* Increased shedding\n* Excessive oiliness or dryness of the scalp\n* Irritation or inflammation\n* In advanced cases, bald spots may form on the scalp or forehead\n\n# Recommended treatments for male pattern baldness:\n\n1. Medications: Topical minoxidil and oral finasteride are both available to treat male pattern baldness. Minoxidil can be applied directly to the scalp twice a day to promote hair growth, while finasteride is a pill that reduces the production of DHT, the hormone linked to male pattern baldness.\n2. Hair Transplants: Hair transplants involve removing healthy hair follicles from the back or sides of the head and implanting them into areas where hair has been lost. This surgical solution can be successful but costly and may not be suitable for everyone.\n3. Scandinavian Biolabs Hair Growth Routine: Designed to address early-stage non-scarring hair loss, including androgenetic alopecia, this natural hair growth solution harnesses the power of bioactive ingredients to help strengthen hair, reduce hair loss, and stimulate new growth.\n\n# Alopecia Areata:\n\nAlopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder that causes patchy hair loss on the scalp, face, and other parts of the body. The immune system attacks hair follicles, leading to hair loss in small, round patches.\n\n# Symptoms of alopecia areata (continued):\n\n* Sudden onset of one or more round, smooth patches of hair loss on the scalp or other body parts\n* The skin in these areas is usually not inflamed or scaly\n* Scaling and inflammation on the scalp\n* Dandruff-like flaking\n* Hair loss on other areas of the body, such as the beard or eyebrows\n* Sometimes, the affected area may have a burning or itchy sensation\n\n# Recommended treatments for alopecia areata:\n\n1. Topical corticosteroids: These medications help reduce inflammation in the scalp and promote hair regrowth. Intralesional corticosteroids may also be used for this purpose.\n2. Medications like minoxidil and anthralin can help promote hair regrowth in some individuals.\n3. Scalp-cooling caps or cold caps can be used to reduce inflammation and improve the effectiveness of topical corticosteroids.\n4. Immunotherapy: This treatment stimulates an immune response to promote hair regrowth and may be beneficial for some people with alopecia areata.\n\n# Telogen Effluvium:\n\nTelogen effluvium is a temporary increase in hair shedding caused by various factors, such as stress, illness, surgery, or significant weight loss. Hair shedding typically occurs 2-3 months after the triggering event and can last for several months before resolving.\n\n# Symptoms of telogen effluvium:\n\n* Rapid, noticeable thinning or shedding of scalp hair\n* Excessive amounts of hair in the shower drain or on pillows after sleeping\n* Small \"peach fuzz\" hairs on the scalp\n* Visible scalp through thinning hair\n* Itching, burning, or redness of the scalp\n* Loss of eyebrows or eyelashes in some cases\n\n# Recommended treatments for telogen effluvium:\n\n1. Address the underlying cause: Treat hormonal imbalances or nutritional deficiencies that may be contributing to hair loss. This may involve taking medications or supplements to balance hormones and provide essential nutrients.\n2. Stress management: Practice relaxation techniques such as yoga and meditation to help reduce stress levels.\n3. Medications: Prescription medications like minoxidil (Rogaine) and finasteride (Propecia) can help reverse telogen effluvium by promoting hair growth.\n4. Hair transplant: In some cases, a hair transplant may be necessary to restore lost hair due to telogen effluvium. This involves removing healthy follicles from the back of the head and transplanting them to areas of thinning or baldness.\n5. Scandinavian Biolabs Hair Growth Routine: This natural hair growth solution is recommended for early-stage non-scarring hair loss, including telogen effluvium. The Hair Growth Routine's bioactive ingredients can help strengthen hair, reduce hair loss, and promote new growth.\n\n# Anagen Effluvium:\n\nAnagen effluvium is a type of hair loss caused by an interruption to the normal growth cycle of the hair follicle. This can occur when the cells producing new hairs are damaged or destroyed, leading to rapid hair shedding. Chemotherapy treatments, some medications, certain medical conditions, and nutritional deficiencies can trigger anagen effluvium.\n\n# Symptoms of anagen effluvium:\n\n* Rapid hair loss, usually within 2 to 4 weeks after the triggering event\n* Hair thinning, with a reduction in overall hair volume\n* Patches of baldness on the scalp or other areas of the body where hair is present\n* Brittle, easily broken hair\n* An itchy, scaly scalp or lesions on the scalp or other body areas with hair loss\n* Eyebrows and eyelashes may be affected in some cases\n\n# Recommended treatments for anagen effluvium:\n\n1. Minoxidil: This topical medication can be applied directly to the scalp to help stimulate hair growth and reduce hair loss.\n2. Steroid injections: Corticosteroid injections can help suppress scalp inflammation and promote hair regrowth.\n3. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy: This treatment involves taking a blood sample from the patient and injecting it into the scalp to stimulate hair growth.\n4. Hair transplantation: For severe cases of anagen effluvium, a hair transplant may be necessary to restore lost hair. The hair follicles are taken from another area of the scalp and implanted in the affected area.\n5. Hair Nutrient Tablets by Scandinavian Biolabs: These multivitamins are enriched with essential nutrients like zinc, riboflavin, and other vitamins that support healthy hair growth.\n\n# Traction Alopecia:\n\nTraction alopecia is hair loss caused by prolonged, constant tension on the scalp. It can occur from hairstyles that pull too tightly on the follicles, such as tight buns, braids, and ponytails. Traction alopecia is commonly seen in African Americans, but anyone can be affected by it.\n\n# Symptoms of traction alopecia:\n\n* Thinning hair and bald patches in areas repeatedly exposed to tight hairstyles\n* Tenderness or burning sensations on the scalp and itching\n* Inflammation or open sores (known as folliculitis) due to excessive tension placed on the hair follicles\n* Hair loss may spread beyond the initial area of damage, and other scalp issues, such as scarring or infections, may occur\n\n# Recommended treatments for traction alopecia:\n\n1. Removal of the cause: Avoid activities that cause excess tension on the scalp, such as tight hairstyles or clips. Wearing protective hairstyles, like loose braids or ponytails, can help prevent traction alopecia from reoccurring.\n2. Scandinavian Biolabs Hair Growth Routine: This natural hair growth solution is designed to address early-stage non-scarring hair loss, including traction alopecia. The Hair Growth Routine's bioactive ingredients can help strengthen hair, reduce hair loss, and promote new growth.\n3. Essential oil massage: Massaging the scalp with essential oils like lavender and rosemary can help stimulate hair growth. Alternatively, try a [hair protection oil](https://scandinavianbiolabs.com/products/hair-protection-oil) – a blend of essential and beneficial oils designed to revitalize your hair.\n4. Maintain a healthy diet: Ensuring a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle can improve the overall health of the scalp and hair. If left untreated, traction alopecia can lead to permanent baldness.\n\n# Scalp Psoriasis\n\nScalp psoriasis is a prevalent skin condition that affects millions of people globally. It is characterized by red, scaly patches on the scalp, leading to itching, burning, discomfort, and even hair loss. By understanding the symptoms and recommended treatments for scalp psoriasis, you can better manage this condition and reduce its impact on your hair health.\n\n# Symptoms of scalp psoriasis:\n\nDepending on the severity, symptoms of scalp psoriasis can vary. Common symptoms include:\n\n* Itchy, scaly patches on the scalp\n* Redness and inflammation\n* Thick, silvery scales or plaques that may appear as large patches\n* Hair loss in patchy areas\n* Burning or soreness\n* Stiffness in the scalp\n* Flaking skin that may appear on clothes or furniture\n\n# Recommended treatments for scalp psoriasis:\n\n1. Topical medications: corticosteroids, calcipotriol, coal tar products, dithranol, and salicylic acid.\n2. Oral or injected medications: to control inflammation and reduce scaling.\n3. Light therapy: beneficial for scalp psoriasis alone or combined with topical medications.\n4. Lifestyle changes: stress reduction, diet improvement, and regular exercise to reduce flare-ups.\n5. Self-care measures: avoid scratching the scalp, and use gentle shampoos designed for scalp psoriasis.\n\n# Trichotillomania\n\nTrichotillomania, or hair-pulling disorder, is a psychological condition marked by a recurrent urge to pull out one's hair. This behavior can lead to noticeable hair thinning, patchy baldness, or even complete hair loss in severe cases.\n\n# Symptoms of trichotillomania\n\nCommon symptoms associated with trichotillomania include:\n\n* Obsessive thoughts or urges to pull out hair\n* Feelings of tension before and relief after hair-pulling\n* Frequent playing with, twirling, or rubbing pulled-out hair\n* Inability to resist hair-pulling in specific situations or when experiencing certain emotions\n* Noticeable bald patches on the scalp and other areas of the body\n* Emotional distress related to hair-pulling, such as guilt or shame\n* Excessive grooming behaviors leading to hair loss, such as over-combing or brushing\n* Feelings of satisfaction when looking at pulled-out hair\n* Using techniques to disguise bald patches, such as wearing hats or frequently changing hairstyles\n\n# Recommended treatments for trichotillomania\n\n1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): helps identify and modify thoughts, feelings, and behaviors contributing to hair-pulling urges.\n2. Medications: antidepressants or antipsychotics to reduce hair-pulling urges and relieve symptoms.\n3. Habit Reversal Training (HRT): a type of CBT that helps identify and modify hair-pulling behaviors.\n4. Support Groups: provide a safe place to share experiences, build coping skills, and reduce stigma.\n\n# Female Pattern Baldness\n\nFemale pattern baldness, or androgenetic alopecia, is a common type of hair loss affecting millions of women worldwide. It usually begins in the 40s and can continue until menopause. The primary cause is an excess of androgens or male hormones, which causes hair follicles to shrink, leading to thinning hair on the scalp.\n\n# Symptoms of female pattern baldness\n\nCommon signs and symptoms include:\n\n* Gradual thinning on top of the head\n* Receding hairline, especially at temples\n* Widening of the center hair part\n* Increased hair shedding on a pillow in the morning\n* An overall decrease in scalp coverage\n* Visible bald patches (in advanced cases)\n* Hair shedding or breakage\n\n# Recommended treatments for female pattern baldness\n\n1. Medications: Finasteride (Propecia) and minoxidil (Rogaine) are commonly used to treat female pattern baldness. Finasteride blocks the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), while minoxidil promotes hair growth by increasing blood flow to the scalp.\n2. Laser Therapy: Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a non-invasive treatment shown to reduce hair loss and promote new hair growth in some women. It uses low-intensity lasers to stimulate the scalp, increasing circulation and encouraging follicles to enter the anagen phase of the hair growth cycle.\n3. Hair Transplant Surgery: This procedure involves transplanting healthy hair from an area of the scalp with thicker hair to balding areas. The transplanted hairs will grow naturally in the new location, providing a permanent solution to female pattern baldness.\n4. Scandinavian Biolabs Hair Growth Routine: Designed to address early-stage non-scarring hair loss, including androgenetic alopecia, this natural hair growth solution harnesses the power of bioactive ingredients to help strengthen hair, reduce hair loss, and stimulate new growth.\n\n# Hairline Recession & Thinning at The Crown\n\nHairline recession and thinning at the crown can be distressing for many people, especially those who had a full head of hair in their younger years. This issue affects both men and women but is more common in men.\n\n# Symptoms of hairline recession & thinning at the crown\n\n* Widening of the central and frontal hair part line\n* Visible scalp on forehead, temples, or crown areas\n* Reduced amount of hairs in specific areas\n* An overall decrease in fullness and body of hair along the parting line\n* Widening of the scalp line with a receding hairline\n* Hair loss in patches, mainly on the crown area\n* Breakage or shedding hairs along the parting lines or around the crown area\n\n# Recommended treatments for hairline recession & thinning at the crown\n\n1. Minoxidil: Minoxidil is a topical medication applied directly to the scalp, available in over-the-counter and prescription formulas. It stimulates hair growth and makes existing hairs stronger and thicker.\n2. Finasteride: This medication is taken orally, usually once a day, and works to block the production of DHT (dihydrotestosterone), a significant contributing factor in male pattern baldness.\n3. Platelet-rich Plasma Therapy: Platelet-rich plasma therapy (PRP) is a treatment that uses the patient's blood to stimulate hair growth. It injects the patient's plasma, containing high platelets and other healing factors, directly into the scalp.\n4. Hair Transplant: A hair transplant is a surgical procedure that involves transferring hair follicles from one part of the scalp to another. It can treat hairline recession and thinning at the crown.\n5. Laser Therapy: Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a newer form of treatment that uses light energy to stimulate hair growth. The lasers are typically painless and can treat both men and women experiencing hair loss.",

Then start doing sports ( any activity like yoga or pilates will do , walk more )Drink more water , sleep well , calm down your nerves. You need herb medications to bust your blood flow , to increase metabolism. Coconut oil mixed with ginger or red pepper or turmeric will only make your hair greasy and your scalp itchy . I tried it believe me . Nicotinic acid works a little  because it makes your blood flow betterIts  . It’s never a bad idea to consult a professional therapist . He can give individual recommendations which will work for you. For example Ashvagandha and Horsetail worked well for me . But if doesn’t mean that it will suit your dosha type.

    "body": "This was not today, but after a vacation to Maui my wife and I took 5 years ago. As people tend to do on vacations to Hawaii, we spent a great deal of time at the beach. One day we were boogie boarding at a beach and found that the waves would push you up onto the beach, then the undertow was strong enough to pull you back out to where the waves break, and you could just go up and down the beach with minimal effort. My back was exposed to the sun a lot. The rest of me did not fare much better as, by the end of the day, I appeared to be wearing a salmon colored t-shirt at all times and had red knee caps and shins. My wife was fine. Her skin is a darker complexion than mine, but I, the son of a ginger, burned. (Note: I applied and reapplied sunscreen throughout the trip. It didn't matter. Although, I'm sure it would have been worse without.)\n\nThe sunburn went away after a few days with some peeling, but no blistering, so I thought it was done. It was not. After 2-3 days at home, my back itched. Since the burn was gone, it did not hurt to scratch it, but scratching did not relieve the itch. It got worse to the point of being a persistent itch that felt like it was deep in the skin. I would find myself lying shirtless on the carpet, sliding back and forth to get some relief, but nothing helped. It was bad enough that I had trouble sleeping because I itched so badly. I tried aloe, heat, cold compress, nothing helped.\n\nFinally, I did some research and discovered I was suffering from Hell's Itch which can occur during or shortly after the healing of a bad sunburn. It is essentially what I have described, a deep, persistent itch that cannot be relieved by scratching. I tried several of the suggested methods to alleviate the itch and finally came across peppermint oil. Basically, it made my back feel so cold/almost numb that the itch wasn't the strongest sensation I was feeling and I was able to ignore it more easily than before. This got me through the ordeal. Start to finish, I dealt with this issue for about two weeks. It doesn't always last that long, but it certainly can.\n\ntl:dr - Got a bad sunburn, and ended up with a persistently itchy back that could not be relieved by scratching. This lasted 2 weeks.",

Here’s the deal:\n\nStep 1: Get ’Em Hard\n\t•\tIce cube: Classic. Rub for like 10 seconds, don’t overdo it or you’ll numb yourself.\n\t•\tCold air: Blast from an AC, fan, or canned air works in a pinch.\n\t•\tMenthol: A dab of Tiger Balm, Vicks, or peppermint oil (diluted!) can give a nice tingle. Test first so you don’t accidentally cry on camera.\n\t•\tManual tuning: Little rub or flick and you’re good. You’re a guitarist — you know how to use your hands.\n\nStep 2: Style It So It Doesn’t Look Like a Cry for Help\n\t•\tNo shirt? Own it. Throw on some body oil or bronzer if you’re feeling spicy. Good lighting (side or top) will help with definition.\n\t•\tWearing a shirt? Thin fabric like mesh, worn-in band tees, or even wetting the shirt slightly will give you that “just rocked too hard” look.\n\t•\tAccessories help: Necklaces, chains, or even a slightly off-center guitar strap can frame the chest like it’s on purpose.\n\t•\tCameras love confidence: Waist-up shot with a slight upward angle gives the chest some power without turning into OnlyFans.\n\nBonus Vibe Tips:\n\t•\tMake sure the mood matches the music. Glam, punk, metal? All fair game. Acoustic folk with hard nips might raise some questions.\n\t•\tDon’t overthink it — the best look is the one that feels natural (but maybe slightly dangerous).\n\nRock on. Stay hard (visually).",

I lost my 20s by sobbing on the bathroom floor while doctors told me it was just anxiety. I have never been able to work full time in my life.

They keep doing it. Then there was one I saw for peppermint oil. Instead of focusing on biologics that could help our inflammation or how to successfully treat a disease that needs to be reclassified as a type of tumor (it's organ tissue growing where it shouldn't that keeps regrowing no matter how many times its removed, so why is it not considered a noncancerous tumor??) they're focusing on yoga and peppermint oil. \n\nBut it's cool, I guess I'll just fucking do yoga.\n\nDefunding announcement: https://www.whi.org/md/news/whi-funding-announcement\n\nEdit: someone just legit told me to drink my own urine to cure to cure myself",

Apart from that, cardiologists are also focusing more on the differences between men and women. Same goes for pharmaceutical research. And this is also happening in the rest of the EU.

    "body": "This just happened last week and I have to keep it somewhat vague for privacy reasons due to my job. But, I am sure the sweet revenge comes through fine!  \n\n\nThis gentleman was a client of mine who required help with housework 3 times a week. (Or so the company was told prior to me being assigned to him.) I am really easy-going and as long as nobody is in danger or anything of that sort, I can bend a rule here and there or accept humans aren't perfect. However, issues with this man arose almost instantly...  \n\n\nHis file listed all his health issues, what I am needed to do in the home, and listed NOK (next of kin) as a daughter who DOES NOT reside on the property. (Hence why I was needed. This is important info to remember...) It was nothing I couldn't handle but what the file couldn't tell me was that all others assigned to him previously (co-workers I know well enough to trust without blinking) ran for the hills after one shift; maybe less. I was warned he was \"difficult\" but I got into this job after caring for dementia patients in the family so how much \"difficult\" could this be?  \n\n\nThe house had a permanent smell of sickness, smoke, and rotted ketchup but yet was not the worst I had dealt with; a little bleach, some gloves, and peppermint oil in my mask and it was cut down by 60%. My real issue came from the fact that the NUMBER 1 RULE is that the client (or NOK) must be on site for the whole shift. (Obviously, right?) But this gentleman often got home after I arrived and left well before I did. Annoying? Yes. Potentially problematic for me if something came up missing? Yep. But, I kept notes of everything for my boss and she assured me that as long as I kept my client files up-to-date, not to worry too much. (She was annoyed but not with me.) So, each day I'd keep note of what I did and how often the client vanished. However, by the second week, he stepped in it DEEP.  \n\n\nI showed up on time. The client? I waited 45 minutes; mostly so I could finish my lunch I'd grabbed on the way over. (A good burger is a terrible thing to waste, you know!) I stayed outside other than a 30-second walk-through of the house to make sure he was NOT on the property. Technically I am not allowed in the homes without a client there but after a few shifts, it's up to the worker/client if that happens or not. (Personally I am not comfortable in the home without a client/NOK.)   \n\n\nAfter the 45 minutes, I gathered my things and prepared to leave but the client showed up and demanded to know why I had not started cleaning yet. I responded with \"Company rule, Sir. Workers cannot be inside the home without a client/NOK around.\" He rolled his eyes and commanded me to \"Just get to it\". Strike one.  \n\n\nI followed him inside and he started telling me what he wanted me to do; fair enough. However, I told him how company rules AND the client contract stated he was to remain on the property the whole time I was there since that was the whole point of me being there. He LOST HIS MIND and began screaming and swearing on me about how I was lying and \"He wasn't a babysitter\". Strike two.  \n\n\nThen, the usually locked back room door opened and his daughter emerged. Turns out she lives in the home (remember: he told the company/me that she did NOT live there which is WHY he qualified to be a client at all) and had been \\*hiding in the bedroom the whole time I was there\\*. (That made things make more sense; I'd clean one room, move onto another, and come back to room 1 and find things different to how I left them and always heard footsteps but never found anybody in the home with me.) Strike three; I'm out. (Yes I could have just left when he was not there on arrival or when he got snarky with me but given his client info, I let it slide because he's human and sometimes we can all be a bit rude.)  \n\n\nShe demands what's wrong and he demands to speak to my boss \"because I am a f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* liar and he's going to get me fired!\" Hoo boy...I thought I smelled burnt toast because my brain went silent. I asked him \"Are you SURE you want to speak to her?\" He basically spat at me and hissed \"Yes! It's your job to do as I say!\" I nodded and dialed her number; putting it on speaker. I knew how this would end and did my best to stay close to watch the fireworks...  \n\n\nHe screamed and swore at my boss and demanded I be fired. My boss is a sweet but no-nonsense woman; I respect her a lot despite only personally interacting with her 3X. (I got this job back in March and largely only deal with the two workers below her who deal with clients and payroll. Both of which actually knew me previously as NOK for my great grandparents when this company helped with them when their dementia got too bad for just us to deal with. Which is WHY I chose to start working for them as soon as an opening came about.) She was quiet; a sign most people would know as \"You fucked up\". Not this client, however. He continued roaring down the phone at her until she simply said \"I'm going to transfer this call to (ClientPayRoll1/CPR1)...\" Within moments, she was on the line and before he could get his breath to unleash his rage on her? She simply said \"(Me) is right; you ARE legally required by our contract and policy to be on the property while (me) is there. They've been patient with you and have given you chances most others have not. However after today, (me) is no longer your worker. Actually? You can just go home now and enjoy your weekend; your updated client list for the week is in your inbox.\" She then hung up; I suspect she has a heavier phone so the \\*slam\\* is more satisfying. Of course, I was already half way down the driveway since it was within my rights to leave before the call; I just wanted to see his face when she told him I was right.  \n\n\nI got home and sure enough, my updated list was in the inbox with a note of \"Call the office ASAP\". So, I did and my boss apologized for me having to deal with that. She then handed the call to CPR1 who already had all my notes but went over them again and added that days events to them. She also apologized and promised she'd never send another worker over to his house; he'd been fired as a client and she'd sent a warning to all our sister locations AND \"rival\" companies (it's actually more like \"cousin locations\" cause we're all extended family) so that he couldn't abuse anybody again. SO the ONLY way he'd be able to re-apply is if a doctor personally called us and got him set up with us in the event his health gets to where he is 100% unable to do things himself. (To us, anyway. Cousin locations can choose to take him on if they wish but the names of the workers he's burned through is attached to his file so even if we went to a new company, we'd never be sent to him again.) CPR2 then got on the phone (CPR1 is a busy woman after-all) and she's all-too-happy to tell me she's happy \"someone finally stood up to him\" and how she was actually proud of me because I am SUPER shy and never speak up to defend myself. (She was actually the one who, when one of my references fell through, vouched for me and bumped me up the line to be hired. I am not supposed to know this but her brother plays cards with my mom and he's a \"secret spilling\" drunk...) She then tells me that since his daughter lives on the property, he's been caught in a lie and may have to pay back the govt since they paid the company to send him workers.  \n\n\nTLDR: Client has a habit of running off workers and taking advantage of them/the company who sent them. Decided to try and be a \"Karen\" and get me fired for literally following the contract. Instead he is the one who got fired and since he tried to lie and scam services he didn't need, he's likely going to be fined. Lesson of the day: Don't fuck with health-care people; we aren't paid to deal with abuse and therefore will not tolerate it.",

Needed a shower, but the bathroom funk smell was back, so I poured four or five drops of peppermint oil into each drain. Then I closed my toilet and set my clean clothes on it for my shower.\n\nI didn't open the toilet up again for hours. I forgot the peppermint oil was in there. I went in to take my pre bedtime shit, and the oil had arrosolized. My dearest Redditor, I don't know how familiar you are with peppermint oil. It covers up unwanted smells very well, but it's best used in very small doses. In a diffuser. Maybe in a different room. That shit will fuck up a mucous membrane, hence me using it to try to clear my sinuses in the shower. It is downright painful on any sort of sensitive skin, like an ass. Or vagina.\n\nIt hurts to walk. Or to exist. But hey, at least it doesn't smell like poop.\n\nTL;DR; peppermint gas bombed my ass and vag, and now existence is miserable until my nethers fully air out.\n\nUpdate: Slept all night and there's still some residual burning, but it's far more manageable.

And I decided that if I added some of that peppermint essential oil, it would help my back even more. \n\nSo I set the bath to filling and get the temperature right and as the bath fills I dump the bottle sideways so a little stream of essential oil pours out of the bottle. Maybe around 0.5 to 1 oz. I made sure it got into the stream of water from the sipgot, so it really dispersed through the water. \n\nAnd then I got in. And it burned, from the heat. \n\nAnd I sat down into it. And it kept burning. And burning. \n\nAnd then it wasnt just burning from the heat, but I was on FIRE below the waist. My back. Everywhere the water was touching me. It felt like I had maced my entire lower body.\n\nSo I started draining the tub, and turned on the shower, to try and wash off this burning shit, and the water stays warm for about 30 seconds and then turns ice cold. Which was not fun, combined with the mentholated experience my skin had become.\n\nSo I spent like 30 minutes showering off burning peppermint in ice cold water before turning it off and dragging myself into bed to shiver and ache and be miserable. \n\nYou only need a drop or two of essential oil in a bath. Not like a shot-glass worth. Lesson learned.",

A few years ago we had a hot summer and i was crispy sunburnt. \n\nPreviously I was gifted some bath oils and thought it would be a GREAT idea to use PEPPERMINT OIL in the bath, to cool down my skin.. “Peppermint make sunburn feel cool!” Big brain thought. Big brain is stupid and actually little. I wasn’t careful and dropped the bottle in the tub.\n\nIt was pure torture. Like fuck dude.\n\nThe peppermint latched onto all of my skin after spreading in the water and would burn/freeze it into an icy blast of pain if i sat still in the water. But if i moved, the hot/warm water felt like FIRE because of the oil! There was no middle ground, no relief. I tried to sit through it thinking it would just sting for a moment oh but i was so wrong.\n\nI never imagined i could suffer pure torture while smelling like a peppermint patty bliss.\nI couldn’t take it anymore, after draining the tub i had to shower it off.\n\n🥲 that was a bigger betterer brain idea. (Aka no, no it wasn’t.)\n\nI could only get cold water because I used up the hot water for the bath. My sunburn made it hard to get the oil off, and my nerves were overwhelmed and I could barely touch my skin. It felt like it was all going to slough off me any moment, every touch sent shock waves i could feel buzz through my teeth. \n\nI was huffing and puffing like i ran a marathon and crying through it all, and i was thankful that the one braincell who wasn’t still on vacation hung back to give me the foresight to no touch my face and eyes to wipe away the tears. \n\nI couldn’t use a towel. I refused to touch anything else.. i committed myself to just air drying and laying down on the bed and not moving at all for a bit….to RECOVER.\n\nI think the braincell took a coffee break, to make this a margarita of a wound…I hobbled out of the bathroom….into a room blasting ac. \n\nAfter being immersed in peppermint oil water.\n\nWith a sunburn akin to Larry the Lobster.\n\n\n\nTLDR; While sunburnt, I took a bath and dropped peppermint oil in the tub. It turned me into a peppermint patty of pain. Followed up by being freeze dried by the ac.",

Then you boil/remove away the water. Another extraction method is distilling them with steam and condensing that in to a liquid. Entirely depends what the compounds you want are. This distillation method is actually used a lot in traditional perfume making.\n\nWhat is left is the *essence*, basically concentrated flower juice.\n\nNow... Whether they actually do anything. This is important: **If the plant that you are extracting the oil from has an active compound that does something**, and it survives the extraction process and is in form where it can do something in your body, **then the essential oil it actually does something**. This has been and still is used in medical manufacturing for extraction of compounds that are derived from plants. So if a medicine has something that was derived from plants, it basically has \"essential oil\". Although in medicine only the active compound is used. Because modern medicine relies on correct dosages and purity of active ingredients. \n\nBut here is a thing. If you feel like the oil is helping you to relax for example, then it is beneficial and has an effect. But if they promise anything more than that, then they probably all bullshitting. And basically never don't because far as I know nowhere at least in the sphere of western medicine are you allowed to claim medical benefits without proving that.\n\nBut if an plant has an active compound that can be extracted in to the oil and consumed from it. Then yes... It can work... not because it is essential oil, but because there is something active in it. Because then it is like saying \"Drinking this beverage will get you drunk... because it has alcohol in it\".",

Oil doesn't mix with water, and peppermint is a plant, so maybe it's relatively safe, but it could also slowly accumulate until it hits a critical point and crashes the tank.

Turns out mice are afraid of rats, a rats odor can be a deterrent and it scares em off.

I have been using a staple gun to close off the backs of cabinets and wall units, I'm currently reworking all of our dresser drawers to prevent them from trying to get in for nesting. We have been using peppermint oil religiously, my gf has suggested chili pepper flakes since she used to live in the country and dealt with this problem as a child.\n\nI feel kinda lost and like the mice are winning. We use electric traps, which have caught maybe 20 mice in a month or so.\n\nWhat advice can reddit give me to try and save the apartment I currently want to stay in (rent is very reasonable)\n\nThis is somewhat of a new problem, a tenant in this building passed away and his apartment was gutted, the mice had nowhere else to go. My girlfriend and I are a cluttered people, but we are not unclean, we do not leave food openly available to mice and most of our bagged/perishable foods like rice and oatmeal have always been kept in one of my plethora of mason jars.\n\nHelp! I'd rather save for downpayment on a nice house than waste money moving to a place with double the rent. These little bastards are trying to eat my houseplants!! Grrrr!\n\nE: The response I have received in this sub is honestly heart warming. I cant thank you all enough for taking time out of your days to share wisdom and tactics with me.

The (really bad) scent of a dead decaying mouse brings other mice. \n\nSnap traps are the most reliable, even if they're awful. They will (mostly) kill the mouse fast instead of letting it scream under your fridge for 6 hours on a glue trap. Don't be too surprised if you find a mouse head or leg or whatever separated from the rest of the mouse either, those traps can be STRONG. Use poison too, if you can put it in places where your dog can't reach (like inside a mouse hole, right before you seal it up). And put 2-3 traps in the same spot. Mice like to run near walls, and they learn where to go from other mice. So even if you kill one, there are still a bunch that \"know\" the same route.\n\nFind their popular pathways by looking for grime. They're pretty dirty, so they leave \"mouse grease\" around holes that they've been using a lot to go in and out.\n\nAlong with not leaving food out, you probably can't leave dog food out for your dog either. He's gotta eat, then you put it away. Because otherwise, dog food becomes mouse food.\n\nMy magic combo was always steel wool + expansion foam. A mouse can chew through that but it takes a long time, up to a year. Put steel wool around all water pipes that come into your apartment, really pack it in tight. Check behind your stove too, there could be a pipe back there for gas. Got heat pipes? steel wool at the bottom *and top*. Mice can climb vertical if there's even the tiniest of footholds. They can go through a hole or a crack the size of a dime. Any gaps in the moldings around doors? They can come in through there also.\n\nAnd if you have the stomach for it, which I know is a hard ask on this: Wear shoes with heavy soles inside your house. Stomp them. It's disgusting and their organs splash. The cleanup isn't fun. But, if you can tolerate that more than you can tolerate the mice in your house, well... it's effective.\n\nYou might be able to seal off your dresser a bit better if it has legs on it- you can get risers for it, or an empty and clean 2-liter soda bottle with the top cut off for each leg (just plunk the leg into the soda bottle, like a vase), so a mouse can't even get to the dresser.\n\nSource: a disgusting landlord and  super who refused to do anything about a 2-year mouse problem, and a 5-year job at a filthy grocery store where you could get a mouse up your pants leg if you stood at the register too long. \n\nHopefully there's not too many typos or unclear things in here. Good luck!",

The others are cockroaches, ants (3 different kinds), mosquitoes and geckos.\n\nFor the rat problem, I have tried all the conventional stuff from traps and poisons but the rats never left. The problem with traps and poisons is that they use bate.  So we were having to keep the traps and keep killing rats. For about 2 years, we had to deal with the death screams and smell of dead rats on a weekly basis. We probably killed 20 rats, but they just kept coming.\n\nFinally, we heard about camphor as a repellent. Turns out, nothing likes the smell of camphor. It is even worse than chili pepper,  which I also tried.\n\nI started putting raw crystal camphor (it is like sugar only clumpy and sticky) in the ceiling space and in the attic space.  I started by adding more about every 3 months, then every 6 months.  Now, we sometimes hear a rat enter the ceiling but they leave about 1 minute later.\n\nToday, there are no rats scratching and running around in our ceiling space anymore.  I haven't killed any rats, or smelled dead rat in 4 years.  Also, turns out mosquitoes, ants and cockroaches don't like camphor either. It is an all natural pest repellent.\n\nThere is a strong smell when you first apply camphor,  but it goes away after a few days.  Camphor is a natural mineral, it is not toxic (unless you eat it), and its smell will be much better than the homes of geriatric men, cat people, hoarders, and folks with bad hygiene.  In fact, you may find the camphor smells like strong perfume.",

You assume that mice are *there*, but you need to create an environment that's inhospitable to them. eg my house's old owner had a bad mouse problem, and she'd split the house into a duplex, but her response was always reactive. I find (many active) mouse traps all over the house, sticky glue with legs still attached, big piles of poop, etc. My response was to junk what I can, seal up the walls, fill every hole with the proper material (also good for weatherproofing), bleach, and just make it the kind of place mice don't want to be. Fingers crossed, but looking great so far.\n\nI'll say that stapling things shut may only make things harder. Mice are practically able to convert to a liquid form and fly through the tiniest of holes, so unless you seal properly (caulk, drywall patch with joint compound, steel plates w/ caulk, etc.) you won't be doing much. The smells they track will still make it through too.\n\nUnfortunately for you, this is the biggest downside of renting in a duplex/triplex/etc. vs a new condo/townhouse with concrete walls. Making a firm barrier between you and the other units is virtually impossible, so if all the other tenants dgaf you may be SoL. Best I can say is that if you think you're cluttered but clean, you're probably not actually clean.

    "body": "Hey lovelies!\n\nHere are somethings I learned while on this journey. I'm hoping it can help someone else out. Please feel free to add/subtract/share your stories with this.\n\nThis post is for people who believe in doctors/medications, not for people who prefer ONLY natural remedies. However, see points 16,17, 30 for natural remedies.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Disclaimer: this is just my experience, it might not actually be the be what works for you. I'm using 5% minox foam, one time a day, and this is what I've learned. I will regularly edit this as more things come to mind. Please drop a comment about what you think!:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. There are 4 stages of hair growth. Anagen (growing), Catagen (transition), Telogen (resting), and exogen (shedding) stages. Minoxidil works first by causing the exogen to speed up, and then works backwards to Telogen, and kindly causes those resting hairs to shed as well. This is what happens in the first 'dread shed', which can last anywhere from 2-8 weeks.\n2. At any given time, approx. 10% of hair is in the resting phase. This is what falls out first.\n3. Increasing circulation in your scalp is what keeps your hair in the Anagen phase, but that will also eventually shift into Catogen, and so on.\n4. This dread shed is a good sign that your scalp is reacting well to Minox. Minox is a vasodilator and acts by providing more oxygen to your scalp. This oxygen is what provides the follicles with the proper nutrients to go back to Anagen and Catogen phase.\n5. If you start applying minoxidil to a specific location, you need to continue to apply it there. Stopping while using minoxidil will cause the hair to go back to its deoxygenated strand.\n6. Minox is not going to replace healthy hair from a healthy lifestyle. You need to eat well and get some exercise in, no matter what formulation you use.\n7. Minox works well with other vitamins such as Viviscal, Nutrafol, and other multivitamins.\n8. Rest also plays a crucial role in hair regrowth. Increased cortisol (stress hormone) may cause increased hairloss. Adults should aim for 7-9 hours daily, or however your doctor prescribes.\n9. While other people may have faster results than some when using minox, it should be noted that their hair cycle may be a bit different than yours. Results are usually seen by 6 month mark. Some might not even have dread shed.\n10. If you have dread shed, just note, it will be everywhere. Sweaters, drains, floors, everywhere. It is distressing. Take a deep breath but do not stop using until told by a doctor.\n11. Here are a couple of items that have helped reduce the friction/breakage caused by everyday activities: Boar-bristle brushes, velvet/silk hair scrunchies, silk/satin pillow cases, silk night caps.\n12. Be as gentle as you can possibly be with your hair.\n13. You will/should normally shed anywhere with 50-100 hairs a day. It might look like more if you have thicker or longer hair, and it might look like less if you have thinner and shorter hair.\n14. Hair volume and hair density are not the same thing. Density is the number of strands. Volume is the thickness of each strand. anything 3+ inches thick when wrapped in a ponytail is considered thick hair. 2-3 is medium thick. <1 is thin.\n15. Applying minox at night and using a combination of rosemary oil/peppermint oil the day of the wash (wake up earlier and apply \\~1 hour before shower, if morning shower) will also help with increased circulation.\n16. Rosemary and peppermint oils are natural vasodilators. Sting like hell if you get it in your eye. To use, add a couple of drops to a carrier oil (coconut, jojoba, castor) and apply to affected areas. Caution: these things are pungent.\n17. Taking a warm shower (not washing hair)  half an hour before application helps with pores on the scalp to open up and may increase absorption.\n18. Sweat on hair will reduce minoxidil absorption.\n19. Dermarolling may increase absorption. The thickness of the dermaroller may vary by scalp and by ethnicity. usually 1.5mm is thick enough. Do not use this everyday. Start by parting hair and rolling back and forth in one direction. You should not bleed profusely. Roll over all affected areas. Start with 1x every two weeks, then increase as you see fit. Beware, things maybe marked as 1.5mm needles when they're not. Best to measure if you can. Ones with needles may work better than wheel dermarollers. Sanitize after every use. Replace every few months, as needles might become dull.\n20. To avoid cutting the hair accidentally, may work better if hair is wet. Apply minox after dermarolling, maybe 20-30 minutes, as you feel comfortable.\n21. AGA (androgenic alopecia) and TE (telogen effluvium). AGA can be hormonal, where TE might be caused by stress.\n22. Hairloss caused by TE usually grows back if conditions change.  Stress management is unbelievably important in hair regrowth.\n23. Any sort of anesthesia can cause TE. Yes, even something as small as wisdom tooth removal.\n24. Continued use of minox is the only way to see && keep the results. It is a lifestyle you must commit to, only stopping when doctor says so (pregnancy && breastfeeding).\n25. As of today, Minox is the only FDA approved medication to treat hair loss, even for continued use. Using a stronger dosage of Minox won't necessarily help, past the 5% as the efficacy plateaus at 5%.\n26. There are things called DHT blockers which stop testosterone from being converted into a harmful chemical that causes hair to go into early telogen/exogen phases. These things include saw palmetto and things of the like. However, do not use this supplement until cleared by a doctor as it may cause side affects for child bearing women.\n27. Pura d'or is a brand that makes shampoo specifically with topical biotin and DHT blockers. Ask doc/do research/try if it's best for you.\n28. Do not let minox drip down on your face. it might cause hair growth on your face. unless you want that! more power to you!!! After application, wash hands and face.\n29. Might not be suitable for people with pets. Be sure to talk to a doctor/do your own research before beginning anything.\n30. Garlic, onions, ginger, curry leaves are known natural foods that help with hair loss.\n31. **Shedding is different than hair loss.** Shedding is when you see strands fall on your bed sheets, sink, counters, etc. Loss is when your hair physically miniaturizes (shrinks/breaks in size).\n32. It is impossible to tell to the naked eye what is miniturized and what is new growth, but some say tapered ends of hair strands mean miniturized and hair that sticks up when dry is new growth.However, this is a bit of conjecture as hair that hasn't been cut before might look tapered. Best to have a derm take a look. \n33. if you feel lightheaded when applying minox, it's a sign that you applied too much.\n34. PATCH. TEST. FIRST. TO SEE. IF YOU. HAVE. ANY DAMN. REACTIONS TO THIS! don't just straight up apply. you could be allergic.\n35. Some people may have adverse dermatological (aging faster, wrinkles) or oxotoxic (tinnitus) effects. Stop use if you experience any of these and talk to a doctor, but know that these are rare.\n36. Purchase a scalp scrubber brush, to really clean your scalp if you are going days between washing hair, but using minox.\n37. Always, always ALWAYS, apply to a dry scalp. the foam, at least, takes 3-4 hours to be absorbed.\n38. LIGHTING. IS. EVERYTHING. it may make your hair loss look worse than it actually is.\n39. Please use common sense. If you have hormonal deficiencies or vitamin deficiencies, no matter *what* you use, you might not see results until the underlying problem is addressed. ***One of the most common vitamin deficiencies is Vitamin D. Unbalanced Vitamin D levels can cause hair loss.*** \n40. Don't be afraid to get a second opinion from another dermatologist. Hair loss can also be an endocrine problem (endocrine system regulates hormones), check out an endocrinologist if still concerned. They may assign some bloodwork, maybe regularly. \n41. Protein intake is extremely important for hair regrowth. Your hair is primarily made of protein and sulfate bonds. For the average sedentary woman, you need 46 grams/day. DRI says 0.36 grams of protein per pound, adjust as you see necessary. Be careful, however, too much protein maybe stored as fat. \n\nI am a very impatient person. I blame technology for a part of this. What helped me out is to have a physical daycount of how many days have gone by and how many days more I have left before I hit 3 months. Then i'll do it again for another 3 months. ***These things take time. Let them, and give it an honest effort. Do not stop using it when you see more hair falling out. wish that weak, deoxygenated hair a good riddance. better, thicker strands will replace this one. Just because it has/hasn't worked for someone in the past, doesn't mean it will/won't work for you. Hair is individual, your doctor will know best.***\n\nhere is a silly thing that kept me going. Above my line of vision at my desk, I have a post it note that says the following: \"Take your time, things will get better. Do your best. take a deep breath. It will happen. It will be okay.\" If you made it this far in the post, I am giving you the biggest virtual hug I possibly can. My inbox is ALWAYS open to vents/rants. Sometimes it's easier to vent to a stranger. Don't keep this anxiety bottled up inside, it's not good for anyone.\n\nyou are beautiful. with or without hair, you are beautiful. It sucks what you're going through. Believe me, I know. keep your head up, and do everything you can. you will see a change in due time. Do not compare your chapter 1 to someone else's chapter 4. Commit to this. You got this, babe! Celebrate every little victory!\n\nLast of all, do NOT, by any means, let ANYONE belittle you because of something you cannot control. Do NOT be ashamed of this. this is something that affects a lot of women, and we have been stigmatized to not only not discuss this with other women (WTF, right?) but also fall prey to hair care scams across the internet. Do your research, and stay informed. You are doing your absolute best. That is the only thing anyone can ask of you, and more importantly, you can ask of yourself. This takes time. I repeat, this takes time.",

Which is where modern medicine shows its worth.\n\nThat said, there are astonishingly numerous sources from the Roman Empire that deal with digestive issues.

Yet I would not interpret those texts through an IBS perspective since issues like infections or other diseases seem more likely.\n\nFrom the European Middle Ages we have quite a lot of sources that deal with medications, many of them also deal with digestion. They had quite a range from love potions to opiates. But far from having proof that such a complex problem like IBS was described, at least from what I read.\n\nPeople \"back then\" had a good chance of becoming quite old if they survived birth and childhood (vaccines for childhood diseases are an incredible blessing, for adults, too).

Does anyone have any experience/success with making their own toothpaste?\n\nEdit: think Im crazy? This is where I got the idea from! [Zero Waste Vice] (https://youtu.be/cd48LW3qeNE)\n\nI know I know… internet cannot be more reliable than dental professionals… but DANG! She made that toothpaste look effective af, and zero waste. I also love natural diy projects and have made many other successful products already. My dentist even uses baking soda rinse to finalize my periodic clean, so I really thought this recipe was harmless! … in regards to neem, I had used Theraneem products before and was considered a healthy dental patient! I also liked the idea of coconut oil for its whitening, antimicrobial and oil pulling benefits. \n\nHoney: ofcourse, my intention is always to increase my health instead of reducing it… just because I’ve looked for zero waste/natural alternatives does not mean I do not prioritize my health. If I didn’t, I could have simply chosen to brush my teeth with dirt. I chose specific ingredients said to combat specific dental issues. My confusion of honey came from a toothpaste I had which used propolis. I was misguided and thought propolis and honey had similar values.\n\nI have nothing against fluoride and very much encourage any suggestions with fluoride in it as a way to help restore my enamel!\n\nFinal edit: I hereby accept my title as the new Gorilla Glue girl 😔",

If you're an adult, another week without flouride won't hurt you. Childhood flouride has a much bigger impact than it does in adulthood, as I understand it.

    "body": "It sounds like this compound has a lot of potential. It's as reportedly as effective as DEET or picaradin and lasts just as long. The only potential downside for the backcountry would be the grapefruit scent. Either way, it's nice to see a new alternative come to the market.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/health/tick-mosquito-repellant-nootkatone.html\n\n> The E.P.A. has approved nootkatone, which is found in cedars and grapefruit. It repels ticks, mosquitoes and other dangerous bugs for hours, but is safe enough to eat.\n\n> Adding a new weapon to the fight against insect-borne illnesses like Lyme disease and malaria, the Environmental Protection Agency on Monday approved a new chemical that both repels and kills ticks and mosquitoes.\n\n> The chemical, nootkatone, an oil found in cedar trees and grapefruits, is so safe that it is used by the food and perfume industries.\n\n> Nootkatone is considered nontoxic to humans and other mammals, birds, fish and bees, the E.P.A. said in a statement.\n\n> Diseases caused by the bites of ticks, mosquitoes and fleas have tripled in the United States in the last 15 years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a 2018 report. They include Lyme disease, anaplasmosis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever from ticks; West Nile, dengue, Zika and chikungunya from mosquitoes; and plague from fleas.\n\n> In tropical countries, malaria and yellow fever are major killers; elephantiasis is also spread by mosquitoes. Lethal Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is spread by ticks, and kala azar is spread by sandflies.\n\n> Manuel F. Lluberas, a public health entomologist who has worked on mosquito-control campaigns all over the world, said he hoped that nootkatone would be accepted by people who fear synthetic repellents and that it could be made cheaply enough to be bought by foreign aid programs like the President’s Malaria Initiative.\n\n> The E.P.A. registration applies only to nootkatone as an active ingredient, the statement said. Any formulations using it in the future will have to be tested and registered separately.\n\n> The chemical repels mosquitoes, ticks, bedbugs and fleas — and, in high concentrations, kills them, according to the C.D.C. It may also be effective against lice, sandflies, midges and other pests, some of which can carry lethal diseases.\n\n> It is not oily, lasts for hours and has a pleasant grapefruit-like scent, said Ben Beard, deputy director of the division of vector-borne diseases at the C.D.C.\n\n> “If you drink Fresca or Squirt, you’ve drunk nootkatone,” Dr. Beard said.\n\n> Nootkatone works differently from previous classes of insecticides and can kill bugs that are resistant to DDT, pyrethroids and other common insecticides.\n\n> Experts in insect-borne diseases greeted the news with cautious enthusiasm.\n\n> “Its use as an insecticidal soap has great potential,” said Duane J. Gubler, a former C.D.C. chief of vector-borne diseases.\n\n> One proposed use is in soaps that people in tick-infested areas could shower with, repelling and possibly killing ticks that try to attach to them.\n\n> Joel R. Coats, a specialist in insect toxicology at Iowa State University, said his lab had tested nootkatone and found it to be “an impressive repellent but a weak insecticide.”\n\n> It repels ticks even better than synthetics like DEET, picaridin or IR3535 do, Dr. Coats said, and it is their equal at repelling mosquitoes.\n\n> Unlike citronella, peppermint oil, lemongrass oil and other repellents based on plant oils, he added, nootkatone does not lose its potency after about an hour, but lasts as long as the synthetics.\n\n> But although it can also kill insects, he said, doing that takes so much of the chemical that it may not be practical.\n\n> “Most plant terpenes will kill bugs if you go to a high enough dose, but I haven’t seen any data that supports using it as an insecticide,” Dr. Coats said, using a term for aromatic oils exuded by many plants to repel invasive insects. “I’ve seen lots of data on it as a repellent.”\n\n> Mikkel Vestergaard-Frandsen, owner of the Vestergaard company, which makes insecticide-impregnated nets to fight malaria, said he was interested in the compound, but wanted to know more about it.\n\n> Because babies sleep under the nets, any insecticide in them must be very safe.\n\n> In many areas, mosquitoes have developed resistance to the pyrethin-based insecticides now used in nets, which are synthetic versions of a chemical found in chrysanthemum flowers.\n\n> A version of nootkatone that can linger in netting fabric for years would have to be developed, but good repellents usually dissolve too quickly for that, he said.\n\n> The C.D.C. discovered nootkatone’s repellent properties almost 25 years ago as part of a search for new tick-control compounds to fight Lyme disease, Dr. Beard said.\n\n> They investigated cedar bark and chips “because there are all these folk tales that cedar repels insects — and people keep their clothes in cedar chests,” he said.\n\n> Cedar wood itself had very little effect on ticks, he said, but Oregon State University scientists working with the agency found the terpene oil of the Alaskan yellow cedar to be powerfully repellent. The Latin name of the tree is Cupressus nootkatensis, which comes from the Nuu-Chah-Nulth people of Canada.\n\n> It is “not known in great detail” how nootkatone works, Dr. Beard said, but it appears to activate octopamine receptors, which in insects send electrical impulses from one nerve cell to the next. Unable to turn off the signal, the bugs twitch to death.\n\n> In mammals, adrenaline — which is chemically related to octopamine — performs the same function. But the compound does not trigger adrenaline receptors.\n\n> Later the agency realized that the same chemical, originally derived from grapefruit rinds, was used as a flavoring and in perfumes.\n\n> The C.D.C. licensed its patent to a Swiss company, Evolva, which isolates the chemical from fermenting yeast.\n\n> But doing the safety studies required for E.P.A. registration was too expensive until the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic came along, Dr. Beard said.\n\n> That epidemic prodded Congress to appropriate money for mosquito control, and the C.D.C. transferred some of it to BARDA, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, which contracted with Evolva to finish the research.\n\n> Zika funding “was the key to moving the boulder up the hill,” Dr. Beard said. But since nootkatone works well on both insects, he added, “it wasn’t a bait-and-switch.”",

I test insect repellents daily, and have repeatedly found that DEET is the only true “silver bullet” out there, at least when it comes to topical repellents. By all means, try nootkatone-based repellents when they become available, but don’t expect them to be all the same or as good as DEET. In my opinion, the best non-DEET options on the market right now are Oil of Lemon Eucalyptus/PMD based repellents, particularly the Repel branded 30% concentration that somebody else in the thread linked to.",

I'm not going to go through my usual recap but some people have been messaging me about what's going on so I thought I would just share an update. \n\nI was set to move in my storage unit this past Wednesday but some hiccups happened (storage unit closed WAY LATER than what I was told on the phone) so we had to postpone it until Thursday. When Thursday came, I had decided last minute to actually change storage units as the original unit I chose was in a HORRIBLE area and even the outside of the building was incredibly sketchy. I then lassoed 4 of my friends to help me with the move and we managed to do it in an outstanding 90 minutes finishing one minute before closing time - phew! I still have the contract with my other unit but I believe it is month to month. I understand I'll probably have to pay the first month but hopefully I'll be able to get out of it by the second month. I'm just glad my belongings aren't there.\n\nYesterday I paid my final month's rent in full as it was becoming due. It took an obvious MASSIVE hit to my bank account but at least it is paid in full and out of my hair.\n\nToday I realized I will probably need bins (those large Rubbermaid ones) for my stuff (I had emergency packed everything in trash bags) so my friend drove me to get some and I brought them to my new unit to remove everything from the bags as I don't want them to get infested with pests. It was completely exhausting as my friend had to go and I basically had to walk 30 mins each way in the 90 degree heat with the bins, but nevertheless I did it. I still have to go back tomorrow and finish up but most of the stuff is put away. Unfortunately I did find some rat droppings in the corner of my unit but I simply do not have time to look for another unit and I'm sure most storage places have pests of some kind and if my stuff is in the large plastic bins I hope it protects them. I'm also going to go buy some peppermint oil to drop around the bottom of my unit where the mice can get in.\n\nNow you're probably wondering about JNM and Dad. They thankfully haven't reached out since I told Dad I wasn't moving to California but was instead moving in with a friend temporarily until I found a new place in Boston (a lie so they wouldn't perform an ambush) - until Thursday. Unfortunately JNM's number is listed as a contact number (believe me I have tried many times to get this off). On Thursday when I moved, I had to reserve the loading dock for my Uhaul truck. Someone else who had moved that day left a vacuum so I guess someone called her to see if I had left it. She then texted me:\n\n*Just got a message from your building that they found a vacuum in the loading bay. They are not sure if it's yours or someone that moved out before you. Did you move out today?*\n\nI ignored this as I assume it was less of a text to help me in case I actually left a vacuum and more of an attempt to pry into my move. She hasn't reached out since but I'm eagerly anticipating her or Dad's next text as I know they won't leave me be forever.\n\nI had originally planned to fly out to California yesterday but because of the hiccups it's being postponed a bit. That's ok though, I still have 20 days to figure out everything else. I still have to get rid of some of my furniture, stop my wifi and ship the router back, hand my keys in, and some other minor logistic things. I'm hoping my bins tomorrow go well and that will be contingent on whether or not I fly out Friday or not (storage unit closes bizarrely early so I can only take care of this on the weekend. I could always take a day off from work but I would really prefer not to).\n\nOther than that things have been ok - I've just been trying to keep my head up and keep my eyes on the prize. There's a few things I'm flubbing up a bit on (ex. the storage unit and the bins) but I'm learning as I go. I hope everyone appreciated the update and thanks again for all of your support. I'll continue to keep you guys updated! :)",

        "body": "I read your whole post history. I am a mom of six adult children,ages almost 20 to 34. I am amazed at the difference I often see in parenting styles of people that have only one or two children. \n\nHaving so many children made me look forward to my kids new milestones. I didn’t cry when my first kid went to kindergarten, as I had three more at home. It went that way with high school graduations, going away to college, and getting married. \n\nYour parents had such a tight grip on you. It’s crazy that they had all of your passwords to your financial accounts and you didn’t know them. I think they kept control because they still viewed you as a kid needing their help and advice. \n\nActually at 24 my kids all asked me for advice, and they all still ask for advice about parenting, etc.\n\nAfter reading your history, I have great hope for your parents.  As they continued to treat you like a child and squeeze with an ever tightening grip, you melted  through their fingers like a stick of warm butter.  \n\nYour dad is an attorney. He’s not stupid. It appears that your parents are starting to figure it out. Although your mom’s itemized list can be seen as a “stick it to you” of “look at all these things you’re going to have to pay,” you should look at it as she respects you enough to help you on your journey to independence. \n\nYour dad was upset about the lease, and you’re saying,” I’ve got it, don’t worry.” Although your parents have handled this poorly and have learning to do, they do love you. I can assure you right now that your parents are TERRIFIED. It’s not being terrified of losing control. You’ve done a good job. They already know that they have no control. You stripped them of every last bit of control they have. Young women are often victimized. Your parents worry about you being safe.\n\nThey are now ASKING for information, not demanding. They hope you haven’t quit your job. This is important for health insurance reasons. They want to know where your planning to live. \n\nIf you want to be an adult and have a good relationship with your parents and keep their respect, don’t lie to them. Adults make decisions, and they don’t ask for permission or apologize to anyone for the decisions they make. \n\nAt some point in the near future you should reach out and give them your “RULES OF ENGAGEMENT.” Text them and tell them you’ll speak to them, but only if they follow your rules of engagement. They need to respect your agency to make your own choices, treat you with respect, and not trash talk your friends, along with any other rules you see fit to make your relationship better. \n\nTell your parents you miss them too, but you don’t miss the relationship dynamics. You look forward to a loving relationship where they don’t equate you showing respect for them to blindly obeying their wishes or demands. If they are unsure how to interact with you in a respectful way, they should pretend like you’re a new neighbor or church member they would like to have a relationship with. Inquire about your family,interests, job, availability to make plans, etc. and then respect your agency when you make a decision. Good relationships are not about power.\n\nI think you have done a great job. I realize a lot of people might disagree me, but I can see from your posts that you want a living relationship with your parents. When you see them weakening, test the waters. They feel like this is invasion of the body snatchers. Let them know that you’re willing to have a relationship with them, but only if they respect you as an adult. They encouraged your financial dependence, and you taking control of your life shows you are ready to act like an adult. So now just demand to be treated like one. You can always hang up the phone.",

Each station has a shampoo bowl and at the end of the hair cut I turn the client around and lower them back in to the shampoo bowl. Some clients are more helpful than others when sitting up and sometimes I use too much effort with my left arm to raise them up and as a result I have developed what I believe is tennis elbow. I wrapped it and applied ice last night but decided this morning I would massage a little peppermint oil on to my elbow. And here's where the fuck up begins. I put a drop of peppermint oil in to the palm of my hand with some coconut oil and massage it in to my arm and go about the business of getting ready for the day. I have a mild yeast infection so I grabbed my antifungal cream and rubbed some on the vag. It only took about 10 seconds to realize I had fucked up. I grabbed some more coconut oil (after furiously washing my hands) and slathered it on my poor nether regions but it only mildly helped. The realization that I'm going to just have to ride this out slowly starts sinking in. I walk to the kitchen to grab an ice pack and am currently sitting on it while typing and thinking about all the times my vagina wasn't on fire and wishing desperately that I could go back to that time, half an hour ago, where my only issue was being a little itchy.\n\nTl/dr: had tennis elbow and a yeast infection at the same time, applied the remedies for these two ailments in the wrong order and now my vagina is on fire.

    "body": "I’m a witch. Shocker, I know, based on my username. Probably just saying that to you conjures up some pretty vivid images - either of a woman in a pointed hat throwing ingredients into a cauldron, or a goth teenager writing angrily into a journal covered in pentagrams. I'm not either of those things, but that's neither here nor there. \n\nA lot of people don’t seem to understand that the world of the supernatural isn’t all candles, cemeteries, and demons. Sometimes, it’s banging a pot and pan together to get the ornery old ghost that lives in your kitchen to stop opening all the cupboards, for the love of god. Or throwing your Tarot deck across the room for reminding you for the fourth time that you should be applying for jobs when you were asking about something completely unrelated - and then immediately apologizing to it because god only knows my Tarot deck can be catty and cruel when it wants to be.\n\nBut anyways, being a witch means I have a whole multitude of supernatural stories under my belt, ones that range from your typical “this is horrifying and I might shit my pants” right over to “ridiculous, hilarious, and kind of pathetic”. I have a lot of these stories for a few reasons - the first being that people tend to bring their supernatural problems to you, when they know you’re practicing. I’ve busted way too many ghosts for my liking (and by busted, I mean asked nicely to leave. Funny how many people never really try talking to their spooks and spectres).\n\nThe more prevalent reason that I’m constantly surrounded by supernatural goings-on, however, is that when you declare your intent to practice magic to the world, the world listens. Raptly. A practicing witch is a light in the middle of the dead of night - a homing beacon for everything that’s used to operating in the shadows. That’s not to say that everything in the shadows is bad - sometimes the worst monsters are the ones that stay visible and thrive under attention. But, I’m getting ahead of myself. \n\nI nanny part-time in tandem with freelancing graphic design work. When it comes to watching their kids, parents are much more willing to hire a woman in her late twenties than a fresh-faced teenager. Works out well for me, as I get to charge a little higher for that reason - and because, let’s face it, I’m good at what I do and in high demand because of it. The parents love that I keep their house clean, their kids clean, and stick to their schedules for bedtime. The kids love that I smell like lavender and peppermint and always show up with homemade cookies in my bag.\n\nParents and kids alike also love my “Monster Spray”. I keep a bottle of it in my nannying bag, tucked safely next to a package of wet-wipes. Water, salt, lavender oil, peppermint oil, clove oil - and a few other ingredients I’ll keep secret. That’s all that’s in there. Seems like nothing to most adults - a room freshener, if it’s anything at all - but to a scared kid, it’s so much more than that. Most kids imagine monsters in their closets and under their beds. It’s just a normal part of childhood. We’ve all been there, as children - that cold, trickling dread crawling down our spines, our hearts jackhammering in our ribcages as we stared down the slightly cracked-open door of the closet. We knew in our hearts that something in there was going to come out and eat us alive, and the worst part of it all was the feeling helplessness that creeped over us, leaving us paralyzed and still and afraid under our covers.\n\nMonster Spray, at its core, gives kids their power back. I put the Monster Spray into the hands of a terrified child and explain how much monsters hate the spray, how it causes them pain and makes them cower back to the creepy crawly depths they came from, and you can see the tiniest hint of bravery sparking itself alive in their eyes. They clutch the bottle with tiny hands and spray the everliving hell out of their closet, sometimes soaking their hanging clothes (hey, clothes dry). They’re then lulled back to a peaceful sleep by my soft singing voice, the smell of lavender and peppermint, and the bottle of Monster Spray that now officially takes up permanent residence on their nightstand table.\n\nA lot of children have been given their very own bottle of Monster Spray. One little girl I babysat for a few months sticks out in my mind, in particular. Let’s call her Anna. Anna was terrified of the big, wooden armoire in the corner of her room - one that used to be her grandmothers. Anna would tie her jumprope around the handles, only to have it unwound by the morning (which she of course, swore up and down that she didn’t do). Her parents were mostly unbothered by her tall tales, of course - they were mostly concerned with getting her a good night’s rest.\n\nIt was my third night babysitting when I had to bring out the Monster Spray. Anna had been put to bed and I was flipping idly through television channels. I had just settled on an episode of Chopped when I felt a cold chill ripple down my spine. A fraction of a second later, Anna screamed.\n\nIt’s not exactly the kind of things one wants to hear while babysitting another person’s child. In a panic, I ran up the stairs and turned the light on to find Anna sobbing and trying to climb up her headboard, as if to create more distance between herself and the armoire. It took a few moments to calm her down, but soon enough she let me hug her and sing to her. She eventually explained that she had gone to sleep, but woke up again when she started to hear scratching and banging from the armoire. It was followed by a sound like someone was turning a pool vacuum on and off - and then, she says, it felt like something was licking at her toes. \n\nI of course eyed the armoire as she told her story, studying it intently. I didn’t blame Anna - the old, wooden, heavy thing must have been from the gothic era - or at least was inspired by it. Creepy enough on its own, but combine it with those noises and the throat-tightening, hair-raising feeling I got when I looked at it for too long and I knew in my gut something was Up with a capital \"U\".\n\nI gently told Anna to go down to my bag and fetch the Monster Spray. As she was gone, I went to the window and cracked it open, and then removed the loosely hanging jumprope from the handles of the armoire. I met Anna in the hallway, where she placed the Spray into my waiting hands. I then told her to go have another cookie from my bag as she waits for me downstairs. Being a child, that was of course a no-brainer for her.\n\nWhen I was sure she was safely downstairs, I closed the bedroom door and turned off the lights. I sat on the floor, my back against the front of the armoire, and waited in the darkness. Sure enough, I felt a few light thumps at my back, followed by the sound of scratching and a wet sucking noise. I clenched my jaw tightly before speaking.\n\n“You’re not welcome here. You’re scaring a little girl. You leave, or I make you leave. Are we clear?”\n\nThere was a beat of silence, during which my gaze found the gentle moon sitting just outside the window, its light streaming softly over the bedroom. It was a surprisingly peaceful moment, and for a fraction of a second I hoped that would be enough. \n\nA sudden jolt of pain broke my reverie as the armoire door slammed into my back and head twice. I pressed my body weight back firmly as a high-pitched, ear-piercing whine broke through the relative silence of Anna’s room. The whine reminded me of the feedback from a broken microphone, and I could feel a trickle of blood making its way out of my ear. And then, through the crack in the door that I couldn’t keep closed with my body weight, something reached out and grabbed my forearm.\n\nThe sensation of cold and heat was the first thing I noticed - slimy wetness sliding across my skin even as it bubbled under the touch of something as hot as a stove element, maybe hotter. I hissed through my teeth and jerked my arm away, pulling wet chunks of flesh from the creature as I did. \n\n“That’s enough,” I grunted, clenching my jaw so hard I thought my teeth might break. I grabbed the Monster Spray as I swooped around, shut my eyes tight, opened the armoire door, and gave that thing the dousing of its life.\n\nI was immediately aware of the smell - it was something overpowering, toxic and dead, like the smell of burnt and melted plastic being poured over sun-baked roadkill. I could hear a hissing and popping and bubbling, and the creature’s shrieking reached a frantic din. Something bowled me over in its haste to leave the armoire, and I opened my eyes in time to see something mottled and dark and covered in smoking, scaled skin illuminated in the moonlight as it crawled out the window.\n\nAnna slept beside me  on the couch until her parents arrived home. Frankly, I felt better that way, myself. I told her that I had made the monster leave, and that as long as she had her Monster Spray, no monster would ever come back. She fell asleep curled around the bottle, and when her parents arrived home they were so charmed by the story of the Monster Spray that they didn’t even mind that Anna wasn’t in bed. They did make sure I put some polysporin on the burn on my forearm, though. I’m so clumsy with the tea kettle, I had explained with a laugh.\n\nParents always find Monster Spray to be a charming “parenting technique”, like something clever you’d find on Pinterest. They always remark, often a few weeks later, how much more confident and at ease their child seems with that bottle beside their bed. How bedtimes always used to be a problem, but now their kid jumps into bed eagerly. How I helped make the monsters disappear; this is always said with a wink and an elbow nudge, because of course their child is just being silly or over-imaginative.\n\nWhat I never tell those parents is that in my experience, children who need the Monster Spray always have an extremely good reason. That spray isn’t made with that concoction of oils simply because it smells good. Everything in Monster Spray is there for purification purposes - water cleansed with crystals, salt, the specific oils, everything has a purpose. That sole, singular purpose is to keep any nasties away that might be particularly attracted to the shiny, beautiful newness of a child.\n\nSee, children have an energy and a presence that is unlike most dull, mundane things - they’re closer to being outside of our world than in it, and because of that, they’re beacons, too. They still carry a trace, a lingering whiff, of the Past World, and that’s a very tantalizing thing to most supernatural creatures. \n\nBut I smile and nod at the parents, pretending to be in on some kind of ruse to these over-confident people who, once-upon-a-time, also had spirits and demons trailing after them like toilet paper on a shoe. And then I go home and make another batch of Monster Spray.",

    "body": "*Edit* \n\nHere's some collective general food poisoning advice:\n\nAs people have said, if you can't peel it, cook it or boil it then forget it. Food should be hot and fresh. Same advice as in this post also applies to uncooked salads / pre cut veggies / washed veggies (unless you can confirm they've been washed and grown in clean water). Also important is to only drink filtered or bottled water, avoid ice and only brush teeth with filtered water too. Good advice to go to a place with some turnover and don't order something which may have been stored for a long time and not frequently ordered and also uncooked (E.g. a burger bun at an Indian restaurant in a non tourist area, got food poisoning from that in 2020 believe it or not). Meat also carries it's own unique risks, but as I'm a vegetarian you'll have to do your own research on that one. Take probiotics and stock a bunch of stuff that can help control indigestion too (e.g. peppermint oil caps, calcium carbonate, buscopan, pepto etc). Watch out for unpasteurized milk. Carry hand sanitizer. Get travel insurance and have extra money to front immediate costs. Get your travel vaccinations. \n\nAnd last but not least... don't be scared or put off by all of this! You should still be cautious and follow some guidelines, but follow this advice and you should be sweet! So jump in and get traveling food poisoning FREE.\n\n*Original story* \n\nI can't believe I made such a rookie mistake. In Bangalore, India I bought a bowl of pre cut fruit (papaya, watermelon, banana) from a street stall. I assumed it had just been cut recently and it was fine. It also wasn't refrigerated but it looked totally fresh. I got some SERIOUS food poisoning that day. I wrongly assumed that it was from a curry that I ate that same day, so 5 days later I got some from a different stall and got food poisoning again...\n\nAfter researching I discovered that pre cut fruit is something you should avoid, especially in developing countries. The rind or peel protects the inside of the fruit or vegetable from bacteria. As soon as you cut it it's shelf life goes way down too. Pre cut fruit is often handled with no gloves and also not cooked so any bacteria can grow on it easily. It's also often out in the open so bacteria can build up over time, and often it is washed in local tap water. So if you want to eat fruit while you're traveling you should just buy something you can peel yourself.",

Even in developed countries, unpasteurized juice is pretty much a no go. Especially for children or older people who are susceptible to severe reactions to E. Coli. Also realize that if you’re coming from a first world country into a developing country you can’t necessarily eat like locals eat, our gut bacteria is a lot different and kind of weak from the super strict food handling rules in developed nations. I guess put simply, our bodies aren’t “used to” the bacteria you’ll encounter.",

If there are contaminates such as manure or pesticides on the skin of the fruit that doesn't easily transfer into the fruit. If that is all properly washed off before its slice or peeled then less problem  \n\n\nBUT if it's not then the person handling it transfers those contaminants onto their hands and then onto the fruit. Same if the water used to clean it was already full of bugs that your stomach wont handle then it goes from skin to fruit again. Think of dunking a dirty orange in a big bucket of dirty water. the visible dirt may be removed but its not really clean. Now my hand that i reached into grab it with is dirty and thus so will be the fruit.   \n\n\nhttps://globalnews.ca/news/4268971/pre-cut-fruit-salmonella-risk/",

I generally do not mind as they keep other pesky bugs out but I rather them stay in my garden area than inside.\n\nPeppermint oil, any kind really, keeps spiders away. Dap a drop in every corner of the house and door/window opening. They will stay away as they do not like it since it disrupts their sensory receptors. \n\nNot only that but if you love the smell of peppermint, your house will smell faintly of peppermint depending on how much you use!\n\nNote: I wanted to add that this is risky if you have pet as the fumes CAN be toxic to birds/dogs/ cats. Use in moderation and in places they can not reach it to lick it. \n\nI personally have a few dogs and never had issues with their health for this reason but I only use 1 drop near the outside of my doors and on my windows and they never got to those places.\n\nAlways keep a close eye on your babies regardless! They are curious creatures!!",

We did and we were shocked, no more mice or spiders. We had also heard about clove oil, so we eventually switched to that. Either works fine. I saw in the comments \"heresay\" but this actually worked for us. We refreshed it every other week. I put two/three drops on cotton balls in old yogurt cups in all our storage areas and in the bathroom tub. I was so excited the week we came back after trying it and seeing nothing. As a side note, you have to use the real oil, not imitation. And yes, our dogs hated the smell, didn't want to go in, but the windows were opened right away and by the time we went in at night after a campfire, the smell had dissipated enough for the dogs. Since then I use the peppermint or clove oil in the basement o keep spiders out each fall, it's been several years, and no spiders.",

If I only spray the oil inside can it still be harmful to the cats? Assuming no given the walls and the fact that the cats are out in the open air but given that people said fumes and smell can be enough I want to make sure I don’t overdo it. I appreciate having them as neighbors 🐱",

    "body": "#THINGS TO AVOID\n\n - DO NOT SCRATCH\n - DO NOT USE TYPICAL SUNBURN RELIEF CREAMS (aloe, generic moisturizers, etc)\n - DO NOT USE OIL-BASED TOPICALS (make sure any remedies below are NOT oil-based; peppermint seems to be the exception)\n - DO NOT USE WET OR DAMP CLOTH\n\n___\n\n##**IF YOU HAVE IT NOW, AND HAVE ALREADY TRIED ALOE**\n###Long, intense (*very hot* or *very cold*) shower or bath, followed by peppermint oil rub. \n\n* The shower will offer temporary, but immediate relief, while washing off any other topical ointments. Use with CAUTION, as it CAN make the itch worse once the relief is gone, but seems to be the best way to offer an immediate respite.\n* Oatmeal baths (even lukework) are also occasionally mentioned. Same CAUTION here; only do so if you've already tried other methods to the surface of the skin, as it can make it WORSE once you get out.\n\n___\n\n##**IF YOU HAVE IT NOW**\n\n###AVOID SHOWERS & ANYTHING APPLIED TO THE SKIN\nAlthough a very hot or very cold shower can help reduce the intensity in the short term, the intensity of the itch will likely increase within minutes after the shower. Take ONLY as necessary (or when waiting for oral remedies to kick in).\n\n###Betamethasone (Celestone) Injection\n\n* An injection of the corticosteroid Betamethasone (celestone) has been reported by a few to stop HI completely.\n* In the US, the injection requires a doctor's visit (show them [this paper](https://academic.oup.com/jtm/article/26/1/tay124/5180068) if they don't believe you), while the cream & oral variations require a prescription.\n\n###Antihistamine & Ibuprofen\n\n* This combination is consistently reported as the best method for longer term relief. Typically used in combination with something below, as you will have to wait for its affects.\n\n* Diphenhydramine (Benedryl in he US) seems to be the most effective. The variation found in the UK is a third-gen variant, but both are still found over-the-counter.\n\n###Anti Itch (Cooling) Spray\n\n* This has been corroborated by a few others already, so it's worth putting on the main list.\n\n###Vitamin A&D Cream. \n\n* THIS WILL CAUSE A FLARE UP LIKE OTHER TOPICALS. If you're already at your limit, hold off on this. If you've reached a point where you can deal, it will help with long term relief, and could reduce the duration of the itch overall.\n\n###Talc(um) Powder\n\n*Referenced once; specifically mentioned was Dr. Scholl's Soothing Foot Powder. Keep in mind this is only effective while it's actively on the skin. Further tests from the users showed any talcum powder-based product (eg: baby powder) was also effective*\n\n###Beta-alanine (experimental)\n\n* An OTC pre-workout supplement you can find at most vitamin shops. Referenced by some HI researches contacted by [another user](/r/HellsItch/comments/1l0z1xz/this_stopped_hells_itch_for_my_son_and_university/). Mention in this thread if this had a positive effect for you to bump it up the list!\n\n\n___\n\n##**IF YOU KNOW YOU'LL GET IT**\n\n### DRINK WATER, TAKE IBUPROFEN, TAKE ANTI-HISTAMINES\n\n* This will help reduce general inflammation and reduce the histamine that is likely the root cause. Combine this with the below cream, and you might be able to avoid the itch altogether.\n\n### APPLY Vitamin A&D cream on the FIRST DAY (day of sunburn/directly after)\n\n* /u/judascrinitus has a [great write up](/r/HellsItch/comments/4w2sly/ad_doing_the_trick_for_me/), while /u/ninshakjr has used it as a [preemptive measure](/r/HellsItch/comments/4gh11d/experienced_veteran_kinda/). They later comment that it did indeed help reduce the pain.\n\n### DRINK LOTS OF WATER\n\n* This will help reduce dryness often caused by sunburns that can reduce the impact of the itch.\n\n___\n\n###All measures referenced\n\n##Primary Goal:\n\n*Pressure & Temperature can overload your bodies ability to send pain signals, but need to be intense enough to do so. Medications can override your sense of pain or just knock you out, but you should always be careful with these methods. Your best bet is to use some pressure / temperature method for immediate relief until a medicated approach kicks in.*\n\n**INTERNAL PAIN RELIEF**\n\n* **Ibuprofen** can reduce overall pain and inflammation, and is great for pre-itch-care. It's better to take it in conjunction with something else.\n* **Antihistamines** seem to work, but this seems to be hit-or-miss with people. Diphenhydramine has been mentioned. Most useful when taken in conjunction with something else, or if  you want to just pass out (eg: nyquil /  benedryl)\n* **Trees** If it's legal and accessible to you, smoking marijuana is a proven general pain reliever.\n\n**DIRECT APPLICATION**\n\n* Keep in mind any direct application WILL cause the itch to intensify. If you have already *tried* something applied to the skin, these are likely candidates to help reduce the itch. ALWAYS spot-check first, and wait 15-20 minutes. If you have not, **THE BEST ADVICE IS TO NOT APPLY ANYTHING TO THE SKIN**\n\n* **[Benadryl Itch-Stopping Gel](/r/HellsItch/comments/8ygbvj/13_years_later_this_is_still_a_thing_for_me/)** - [product link](https://www.benadryl.com/products/benadryl-itch-stopping-gel-extra-strength) - By far one of the most effective & referenced short-term treatments.\n* **Vitamin A&D** Some accounts have mentioned this may prevent the itch, or at least reduce the length of time the itch occurs.\n* ***Lidocaine creams*** can numb the skin, but may only be so effective. **WARNING** Some people benefit from this, while for others it has made the itch WORSE. Try a small amount first.\n* **Peppermint Oil** This is a direct application, but acts as a way to trick your body into sensing temperature.\n* **Tea Tree Oil** See above\n* **[IcyHot](/r/HellsItch/comments/4ylqvd/remedies_most_common_effective/d7a8pk1/)** See above\n* **[Talcum Powder](/r/HellsItch/comments/6qo8yn/i_got_hells_itch_for_the_first_time_tonight/)** - The product used was Dr Scholl's Foot Powder, but baby powder will also work. Effective only [while actively on the skin](/r/HellsItch/comments/6qo8yn/i_got_hells_itch_for_the_first_time_tonight/dkzu1yb/).\n\n* *One-off references below*\n* **[Sarna Anti Itch Spray](https://www.sarna-skincare.com/index.html)**\n* **[Mitchum deodorant](/r/HellsItch/comments/5ck71k/my_experience/)**\n* **[Witch Hazel](/r/HellsItch/comments/8o146l/witch_hazel_as_a_possible_remedy/)**\n\n\n**PRESSURE**\n\n* Wrap the area in a dry cloth & apply pressure by leaning against a surface or laying down.\n* Heavy or weighted blankets\n* Tightly wrapping yourself in a towel, and leaning against something; just don't shift.\n\n**TEMPERATURE**\n\n* **Ice Packs**\n * Condensation from plastic or ice water can inflame the area further once the ice is removed.\n * Another warning on this: Ice on the skin will eventually do more damage than the itch feels like it's doing. Removing the ice, especially after a couple hours, will result in a lot more pain due to returning circulation, so have something else to aid relief if you can.\n* **Heating Pad**\n* **Blow dryer on hot**\n* **HOT SHOWER** (for immediate, but short term, relief)\n * The most common way to get immediate relief, especially if you've mistakenly tried something that has made it worse. Typically paired with a [peppermint oil](/r/HellsItch/comments/4ylqvd/remedies_most_common_effective/dbfegmq/) application directly after, or when waiting for internal remedies (antihistamine / ibuprofen) to take effect.\n\n\n\n___\n\n####Other common questions\n\n**How long will this last?**\n\n***First-degree sunburns*** (no blisters)\n\nThis is proportional to the burn: very **mild, light pink** will last **a few hours**. More **intense, deep burns** can easily be **up to 72 hours**. 5 days has been the longest, consistent itch.\n\n***Second-degree sunburns*** (blisters & other skin damage)\n\nThis is a much more intense, but drawn-out experience. Thankfully Hell's Itch tends to last only a few hours at a time in this scenario, but can flare up for weeks after the initial burn, but while the body is healing. Keep A&D cream on hand for when you're not dealing with the itch; be careful with showers; and have anti-histamine's on hand for flare ups.\n\n***Post-Traumatic-Itch*** (or: \"will this come back??\")\n\nIt's not uncommon to experience 'phantom hells itch' well after the burn itself is healed or peeling has started. This is likely due to the added inflammation or dryness from the burn itself, but also the body being hyper-aware of itching sensations, and the brain immediately being terrified. Physically, keep hydrated, & the skin moisturized. Mentally, just remind yourself the the HI is **gone** once peeling starts, and breathe through those moments of terror.\n\n**Will this happen if I get sunburned again?*\n\nIf you are generally inactive in the sun, or have not had a sunburn in the affected area *that season*, the likely answer is yes. Although skin-tone can help prevent a sunburn in the first place, if you *do* get burned, the result is unfortunately consistent.\n\n**WHY???**\n\nThe most likely cause (in a cruel twist of irony) appears to be a **lack of sun exposure** in the affected area.^(see disclaimer)\n\nThis has been anecdotally corroborated by [previous experience](/r/HellsItch/comments/gjqjkh/localized_hells_itch/), and even by a second-hand [doctor's account](/r/HellsItch/comments/m216w5/a_doctors_advice/gqgwgpi/).\n\nIn order to prevent HI before a sunburn, the post above mentions at least ***second hand*** sun exposure. eg: hanging out in swimwear beneath the shade, and allowing indirect sunlight (via the water's surface) to reflect. However, even indirect sunlight can still cause a sunburn (as personally experienced), so keep the time exposed limited.\n\n---\n\n*Disclaimer*...\n\nI AM NOT A DOCTOR. This list, methods of treatment, and experiences in the subreddit are based on ANECDOTES. However, due to the rarity of the condition and the lack of scientific literature, it's all we've really got to go on at the moment, and many doctors don't seem to be aware of what's going on.

So wish I had this 17 years ago when I first had my reaction! I will say though 100% peppermint oil is a miracle with this and I wish the post pointed that out more. It causes a few minutes of hell after applying, but gives you maybe 6 hours of relief before needing reapplied again. By far the best remedy and only lasting remedy I’ve found in those 17 years dealing with it!\n\nAlso as a side note, I believe this may be a possible type of auto immune reaction that causes hells itch. Seems that the UV may cause damage to the cells in a way that cause the body to attack itself, causing the itch. That’s just my theory though and I hope doctors research this more one day.",

        "body": "So grateful this sub exists! Just went through HI for the first time after getting a sunburn on my back at very high elevation. Unrelenting, stabbing pain! Scalding hot showers and baths worked wonders. Disregard everything any medical website has to say on the issue, as they are all clueless. DO NOT USE ALOE or any other lotion. All were a grave mistake, in my experience, and I had to take hot showers to remove anything topical each time it was tried. Ibuprofen worked great! Tylenol not so much. Benedryl was okay, but not sure how much this really helped. CBD/THC was somewhat helpful maybe, but again, difficult to determine. Ice packs worked only while actively on the skin, but the stabbing resumed immediately after removal. Peppermint oil was too strong/burning for my sensitive skin. Benzodiazepines, if you happen to have them, are an aboslute lifesaver, as they seem to dull the body's reactivity to the pain/inflammation. Alcohol helps immensely as well, as it acts similarly. Take care combining those two, however. Have a couple drinks, then wait a few hours to take one dose of anxiety med (if you have it). If you wake up in the night with pain again, take ibuprofen, then a quick scalding shower directed at the spot. I now seem to be on the mend, and if it comes back, I know what to do. Good luck and god help you, fellow sufferers!",

        "body": "Thought I would post my current first time experience here.\n\nFirst of all, I'm in my late 30s, very light skinned and burn fairly easily. Since a child, I've always been very cautious to spend much time in the sun without sunscreen, and rarely without my shirt (even while swimming).\n\nWent on a family vacation to Florida this past week and was very careful to use sunblock, save for Sunday when we went to the Atlantic Ocean. I didn't put on much sunblock as we didn't plan to spend more than 2 hours at the beach. After about 3 hours, we went back to where we were staying, and my wife commented on how bad my sunburn looked. It felt like any normal sunburn, and she put our usual Aveeno lotion on my back after we showered. \n\nLater that evening, my upper back and shoulders began to lightly hurt. I thought it was just normal sunburn pain and had my wife rub more Aveeno lotion on it. It was very uncomfortable, but I was \"tough\" and made it through the night. \n\nMonday morning, upper back and shoulders mildly hurt. After the morning shower, wife rubbed in more Aveeno lotion. It hurt just a little more than the night before. Wife asked if I wanted some Ibuprofen. I rarely take pain meds, but with a 2 day drive ahead of us, I decided to take the Ibuprofen. Mild discomfort while driving, but not too bad. \n\nLater that evening, about 30 hours from leaving the beach, wife lotion me again with the Aveeno and I took more Ibuprofen. Pain was more than mild, but subsided enough when the Ibuprofen took affect for me to fall asleep. \n\nTuesday morning went about the same as the day before. Up to this point, I thought this was just a normal sunburn pain. Had to take Ibuprofen halfway through the day.\n\nTuesday night (tonight as of this writing), we made it home from Florida. Unloaded the car, did typical stuff you do when getting home from vacation. But, the sunburn pain on my upper back and shoulders was getting really intense. This was about 54 hours after leaving the beach. I told my wife I needed her to put Aveeno lotion on my back, she told me in just a few minutes after she takes care of the kids. Normally I would help her with the kids, but the sunburn pain was beginning to take over my thought process. So I waited a few minutes for her to finish with the kids. \n\nBut the pain was getting more intense by the second. I finally told her to stop with the kids and please put some lotion on my back. So she gently rubbed some Aveeno lotion on my back and arms. It seemed that when she would stop rubbing, this overwhelming intense pain in my upper back and shoulders would begin to overcome me. It was a pain like I had never experienced. If I touched the part where there was pain, it would temporarily go away, like scratching does to an itch. I was starting to loose sanity. The pain sensation would not stop. My wife began looking at me like I was crazy. I had never experienced this in my life. It was so bad, I sent my kids to their rooms, as I did not want them to see me loosing my sanity. I was rolling in pain on the floor, trying to Google what was going on. But I could not even concentrate on my phone long enough to read the Google results.\n\nI felt like I was ready to die! I took 4 Ibuprofen tablets (not sure how many mg that is, but at this point, I didn't care). I knew that lightly touching it provided some very temporary relief (like I compared before as scratching an itch) so I decided to take a shower and hoped I could manage till the Ibuprofen started to take affect. Tried both hot and cold water. Hot seemed to offer the best relief. After a 30 minute shower, I could feel the Ibuprofen beginning to do its job. \n\nAs I was Googling for solutions, medical sites were worthless! They all sited this was a rare condition with little scientific study. But after scrolling through a few sites, I ran across a blog [Excruciatin Pinprick Pain Days After Sunburn](https://medium.com/@RantNinja/excruciating-pinprick-pain-days-after-sunburn-e2f22d414481) and eventually to this Reddit. \n\nAs of right now, I'd say my Hell's Itch pain is at a manageable 4 on a 1 to 10 pain scale with the Ibuprofen. I'll update this post to further document my journey on the worst pain I have ever experienced in my life.",

I got moderately burned on my back and shoulders, and it stung like a normal sunburn on Tuesday and Wednesday night. On Thursday I went for another 30 minute swim in the sea - this time wearing suncream and a t-shirt. The swim was lovely, but when I got out the itch began. I've never felt anything like it before, it was so unpleasant, I wanted to tear my skin off.\n\nMy wife applied various creams including after-sun, a moisturizer, and vaseline, which didn't seem to help. I then went for a 5 hour long cold bath - this seemed to stop the itch, but as soon as I got out it came back. Then I found this subreddit. I took Ibuprofen and anti-histamine (loratadine, which is all I had) and had a long hot shower. Now the itching seems to have mostly stopped (It's still a little unpleasant but not unbearable like before).\n\nThanks very much!

        "body": "Thought I’d chime in. Had sun induced HI the first time as a 14 year old in Greece. My father had dropped the sunscreen accidentally on the way to the beach, and  as I thought swimming and snorkelling with a t shirt was unbearable, I was exposed to sun between 7am and 3pm.\nTo my old man’s defense, I was told every thirty minutes to get in the shade or be burned.\nThe following night I woke up abruptly at 3am as if someone stabbed me in the back with a knife. It was everywhere, my legs, arms, torso, back, ears, and it was like “a million needles piercing directly into my flesh sporadically with millisecond intervals.\nI screamed, cried, and stood naked shaking and hitting my fists against the wall whilst my panicking dad did what he could spraying my body with the shower head and cold water. And so we went for hours, with my 3 younger sibling taking turns spectating in awe and terror. \nFinally, after probably 3 hours my dad had to get them breakfast and resume his responsibilities as a dad of four. I continued with cold water in the shower thinking I’d rather die.\nSome time around noon, I was finally able to enter the living room. I was miserable and itchy and couldn’t stand still, and couldn’t move either.\nMy father had walked around for a while stealing raw aloe Vera leaves and finally was able to give me relief applying what looked like a bucket of raw aloe.\nThe rest of the vacation was less than memorable, and my family’s amusement at every conversation on the topic of sunburns ever since have been so terrible. I made a promise to myself to never get excessively sunburned again. As a white Scandinavian guy, I’ve been sunburned mild to moderately probably every year since then. That’s 16 years.\nUntil today!!! I’ve lived on the US east coast for 6 months. Prior to this, 6 months in Malaysia. In Malaysia, I could stay in the sun for 2-3 hours before getting burned, and therefore thought that New Jersey would be alright for the same amount of time, at least.\nBoy, was I wrong. After having been shirtless at the beach for and hour fifteen at most 2 days ago, I now sit here in embarrassment to my wife who urged me to apply sun lotion, my son to whom I should be a role model, and myself for not having learned my lesson as a teenager. After having danced, jumped, rolled, and hit floors, walls, and ceiling with various body parts whilst losing my sanity in front of them, ending with an hour in the shower with cold water on my back, I now am finally able to sit down and write.\nIt has taken 8 aspirins, 2 zyrtex antihistamines, and almost an entire bottle Prosecco, that my lovely wife went to get at my request  an hour ago when I was staring into the abyss. lol.\nI never thought I’d be in this mess again, let alone after only an hour in the sun in the northern hemisphere.\nI am not religious, by any means, but heard my inner voice pray in the shower to both god and Allah, that they’d make it stop in exchange for anything I could possibly give in return.\nI hope I will never experience this again.\nIt is beyond words and I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. \n\nAfter this most recent HI, I would strongly suggest that anyone suffering from it AVOID lotions and scratching, no matter how tempting, and that they instead ingest antihistamines and some ibuprofen/aspirin as quickly as possible with some fast acting sugars for quicker digestion and absorption. Alcohol I would never recommend anyone, although am very happy right now after having almost chugged an entire bottle in 15 minutes. \n\nTo myself, and all of you, my fellow sufferers of HI, that we apply copious amounts of sunscreen going forward.\n\nBest of luck, and stay safe!",

Wish I would remember what it was.\n3) Wash white soft tshirts immediately and wear under a sweatshirt.  Won't fix but will reduce aggravation.\n4) Fireball or favorite whiskey.  It works and will help pass out.\n5) Use an ultrabronze a few times before beginning of summer.  However don't use ultrabronze after hot tub or going into pool with chlorine.  The bronzer will inflame the chlorine on skin.  Worse hells itch ever but thankfully only lasted 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nSomething to help the doctors and scientist.\n1) This is similar to runners hell itch.  Tends to happen around fall.

Regardless, I’m back to sitting in the shower sobbing like a baby, had to call my mom to come pick up my kids because I cannot function. Hubby gets off work in a few minutes and will be picking up Benadryl…I hope it works",

My grandma put a jar of Japanese peppermint oil in my bathroom and I searched online and it said u could put it in your bath so that’s what I did but I poured in like half the bottle in stead of only three drops and it FUCKIN BURNS!!! DAMNNN IM IN MY BED RIGHT NOW SHIVERING THE FUK OFF WTF DO I DOOO??? HOW LONG DOES THIS LAST FOR!!!??? GOD DAMNNN HELP ME LORD I DONT KNOW WHETHER TO SHIVER OR HEAT LIKE WTF MY BACK IS BURNING FAHKKK MEEEE DONT POUR MORE THAN ONE DROP IN THE BATH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Im going to try and sleep... fukkkk it’s 12:30 ammm and it’s cold/hot IDEK ANYMORE HELPPPP SOMEONE IT FREAKING BURNS GOD DAMN\n\nUPDATE: Guys thank you for all the support, the effects kind of went down after an hour but during that period my whole body was on fire. I got 4 hours of sleep and my body no longer feels like fire. This is definitely something to remember and that was the worst pain in my life. Don’t do what I did. Put only one drop next time. Thank you everyone.\n\nP.S. I just went through all the comments and most of you stated I should have went to the ER. Unfortunately I’m 15YO and this happened at 12AM. I could not bear to wake my parents and tell them what happened. However I will tell my grandma this morning and see what she says. I thank everyone again for all the support.\n\nUPDATE2: Wow thank you everyone for all the support, I’m getting so much messages! I am doing fine and I don’t think anything is wrong. I don’t see any signs of chemical burns or anything. Unless I see redness on my back or other symptoms I think I’ll hold off on the doctor. Anyways lesson learned, whenever you try something you’ve never tried before, always go with the instructions or even less. Again I thank everyone for their support and unless I really need to, I won’t be seeing a doctor anytime soon. :)",

    "body": "Hi all! I knew that there would be a lot of stories about frustrating and overbearing MILs ruining the season so I thought I’d pop in with a happier tale.\n\nTo recap, my husband and I are estranged from my MIL after she covered my son in hemp oil/peppermint oil when he was 9 months old, proceeded to be squirrelly about the situation for 5 months during which she made no attempt to contact us, and finally contacted us to give us an “apology” which basically amounted to a laundry list of rationalizations and justifications for her actions. My husband and I spent Christmas with some of his extended family not related to PB and we had such a wonderful time. Kiddo (now 17 months) was so calm, happy and content with these people who wanted nothing more than to share time with him and get to know his little bubbly personality self. \n\nIt was such a contrast to last Christmas. I was SO stressed last year thinking about going to my MIL’s house. I had heard through the grape vine that she had bought me and DH movie tickets and had plans to baby sit my son—none of which she discussed with me. I knew I would have to shut her down, as my son was still exclusively breastfeeding very frequently at the time and I hadn’t let anyone babysit him yet. I certainly didn’t want my first time apart from him to be on his first Christmas, for an activity I didn’t want to do (I’m not remotely a movie person) and with a person who didn’t have the curtesy to even discuss it with me. She ended up going to the movie in our place and we left her houe after only an hour or so (but not before she asked us if we were going to wait for her to come back? Uh, no. We live 20 minutes away, we’re  going home).\n\nIt was incidents like that that raised my heckles and told me not to trust her with my kid—I just had this feeling that she really wanted to get him alone and play mommy with him. Lo and behold, my gut couldn’t have been more correct.\n\nPB texted my husband at like 10:30 pm last night wishing him a merry Christmas. He didn’t respond. \n\nI’m looking forward to many more PB free Christmases in the future.\n\nGood luck today ladies. Trust your guts when it comes to your kids. And merry Christmas.",

We all got terribly sick from the chicken and I posted on FB giving a heads up that something was up with the chicken there today, and I’ve never gotten sick there before. \n\nMy sister’s friend IMMEDIATELY responds with a ‘hey hun’ type comment, telling me she has something to fix my stomach woes! I’m honestly expecting something genuine out of her and telling me to try peppermint oil or something. Foolish me! No, she tells me about the fit tea. \n\nI’m very irritable, and so are my bowels (sorry, I had to), I’m dehydrated and I’ve been sick for hours, I’m literally watching Seinfeld reruns on my iPad in my bathroom, and I snap at her. “I don’t need your laxative tea”, I tell her. \n\nAgain she responds IMMEDIATELY, “hey hun just so you know it’s a detox tea not a laxative and I think you just have too many toxins in your body and that’s why you got sick today!”\n\nI respond saying a LAXATIVE is not what I need right now, and yes, it is a laxative. She proceeds to tell me that I need to use the tea to FLUSH THE TOXINS I GOT FROM EATING BAD FOOD, because SHE used to get sick all the time after eating, and she can eat whatever she wants now! She was gluten sensitive before but now can eat it and it doesn’t cause bloating because of the tea! MAYBE BECAUSE YOUR DIGESTIVE SYSTEM ISNT EVEN PROCESSING IT??? \n\nMe, on the edge of death, too weak to respond, closes Facebook and comes here.

    "body": "⚠️ **DISCLAIMER:** Since making this post, I've learned some new information that has changed my perception and usage of the term \"fungal-safe\". I've shared about this at length in my post [\"Fungal-safe\" skincare: unscientific BS?](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/IxvbUdN1jv) The TLDR of that post: there is no scientific proof showing that the ingredients excluded as not \"fungal-safe\"  actually cause problems for those with malassezia-related conditions. The concept of \"fungal-safe\" is something created purely based on the personal experiences of people on the internet. It is 100% anecdotal. I will no longer be perpetuating the concept of \"fungal-safe\" skincare, and all previous or future posts by me should not be considered advice, but merely recountings of my personal experience. **These are simply techniques and product choices that have worked for me, personally.**\n\n♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️\n\nIt's been over a year since I first made a list of fungal-safe products, for anyone dealing with malassezia follicutlitis (fungal acne), seb derm (seborrheic dermatitis) or similar conditions. Since then, more products have come on the market, reformulations have happened, I've used more products - plus I figured having just a list would be handy reference, since my first post was... really long 😂\n\n[My first list of fungal-safe products](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), with an in-depth guide to how I made my first fungal-safe skincare routine, and practical tips. Notable point is, since that post, I've learned that cetearyl alcohol is not fungal-safe, and switched to using https://folliculitisscout.com as an ingredient checker since I find it up to date, with that ingredient flagged. if any of you want to check if a product is fungal-safe - that's the website I personally use ☺️ If you want a detailed rundown of how and why these ingredients affect our skin, I highly reccomend the SimpleSkincareScience website - [Their Fungal Acne Treatment Bible post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) is very thorough and cites sources ❤️\n\n[My current routine in 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/uwmvkk/my_current_2022_fungalsafe_skincare_routine_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (more or less) with some haircare.\n\nThese are not recommendations, they're just useful information - some products have reviews linked, but please do use ✨️the search bar✨️ as well as other sources to check out other reviews, and make an informed purchase  ☺️\n\n**Disclaimer:** These products are not guaranteed to suit anybody. It's just that ingredients that are known triggers for seb derm or fungal acne - like plant oils, esters, fatty acids, etc. - are absent in these products. They may not suit your skin for other reasons. YMMV.\n\n**They will not treat malassezia related conditions**, they're intended as options for those who want to use a fungal-safe routine, to prevent flare-ups and maintain their skin.\n\nIF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU MAY BE SUFFERING FROM ONE OF THESE CONDITIONS, PLEASE SEEK MEDICAL GUIDANCE FROM A DERMATOLOGIST. These products are not a substitute for medical treatment.\n\n#✨️ First cleansers/makeup removers\n\n+ Solimo Micellar Water\n\n+ Garnier Naturals Micellar Water (the pink one)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil (plain pink original formula - does not emulsify, but can be used to dissolve and wipe off sunscreen/makeup, and followed up with a foaming cleanser)\n\n#✨️ Foaming cleansers\n\n+ Sebamed Clear Face Cleansing Foam\n\n+ Simple Kind to Skin Refreshing Face Wash\n\n+ Kaya Clinic Soothing Cleansing Gel\n\n+ Deconstruct Niacinamide Brightening Face Wash - 2% Niacinamide+2% Liquorice Root Extract\n\n+ Deconstruct Salicylic Acid Oil Control Face Wash - 0.5% Salicylic Acid +1% Niacinamide [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/y3ynhi/review_deconstruct_salicylic_acid_oil_control/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=2&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Deconstruct Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Face Wash - 0.5% Amino Acids + 0.1% Hyaluronic Acid\n\n+ Body Cupid Deep Clarifying Face Wash (with Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E) \n\n+ Body Cupid Tea Tree and Neem Anti Acne Face Wash (with Tea Tree Oil & Neem Extract) \n\n+ Body Cupid Vitamin C Brightening Face Wash (with Fruit Extract of Kakadu Plums) \n\nAll the Body Cupid face washes appear to be fungal-safe, but the ones I left out have \"menthol crystals\" and \"strawberry microbeads\" in, respectively, so... wouldn't recommend, even in theory 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\n+ Bliscent Lychee & Sea Buckthorn Face Wash\n\n+ Himalaya Purifying Neem Face Wash (tube, not foaming pump)\n\n+ Himalaya Tan Removal Orange Face Wash (not the scrub)\n\n+ DermaCo 2% Cica-Glow Daily Face Wash with Tranexamic Acid & Licorice Extract (contains something called \"Gillet-C\", which I cannot find as an ingredient anywhere, but seems to have something to do with vitamin C?)\n\n+ Mamaearth Charcoal Face Wash (with activated charcoal and coffee)\n\n+ Clean & Clear Natural Bright Face Wash\n\n+ Re'equil Fruit AHA Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Rejusure 2% Salicylic Acid Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/th4u4s/review_rejusure_2_salicylic_acid_face_wash/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Zitclin Zitcare Foam Face Wash (2% salicylic acid in a \"gel base q.s. containing aloe vera\". Pharma product with incomplete ingredients - currently using, will review)\n\n+ Pulp Off-Duty Cleanser - Aloe Vera, Azelaic Acid, and Alpha Arbutin\n\n+ Aqualogica Clear+ Smoothie Face wash\n\n+ Aqualogica Radiance+ Smoothie Face wash (contains menthol)\n\n+ Plum Green Tea Pore-Cleansing Face Wash (contains cellulose beads and glycolic acid)\n\n+ Put Simply Get Your Greens pH Balanced Gel Cleanser \n\n+ Joy Coconut & Coffee Skin Refreshing & Energising Anti Pollution Gel Scrub (contains walnut shell, coffee seed powder, and perfume - wouldn't suggest for sensitive skin)\n\n+ Joy Spearmint & Eucalyptus Mood Uplifting & Skin Softening Stress Relief Scrub (Seems to be a sugar scrub, contains spearmint & eucalyptus essentil oils)\n\n+ VLCC Mulberry and Rose Fairness Face Wash (contains mulberry, rose, orange and lemon peel extract and glycolic acid)\n\n+ Round Lab 1025 Dokdo Cleanser\n\n#🐳 Moisturizers\n\n**Note:** people with malassezia have quite an individual reaction to squalane. Sugarcane squalane is considered fungal-safe. Olive squalane is variable - some people with malassezia use it with zero issues, some find it aggravates their condition. I've mentioned the source of the squalane in these products whenever I've been able to find that info.\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you are dealing with active seb derm/fungal acne and want to be on the safe side, best to avoid products containing mineral oil, liquid paraffin or Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather - even too much MCT oil - can lead to oil and heat building up and cause flare-ups. Less is more.\n\n+ Body Cupid 99% Pure Aloe Vera Gel (OG Aloe gel for me. Soothing and healing for skin, plus I use it every time I shampoo - I use the WOW one only if this is unavailable)\n\n+ Rahul Phate's lnnovations Hydra-smooth Hydrating Gel (contains urea.

It's more expensive that the Rahul Phate one, but on the pro side - it's vegan [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/sirkr3/review_of_fungalsafe_moisturiser_dr_sheths_aloe_1/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) \n\n+ Dr. Sheth’s Haldi & Hyaluronic Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer (contains \"haldi beads\")\n\n+ Dr. Sheth’s Hibiscus and Niacinamide Lotion (contains 5% niacinamide and allantoin, mentions lightweight but also contains occlusives like paraffin above the 5% niacinamide, so if ingredient order is reliable, this may be good for those with dryness)\n\n+ Dr. Sheth's Vitamin E & Ginseng Moisturizing Cream (contains light liquid paraffin as occlusive, so should help for drier skin)\n\n+ Earth Rhythm Sea Glow Gel\n\n+ Earth Rhythm Phyto Clear Oil-free Moisturiser (contains Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Extract) \n\n+ Earth Rhythm Depuff Undereye Gel (contains kojic acid,   botanical extracts)\n\n+ ONE THING Centella Soothing Cream ([my review here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/z72rrf/review_one_thing_centella_soothing_cream/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)]\n\n+ Zitmoist Gel (the [ingredients provided on the packaging](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/zitmoist-gel-50gm) are just 1% sodium hyaluronate and 0.3% allantoin, in an \"gel base containing aloe vera gel\" - incomplete list) \n\n+ e.l.f.

Yes. Do I appreciate that they clearly state when their products are malassezia safe? Also, yes 😂)\n\n+ It's Skin Aloe Relaxing Cream\n\n+ It's Skin Hyaluronic Acid Moisture Emulsion\n\n+ Aqualogica Glow+ Luminous Under Eye Gel (contains niacinamide, fragranced)\n\n+ CeraVe Healing Ointment (contains petrolatum, mineral oil, ceramides, hyaluronic acid and panthenol. Does also contain water, so I'd consider it a rich moisturizer rather than a balm/plain occlusive)\n\n+ Aveeno Daily Moisturizing  Body Lotion with SPF 15 (not the other variants, only the SPF 15 one)\n\n+ Nykaa SKINRX Ceramide Barrier Repair Deep Nourish Night Moisturizer For Oily Skin (contains ceramides 1, 2, 3, 4, 6II, cholesterol and oat extract)\n\n+ Nykaa SKINRX 5% Niacinamide Day Moisturiser with SPF 15 for Oily Skin (also contains alpha arbutin, ceramides 1, 2, 3, 4, 6II and cholesterol)\n\n+ Nykaa SKINRX Oil Free Vitamin C - Illuminate + Day Moisturizer with SPF 15 for Oily Skin (contains ethyl ascorbic acid)\n\n+ Nykaa SKINRX Hyaluronic Acid Hydra-X Night Moisturizer For Oily Skin (NOT the one of the same name for Dry Skin, that one contains olive oil)\n\n+ Truekind Daily Dew Hyaluronic & Squalane Water Crème \n\n+ Truekind Manjistha and Saffron Moisture Gel (contains botanicals, 1-2% niacinamide)\n\n+ Truekind Bio Exfoliant Brightening Sleeping Mask (contains botanicals, 1-2% niacinamide, less than 0.5% potassium azeloyl diglycinate)\n\n+ Truekind Acne Calming Herb Rescue Mask (gel mask with various botanical extracts - suggested use as sleeping mask/daytime moisturizer)\n\n+ Lakmé Sun Expert After Sun Cooling Gel\n\n+ Joy Hydra Refresh Ultra Light Gel (with glycerin, allantoin and D-panthenol.

People have asked me how I choose one, and having looked at the available brands on Amazon, I can say that the brands Sharrets, Carbamide Forte and Growfit appear to be C8+C10 only, so they're suitable. \n\nThe brands Laurin and Kayos, for example, also contain C12, which is lauric acid - NOT fungal-safe. The brand Simyl is available in chemists and very cheap, but it's meant to be a weight gain supplement for infants, and is not fungal-safe. That's about all there is to look out for when purchasing, the rest is trial, even for me ☺️\n\n+ Aiwo MCT C8 Oil (unfortunately the only C8 oil I can find, only available  in a 500ml bottle for around 2000 bucks)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil with Vitamin E (the original, plain one) - just mineral oil with vitamin E and added fragrance\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you want to be on the safe side, best to avoid mineral oil, liquid paraffin and Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather, even too much MCT oil, can lead to oil and heat building and cause flare-ups. Less is more, and if using mineral oil, a literal drop or two may be enough.\n\n+ Plain mineral oil/liquid paraffin - available at chemists. Not sure if it's less refined than the baby oil, but it's far cheaper (as it should be baby products are marked up like crazy) and has no fragrance\n\n+ Boroline/Boroline Night Repair Cream (waterless balm - same ingredients list, contains lanolin - not vegan - which may not suit some people's skin)\n\n+ Good old plain Vaseline \n\n+ Minimalist 100% Squalane (olive squalane, which works for some people with fungal issues and breaks some people out 🙃)\n\n+ Indulgeo Quench – 100% Sugarcane Squalane\n\n+ Indulgeo Squalane (70% olive, 30% sugarcane)\n\n+ PURITO Plainet Squalane Oil (sugarcane squalane, which is fungal-safe for sure. Will definitely be purchasing this myself, thank you u/imnumo!)\n\n+ The Ordinary 100% Plant-Derived Squalane [Edit: may be derived from different sources in different locations, will update if I find out details. From what I can find online, its derived from [sugarcane and beets](https://m.facebook.com/theordinary/photos/a.286843978083265/2326766210757688/?type=3)]\n\n+ Earth Rhythm Sugar squalane (ingredient list as 100% sugarcane derived)\n\n#🌤 Sunscreens \n\n+ Episoft AC moisturizer with microencapsulated sunscreen SPF 30 (water-based)\n\n+ Fixderma Shadow Spf 30+ PA+++ Gel (water based)\n\n+ Fixderma Shadow Sunscreen SPF 50+ PA+++ Gel (water based)\n\n+ Re'equil Ultra Matte Dry Touch Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA++++ (the blue one - silicone based) \n\n+ Brinton Healthcare UvDoux Face & Body Sunscreen gel with SPF 50 PA+++ (silicone based)\n\n+ IPCA Acne-UV Gel SPF 30 PA+++ (silicone based)\n\n+ IPCA Acne UV Gel SPF 50 PA+++ (silicone based)\n\n+ Missha All Around Safe Block Essence Sun Milk SPF50+/PA+++ - green (contains denatured alcohol as third ingredient, and various botanical extracts, water based)\n\n+ DermaCo 1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum SPF 50 PA++++ (has niacinamide - water based)\n\n+ DermaCo Hyaluronic Invisible Sunscreen Gel SPF50 PA+++ with Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E (silicone based)\n\n+ DermaCo Ultra Matte Sunscreen Gel SPF60 PA+++ (silicone based)\n\n+ Plum 2% Niacinamide & Rice Water SPF 50 PA+++ Hybrid Sunscreen (contains rice ferment filtrate. Water based)\n\n+ Phy Active Sun Protect Sunscreen Gel SPF 60 (no PA rating, contains niacinamide, green tea extract, panthenol, fragrance) - \"for men\" brand, same ownership as Plum\n\n+ Rivela Ultralight Matte Dry Sunscreen Gel SPF50 PA+++(silicone based)\n\n+ Bubblefarm Ultra Light Daily Sunshield SPF40 PA+++ (UVA/B)(water based) - contains Thermus Thermophilis Extract, a fermented ingredient, \"essential oil blend\"  and undisclosed \"eco-certified preservative\"\n\n+ Photon 360 Hydra Sunscreen Fluid Cream SPF50 PA+++ (water based) - near identical ingredient list to the Bubblefarm one, except it contains Yellow Iron Oxide instead of zinc oxide. Also contains Thermus Thermophilis Extract and \"essential oil blend\".

    "body": "I joined the sub a few weeks back, as one of those \"I'll get around to it\" things. Well, something must have affected me subconsciously as the posts scrolled by on my daily Home feed, and last night I had the first lucid dream in years.\n\nIt was awful.\n\nBasically, I had the \"back in school\" setting going on, last minute exams, typical stuff. All of the sudden I see one of my friends that I hadn't seen in 14 years sitting on some steps. I call out her name, she looks up and smiles... but only politely.\n\nAs soon as we lock eyes, I knew I was dreaming, we hadn't spoken in as many years (fall out due to my depression at the time). I could feel my face muscles fall back into that sad nothingness that always associated itself with my depressed states, and I just stared at her, amazed my brain could produce such a convincing image. My gut sank remembering how close we were for a little while, and how my stupid, out of control emotions at the time screwed all that up.\n\nI said out loud \"No, I don't want this\", and she literally disappeared, leaving just the empty steps behind, me still staring at the spot she just was. Back when I used to LD a lot more in my 20's, I would have taken this opportunity to do all kinds of experimenting. But now, as a middle aged brain, I just didn't care. I had just seen someone I used to care a great deal for, and identify with, and for a moment my brain allowed me to pretend that life hadn't screwed that connection up.\n\nI woke up extremely sad, and now that I'm writing it out, I'm almost tearing up. Maybe this isn't much about lucid dreaming after all. Maybe I just miss my friend.\n\nEdit: Y'all are awesome, but I'm clearly bumming everyone out. So to make up for it, I'll share a cool recipe I recently discovered: Mocha flavored coffee + a few drops of peppermint oil = Girl Scout Thin Mint Cookies, with like zero calories. Repressed sadness is hard and complicated, but Thin Mints fucking rock.\n\nEdit 2: I just got a message from Reddit about their \"crisis\" counselor chat lines, you guys are awesome haha. I'll be ok, really. In these troubling times, let's focus on those who are going through a real crisis - the r/freefolk subreddit.",

My husbands long lost American friend from his crazy party college days in Chile was passing by with his wife. I had never met either of them so really had no idea what I was in for.\n\nThey were and are both nice people. The wife, 'kate' was very into doing things she decribes as 'authentic', 'self-love', 'touching your deepest most inner hooha' or whatever and was of course, at the white-woman-cis gendered-wisdom filled age of 30, was writting a book about how to obsess over ones neuroses. She called it an 'in depth study of self-love.' Not my thing, but tolerable none the less.\n\nDay 2 of their stay comes and the guys decide to head the river to whip each other with algae and find a dead thing to poke a stick with. Kate needs to stay to use the wifi so she can do her 'online lecture for work.' Now, that should have been my 1st clue. I thought of it as a university/college lecture because lecture in british english is reserved for that context. \n\nI was wrong.\n\nShe ended up having to do it in the lounge, where I was set up breastfeeding my baby. But that's cool she says it's no problem, she has headphones, and the camera will be off us. \n\nThe beginning of the 'lecture' almost had my jaw drop. The bottles started coming out,she explained how her mother was  currently hospitalized for a mental breakdown and her family's refusal to treat her with OILS was driving an 'un-healable rift' between her and them and THIS is why she is SO passionate about her product and lifestyle. \n\nWhat in the mother fucking fuck.\n\nThe train just derailed from there. She started talking about how antibiotics are ineffective because they can't kill a virus...yes you read that right...a VIRUS. \n\nShe advocated ingestion of oils and topically applying undiluted oils. My favourite was when she rubbed peppermint oil on her neck 'as a natural way to cool ones body down' only to have trouble talking for a few mins after. Cause guess what? When it's fucking 100F, and you're a sweaty troll, that shit BURNS.\n\n\nMy baby sat through the whole hostage situation without crying, so I was naughty and moved her around so she made a little 'waaa' and I could gtfo.\n\nIt was an awkward 4 day stay that ended with a thank you gift of doterra samples. This girl has a goddamn masters. Her husband works in finance. They do not have money problems. I have no answers lol.",

In fact when I was a teenager, I didn’t ever party or drink until I was 18 almost 19. It wasn’t until I was 20 years old that I smoked weed for the first time, and from then on, I’ve absolutely loved it. \n\nI get very very self-conscious about it though. If i smoke it, I always make sure to change my shirt, to wash my hands, to wear cologne, put eye drops in my eyes, and I put peppermint oil in my mouth to drown out the smell. I guess my rationale is that I feel like people get very judgy about it, and if I smoke weed, they’ll think I’m trashy for it.\n\nIs it trashy to smoke weed?

        "body": "I was in a highly controlled religious environment which trafficked me for labor during my late teens (the trafficking ended when I turned 18 but I was still at home with my overly-zealous parents). Needless to say, I didn't party or anything until after 21. Didn't even drink on my 21st birthday. I just called off work and spent the day at home playing video games. I started smoking weed when I was 21. \n\nDidn't make it a daily habit until the last couple of years. It has worked wonders for my general disposition. I don't wake up anxious before work anymore. I am not constantly worried about the future, although I am able to think about it without worrying. It's really made a huge difference. I also came down with testicular cancer which didn't spread beyond my testicle. I don't think weed cures cancer but evidence shows it can slow the spread. I lend a little credit to weed for keeping it in stage 1.\n\nMy husband was concerned about it at first, but I think that he sees that the weed doesn't change me as a person. I act relatively the same when I am high as when I am sober.\n\nMy suggestion: get a small rechargeable battery and some cartridges of THC oil. They don't leave a lingering smell. You can pretty much hit them anywhere and just say it's an e-cig. It also gets rid of the \"trashy\" part of smoking. It feels and appears more sophisticated to smoke those little oil pens than hitting flower. I don't personally think smoking weed in any form is trashy. Smoking cigarettes is trashy (and I am still guilty of it on occasion when partying) and I think people tend to get smoking cigarettes and smoking weed mixed up in their head.\n\nMy other suggestion: Don't become a vaping bro. That shit's annoying with the clouds of stinky ass water vapor everywhere. Vaping is not safer than smoking cigarettes and it's really really really irritating.",

    "body": "The other day, I was down another rabbit hole of Careprost for lashes and found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/ky9ece/24_days_progress_rosemary_and_peppermint_oil_and/gjfaxsy?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) very useful comment on r/HaircareScience\n\nTl;DR: Key points-\n\n1. Rosemary oil is as effective as minoxidil for hair growth\n2. Castor oil as a carrier oil for all packs due to it's anti-fungal, conditioning & growth boosting properties\n3. Other oils & ingredients to be added as per concern\n\n\\[Crosspost\\]Several years ago, after reading up a lot on Rosemary Oil and finding it is a common ingredient in many regrowth serums, I have been using it with a variation of Castor Oil hair masks, some also with Peppermint Oil. I've been using my masks for roughly 4 years now and my hair is completely different and no longer concerns me.\n\nI have shared this a few times elsewhere so copy and pasting the relevant parts (after a lot, a lot of research), where brows and lashes were more the focus; I use only pure Castor Oil on my lashes and the other hair mask mixtures on my brows. Also I was using a hair mask weekly to every 10 days for the first 2 years or so, then 3 times a month for roughly a year, and now (coming up on 2 years) I use one every 2-3 weeks.\n\nWarning **LONG** post.\n\nI combine the mixture into two 30ml or one 60ml dropper bottles (ratios dependent on hair length) since it can be mixed/shaken well and I find it to be the easiest/least messy way to apply it in sections (I also warm the bottle(s) in a mug of hot tap water for about 5-7 minutes prior for the hot oil effect), starting at the roots and moving my way down to the tips. I always massage it into my scalp for a good 10+ minutes once done, I use a gentle, non-stripping shampoo and wash twice to get it all out/prevent weighing it down. (I aim to use it where I don't need to style my hair the following day to give it a break and honestly it's too soft to hold most styles I've found and just leave it with only a bit of leave-in conditioner). I buy a pack of [100 disposable shower caps](http://imgur.com/a/bm3CO8c) from Amazon for around $3-$5 too to make using the masks really easy. I'll use one of the below masks...\n\n**• Castor Oil & Aloe Vera Hair Mask**\n\n*For a nourished and healthy scalp, conditions hair, adds shine and strength and promotes growth. I use 70% Castor Oil and 30% Aloe (I prefer Lily of the Desert) and ideally left overnight but I aim for a minimum 2 hours, I use a disposable shower cap. It's a very gentle and soothing mask. (Rosemary Oil optional.)*\n\n**• Castor Oil & Fractioned Coconut Oil Hair Mask**\n\n*Ideal for thin (thinning) hair, to get healthier, thicker and stronger hair, also promotes growth. I mix 60:40 oils and leave on for 45 minutes to an hour, wrapped in a hot/warm towel. (Rosemary Oil optional.)*\n\n**• Castor Oil, Egg & Honey Mask**\n\n*For split ends, damaged and unruly hair; promotes growth, nourishes and tames, also helps with an irritated scalp; it's very deep conditioning. I use 1 egg, 8 tablespoons of castor oil, and 2 tablespoon of honey (I warm the honey slightly to mix it in easier). Leaving it on for approximately an hour, wrapped with a shower cap and a hot/warm towel over top. Note: Once honey is mixed, it is not the sticky mess you would anticipate and it's not at all difficult to wash away either.*\n\n***Re: Eggs***\n\n>*\"For normal hair use the entire egg to condition, use egg whites only to treat oily hair; use egg yolks only to moisturize dry brittle hair.\"*\n\n**• Castor Oil & Sweet Almond Oil Hair Mask**\n\n*Perfect for thin and/or lifeless hair, again promotes growth and is a deeply nourishing mask and adds bounce. I use a 60% and 40% ratio. Best left on overnight wrapped initially with a hot/warm towel for an hour and then with a disposable shower cap if leaving on overnight. (Rosemary Oil optional.)*\n\n**• Castor Oil & Water Hair Mask**\n\n*This one is easiest to make obviously and comes with the same benefits of thick, shiny and strong hair, along with regrowth. I use approximately 10+ tablespoons oil and 2-3 tablespoons of water to thin it and help it spread easier. Leaving it on for two hours minimum, overnight is great too from my experience. (Rosemary Oil optional...I sometimes add in Peppermint Oil as well which also stimulates follicles.)*\n\n**• Castor Oil & Argan Oil Hair Mask**\n\n*This mask is highly moisturizing, helps strengthen strands, less breakage and less fallout will be noticed, promotes hair growth, bounce and shine and is nourishing for the scalp. I use a 50:50 ratio and leave it on anywhere from 1 hour (with a hot towel) to overnight (with a shower cap). (Rosemary and Peppermint Oil optional, I personally always add both to this mask.)*\n\n**• Castor Oil & Ylang Ylang Mask**\n\n*\"This mask is an effective natural treatment to reduce hair fall out caused by stress and alopecia. When it is massaged into the hair follicles, it stimulates hair growth and is a natural way to treat thinning hair according to studies.\" I mix a 70:30 ratio and leave it on for an hour, wrapped in a warm towel. (Rosemary Oil optional.)*\n\nWhere I've said **\"Rosemary Oil Optional\"**, I do add it in, (often with Peppermint Oil as well), after finding it's either a very common ingredient (as is Castor Oil) or performs similarly to hair regrowth serums (I'll generally add in 10-15 drops based on my ratios (or roughly 8 and 8 drops if adding in both Peppermint and Rosemary Oils...**if unfamiliar or new to EOs, I highly recommend a patch test that is mixed with a carrier oil and only a couple of drops added**): \n\n>*\"If you want to improve both hair thickness and hair growth, rosemary oil is a great choice thanks to its ability to improve cellular generation. According to studies, rosemary oil performed as well as minoxidil, a common hair growth treatment, but with less to no scalp itching as a side effect.\"*\n\n***Note re:*** *oil substitutions, in place of Sweet Almond, Fractioned Coconut, Ylang Ylang or Argan Oils (or perfectly fine added in/combined if preferred), Sesame, Grapeseed, Avocado and/or Jojoba Oils have all shown similar hair and scalp health benefits. I'll mix and match whatever I have on hand or if out of one of them but Castor Oil is always the main base.*\n\n**Castor oil’s antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal properties make it an effective treatment for scalp infections, dandruff and/or irritations including dry or oily scalp. Also it's strengthening, shine boosting, conditioning and promoting of hair growth, it dramatically improves fallout too from my experience and is usually one of the main ingredients in hair regrowth systems/serums. Although I have tried and liked many,** [**this Castor Oil**](http://imgur.com/a/uU4qvGY) **is my favourite one that I always go back to and have now solely used for the last 2 years.**\n\nLastly: For realistic expectations since I know many who tried it for a few weeks to a month and didn't see results fast enough and/or weren't consistent; I've been using castor oil for hair, brows and lashes for around 4 years now. After a couple of weeks, everything simply looked healthier with added shine. After 1 month I started seeing baby hairs growing in where there weren't any previously, my hair stopped falling out at such a high rate, often I would brush my hair and be really surprised to see maybe 2 strands in the brush vs a huge handful, it was also feeling stronger and had a lot of body, lashes looked lengthened and brows looked mildly fuller. At 3 months my hair was definitely thicker and stopped falling out completely, other than normal shedding. It was at the 6 month mark my hair had grown in length quite significantly, it was healthy, very strong, shiny, had bounce to it and was much, much thicker...my brows were full again and no sparse areas, lashes were longer and fuller as well. (I applied nightly to brows and lashes, I use [these tubes](http://imgur.com/a/pAOK2DC) from AliExpress, also available on Amazon for just a bit more, which were quite cheap.)\n\nI hope this helps! :)\n\nShoutout to u/therealmrsbrady for sharing her routine.",

Like, REALLY bad. Posted on my birthcenter mom group looking for advice and was told to try essential oils after I had tried pretty much everything else I could. Yes, I actaully listened to them: I didn't know what I was walking into and it was my first experience hearing of them. I desperately needed relief. \n\nThe ones that i was told to use were lemon and peppermint oil. I was supposed to put some of that on a cotton ball and just stick it up there and it was *supposedly* supposed to calm the inflammation and pain.\n\nWell I tried it and **SON OF A BITCH** have you ever felt the same sensation as 1,000 bees stinging your asshole at the same time, inside and out? I was HOWLING. My asshole and entire ass was red and blotchy. Tears were streaming down my face. I was laying in a puddle of sweat, paralyzed on the bathroom floor wondering what I had done to God to piss him off so bad that he felt the need to punish my asshole like this.\n\nThis shit lasted for **over an hour** and the entire time I was seriously toying with the idea of going to the emergency room and spreading my cheeks on display for them so they could let me know if my asshole was literally burning off. \n\nI later learned that they were supposed to be diluted with water and tested on a non sensitive are first, none of which I was told, but honestly I should have been smart enough to think of it. \n\nThe pain eventually went away, but my trauma didn't. I haven't joined a facebook mom group since. \n\nAnytime someone even *attempts* to talk to me about essential oils all I say is, \"I stay far away from those. They make my asshole burn.\"\n\n\n\nTL;DR: I attempted to relieve my hemorrhoids by putting essential oils directly on my asshole after trying nearly all other remedies. It didn't work and felt like my asshole was being stung my 1,000 angry bees. ",

    "body": "A couple months back I was fighting a bad sinus infection. Being unable to take decongestants, I was trying all kinds of natural remedies to open my head up so I could breathe. Several friends had suggested I try peppermint oil in some fashion or another. Since I was at the end of my rope with the stuffiness, I stopped at the local health food store and picked up the cheapest bottle available.\n\nOnce I got home I set about applying the peppermint oil. Most friends had told me they dabbed a drop or two under their noses. After I mixed the peppermint with olive oil I rubbed some under my nose. After a minute of not noticing any relief I decided that if a little bit was good that more should be better. I proceeded to rub more oil on my temples and at the base of my neck.\n\nAbout that time the burning sensation kicked in. My head was on fire. I ran to the bathroom and tried to remove the oil on my temples. However my wiping at the oil only served to smudge it over a greater area. Soon the burning sensation and smell of peppermint became too much for me to bear.\n\nI jumped in the shower to wash away all the oil. But again the oil just seemed to multiply and flow all over my skin. The next spot it landed was on my chest. As bad as it was to have my head burn, having the burning so near my lungs was worse. I began to panic in earnest.\n\nI jumped out of the shower and began to yell for my husband to help me. He came in the bathroom to see me naked and jumping around screaming \"Help me, my boobs are burning!\" Of course he started laughing and I started crying.\n\nFirst he brought me Dawn to wash with. It helped a little, but the boobs continued to burn. He looked up how to remove essential oil on the Internet and saw a recommendation to wipe with olive oil. We got some cotton balls and started wiping things down. The fire on my head was gone, but the boobs continued to tingle.\n\nAs I was pretty much having a full on panic attack by now we called an essential oil retailer to get advice. She worried I was suffering a chemical burn as I had used a cheap product that probably contained additives. She suggested rinsing the area with milk.\n\nAfter giving my chest a milk bath, I had had enough. I threw on some clothes and we drove to the nearest medstop. I just wanted to breath normally and have someone tell me if I had burned myself or not.\n\nI have to give the nurse credit for never once laughing as I told her this story and showed her the reddish pinkish spot on my tingly chest. She told me I was fine and wondered if I was just having an allergic reaction to the oil. The doctor couldn't resist making some crack about me making salad dressing when I told him everything I had put on my chest to stop the burning.

I had to go to a c section and wasn't relishing the idea of smelling cauterized flesh while feeling nauseous, so I asked one of the nurses I worked with if she could put a dab of one of her stronger smelling oils on the inside of my mask before I went back. She put just the absolute barest dab of peppermint oil on my mask. I made it through the c section, took my mask off, and sat down to chart and realized for the first time in weeks I didn't have a headache. I said something about it out loud and the person who gave me the oil said that peppermint is known for helping headaches. It wasn't placebo for me because I had never even heard that. She offered to order me some of her YL peppermint oil but I just bought some on Amazon. Over the years I've tried it on different headaches and it doesn't work on all of them. Every time I had one while I was pregnant, it cleared it up right away. Occasionally I'll get a headache that doesn't respond to ibuprofen or Tylenol and peppermint seems to help then. But don't get me wrong, I don't believe in any of the other oil woo.",

I know it’s hard. 21M; 9 Weeks Minoxidil.\n\n (My apologies if this all sounds a bit clunky, i used the creation of this post as my break from studying for a pathogenesis final exam lol.)\nKeep in mind I’m at a major university and one of the biggest party schools in the country with a top 20 football team. For me to be going bald was unacceptable so trust me, I understand all of your struggles. \n\nFirst 3 pictures:\nOctober 11, 2023 - This was approximately 2 weeks into me using topical minoxidil and finasteride from the brand HIMS. \n\nUsed the topical once per day at night with nothing else added throughout the rest of the day. Now I wish I had taken a picture of my hairline back in August when it was mostly fine. (I had used finasteride once before and I got off of it.) Here you can see I was pretty much going completely bald in my corners, which is something I inherited from my father meaning it’s GeNeTiC. However it was this day, that I decided I wanted to do a little research and see what else I could use to boost my hair growth. \n\nI ended up buying avocado oil, peppermint oil, a derma stamp and a couple weeks after these first few photos I started applying the topical twice per day due to the half-life of minoxidil being about 18 hours. I wanted to make sure I was working all day. I began applying the avocado/peppermint in about a 5:1 ratio pretty much every other day. (Pure Peppermint oil is extremely potent so be sure you use much more avocado oil, hence the 5:1 ratio.) I would also derma stamp at a length of 1.5mm once every 7 days. I would do about 8 stamps each corner. \n\nThe next 3 pictures:\nNovember 29th, 2023 -  9AM\nDoing everything mentioned above, even missed a day or EVEN TWO occasionally due to the schedule of a pre-medical student lol. However, you can still see substantial growth. Now the surrounding hair makes it look worse than it actually is. Couple weeks prior I also bought a DHT blocking shampoo that I use maybe once or twice per week depending on how my scalp feels. \n\nPoint is, I knew my hair looked a lot better than this, but I needed to get a style that showed me that. So what did I do? What every black mother does to their kid on a Saturday, GET A HAIRCUT. (Should probably note that I didn’t get a haircut for 7 weeks because sometimes the lineups that us black people get can stunt the growth of the affected hair follicles.)\n\nLast picture. \nNovember 29th, 2023 - 10:45 AM\nIt’s possible. I am a prime example. Whether it’s from genetics or stress, you can defeat hair loss whether it be mentally or physically. I didn’t do anything crazy, I just stuck to the process. I had the dread shed but I trusted the process. JUST TRUST THE PROCESS! Hell after I took the first set of pictures I wore a beanie for 2 weeks straight and didn’t go out to any bars during that time. I will be happy to answer any questions in the comments or DMs",

    "body": "No matter who you are, what agency you work for, or your location on the globe, there are certain individuals that you keep running into. Everyone has at least one “That Guy”. No, not the DnD That Guy. Usually he’s /r/FloridaMan material. Sometimes he’s a truly awful person, but most times he’s not. He’s probably got a history with your agency that goes back well beyond the start of your career, and beyond the birth date of most redditors. The first time you dealt with him, wide-eyed and surprised, you probably ran and told one of the old, salty vets on your shift, who just chuckled and told you that “Yup, that sounds like him”. I was no exception, and my introduction to one of our local repeat customers was certainly memorable. We’re gonna call him Jack, for no particular reason.\n\nActually, that’s not accurate. Jack is called Jack because he liked to drink. Jack especially liked to drink his namesake that came in square bottles with black labels, at least when he could afford to get his hands on it. More often than not, Jack would just make do with whatever bottom-shelf, plastic-bottle swill he could get his hands on, but that’s not really important. Was is important was that this individual, like so many who enter the criminal justice system, probably had no business drinking. In this particular case, it was due to a combination of poor drunken behavior, and some serious health issues. Jack really hadn’t learned his lesson over the years, and his records were testament to that. Our current computerized system has only been in place about 5 years, but the old digital records going back to the early 2000’s were imported. In Jack’s case, someone had painstakingly added all of his paper records to the system, and as a result one can find system cautions with posting dates from the Reagan era.\n\nJack came to me for the first time on a night just like any other. He arrived early in my shift, and being too drunk to be processed, went into the rubber room to sleep it off where we could still keep an eye on him. Nothing notable happened for several hours as he slept peacefully, until at about 0300 when we sent another inebriated individual into the box to get his beauty rest. Jack didn’t budge until we slammed the cell door closed, the loud metallic crash waking him from his intoxicated fog. A few minutes later, he appeared at the window, gently tapping for attention. I walked to the door, where I could smell the booze coming off of him even through the closed door.\n\n“Paper?” he queried through the inches-thick glass, steel and foam. I must have given him a confused look, because he repeated his question. “Paper!? Toilet paper!” He threw up his hands in a confused gesture, acknowledging his accommodation’s lack of sanitary products. I quickly returned with a roll and opened his tray slot, where he graciously accepted his prize. In my coffee-deprived, 3 AM mind, however, I failed to consider one major flaw with this decision. You see, the rubber room is also what is referred to as a “dry cell”. That means no sink, and more importantly, no toilet. There’s a hole in the floor with a grate over it, which is fine if you need to take a leak, but for solid waste disposal it’s not a great option. It’ll work in a pinch, but I (and the inmates) prefer to pull people out to a normal cell for that need if the option is available. My sleepy, decaffeinated brain chose to ignore this fact though, and Jack either didn’t mind or was still to intoxicated to care. I returned to post and went back to forcing myself to stay awake.\n\nMy psudeo-slumber was interrupted about twenty minutes later by the trustee’s loud exclamations. “Aw, damn! What are you doing, man? Don’t do – oh hell no.” I looked up to see the pained expression on his face. “Old boy’s taking a shit in the rubber cell, man.” I craned my neck to see Jack hunched over, looking behind him at his girthy production. Worse still, he had missed the hole in the floor by a good two or three feet. He turned back to me and shrugged, pulling up his pants that he really hadn’t managed to get down in the first place. Suddenly, my nose was assaulted by the worst smell imaginable. I don’t know what Jack had been eating on the outside, but it produced an odor that burned in my nose and made my eyes water. I ran to the door and slammed the tray slot shut, but it was too late – the smell had escaped. My coworkers started to complain and a female that was being processed gasped and gagged. My vision went blurry as my eyes filled with tears. At that moment, I would have preferred to have had a face full of OC than to have to smell this hellish scent. It also probably would have had less effect. \n\nAs other inmates and officers scrambled to get near a ventilation source, I made a mad dash back to my post. You know how when stuff goes really wrong in the hospital, they rub the peppermint oil on a cold mask so that’s all you smell? We don’t really have that. The best I could come up with was some hand sanitizer, which I smeared under my nose in the hope that it might clean the air of the noxious odor. My nose was dry and cracked at the corners because I had been fighting off a cold, and the alcohol stung and burned my skin. I couldn’t care less, because it offered a brief respite from smelling something that was more at home in a sewage pipe than anywhere else. I turned to see the trustee at the cell door, holding his nose, and waving frantically to get Jack’s attention. “Get it in the hole, man! You gotta get it in the hole!” He frantically pushed the flush button on the exterior of the cell, hoping to encourage Jack to get the hint. He turned to me and shook his head. “Man, he gotta get it all in the hole. He gotta push it or something.” He turned back briefly before exclaiming again and walking away in disgust. “Aw HELL naw. Not like that, cuz. Nasty ass god damn…” He trailed off as he went to fetch cleaning supplies, drawing the attention of the sergeant, who was coming to investigate the rancid odor.\n\n“What’s he doing, Muff_Huffer?” Prompted by the sarge, I nervously approached the door and peered in the window. What I saw was a scene from a horror film. A three foot long, one foot wide smear lay across the floor of the rubber room. The offending substance was piled haphazardly on top of the grate, mixed with toilet paper. I don’t know why Jack had bothered to ask for the roll, however, because he had applied most of the fecal matter to himself. Caked up to both elbows in his own excrement, it dotted his face and hair where he had scratched himself. There was a trail down the back of his dirty sweatpants and at the bottom of his threadbare thermal shirt. He looked up at me in shock and with indignance, and shrugged, before asking “What? It’s fine.” I shook my head and sighed. “Jack, you gotta clean up a little, bud.” He scoffed. “I’m….fffffine. I’m just…in here, and I just wanna go back to sleep!” I reached for my keys and told him, “Nah man, you gotta get cleaned up. I’m not trying to leave you in there all covered in poop, man.” Jack shook his head and waved his hands dismissively. “Nah, I just wanna stay here. It’s fine.” He stood and turned away.\n\nThen, to my ultimate horror and revulsion, he dropped his pants, squatted and did it again. Same spot. Even more poop. While I watched.\n\nI still have nightmares.\n\nDirty deed done for the second time, I couldn’t tear myself away. It was like watching a bad car accident, when you know you shouldn’t look but you’re so astounded by the violation of the laws of nature that’s happening in front of you that you’re almost compelled to keep watching. Bare ass still hanging out, Jack stood and turned, then bent back over and smeared his second set of turds across the floor and began to smash them through the grate with his bare hands. I swore and knocked on the window. “Dude! At least use the toilet paper!” Jack scoffed and waved his hands again, inadvertently flinging miniscule poop flecks around the cell. This time, his production was looser and less solid, more wet sand than modeling clay like the first one. I screamed silently and turned to the sergeant. I looked apologetically at her and weakly offered, “He…he just did it again.” Sarge looked at me quizzically. “He pooped on the floor a second time, Sarge. He smeared it all over himself and the damn floor. I…I don’t know what else to say.”\n\nSarge looked blankly at me and blinked a few times. “Well…I guess we gotta get him out and clean him up.” The next few minutes were a haze. The unfortunate duty of dressing Jack in his jail clothes fell to me, and after being given several minutes in a bathroom to clean himself up, I had to strip search Jack as part of the booking process. It was here that I discovered he didn’t do as good a job as he thought he did, and despite taking a shower later that night, Jack’s case of mudbutt persisted. I did my best to block those scenes out from my memory, but Jack had left a momento behind – the raw odor of his vile expulsion. Despite the trustee (in a full hazmat suit, no less) throwing every cleaning product in our arsenal at the cell, the smell lingered for hours. It also spread to our new, temporary drunk tank cell, where Jack and his roommate (who slept through the whole thing) had to be moved. The smell hung around for so long and was so bad that it even eventually permeated the virtually sealed control box next to my post, who called me about an hour later asking if the sewer line was backed up again. Someone took pity on me and came up with a can of Febreeze, which I distinctly remember spraying non stop until the can was empty. The remaining few hours of my shift passed without further incident, but the damage was done. Scared and disturbed, I went home that morning with the image of Jack taking his second deuce burned into my brain.\n\nA few days later, I regaled a sergeant on another shift with my harrowing tale of Jack and the giant dung drop. Expecting shock, horror and revulsion, I was instead surprised when he simply gently nodded at the end of the story. “Yup,” he said to me.\n\n“That sounds like him, alright.”\n",

It's where I smuggle plants that I wasn't supposed to buy. \n\nUnfortunately, the spiders also really love to take naps on my sofa. Obviously this is a greenhouse and it is indeed outdoors, where spiders live. \n\nI don't want to kill them or repel them from the entirety of the greenhouse, as I acknowledge their place in the ecosystem as beneficial, and I like them protecting my plants. However, they also fill me with a visceral fear when they hide in the cushions and are really putting a damper on the peaceful napping situation. \n\nIs there something I could put on my little sofa to encourage them to hang out elsewhere? I did try peppermint oil under the cushions, but I didn't really love the sensation of being punched in the face by toothpaste, and it only worked a couple days before it came minty AND spidery. \n\nCitrus oil, maybe? Cinnamon? Just something to stop them from touching me while I sleep. ",

    "body": "On the front page this morning there was a post on a nursing journal about managing morbidly obese patients. This reminded me of my first encounter with the hammiest of hammy patients long, long ago...\n\nSo on to the story! \n\nWay, way back in the day, (we're talking almost 2 decades ago here) when I still did patient care, I had the hammiest of ham encounters. There was a mid-30's male who was admitted inpatient due to a 12cm scrotal tear. He was so morbidly obese (from what I recall, he was upwards of 225kg/500lbs) that the mere act of shifting while sitting on the sofa at home caused his sack to rip, as it was sticking to his inner thighs and fupa. Because I lack in the creative naming department, let's call him Scrotum Ham.\n\nHe required BID wound cleaning done by pulsevac. Usually, this would fall under PT's duties, but clearly, due to his girth, the PT would be requiring multiple assistants in order to treat him. So whomever was around would get snatched up to go assist the PT and I was one of the unlucky ones who happened to be in the vicinity.\n\nWe required 6 people to do this task. PT to wound clean, the rest of us to push his fupa, thighs, and other miscellaneous rolls out of the way so she could access the site. It was no easy task and the smell... oh dear god, the smell... we had to put peppermint oil on the insides of our masks just to keep us from gagging. And of course he just passively laid there, EATING (he somehow magically produced food from god knows where), and being all nonchalant, like nothing was even going on down there whilst we were all struggling, grunting, sweating, and straining at pushing his fat out of the way. It was a workout. And it was seriously pissing off the nurses how he wasn't even attempting at helping move his own mass, and I will never forget his smug face while it was all happening.\n\nThe wound itself looked like a gaping hole, and the PT used a cotton tipped applicator to measure it. It looked like the entire thing would disappear up in him, and these things are long. Strangely enough though, no penis was ever seen in the entirety of his stay. All you could see was the catheter just going up into fat folds. I'm thankful I wasn't around to have to assist in that debacle.\n\nSo the hammy bits I was told by the nurses in the ward? He of course required the \"big boy\" bed (how the nurses referred to the bariatric beds) and these beds only fit in the large private rooms that were recently renovated so they looked very much like posh hotel rooms. Just because they looked like hotel rooms didn't mean they were. This was lost on Scrotum Ham. He constantly hit the nurse call button demanding \"room service\" on the hour, sometimes more, to the point where they had to have a serious chat with him about not abusing the nurse call button.\n\nScrotum Ham never made any effort to try to move when the nurses bathed him, changed linens, or adjust him when he complained of being uncomfortable. And forget about the PT that was ordered by the doc, which only asked him to stand up twice a day at the edge of his bed for as long as he could tolerate. The screams, moans, crocodile tears, and drama he caused were absurd. \n\nHe was put on a strict diet while there, but his enabling (also obese, but not 225kg obese) wife constantly snuck in all kinds of fast food, and of course the nurses did their best to stop it but they couldn't guard his room 24 hours a day. He already sucked far too much time away from the other patients the nurses had to care for.\n\nSo the day came where he was being discharged. He was meant to only stay for 3 days (for the course of IV antibiotics he was on) and then have home health visits for wound care, but each time he was being prepped for discharge, he would cause all kinds of drama and fabricate new ailments to stay longer. He faked a seizure (badly, I might add) and when that didn't work, he tried to fake a coma. Its almost funny if his antics didn't come at the expense of others. I don't know why anyone would want to stay in the hospital but to him, he was living the life: a team of people to feed, bathe, and care for all his needs, around the clock in a nice room with \"maid service.\"\n\nThis guy was such a resource suck, and after 2 weeks, everyone had had enough. He basically was forcibly discharged and sent home via ambulance. He fought the entire way out. It took discharging him to get him to actually move his arms and legs on his own. He tried HITTING the nurses and paramedics and of course screamed how he was going to sue the hospital and how he was being discriminated against, but of course, nothing came of those empty threats. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "TL;DR To help alleviate symptoms of [IBS](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/irritable-bowel-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20360016), find and avoid your trigger foods, don’t overeat or drink (everything in moderation), and stick to the same general (bland-ish) diet every day. Skip the Metamucil and Miralax for magnesium (oxide) supplements instead and find your daily “go time” and stick to it. Avoid tight clothes around your stomach (let her *breeeeeeathe*).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI’ve suffered (with a capital *S*) from **IBS-C** since I was 16 - irregular and infrequent BMs, bloating, abdominal pain, etc. I am now 27 and although this debilitating disorder ebbs and flows, I have generally figured out how to control this grossly under-researched *disease*. Because, according to many doctors, that’s what it is.\n\nThis information may make it seem like I’m some saint who never drinks too much or raids the candy drawer when I know I shouldn’t. I’m human, and sugar is *deliciousssss*. All this to say, I hope these methods help you and to give yourself grace when the holidays come around and you drink one-too-many ‘nogs and have an enormous stomachache afterward. Sometimes, yes pain, but also, a delicious gain.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE:** This is what I've found useful, but everyone is different! Things that work for some may not work for others. I am by no means an expert (of anything) and can only provide my own experience.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**DISCOVERING YOUR TRIGGER FOODS:**\nGIs suggest eliminating one food or drink from your regular diet for at least a few months to measure your gastrointestinal reaction to that particular item. If you have the time and patience, which I did not, go for it! What I did was try to eat the (relatively) same diet for a few weeks. If any meal/snack/drink felt like it caused GI distress afterward, I switched to something else to see if that worked better. From what I've learned, if it's \"bland,\" then the likelihood of upsetting my stomach is much lower. My mom always references the BRAT (Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, Toast) Diet when I'm complaining about IBS (...yet again. Sorry, Mom!). Although not sustainable, the idea is to give the gut a chance to rest; these foods are as bland as they come. So if you get a gnarly stomachache after scarfing down some pigs in a blanket, then feel that same suffering the next week after plowing through some hot wings, it may be time to reevaluate your relationship with fried foods. Sad to say, but for me, it was almost always a High-[FODMAP](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/fodmap-diet-what-you-need-to-know) food that caused the most distress (French fries included :/).\n\nOnce you figure out what’s causing you unnecessary pain, see if you’re able to continue to enjoy it in moderation, or more depressingly, have to eliminate it altogether.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**MY TRIGGERS:**\n\n- Alcohol\n- Carbonated drinks\n- Raw spinach\n- Grapes\n- Apples\n- Bananas\n- Nuts\n- Beans\n- Chocolate\n- (Too much) Dairy\n- (Too much) Sugar\n- Fried foods\n- Highly-processed foods\n- Artificial sweeteners\n- PEANUT BUTTER :’(\n\n… basically everything delicious (and some, nutritious!).\n\nI have found that even if you’re trying to eat healthily, it doesn’t always agree with your gut. For the longest time, I was having spinach salads for lunch, and even if I felt lean and green, my tummy was saying “Please stop, you queen.”\n\nI can eat all of the foods listed above in moderation besides apples and peanut butter – the most delectable snack combo invented. And BANANAS. If bananas are recommended for people recovering from diarrhea, why would I eat them? The goal is *to* go, not to *not* go. Makes logical sense to me.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**MY BLAND-ISH DIET:** I try to eat the same basic (bland-ish) foods every day, and (try not to) overeat. To expedite my “go time,” see below, I start with a fiber-filled, not-so-exciting **breakfast**:\n\n- Cheerios\n- Lactose-free or soy milk\n- 1 cup of coffee\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- For **lunch**, I have a turkey and cheese sandwich on gluten-free oat bread.\n\n- For **snacks**, I stick to Kind Oats & Honey granola bars (they’re less processed and don’t include peanut butter or chocolate, two of my trigger foods), tangerines, blueberries, mozzarella cheese, and gluten-free tortilla chips.\n\n- For **dinner**, I switch it up but make sure to keep the portions moderately small and avoid fried, greasy, or spicy foods. I know, lame. I usually have a protein, veggie, and starch.\n\nWith everything, overeating and drinking is the *killer*. If I indulge too much, my system will be out of whack for days to follow. Just know, if you’re feeling gluttonous, you’ll need to give yourself some time to recover. And that’s okay, we all do it!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**MAGNESIUM SUPPLEMENTS >>>>>:** I have IBS-C, so those of you with IBS-D will probably not benefit from this section.\n\nMy bowel movement schedule looked like this: 4-5 days of no BM, followed by diarrhea, and then the pattern repeated.\n\nI tried it all: Metamucil, Dulcolax, Benefiber, Senokot, castor oil (ew, btw). I was even stirring Miralax *into my coffee* for a time. Because some are bulk-forming laxatives or are taken with lots of water, they blew me up like a balloon. They made me insanely uncomfortable, adding insult to injury, with minimal effects. Then I discovered [magnesium supplements](https://www.target.com/p/magnesium-dietary-supplement-caplets-250ct-up-38-up-8482/-/A-50284728#lnk=sametab), with magnesium oxide as the main ingredient, and my life changed (I know that sounds dramatic, but it’s true).\n\nWomen under 30 are [recommended](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/) to take 310 mg daily, but I take the entire 400 mg caplet - sometimes 2 when it's really bad. Although I don’t have “regular” stools, they’re def loosey-goosey (sorry for that visual), it makes me go, and usually every day — which is a miracle! But I will warn, these are almost always semi-urgent BMs, so make sure a restroom is closeby when it's \"go time.\" Because it’s not a bulk-forming laxative, it doesn’t add additional stomach fullness and discomfort, nor do you have to take it with lots of water (at least I don’t).\n\nYou can get it at pretty much any grocery or drug store. Do(o) itttttt. (Sorry, had to.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**MY \"GO TIME\":** A GI told me a few years ago that, even if I don’t feel the need to “go,” I should *try* to in the mornings after a small meal (and in my case, along with my steadfast natural laxative, coffee). He told me most people have the urge at that time of day and that it could help keep me regular.\n\nI have found it to be true – my sweet spot is typically between 8:30 – 9:30 am. That’s why I try to avoid meetings before 10 am, otherwise, it’s a no-go. Really, anything that disrupts this sacred window of time affects my BMs, which makes me sad, and hurts my tummy. I probably take my daily morning mission too seriously, but I know how important it is to try and stay regular to avoid bloating, discomfort, and pain.\n\nBut if your “go time” is 3:45 pm on the dot, stick to it and try to do your thang at the time each day.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**SWEATPANTS OR BUST:** My mom, who also suffered from IBS in her twenties, tells me, ad nauseam, that wearing tight clothing around her stomach always made her symptoms worse. Makes sense.\n\nThis is not to say you can never bust out those high-waisted leather pants you’ve been dying to display, but that you may want to consider unzipping your jeans or throwing on your fave sweatpants when you’re lounging around the house. Try it, you’ll find instant relief.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**INVEST IN A SQUATTY POTTY?:** Out of recent desperation, I caved and invested in a (foldable) [Squatty Potty](https://www.target.com/p/7-fold-n-stow-foldable-toilet-stool-white-squatty-potty/-/A-54626871) to help alleviate and eliminate. I know, it's a $25 stool, don't judge me.

        "body": "I’m 30M with about 9 years of IBS, leaning heavily (like 95%) C, so I guess I’m technically IBS-A. \n\nI’m on the low FODMAP diet. It has helped a ton. I realized my problem was two part (at least). I have hyper sensitivity in my GI, so my bloating is 20x worse. For this I take nortriptyline daily. I also am sensitive to certain foods like garlic, onion, wheat, fructose, lactose. I try to avoid them as much as I can. Comically small amounts are enough to set me off. This diet however, comes with its own problems. I’ve found that fiber intake is difficult to maintain with low FODMAP. Lots of Bristol 1-2. So I use Metamucil when I remember and am in fiber shortage. Doing small amounts consistently is better. It’s also easy to over do it if you had sufficient fiber and can go the other way and make you worse. Best is to be aware of your fiber intake that day and adjust accordingly. I’ve also found myself getting more and more sensitive to fodmaps over time. \n\nFor others, Linzess is really good for IBS-C to get BMs more regularly. \n\nFor pain and gas management I use THC free CBD oil for pain and simethicone for bloat. \n\nI also use quatrase an enzyme supplement when eating some foods that could be triggering if they have higher fodmaps. \n\nMany smaller meals is better than few large ones. \n\nI also used to use peppermint oil and drink ginger tea. But haven’t done that in a while and will resume. Peppermint oil to help reduce current upset stomach. \n\nI’ve just invested in two full featured bidets, one with an “enema” like function to help clear out 1-2s. Tried squatty potty. Sometimes helps a little. \n\nHeated blankets can help alleviate pain and helps gas move along. \n\nFlare ups can me compounding and last longer than you expect. Foods that aren’t normally trigger foods can easily fall over the line and trigger symptoms if you’re more inflamed. \n\nHaven’t done VSL in a long while but used to use their Double strength. I do drink kefir regularly however. \n\nMany of us are in this camp because we don’t have a specific diagnosis and I’ve done so many negative tests, celiac, endoscopy, colonoscopies, sitz marker, hydrogen breath test, low FODMAP challenge, etc. most of them come back, you’re all fine, but your pain and bloat tells you you’re not. \n\nI have yet to try more different types of supplements. Haven’t tried frequency healing. Haven’t tried Nerva or psycho behavioral therapy. Haven’t tried stool transplant. Haven’t tried antibiotics round but will soon. Haven’t tried the extreme bland diet method either. Also interested in trying probiotics with capsules that survive the stomach. So I’m not out of ideas/things to try. But it constrains my life in a very big way and hasn’t shown any signs of improvement — in fact, slowly gets worse.",

I’ve become much more aware of processed crap affecting me (pun intended) so I’m trying to cut it out while on a budget! Even just having real butter instead of blue bonnet or real coffee cream instead of lactose-free processed coffeemate makes a difference. (However, I know dairy can be a trigger and it still needs to be in moderation.)\n\nFellow lover of sugar and definitely notice high-fructose corn syrup is the worst offender. I did some reading and found that our body doesn’t like fructose in large quantities so I try to stick to cane sugar when possible. Get me that glucose. 😎\n\nI definitely joined the jogger pants train due to IBS! Never liked wearing sweatpants because they felt more like pajamas, but I will wear joggers all day every day for stomach relief.\n\nThis final note is definitely person-dependent, but my IBS-D greatly improved when I started my anti-anxiety medication. I never picked up on the fact that my symptoms were worse when my anxiety was worse. Some trigger foods are no longer trigger foods and others only trigger if I eat excessively. On bad anxiety days I still notice an uptick in symptoms, but normal days are much more manageable. Sometimes I’m more grateful to my meds for managing my IBS than my actual anxiety! 😅",

    "body": "I cannot believe I have a new story.\n\n\nNo offence but I hoped to never post to this sub again. \n\n\n*Sigh*\n\n\nI will start this story off with a well known fact. When you are the married couple in a group of young 20 somethings you immediately get 'Proper Adult' status and are expected to be able to do things like file correct tax returns and mediate housemate disputes. \n\n\nThe former I can do, the latter I despise. \n\n\nOne day my husband, housemate and myself were having a little meeting. (Boring stuff, Hyeong may move out soon and there was some funny banter around that if anyone cares) When I get a phone call from Surgeon-Chick, who you may remember from [https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/3k15yd/tamakun_is_back_also_prequel_to_memorial_day_cow/](this) story. All you really need to know about her is she is a very petite female in most of my classes. She also lives just down the street from me with four housemates. Two of which camp out in the basement, guess which ones feature in this story?\n\n\nSo Surgeon-Chick has called to tell me to tell me her landlady had visited, inspected the place and upon seeing the unsightly mess in the basement told them they had one hour to clean in out or she would get ready to evict the two guys living there. Surgeon-Chick and her other housemate never went into the basement so she had no idea how disgusting it was. Chip (named because of the chip on his shoulder) one of the basement dwellers; the younger and rounder of the two, had thrown a glass bottle dangerously close to her housemate after the landlady left.\n\n\nThis made me and my husband furious, that is just dangerous and childish behaviour; a child with a grown man's strength. So we leave to go and help out, not before Hyeong could make a comment about the possibility of my husband using his wedding ring as a knuckle buster. I didn't need to tell him not to do that. \n\n\nWhen we arrive Surgeon-Chick is standing outside on the curb and the other housemate has locked himself in his room. She told us all she wanted was Chip to leave and let them clean, she was pretty scared after the bottle had been thrown. We assured her we would be fine, told her to stay outside for a bit and if anything violent happened to call the cops and her landlady. \n\n\nGoing inside the house seems pretty normal and quiet, the only thing wrong is a shattered beer bottle near the door to the basement. My husband knocks on the door and is greeted with a charming \"F#CK OFF!\" He takes that as an invitation to enter anyway and luckily the basement door didn't lock.\n\n\nWhat do you think the first thing we noticed was? The smell. It wasn't even just the typical gross smell of unclean clothes and rotting food (rancid enough on its own) but is was masked with thick incense, cheap air freshener and stale cigarette smoke. I reached almost immediately. Lucky and I know this will sound eccentric but being a med student it's a necessity. I happened to have peppermint oil in my coat pocket. I rubbed some under my nose and offered it to my husband, who was grateful. \n\n\nOur intrusion caused the 250lbs mass to stir from his stained couch and xbox to get up and again yell at us. \"I told you guys to F#CK OFF!\" \n\n\nCharming. \n\n\nMy husband looks seriously unimpressed and seriously intimidating (muscular Japanese guy in a nice suit.) Chip is continuing to look tough walking towards us when my husband tells him, \"Look, your landlady kindly gave you an hour to clean and show you can function in society like a grown up. So you can either stay and clean up like a man or run of to some arcade to bully high schoolers out of their pocket money, I don't care which you pick but you need to let us clean.\" \n\n\nHe grunts, 'f#ck you man.\"\n\n\nThen shoves past my husband, we were worried he was going to hit one of us for a second but he just walked up the stairs. I called out \"Should we take that as permission to clean up?\" He mumbled something under his breath, probably a schoolyard insult that was offencive 10 years ago. \n\n\nThen comes the worst part, cleaning up. Surgeon-Chick comes downstairs and tells us Chip muttered something to her about getting lunch at McDonald's. Clearly somewhere he went a lot given the not insignificant mountain of McDonald's bags, I opened one of the smaller ones and there was a huge clump of cockroaches squirming around in there. I threw the bag across the room and they poured out into the rest of the pile. Surgeon-Chick ran to the store to get about 10 cans of bug spray and about $50 of other cleaning supplies including gloves and masks which we doused in peppermint oil. \n\n\nThe fastest thing to clean was a small table off in the corner, the lamp on in suggested it was once a study desk but if was piled with nearly a foot of used paper plates and novelty mugs. I saw one of those mugs still had coffee in it, coffee so old an island of mold about an inch thick had grown and someone had put a cigarette out in it. I also saw a condom wrapper stuck to one plate  My husband had me hold a trash bag at the end of the table and he just held his arm out and pushed everything off the table into the trash bag, it was seriously like in those movies when a guy is mad at his boss. \n\n\nThe most bizarre thing was it looked like he had made misguided attempts at cleaning, the couch and xbox area of the room was relatively free of trash or dishes. It was like he thought if you shove mess in corners it eventually disappears. For the rest of the room I really don't want to go on, the sleeping area had used condoms stashed under the bed.\n\n\nThey were stuck to the carpet.\n\n\nNo more about that.\n\n\nWe cleaned for about three hours then left. Once home we took a shower with the same kind of subcutaneous scrubbing one would got through after a day of dissecting cadavers. ",

    "body": ">Background\n\n>William Hardaker, known to locals as \"Humbug Billy\", sold sweets from a stall in the Greenmarket in central Bradford (now the site of Bradford's Arndale Centre).[3][4] Hardaker purchased his supplies from Joseph Neal, who made the sweets (or \"lozenges\") on Stone Street a few hundred yards to the north. The lozenges in question were peppermint humbugs, made of peppermint oil incorporated into a base of sugar and gum.[2] However, sugar was expensive (6½d per 1 pound (0.45 kg)) and so Neal would substitute powdered gypsum (½d per 1 pound (0.45 kg)) — known as \"daff\" — for some of the required sugar.[5][4][6] The adulteration of foodstuffs with cheaper substances was common at the time and the adulterators used obscure nicknames (\"daff\", \"multum\", \"flash\", \"stuff\") to hide the practice.[7][8]\n\n>Accidental poisoning\n\n>On the occasion in question, Neal sent James Archer, a lodger who lived at his house, to collect daff for Hardaker's humbugs from druggist Charles Hodgson. Hodgson's pharmacy was 3 miles (4.8 km) away at Baildon Bridge in Shipley.[9] Hodgson was at his pharmacy, but did not serve Archer owing to illness and so his requests were seen to by his young assistant, William Goddard.[2][10] Goddard asked Hodgson where the daff was, and was told that it was in a cask in a corner of the attic.[8] However, rather than daff, Goddard sold Archer 12 pounds (5.4 kg) of arsenic trioxide.[6]\n\n>The mistake remained undetected even during manufacture of the sweets by James Appleton, an \"experienced sweetmaker\"[2] employed by Neal, though Appleton did observe that the finished product looked different from the usual humbugs. Appleton was suffering symptoms of illness during the sweet-making process and was ill for several days afterwards with vomiting and pain in his hands and arms, but did not realise it was caused by poison.[11] 40 pounds (18 kg) of lozenges were sold to Hardaker who also noticed the sweets looked unusual and used this to obtain a discount from Neal. Like Appleton, Hardaker, as one of the first to taste the sweets, also promptly became ill.\n\n\n>Arsenic trioxide is a white, crystalline powder that closely resembles sugar. It has no odour or taste.\nRegardless, Hardaker sold 5 pounds (2.3 kg) of the sweets from his market stall that night – reportedly at a price of 1½d for 2 ounces (57 g).[2] Of those who purchased and ate the sweets, 21 people died with a further 200 or so becoming severely ill with arsenic poisoning within a day or so.\n\n>Consequences\n\n>Originally the first deaths—those of two children—were thought to be owing to cholera, a major problem in Britain at the time. The growing number of casualties soon showed that the purchase of lozenges from Hardaker's stall was the cause, and from there the trail led to Neal and Hodgson.[12] Goddard was arrested and stood before magistrates in the court house in Bradford on 1 November with Hodgson and Neal later committed for trial with Goddard on a charge of manslaughter.[13] Dr John Bell identified arsenic as the cause, and this was confirmed by Felix Rimmington, a prominent chemist and druggist and analytical chemist.[2] Rimmington estimated that each humbug contained between 14 and 15 grains (910 and 970 milligrams) of arsenic, though a contemporary account suggests 9 grains (580 milligrams), with 4.5 grains (290 milligrams) being a lethal dose.[13] Thus, each lozenge would have contained enough arsenic to kill two people, and enough distributed by Hardaker in total to kill 2,000. The prosecution against Goddard and Neal was later withdrawn and Hodgson was acquitted when the case was considered at York Assizes on 21 December 1858.\n\n>The tragedy and resulting public outcry was a major contributing factor to The Pharmacy Act 1868 which recognized the chemist and druggist as the custodian and seller of named poisons (as medicine was then formally known). The requirement for record keeping and the requirement to obtain the signature of the purchaser is currently upheld under the Poisons Act 1972 for \"non-medicinal\" poisons. W. E. Gladstone's ministry of 1868–1874 also brought in legislation regulating the adulteration of foodstuffs as a result of the events.",

With serious ramifications in Scotland:\n\n· In the 19th century the people of Greenock had a fatal fascination for green, often observed in papers used to line grocers shops and in lurid green food colouring used for sweets and cake icing. Unfortunately the green colour was achieved using poisonous arsenic pigments. A cake decoration so coloured had the inscription \"for the bairnies\" - it contained seven times the fatal adult dose of arsenic. This experience pervaded the Scottish attitude to green confection well into the 20th century with the Professor of Forensic Medicine at Glasgow University in 1954 stating \"Fewer green sweets are sold in Scotland than in any other country\" going on to say \"It is astonishing why the idea of green colour in confections should suggest the stupid impression that arsenic is present\". https://www.abdn.ac.uk/mediareleases/release.php?id=104",

In short, we are under financial control/abuse, and I suffer from C-PTSD, and medically related PTSD. I'm also deaf AF, and need hearing aids now.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/fgje36/pennywise\\_hearing\\_aids\\_lying\\_and\\_rugsweeping/](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/fgje36/pennywise_hearing_aids_lying_and_rugsweeping/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/fem7h9/the\\_pennywise\\_saga\\_continues\\_how\\_being\\_deaf\\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/fem7h9/the_pennywise_saga_continues_how_being_deaf_and/)\n\n*THE GOOD (see:* ***GREAT***\\*):\\*\n\nSo we did dinner with Pennywise and TJYF (Temporarily Just Yes Father), and everything went swimmingly. It was... *surprising*. And as it turns out, they're leaving for a month to stay in Florida. So they'll be gone for a ***WHOLE*** month.  When my mother excused herself to the washroom, my father slipped me a birthday card, which I thought was another one for my husband for his birthday, but it wasn't. This one was for me.\n\nInside it contained a cheque written out to me for $500 with the memo saying, \"For Hearing the World Again\". He smiled, and told me to put it away immediately, which I did promptly, hiding it in my purse.\n\nWhen she came back, Pennywise asked if I was wearing the hearing aids, and I said yes, and that it neutralizes the dissonance of a crowded restaurant, and helps me focus on the people to my sides and in front of me; that I was able to hear all conversations. Everyone was delighted, even Pennywise said I was *'no longer talking shouting at people'*.\n\nI ordered a large salad but two drinks (one was a double, and one was a single). They were late by almost 30 minutes *(Pennywise had to stop at Costco)*, so I basically finished most of my first drink before they even got there. I ordered a California salad (strawberries, toasted pecans, goat's cheese, spring mix, etc). There were no complaints about how 'fatty' my meal was from Pennywise, nor did I even finish the salad (it was heavily drenched in raspberry vinaigrette, and I found it too oily).\n\nShe complimented me on not finishing my meal (*she loves and envies people with eating disorders, I swear*), and suggested that I complain (after finishing half of my salad), that I should ask for a new one. (She ***ALWAYS*** complains about her meal, and she told our waitress her meal was too spicy ((despite it saying it was spicy on the menu))). I said no. She made no comments on my hair being up, OR the fact that I was wearing my glasses. Success!\n\nShe was literally on her BEST behaviour. At least for MOST of the dinner. AND they'll be gone for a whole month. Literally, a whole damned month. Which means less phone calls, no need for face-to-face interaction, this next month is going to be peaceful, and I'm ***SO*** pumped about it.\n\nMy GoFundMe has taken off thanks to my friends, and community; and we've reached $1100. We still require $4300 or so (counting for the .30 cent per donation, and 2.7% they'll take). However, none of that has brought my mood down at all. I've cried many times since it first started, but it's all happy tears and disbelief. Hearing the world again is just so amazing, and new things I've learned since wearing them:\n\nMy cat purrs *REALLY* loudly, I just couldn't hear him before. I can also hear him countersurfing two rooms over, and can yell from across the apartment, and hear him scramble down to get the hell off the counter. LOL\n\nIt's *hilarious*.\n\nI can hear music differently. In songs I've always loved, I can hear the bass and the cello, I can hear the clarinet, I can hear soft background vocals, that I couldn't hear before. I can hear all the nuances of music. I can play piano quietly, and actually play by 'ear' again. It's ***amazing.***\n\nMy voice is higher than I thought it was. It's hilarious. I have a husky girly voice (very Jessica Rabbit/Kathleen Turner, or so I thought), but it's so much higher than I ever thought it was.\n\nI can hear my husband's stomach growl from ***ACROSS THE ROOM.*** That makes me laugh. He continues to whisper, *\"I love you\"* from across the room, and he does it multiple times a day, and late at night when he thinks I'm sleeping. Or when he's half asleep, he even mutters it in his sleep.\n\nWearing the hearing aids has improved my hearing WITHOUT the hearing aids, too, as Tara (my audiologist) said they would because my ear timpani is getting a work out and getting more flexibility. All of this amazing and fantastical!\n\n\\-------------------------------\n\nNow,\n\n*THE BAD (see:* ***AWKWARD AF***\\*)\\*\n\nHowever, it wouldn't be a JustNo story without some drama, so here we go. I refused to let Pennywise hold the hearing aids -- I didn't want her to mess with them, and she was insulted, scoffed, but both my SO and my TJYF steered the conversation away.\n\nShe shook her head in disbelief, rolled her eyes, and the conversation changed over to something else. If you've read my last few entries, there was a small discussion last year about the one thing I wanted for Christmas. Since she usually enjoys musical theatre, and it's the ONE thing we actually do together, I blurted out,\n\n\"ANASTASIA! I really want to see it! Honestly ANYTHING but Phantom, please. I've seen Phantom 11-12 times. I genuinely HATE it now.\"\n\n(She used to be a teacher and took her students to Phantom every year, so I've been going since I was 9, every year...)\n\nThis Christmas, she gave me a $50 Visa gift card, and two tickets to Phantom. I was severely disappointed, but grateful, as a present is a present. Then I learned that the second ticket isn't even meant for me and SO -- it's meant for her and I. She also got tickets for JYSIL, and JYSIL's eldest son. She constantly excludes my husband, as she dislikes him. She expressed she couldn't GET tickets to Anastasia. So I understood completely, and let it go, but I gave my ticket to my JYSIL's mother and avoided the whole thing while Pennywise blew up in an absolute tornado of fury that I didn't want to go. Despite knowing that I can't travel well at night (thanks PTSD), and we wouldn't get home until close to 1 in the morning. She ignored this all, and insisted I be the one to use the ticket. I refused.\n\nAt this point, she has two new programs for plays, one is *Hamilton* and the other is, get this -- *Anastasia.*\n\nPennywise: *\"Do you want the programs? I know you collect them!\"*\n\nMe: *\"Uh, no. I only collect the ones to shows I've seen.\"*\n\nPennywise: *\"Oh, well that's a shame. They were both great!\"*\n\nMe: *\"I thought you couldn't get tickets to Anastasia?\"*\n\nPennywise: *\"What? When did I say that?\"*\n\nMe: *\"It was supposed to be my Christmas present.\"*\n\nTJYF: *\"Oh. I went with your mom, if it's any consolation it wasn't that great.\"*\n\nMe: *\"Well, I know the entire script, and every single song. It's one of my favourite movies. It's about an orphan, who finds her family because of her grandmother. She speaks of a memory about how her grandmother wore peppermint oil as her perfume. And as Anastasia tries to put some on as a child, she spilt all of it, the peppermint oil, on this rug -- and the rug forever smelt of peppermint. And that's how they know she's the real deal. It's literally my favourite story.\"*\n\nPennywise: *\"Oh, well, if you'd told me, I would've taken you.\"*\n\nMe: *\"I did tell you. I said it many times. You said you couldn't get tickets.\"*\n\nPennywise: *\"Oh, well it came with our Mirvish yearly subscription.\"*\n\nMe: *\"Ohhhkay. Well, thanks for... offering the program, I guess?\"*\n\nSegueway into the next awkward AF moment:\n\nMy husband is Native, and I'm adopted, but I, too, am Native (half), and she knows that. Her MIL (God rest her soul) was also Native, and she hated her with thinly veiled hatred. When I wouldn't give her the hearing aids to inspect, which she couldn't even see in my ears with my hair up, this is the conversation that followed:\n\nPennywise: *\"I won't be an Indian Giver!\"*\n\nI don't even think she understands the term.\n\nMe: *\"MOM. You canNOT say that! My gosh!\"*\n\nPennywise: *\"What? Why not?\"*\n\nMe: *\"The term Indian giver is EXTREMELY RACIST.\"*\n\nPennywise: *\"What, how?\"*\n\nMe: *\"You KNOW it's racist as hell, mom. You canNOT say that. Please. Just don't say that.\"*\n\nPennywise: *\"How is Indian Giver racist?\" (-looking to my TJYF for support-)*\n\n**TJYF holds up his hands, and shakes his head quickly.**\n\nTJYF: *\"Pennywise, it's just racist. Okay?\"*\n\nKeep in mind that during this entire conversation, my husband said nothing, and just watched the exchange happen.\n\nThat was pretty much how our evening ended. We said our goodbyes, and now they're gone for a month. Phew! Thank the gods! I'm gonna say success, because she never got to touch the hearing aids, my glasses, and despite some serious racism, some dismissal of the 'supposed-to-be' Christmas present that she lied about -- everything went really well! And NOW -- A MONTH OF NO CONTACT!\n\nBOO YAH! Thank you for listening! (ba-dum-tsst!)",

    "body": "Edit: Added upper-GI symptoms\n\nIf you also ended up with a doctor telling you “Oh you just have IBS” and you want to go further (because IBS itself is NOT a disease but an exclusion diagnosis), I created this decision tree to help you find your root cause based on your symptoms. \n\n*Disclaimer: This is not medical advice. The goal is to give you a general framework to tailor down your differential diagnosis and come up with ideas to discuss with your doctor as many of these causes require testing and/or treatment. \nIf you haven’t seen a doctor and didn’t exclude other causes (IBD, acute infection, etc…), you need to see one first as you may be missing something important. \nIf you have seen a doctor and they haven’t been listening to you, find another doctor.*\n\nIt’s a simplified view but I hope it will help some of you!\n\n**If Lower GI symptoms are MAIN**\n\n**What is your main, most bothersome symptom?**\n(Choose the letter that best fits you, then follow the numbered steps.)\n\n**A. Diarrhea (loose/watery stools, urgency)**\n\n*1. Is your diarrhea most severe after eating (within 30–60 minutes)?*\n\n*1.1 Do you have urgency or accidents after meals, especially fatty foods, or history of gallbladder surgery?*\n\n\t•\tYES: Possible Bile Acid Malabsorption (BAM)\n\n\t•\tRecommended:\n\t•\tSeHCAT scan (if available) OR trial of cholestyramine/colesevelam (bile acid binder) for 1-2 weeks.

One of the first things that should always be done and things like celiac disease should be ruled out first since it’s so easy to test. Other things, like thyroid, hormones, deficiencies, should also be ruled out.\n\nAlso, the low FODMAP diet is longer than two to four weeks.\n\nIncomplete evacuation should also include a defecogram and any serious constipation should have full motility testing.\n\nI’d also add upper gi stuff to rule out gastritis, functional dyspepsia, gerd, and gastroparesis.",

    "body": "Hello everyone!\n\nToday I will present to you my favorite build in the game:\n\n[Quickness Heal Herald](https://preview.redd.it/r5qfgev5u5y91.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6040091e05b15a8098edf2af7e78053945202746)\n\nI've been playing Heal Herald for years, but when Herald got Quickness, I decided to make a guide for it, because now I'm even more convinced that it's a very good build that deserves much more attention!\n\n# About the structure of this post:\n\nThis post is basicly the english translation of my skript for my [detailed german video guide (klick here if you are too lazy to read or enjoy some funny bonus memes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8cJHeThVwI) on my YouTube channel. I wanted to share this with as many as possible, so i took my time and translated it. This also means, that a lot of text is ahead of you! I hope you enjoy the read! If this is too much for you, there is also a TL;DR! Also I put together some **cheatsheets** (for the german versions look at the the video description), which should serve as short summaries of the topics. Down in the equipment section there are also build-links for you to look at.\n\nAnd of course: Feel free to ask questions! If i can convince even one of you to try this build, i am more than happy! :)\n\n# TL;DR:\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- No Aegis  \n\\- No Reflect  \n\\- You can't take all Ulility at the same time  \n\\- Toughness in the most efficient build\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- You can tank every boss  \n\\- Very good Boon Uptime in the complete squad due to Boon Extension  \n\\- Permanent buffing - you can't miss a buffing phase  \n\\- Very good CC  \n\\- Rota very easy, so you can focus on mechanics  \n\\- Extreme healing on extremely high range  \n\\- Very strong utility options  \n\\- Very good personal DPS for a healer  \n\\- A lot of optimization potential\n\n# Traits\n\n[Quickness Heal Herald - Traits](https://preview.redd.it/1idkc55zv5y91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=363b0a351d354c1291a89cddd403e080b64d19ac)\n\nTwo of the three trait lines are pretty straight forward:\n\n**Herald**\n\nWe take Herald, of course, and play 1-1-2 there. Draconic Echo we have to take so we can give Quickness. Also, the trait ensures that Facets continue to pulse their effects for 6 seconds even after we consume them. This will be interesting again later. Elder's Respite I would always take as well, 20% better regeneration is just too strong on healers. In the middle column we take Shared Empowerment to have a better Might Uptime.\n\n**Salvation**\n\nThe second traitline is our healing traitline: **Salvation**. Here I recommend playing 1-1-1 by default, because that just gives us the maximum healing. \"Invocing Harmony\" increases our healing by 20% when we switch legends, and the other two traits ensure that virtually every one of our keys heals. \"Words of Censure\" heals allies when we use Blinds or CC and \"Generous Abundance\" heals when we use a Legend skill. We'll look at what this means for our healing output in a moment. In Salvation, I can only recommend one trait variation, and that is you can take Eluding Nullification in the first column if you need more Condi Cleanses.\n\n**Retribution, Invocation or Corruption**\n\nNow in the last traitline we can actually take what we want and adapt to the fight. You could take **Retribution** 3-2-2 to give yourself Resolution, be a bit tankier overall, and give the group 50% Damage Reduction if you fall below 50% life. This is especially handy in situations where you get a lot of damage at once, like the Greens on Vale Guardian or the Shake on Sloth. You could take **Invocation** 2-1-1 for some Burst Healing when switching to Ventari and for some more reliable Stability when playing with Dwarf. Those are all special cases, though. My default choice for the third traitline is actually **Corruption**, the Condi Damage traitline. I take Top Bottom Top here to boost my personal damage a bit, because the support we already have is already more than enough in most cases.\n\n# Boons\n\n**Regeneration, Fury, Might, Swiftness and Protection**\n\nWhere do the boons come from in this build? That's actually pretty straight forward in Herald: The five standard boons Regeneration, Fury, Might, Swiftness and Protection come from the 5 Facets. Each pulses a Boon in a 600 radius and can also sustain it completely. However, in the case of the Might Facet, this is not quite true. It can only hold about 12 stacks. However, we play with the trait \"Shared Empowerment\" which gives a stack of Might once per second when we give any Boon to allies. Because of the fact that we are throwing boons all over the place, this adds up to a lot. The missing Might we can generate via Fire Field Blast Finisher, which we have in our Rota anyway. Mace 2 is a Fire Field and Mace 3 is a Blast Finisher, but more on that later in the rotation part. The Might rampup from 15 to 25 stacks can take a few seconds, but these days as a healer you're almost never the only Might source anyway, which puts me at 25 stacks instantaneously in pretty much every fight. By the way, the Might of Blast Finishers lasts extremely long, which is why you never fall below 25 stacks of Might again once you've built it up. If there is downtime in a fight, try to keep the Might Facet active and blast a Fire Field once in a while to keep the Might stacks up, then you don't have to build them up again every phase.\n\n**Quickness**\n\nApart from the Standarad Boons, we also want to give Quickness and we do that with the Draconic Echo trait. Firstly, it ensures that each facet continues to pulse boons for 6 seconds after it has been consumed, but also that consuming a facet gives quickness. The basic duration of the quickness looks sobering little at first, but believe me, if you press the buttons in the right order, you will capp at the 30 seconds quickness limit faster than you think. Even with relatively little Boon Duration. But more about that in the rotation part.\n\n**Vigor and Resistance**\n\nNow I promised you that you can give Vigor and Resistance. We can do that thanks to the trait \"Serene Rejuvenation\" in the Salvation Traitline. With this trait, our Main Heal skill in Ventari gives Vigor and our Elite gives Resistance. Now the thing is that by constantly switching between Glint and Ventari you could keep Vigor up without losing the other boons, but by doing so I think you lose way too much flexibility because it makes the rotation very tight. It's not that important to keep Vigor up permanently under normal circumstances. Vigor increases endurance regeneration and you usually only need that in stressful situations anyway, for which you switch to Ventari to heal. The same goes for Resistance. So both boons I would only give depending on the situation, this eases your rotation immensely and makes sure you can react much better to mechanics.\n\n**Stability**\n\n**Stability** is another boon that is very situation dependent. In some fights you need it, in some you don't. Stabi can be given as a Herald by replacing Ventari with the Dwarf form. There you have the skill \"Inspiring Reinforcement\", or also called \"Stability Road\". You throw the road under your allies, where it then pulses Stabi once per second. And by the fact how the road is coded, you can actually give Stabi to your entire squad with it. Uou just have to drop the road in time for it to tick a few times before the Stabi is needed. For even more Stabi, you can reactivate F2 in dwarf form, but I personally have never needed that.\n\nWhat can be helpful, though, is to play with the Invocation Traitline, as mentioned earlier. This ensures that you immediately give  a stack of Stability every time you switch to the Dwarven Legend. This is much faster than the Stabi Road and use it in Fractal 99 for example, where you need a lot of Stabi and especially want to give Stabi reactively.\n\nAnd to those who I already hear complain that you have no more healing, if you play without Ventari: Stop! Ventari is there for burst healing, but you have more than enough healing for most situations, even without Ventari. Let me explain what I mean!\n\n# Healing\n\nYes, Ventari is a very good source of healing, but I still play a lot of fights without switching to Ventari once, simply because it's not necessary. But let's take a look at Ventari before I explain why Ventari actually often is overkill.\n\n**Ventari**\n\nVentari is the centaur legend and completely focused on support. Here we have Condi Cleanse, a dome and healing. However, it is important to know that Ventari skills do not have their area of effect around the player, but around the tablet. You summon the tablet automatically when you switch to Ventari, or if you destroyed it with the Elite skill, you can summon it again with the Heal skill. As long as the tablet is active, it will passively pulse healing near it. Reactivating your Heal skill is for repositioning the tablet. You also have a second Ticking Heal on Ventari when F2 is active. This second ticking heal is not so little and hits 10 players. Yes, you read  that right. **10 players**.\n\nHowever, the actual burst healing in Ventari comes from the **Natural Harmony** skill, which has virtually no cooldown, and the Generous Abundance trait, which triggers a second powerful heal every time a Ventari skill is pressed. As if that wasn't enough, ArenaNet has added a little mini-mechanic to Ventari that boosts the first skill after summoning the tablet - and of course, that includes when you freshly switch into Ventari. This enhancement means for our Burst Heal skill, it gets another 25% healing on top. All of these effects combined mean that in most cases, you'll get your party back to full life with the press of this one button. If not, you have plenty of other healing options, which I'll get to in a moment, or you can just press the button again. The skill, as I said, has almost no cooldown.\n\n**Healing outside Ventari**\n\nOk, if Ventari has so much healing, why did I say that I often play without Ventari: Quite simply, Herald's healing is not limited to Ventari, of course: On the contrary, most of the healing has actually been hidden somewhere else! And where?\n\nWell? Who can guess it? Right! Most of our healing comes from **Regeneration**.\n\nOkay, so this might be a little unsatisfying, but it makes sense when you think about it: regeneration is always ticking, every second, all fight long, whether you're near your teammates or not. But regeneration is still relatively boring, so what's our second-best healing source: \"Generous Abundance\", which is a trait. This trait, along with \"Words of Censure\" ensures that almost every one of our keys heals. In fact, the traits cause us to heal allies when we CC or blind enemies or simply press a Legend skill. And yes, a skill that is a legend skill and also blinds or CC heals twice!\n\nNow, this means that passively, while we press our rotation, we are always healing, and we're not talking 100 to 200 here, but up to **1000 healed health per trait**, so 2000 with a double activation. This either serves as a very good sustain heal, or if you press a lot of keys at once, it also gives you a good burst heal.\n\nUsually it's perfectly sufficient to camp on Mace and Axe, but in an emergency I sometimes switch to Staff, where you have strong burst heals with Staff 2 and 4 and another regular heal with the autoattacks. Basically, switching from mace to staff is a personal DPS loss, but of course better than when teammates die. Most of the time you have Ventari as a second legend anyway, so you won't have too little healing. In the rotation part later I will give you a prio-list, which legends or weapons you should switch to in which situation and when you can save it.\n\n# Utility\n\n[Quickness Heal Herald - Skills](https://preview.redd.it/tvsyfo57w5y91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=72bbfd1b3b6a18f686105f217602764f07b195d0)\n\n**Crowd Control**\n\nLet's talk about CC first of all: **Herald has a lot of CC**! However, I would like to highlight Staff 5 \"Surge of the Mists\". This is one of the strongest CC skills in the game, because it can hit the opponent up to 9 times. So to apply as much CC as possible, you want to hit the enemy with as many hits as possible. The bigger the hitbox is, the better, of course, but in certain situations there are a few tricks to get as many hits as possible even on small hitboxes. The easiest case would be, for example, if the opponent is standing in front of a wall or something similar, then you can simply stand against the wall with Staff 5, which keeps you in place, so that all hits are in one place, i.e. in the hitbox. If you know any similar tricks and want to share them with everyone, feel free to write them in the comments! There are quite a few!\n\nBy the way, in dragon form you also have a launch with \"Chaotic Release\", which is sometimes quite handy to push opponents a bit.\n\n**Boon Extension**\n\nWhile we're in dragon form, here's one of the special features of Herald: Boon Extension. Herald gives **20% Boon Duration** on top of the own Boon Duration to every squad member by the pulsating effect of the F2er \"Facet of Nature\" in the dragon form. And no, the 100% Boon Duration Cap has no influence on this. So in the end you extend every Boon in the Squad by 20%. In addition to that you can extend every existing boon in your own subgroup by 2 seconds by reactivating F2. So you make sure that even boons you can't give yourself have better uptime.\n\n**Ventari Bubble**\n\nIn Ventari, the main utility we have is the famous **Ventari Bubble**, which can be moved and used to block projectiles for an extremely long time. Ventari is also the legend with the most **Condi Cleanse**. We have direct Condi Cleanse skills with Purifying Essence, Staff 4, and the reactivation of F2, but we can also use the Light combo field from the bubble to cleanse even more Condis with Blast and Whirl finishers. Also, as mentioned earlier, you can switch to Eluding Nullification in the traits so that you can also cleanse with Dodges in addition.\n\n**Stability and Damage Reduction**\n\nThe Dwarf form is mainly used to give **Stability**, but with \"Facet of Nature\" it also brings 10% Damage Reduction for the entire squad. With the Dwarf Elite you can give another **50% Damage Reduction** for 5 seconds on top, which can protect the group from big Damage Spikes. \n\n**Boonstrip**\n\nIt's very rare that you don't have anyone on your team for **Boonstrips**, but if you do, you can pack Malyx as a second legend, on which you should have more than enough Boonstrip. On Malyx you also have a pull, but there are often better options in the squad.\n\n**Blocks and Invulnerability**\n\nWhat Herald can do well again, though, is survive enemy attacks. With the reactivation of the Dragon Heal skill you can make yourself immortal for 3 seconds and with the low cooldown blocks Staff 3 and Shield 5 you can escape any big attack, which leads me directly to the next point: You can tank every boss in the game with ease! I won't get into detail about tanking here, so if you have questions about that, leave them in the comments!\n\n# Rotation\n\n[Quickness Heal Herald - Rotation](https://preview.redd.it/hbzqrbvaw5y91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dc92789fda269cceaaf2f743ec5b384f233cddd)\n\n**Default Rotation**\n\n**Herald is relatively simple to play**, but there are still a few things to keep in mind of course. The standard is to always start with Mace Axe and the dragon form, because this is where we get our boons from. The **F2 should always be active if possible** and that is the most important thing you should pay attention to. This guarantees us, if you remember, that all boons we give will be extended by 20%. After that, I always double click all 3 utility skills right at the start of the fight followed by Mace 2 and 3, resulting in a Fire Field Blast finisher. This way all the important boons are there from the start. Then you want to double click the Heal and Elite skill as soon as possible to extend the quickness a bit more and give regeneration and protection. Both of these are skills that you might want to save for their utility later, but at the beginning of a fight you very rarely need them. Now to keep our boons, we just push all the dragon skills we don't need to save for utility, and the Mace 2 3 combo on Cooldown. Mace 5 can also be pressed on Cooldown to increase DPS, however that is also a CC skill, so best to save that one if you know CC will be needed soon. In the end, this is the standard rotation, if you like to call it that. In many fights I don't do more, because legend and weapon changes we only need for extra healing or utility.\n\n**Opener**\n\nHowever, since boon duration can be relatively tight depending on the equipment, I would add F2 to the opener. That way you can build up Quickness much better and you can spend more time outside of the Dragon Legend later on without Quickness running out. The whole thing then looks like this: F2 is active while I press my first boon rotation. Then, when my three utility skills have about 6 seconds of remaining cooldown, I reactivate F2 for another 4 seconds of extra Quickness. Only 6 seconds before, because the 20% Boon Extension effect remains for 6 seconds after reactivation thanks to the \"Draconic Echo\" trait, and we can then push through our 3 utility skills again during this period.\n\nThis \"opener\" can also be used a second time depending on the boss. Either way, you will have built up enough quickness to be able to switch to other legendaries later on. Basically, I would recommend that you try to get into the habit of planning ahead a bit. Because we press all dragon skills more or less at the same time, there are often periods where you have all skills on cooldown for 10 seconds anyway, so in those periods you can switch to another legend without losing anything. Of course, you can also reactively switch to the other legend to react to a mechanic, in which case it can help to quickly reactivate F2 beforehand so that the quickness doesn't eventually run out. It always depends on how long the fight has been going on and how much quickness you have already built up.\n\n**Stability Rotation**\n\nTo give Stability, you change to the dwarf form and throw the Road. The Cooldown fits perfectly, so that you can put it once directly when you swap in and once directly before you swap out of dwarf. So if you switch on Cooldown between Dragon and Dwarf, you can, if you want to, even theoretically maintain permanent Stabi. However, there is hardly a situation where this is necessary, so I wouldn't bother. There are some fights where you need Stabi pretty early, so I would recommend starting on Dwarf, casting the Road at the start of the fight, and then continuing with the Dragon opener as usual.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n\nIn Ventari and Malyx, there's not much to say about rotation, because you really only switch in there when you need the utility or heal. In Malyx you can activate the elite for personal DPS increase, but only if you have too much energy. Otherwise, just switch back to Dragon form as soon as possible.\n\nNow at the end of this section I promised you a prio list to clarify when I prefer to switch to Ventari and when I prefer to switch to Staff when I need more healing. Both give me exactly that.\n\nBasically, switching down from Mace Axe is always a big DPS loss, and yes, this is a support build, but even as a supporter you naturally want to get the maximum out of it. At the same time, of course, we have to make sure that no boons run out. So now when the group gets a lot of damage I look at how my boons are doing. Will the quickness run out if I can't give a new quickness for 9 seconds? If yes, I switch to staff and can stay in dragon form. Most of the time though, the answer is no tho, so I stay on Mace Axe and switch the legend to Ventari. Of course I want to go back to the dragon form as soon as possible. If there's a lot of damage again, but I'm just coming out of Ventari and am busy buffing, I switch to Staff and heal with it. Staff is more of a backup heal for me, in case Ventari isn't available for some reason. It's very rare that you need the heal from Staff and Ventari at the same time. I only really camp on Stab in high pressure fights like Vale Guardian or Boneskinner, otherwise it's pretty unnecessary most of the time, but you can do it however you want of course. Just don't forget that you have to rely on Mace's Might Blast finishers to hold power alone. But let's face it, when do you need to hold 25 stacks of might alone these days. \n\nI hope my explanation was halfway understandable and didn't confuse you more. Basically, this build has a lot of freedom to react to certain situations, as you will see in the equipment. I hope you find a way of playing that you like through this guide!\n\n# Equipment\n\n[Quickness Heal Herald - Equipment](https://preview.redd.it/emwpwlqew5y91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0104d963c1581a6e5cafce04637668c62a2b1c68)\n\nSo, you've made it this far, now we come to probably the most important part of the post. And it gets wild! Most of you are probably thinking: Why? Just play full Harrier or Minstrel and that's it. And yes, this works of course, and if you can't get new equipment, then go ahead and do it, but it's definitely not optimal, because first of all we don't need that much Boon Duration and can invest the stats accordingly differently, and secondly Power Damage doesn't give us that much, since Mace and Axe are Condi weapons.\n\n**Apothecary Build - Full Heal**  \n[*http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PmwAkeZlpQJMLiidRTMMqiJShsCagjuTVrE-zxIYxojvMqODSvE8dWafzC-e*](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PmwAkeZlpQJMLiidRTMMqiJShsCagjuTVrE-zxIYxojvMqODSvE8dWafzC-e)\n\nI therefore play with the statline \"Apothecary\", which gives as much Healing Power as Magi Equipment and additionally Condition Damage and Toughness. All stats that we can use well. In the armor I take the Monk Rune and in the weapons Sigil of Concentration and Transference. By default I play with Mace and Axe, but you can also replace the Axe with a Shield for an extra Healing skill and an extra Block. Both are probably nice to get into tanking and healing, but I never play with them now because you don't really need either.\n\nWith Food we then get to 45% Boon Duration and that should be the goal, because with it we can comfortably keep Quickness. As food I would recommend the standard healer food, fruit salad with mint, or as a budget variant the rice balls. As enhancement the \"Bountiful Maintanance Oil\" is best, because it boosts our healing again, but if that's too expensive for you, you can also just throw in \"Peppermint Oil\". This gives you about 10% extra Boon Duration, so it gives you a little more freedom and the healing is still very good - you still have almost 1800 Healing Power.\n\nBut the really cool thing is that with this equipment you can easily keep up with a Heal Mech in terms of DPS, even though you have more healing than any other Supporter.\n\nAnd now I have a tidbit for all of you who like to get the maximum out of it: Experience shows that with 1800 Healing Power, you actually have way too much healing in most situations, and you can tweak a bit more towards Damage accordingly. So you can replace as many Apothecary Equipment parts as you like with Celestial parts, you will lose some Healing and Toughness but gain Boon Duration and Expertise.\n\nYou are basically very free to do what you want with your equipment as long as you keep at least about 45% Boon Duration, so feel free to experiment around, but I'll show you what I came up with:\n\nI tried to get to about 85% Torment Dutation with both builds I'm going to show you now, since almost all of our damage comes from Torment. The missing 15% you get in the fight from the trait \"Pact of Pain\".\n\n**Apothecary / Celestial Mix Build - Good mix of heal and personal DPS**  \n[*http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PmwAkeZlpQJMLiidRTMMqiJShsCagjuTVrE-zxQYxoDNWDHXZ0VJUdG470IjNLA-e*](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PmwAkeZlpQJMLiidRTMMqiJShsCagjuTVrE-zxQYxoDNWDHXZ0VJUdG470IjNLA-e)\n\nThe first variant is a mix of \"Apothecary\" and \"Celestial\" and uses the Tormenting rune. Weapons and food remain exactly the same as in the full-heal variant. You have about 1200 healing power, which is about as much as you have with most other healers, but you do really good damage.\n\n**Celestial Build - Max personal DPS**  \n[*http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PmwAkeZlpQJMLiidRTMMqiJShsCagjuTVrE-zxIY1ojvQytAqOC6IFEeWafzC-e*](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PmwAkeZlpQJMLiidRTMMqiJShsCagjuTVrE-zxIY1ojvQytAqOC6IFEeWafzC-e)\n\nI took it to the extreme and created a full Celestial build that has the Nightmare Rune and Torment and Bursting Seals. On the staff I still play with Apothecary and Transference, because you only switch to the staff when you want to heal anyway. I always throw in healer food like in the other builds, even if you don't look like a healer in the DPS graph anymore.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n\nThere are, of course, an infinite number of other gear and food combinations that you can play. Feel free to try out for yourself what you like best and let me know! But don't forget that this is still a healer build and buffing and keeping the team alive is of course the primary task. So I would recommend you to start with the full heal version and then, as you feel like it, work your way up to a more optimized version. Of course, how much or little healing you need is always very dependent on the group you're traveling with. The less mistakes your people make, the less you need to heal them.\n\nBy the way, as I said at the beginning, all of the builds presented here have toughness, which means that you either need to tank or your tank needs a lot of toughness. If you want to build a variant without toughness, I can recommend the statline \"Magi\". It gives as much healing power as \"Apothecary\", but you also lose your Condi Damage. However, the statlines \"Marshal's\", \"Seraph\", \"Shaman's\" or \"Pleaguedoctor's\" would also be playable.",

I'm normally of the opinion that outside of exceptional circumstances (fights with extremely tight DPS checks or extremely low healing pressure), healers greeding for DPS is a mistake. It only takes one player going down during a fight due to your greed to set you back more DPS than most greedy healer builds add over the course of an entire fight.\n\nI'm also wary of low-duration boon builds. What's 'comfortable' uptime to you probably isn't for new players with unpolished rotations, or new groups where people are more likely to be running around losing coverage.\n\nThat all is to say, I think HH is a good and underrated class, but I think the default build for most players should be a more support-focused variant using Minstrel where toughness is allowed and Harrier (maybe with a splash of Magi) when it's not. The Apothecary/Celestial variants are probably better suited for more experienced players and groups looking to push their kill times. I'll definitely have to actually give some of these a whirl myself.",

    "body": "Hi everyone. This is my first FPS. There's a lot of dialogue in the beginning, so I decided not to use green text this time. Before we begin, here are the main characters of the story;\n\n**Me**- 24/F, 5' 6\", 145 lbs, licensed massage therapist working at an upscale salon and day spa in a snooty Chicago suburb\n\n**Desk Girl**- Runs the front desk at the salon\n\n**Em**- Esthetician, petite, early thirties, very sweet\n\n**Elle**- Esthetician, upper twenties, thin perky blonde\n\n**Gas Planet**- a potent one-time client of mine, the largest person I have ever seen and the reason for this particular FPS\n\n\nAbout a month ago, I went to work my two o'clock shift. It had been relatively slow all week so I wasn't anticipating much. When I arrived, Desk Girl immediately pulled me aside and pointed to the one client listed on my schedule for that day.\n\n\"Junejulyblue, have you ever worked with this client before?\"\n\nHis name didn't look familiar. Em, who had come to the desk to check out a client of hers, was nearby.\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"I haven't.\"\n\n\"Okay, ummm.....\" Desk Girl looked nervous, almost afraid, and said in a hushed voice \"I should warn you, he's very big.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay.\"\n\nThis typically isn't such a big deal. I get clients who are overweight sometimes and, honestly, it can be more challenging than working on someone smaller only because there's more you have to work through. That's just the way it is. They're just like any other client though, and they always leave feeling better than when they came in. Apparently this particular client was different.\n\n\"No,\" Desk Girl said, \"this guy is big. Like, HUGE. I'd guess he's close to three hundred pounds.\"\n\nEm, who had heard our conversation, interjected. \"NO!\" She exclaimed. \"He's definitely bigger than that. He's closer to four fifty, probably five hundred.\"\n\nI was skeptical, I wasn't even sure I had ever seen a person who weighed five hundred pounds. However, [the reactions of Desk Girl and Em were worrying me](http://imgur.com/DNAIW3e).\n\n\"That's not all though,\" Desk Girl said. \"He smells. And I mean HE SMELLS.\" \n\n\"He's getting a facial with Elle right now,\" Em said. \"She had to light all kinds of candles in her room. OH MY GOD WAIT, your massage table is wooden, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yeah, it is.\" Most wooden massage tables have a relatively high weight limit. However, my first massage table was broken by a particularly large client, but that's another (less satisfying) story. \n\n\"You CAN'T use your table for this guy,\" Em said, \"you can use my room and my table.\" Em's table is steel because it's mechanical, it has little foot pedals underneath it so it can move up and down. Mine has a crank. It might as well be steam powered.\n\nNow, I just had two grown ass women frantically warm me about a five hundred pound Gas Planet that unquestionably would require a steel table to hold his girth, and still, my naive little mind believed that they were exaggerating/overreacting/just trying to freak me out. \n\nThen we walked down the hallway, past Elle's room. Elle, who at that moment, was giving a facial to Gas Planet in her small, unventilated room. The aroma just outside of her room was....unpleasant [(mfw)](http://imgur.com/zqKaPFl). I couldn't understand it, I can't quite describe it (yes I can; a turd that magically came to life, died, and festered in the sun for a week), but I will not ever forget it.\n\nWEHATESIT.gif\n\nEm and I immediately got to work prepping her room for Gas Planet. Not to make him comfortable, but to mask the aroma that was sure to linger if we didn't take any precautionary measures. We filled the sink with hot water and peppermint oil, lit her candles, and she told me to add peppermint oil or some other kind of essential oil to my massage cream. I don't work with essential oils but I heeded her word. She then hugged me firmly, wished me luck, and took off for her lunch break. \n\nAs I set the table for the massage, Elle, who had just finished the facial with Gas Planet, found me in Em's room. Elle is a pretty blonde girl who is always smiling, and is never anything but happy and pleasant. Today, however, all of usual her joy was completely gone. \n\n\"Junejulyblue...oh my God, I am so, so sorry you have to do this.\" I actually thought she was going to cry.\n\nStill optimistic, still naive as shit, despite the foul odor that assaulted my senses only a short while ago.\n\n\"What happened?\" I asked. Elle explained that, although he was a nice enough guy, his B.O. was absolutely overwhelming, like nothing she'd ever experienced before. However, all Elle had to do was work with his face. I'd be working on his back, arms, legs...feet......I'd have to get all into his rolls and shit-\n\nNo, I thought, stay positive.\n\n\"He's in the waiting area,\" Elle told me, \"He had to use the bathroom. He's ready whenever you are. I'm sorry but, I really don't know how you're going to manage this.\" And then she disappeared. I didn't see her again for the rest of the day. I don't know where she went, but I'm sure she just needed to find a quiet, secluded place to [curl up and cry for a while](http://imgur.com/jAobAL4).\n\nShake it off, shake it off.\n\nI went back to the waiting area (which is also the front desk area) and was, once again, beaten mercilessly by the smell. Gas Planet had just laid waste to the restroom. I can't imagine it would have been any worse if I had been physically walking through the mans colon. I then noticed the masses of clients who had been patiently waiting for their haircuts and pedicures scattered on the floor, having gagged to death from the noxious gas permeating from the restroom, some still clutching copies of People and Glamour.\n\nI smelled him before I saw him, mind you, and when I saw him....\n\n[m-fucking-fw](http://imgur.com/zFNqt94)\n\nNothing my friends had said was an exaggeration. Everything was completely and one hundred percent true. This man was every greasy bit of five hundred pounds, about five foot five, sweating profusely, and toting a bottle of diet coke (which was when the little voice in my head said, my God, I've entered an FPS). \n\n\"But dammit I am a professional,\" I told myself. \"I got into this career to help people, to relieve pain, to reduce stress, to utilize my FUCKING HELL I THINK HE FARTED AGAIN.\"\n\nI plastered on my best smile, stifled my gag reflex and, despite my watering eyes, and walked over to Gas Planet. I shook his moist, hot dog-ish hand and introduced myself, then lead him down the hallway to Em's room. I slowed my pace well below my usual stroll, as making his way down the short hallway was taking an excruciating amount of effort from him. \n\nGas Planet put his Diet Coke on Em's side table. Her neat, clean table with the stack of fluffy white towels and the pristine little jars of q-tips and cotton balls. For some reason, him putting his sticky bottle of Diet Coke on Em's table made me momentarily furious. He wore a tattered red t-shirt with cotton shorts that once must have been brown. They now had stains of various colors in various places, and had faded to a sickly grey/brown. He breathed heavily as he sat down on Em's table. The table, which is made of steel, mind you, groaned. \n\nI wanted to get this over with, as the smell was already overtaking the little room, so I began my usual intake questions and gathered the following information from Gas Planet;\n\n1.) He has diabetes (what no way). \n\n2.) The man never stops farting. And I'm sorry if this all just seems like one long fart joke but the man was always within like a two minute window of extreme flatulence.\n\n3.) He had received lymphatic drainage a year ago, six sessions in two weeks, to help with the build up of lymphatic fluid in his legs.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, [lymphatic drainage](http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-lymphatic-drainage.htm) is a kind of massage therapy wherein the lymphatic fluid, which has built up in the limbs of the client and caused the skin to become puffy and tight, is manually moved back into the lymph nodes of the body, located in areas such as the groin and armpits. I've worked with plenty of people who needed lymphatic drainage, and it's really very easy to do. Boring as hell, in my opinion, but easy.\n\nIn all honesty, part of me was glad that I wasn't going to have to give this guy a regular Swedish massage (the kind you're probably most familiar with, lots of kneading of the muscles and gliding over the skin and using your elbows to dig in and break up tension), but I was still not looking forward this. I've had larger clients in the past who've asked for lymphatic drainage to help with \"the buildup\" when in reality, their arms and legs are just fat. [Here is lymphadema](http://www.mayoclinic.com/images/image_popup/r7_lymphedema.jpg). It looks similar to fat, but it is not fat. Some jerks are just fat.\n\nBut you can't just say that shit to people so you pretty much just have to soldier on. I told Gas Planet to disrobe and get on the table under the sheets, and I left the room. At the desk area, the front doors were now wide open in an attempt to air out the aroma that Gas Planet left in his wake. Some of the clients who had passed out were now coming to, confused and scared. Several of the stylists hanging around the front desk stopped me to admire my bravery/ tell me I was insane/ beg me not to do it (I'm not exaggerating, a few of them had actually tried to think of ways for me to get out of it). \n\nDon'tCryForMeArgentina.avi\n\nAfter washing my hands, I braced myself, and entered the room. Gas Planet was lying face down, as I had instructed, but his stomach was so large that he could not put his head in the face cradle (the horseshoe shaped thing that your face goes in when you get a massage). I gave him a pillow to put under his head and got started. \n\nThe actual massage itself was terribly boring, as lymphatic drainage usually is. As I said, all I was trying to do was help his lymphatic fluid move back into his lymph nodes, if there even was any lymph fluid built up that needed mobilization, so I won't bore you with how the massage was done. \n\nAs I worked on the backs of his legs, he kept moving around and readjusting himself on the table. He could not sit still and get comfortable (one of my pet peeves is someone who can't lay still on the table while I'm trying to work on them). Unfortunately for me, every movement he made released another wave of B.O. from beneath a rippling roll. He hadn't gotten under the sheets and instead just kept his filthy shorts on, which I kind of had to....move out of the way so that I could work on his thighs. \n\nWhen it was finally time to turn over (half way done thank you baby Jesus), he had a hell of a time getting there. He actually stopped halfway to take a breather. He had to take a break just to turn over onto his back! Once he got there, he asked me to raise the head of the table so that he'd be in a sitting position. Usually only pregnant women need the table raised.\n\nI got to work on the front of his legs. By this point the smell was making me headachey and borderline nauseous, and I was getting more and more desperate for the whole ordeal to just be over. Every time I had to move his leg or arm I caught another strong horrible whiff of swamp ass and B.O. Despite lymphatic drainage being light work, I was getting worn out very, very quickly.\n\nAnd here, dear children, is what got to me the most; from the very moment I met Gas Planet, he had been breathing- no suffocating- NO, sucking air through his gaping face hole as though he suffered from asthma and had forgotten to bring his inhaler along to a triathalon. The man never stopped panting. \n\nAnd sweating. He was, somehow, constantly sweating. Beads constantly forming on his forehead, tiny rivers always running down his blubbery neck, a light sheen constantly covering every part of him (that I could see, anyway) [(buhhh)](http://imgur.com/CpjUEEX). \n\nI was supposed to work on his neck....I couldn't find his neck. I turned his head to one side and sort of pushed down on what I thought was just shoulder fat getting in the way, and still there was no neck. I leaned his head forward to see if I could get to the back of his non-neck, and was just met with back fat invading neck space. But, I am a professional, and I instead spent the last minutes of the massage working on his face. \n\nI end every session by saying \"Thank you, [client's name],\" I thanked Gas Planet and GTFO'd as discreetly as I could, tears rolling down my face as I sucked in the fresh, clean air. \n\nThe stylists and desk staff were waiting for me to emerge at the desk area. Some stared in awe, having not expected me to survive. Some fell to their knees and kissed my feet.\n\nOhCaptainMyCaptain.jpg\n\nGas Planet had left, but his presence still lingered. It lingered in the sheets on the table, it lingered in the bathroom he (again) violently assaulted before leaving, taking out the small group of clients waiting in the manicure area, it lingered in the Diet Coke bottle he left on Em's table. I painstakingly cleaned up Em's room after Gas Planet left,  leaving the door wide open and large fan blowing in the direction of the door. I was so grateful to her for letting me use her room, I'd feel awful if any of the aftermath hung around for her to have to take care of.\n\nI spent the rest of my shift in my room, gently weeping. \n\n**TLDR;**\nA particularly flatulent Hamplanet comes to the Salon and Day Spa where I work as a massage therapist. He gets a facial from a Esthetician who may or may not now have PTSD from the incident, and then got a massage from me. The night terrors still haven't stopped.\n\n**EDIT 1** I know the gifs I tried to include are messed up, I'm working on it. Please be nice to me.\n\n**EDIT 2** NAILED IT. Kay enjoy!",

They even replicated the results with people on a survivor like reality show. While plaque on their teeth went up, the bacteria that causes cavities and gingivitis disappeared. Their gum health also improved.\n\n(They also ate sugary foods like berries and honey. [Honey](https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2001/02/28/Honey-fights-tooth-decay), despite having a ton of sugar, has been shown to have antibacterial properties and is probably fine for your teeth.)\n\n[The Hidden Epidemic - Interview with Dr. Thomas Levy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7s8susk4a4) (LONG video but WORTH the watch)\n\nThis video shows that all the abscesses from rotten teeth and gum disease are the cause behind most oxidative stress in your body, heart attacks, and even cancers.\n\nAlmost all heart attacks (the number ONE killer in America) had plaque and bacteria in it that causes cavities.\n\nThe pressure from the jaw while eating pushes all that bacteria in your lymph nodes and blood stream.\n\n\n# What About Acidic Foods?\n\nWhile, yes, people who eat a lot of acidic and sweet foods (like vegans) tend to get more cavities, it isn't the *main* contributor.\n\nHere is the thing: your body is built to handle acidic foods but not PURE SUGAR.\n\nYes, acidic foods will wear down the enamel of your teeth but those foods are only on your teeth for a little while—and your teeth are supposed to remineralize and heal any damage done overnight while you sleep.\n\n(Personally, I have a ton of cavities between my teeth because I hate orange and apples all the time and the pulp would get stuck between my teeth all day. Would I never get cavities there if I didn't eat processed sugar back then? I don't know. But I don't think it'll hurt to floss after you eat certain acidic foods like oranges and apple. If you can't floss, keep toothpicks handy. Even a rinse with water wouldn't hurt.)\n\nAlso, [wait about at least an hour after eating acidic foods before brushing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8BKmlTLwUo). They're in a weakened state, and you'll scrub off more enamel material.\n\n# Fix Your Teeth - Videos To Watch\n\nSo you want to start preventing cavities but not sure if you can COMPLETELY remove all that sugar?\n\nHere are some other good videos worth watching. I'll give TL;DRs for you as well:\n\n[NO CAVITIES after YEARS without dentist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trvMgLQEnYw)\n\nA paleo woman (so almost no processed sugar in her diet) goes to the dentist after 3 years to find no cavities (claims to also not have a cavity for 9 years). How did she do it? 3 things:\n\n* **Natural toothpaste** (Dr. Bronner's Peppermint All-One Toothpaste) without fluoride (as she claims it kills the good bacteria in your mouth)\n* **Cod Liver oil high in vitamin D** (Green Pasture's Fermented Cod Liver Oil and Concentrated Butter Oil) - claims what has kept her from getting a cavity in 9 years\n* **Fermented food like sauerkraut** (fermented versions with good bacteria will always be in the refrigerated section of the grocery store). Instructs you to make sure it doesn't contain vinegar.\n\n[Natural Cure For Gum Disease Amazing Results!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eJX4Ga6kZ0)\n\nWoman shows that putting **fermented vegetable juice** (like the juice from sauerkraut) in her gums healed her gum disease.\n\n[Heal Gums Naturally with Probiotics (Part 1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9T4lmWins)([Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrN8PB-aZJI))\n\nElderly lady uses standard gut probiotics to heal her gums and teeth—**she put gut probiotics directly on her gums**. She open the capsules and packed them directly between the teeth and gums with her tongue. Said she **did it for 4 days** and stopped after her body told her to.\n\nI wish she would give the brand, but this is all I could find in the comments when one person asked:\n\n>You want ones with a variety of cultures in them with both \"bifido...\" strains and \"Lacto...\" strains. No particular brand.\n\nFirst video also said her brand had about **10 billion per capsule with mostly various Lactobacillus strains**.\n\n[What’s the Best Mouthwash?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyghcN9Sws)\n\nAbove video shows that **green tea plus amla powder** is way more effective and safer than the most popular commercial mouthwashes.\n\n[Waterpik Flosser + Real Salt = Oral Health Game Changer!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWawWdsJUu8)\n\n**Water flossing with salt water**\n\n[3 Home Tips to Keep Your Mouth Healthy ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUq42lkvxRo)\n\n**Water flossing with hydrogen peroxide**\n\n[Is CAPB in SLS-Free Toothpaste Any Better?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAlYq4hDglA&t=274s)\n\n**Avoid all detergent toothpastes**, especially sodium lauryl sulfate.\n\n[The Best Toothpaste!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_GpHjng7OE)\n\n**The best toothpaste is no toothpaste?**\n\n[Xylitol Pulling Instead of “Oil Pulling” For Even Better Results!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t58ucaPcGE)\n\n**Xylitol mouthwash**\n\n[Make Your Own Mouthwash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDT2Y8N7Z9w)\n\n**DIY mouthwash** (water, baking soda, and mint essential oil)\n\n[What Happened After 4 Years Using DIY Toothpaste](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh4NXZFgtIg)\n\n**DIY toothpaste** (calcium carbonate powder, coconut oil, baking soda, trace mineral powder, and peppermint essential oil)\n\nShe claims the popular one you see online (just coconut oil, baking soda, and peppermint oil) actually *de*mineralized her teeth, but she *re*mineralized her teeth with her new formula.\n\n[Killing Bacteria Naturally with Salt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQuOVRJkhlo)\n\nMicroscope vision of bacteria dying from salt water\n\n[Fluoride in Water - The Good, The Bad & The Ugly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RHVGIyhmEE)\n\nNot giving a TL;DR for this one as fluoride for your teeth is a complex issue.\n\n[Fluoride in Our Water | 2 Alarming New Studies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nizvddHUd0)\n\n**A few studies that will make you think twice about fluoride.**\n\n[Raederle's Teeth Remineralizing Masterclass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF06YqKL_qw)\n\nHolistic approach to remineralizing your teeth. I usually make fun of hippy girls like this but everything she says agrees with the above. I guess she's just way smarter than me :)\n\n**Supplement or get naturally** (she covers how): K2, calcium (phosphorus), silica, magnesium, retinol, vitamin D2 or D3, DHA & EPA, vitamin C, iodine, selenium, and zinc.\n\n**Avoid**: triclosan, alcohol, sodium lauryl sulfate, fluoride, and excess amounts of glycerin (they're in almost all toothpastes, even the \"natural\" ones). Personally, I would add [carrageenan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8zoPKID_eM) to that list. (Updat: she mentions to avoid that later in the video series. See, she knows what she's talking about!)\n\n**Add to your dental routine**: 20 minutes of oil pulling each day; water flossing after your brush; rinse with sea salt after oil pulling, flossing, or brush; and  mouthwash (herbal for gum infections or with fermented foods like coconut kefir of sauerkraut).\n\nThe only thing I'm not sure about is oil pulling based off the video on about [oil pulling risks (lipoid pneumonia)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zf5PKnKIJc), how [oil pulling undermines the protective teeth layer against acid (at least temporarily)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=betOW0qVGLM&t=283s), but [oil pulling is as effective as commercial mouthwashes (however, so might swishing with water for 20 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72lfQUJo10k&t=260s) from Dr. Greger.\n\nSo if you're going to oil pull, do it before bed or wait a few hours before eating anything acidic. Also, don't swallow the oil, clear the back of your throat and tongue of any oil, and then brush your tooth using a different toothbrush rather than your regular one. And if you think you have any kind of leak into your nasal cavity, you shouldn't oil pull. See above for some great alternatives.\n\nFinally, go to your dentist! At the very least, they can see things in your mouth you can't. Yes, the [x-rays are bad for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYGkvMwqyys) (don't do them all the times and [get your antioxidant levels way up that day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAlUwBOk1kg&t=236s)), but you need to get checked from time to time. Better to tackle a cavity while it's small and where you can remineralize it, before it becomes a big problem where they want to do a root canal on you.\n\n# Conclusion\n\n**Keep in mind, if you didn't grow up eating sugary sweets, you wouldn't crave them, they would be too sweet.**\n\n[Your taste buds adapt.](https://paleoleap.com/taste-buds-sugar/)\n\nBut all that the sugar industry cares about is selling more product.\n\n**Edit**: Added a *proven* DIY toothpaste (the lady claims the popular one you see online *de*mineralized her teeth, but she saved them with her formula), link to show that your taste buds will adapt, added the remineralizing master class by Raederle, Dr. Greger talking a ton about oil pulling, and a video on how another older woman healed her gums with off-the-shelf probiotics. Cleaned up the post with headers. Added more info on dentists and x-rays, and on acidic foods and brushing.\n\n**Bonus**: Watch [Root Cause (2018)](https://tubitv.com/movies/507721).

I use Redman Earthpaste because it only contains five ingredients: purified water, bentonite clay, non-GMO xylitol, essential oils, and sea salt.

I crossposted here a few months back after [an anxiety inducing weekend visiting my bf](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/7ilkj8/my_fmil_thinks_im_high_maintenance_and_spoiled_i/). \n\nEDIT: Putting this at the top so it's seen. A lot of people are saying talk to him about how I'm feeling, which I agree with and I'm going to do when he's here this weekend. My question is, is it my place to suggest NC or VLC? Should that even come up? Right now I want to focus on the fact that we're a team, we have to have one another's backs no matter what. It's incredibly dumb that at this point our fights are mostly from stress she's causing him (usually revolving around his grandpa's dementia). \n\nWe're long distance and visit one another once a month, switching off each month. So, I went there in February for bf's birthday, but we had an Airbnb (that I booked *before* the mouse issue). His mom took off so she could spend time with us, which I thought was nice. The house was crazy clean, like ***crazy*** clean, there was no bad smells, trash was IN the trash can. I felt so good about the place we decided to get food to go and eat at her house. I was a bit on edge, but didn't see any signs of critters, so I was okay. \n\nAbout two weeks after I leave, I'm on the phone with my bf and I hear her scream, my bf runs out of his room, tries to see what's wrong and she says she saw a mouse. My bf thought he muted himself, but he didn't, so I heard her. I played dumb and acted like I didn't. I asked him what was wrong and he tried to shrug it off. \"oh, nothing,\" he said. I suggested it was probably time to set traps, put more peppermint oil around the doors/windows, fill holes, etc. He agreed.  \n\nFast forward to last night, we're talking about our families, he's saying how lucky he is that he's going to marry into my family. My family loves him, we're not perfect, we fight and yell, but overall, we genuinely have one another's back. I joked and said \"yeah idk what family I'm marrying into,\" (which I admit, is at least half true) and he got offended and said \"maybe if you wouldn't insist we stay in a hotel when you visit, you'd know my mom better.\" \n\nFair point, but I ask her WEEKS before I visit if she'd like to go out to eat with us, or spend time with us, she ALWAYS has an excuse. Yes, her dad has dementia, yes she is his main caretaker, yes finding care for him is inconvenient on the weekends, but I give her plenty of heads up so we can spend time together with her son. Her son and I have been dating almost 4 years. Up until last year, she didn't have a place big enough to house us over night, so we only made day trips the first 3ish years of our relationship. I've only spent one holiday with them (Thanksgiving), he's spent every NYE with me and one Thanksgiving as well. Still, the amount of time we spend in each other's hometowns are the same, the quality, not so much. Still, I really don't know anything about her besides her money troubles and hoarding habits. Everything I know about her is negative.  \n\nIt's true, we spend more \"quality time\" with my family (for example, he's visiting this weekend, so my family planned a karaoke night at a bar we love) but that's because my family puts in effort. With her, I feel like the bitch that is taking her son away from her. When I'm not around she comments to him about how him and his brother are going to banish her into a nursing home when she's old because they'll be \"too busy\" with their own families. Talk about a fucking guilt trip. \n\nThe more I hear about her snide comments and think about our lack of relationship the more I realize that I really don't like her. She's had a string of awful luck, she really has. She could benefit from some therapy (we all could tbh), but that's not an excuse to be so manipulative and make consistent excuses about your lack of money (she has no budget, she uses her dad's checks to fund everything, she expects her sons to pick up the slack--even though one is in college and my bf makes half what she does). \n\nI'm just frustrated. How am I supposed to marry someone who's mom doesn't necessarily hate me, but sure as hell doesn't make an effort to get to know me. I really feel like I'm trying. In college, we'd drive up for the day and help out around the house, clean up, we helped her move into her dad's house and we cleaned out her dump of a basement (TWICE!) only for it to go back to cluttered again. I just don't know what else to do. I'm less concerned with her liking me and more concerned with her respecting our relationship and me. \n\nAny advice? \n",

As this person, I get into a lot of private conversations with regulars who message me for sometimes more succinct advice. This is what I've come away with:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMost people who frequent this sub would not marry their partners again if they knew then what it took years of horrorshow abuse to now know. A partner that unfailingly has your back from jump is a different story but even then? Life gets really hard, man. Having to battle this kind of shit day in, day out does not get easier so it's having to do that *and* handle the extra shit that comes at you in life that no one sees coming.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you really want to marry this guy you need to do premarital counseling. You also need to consciously, deliberately realize you will have his mother's snide comments and manipulative shit to endure until she is dead. And by the way from the sounds of it, she'll be living with you. Ever taken care of someone old and dying? I have. 0/10 would not do it again and that was my own mother I adored like no one on Earth. Imagine handling that shit for someone you don't like! You can't rationalize this stuff away. You can't say \"we'll handle it when it comes to it\" because it is coming and you need a plan. Nobody starts off on a cross-country road trip saying, \"I'm actually pants-shittingly terrified of driving in traffic but I'll figure it out when we get there!\" You absolutely know what you are walking into and you know it isn't going to change so you need to figure out how you plan to get married and maybe raise a family all with a woman like that being part of every major life event you ever have. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI don't know you and even if I did I sure as hell wouldn't know what is best for your life. What I do know is in general people need to see what is and not what they want to see. I say that a lot. It's because most people are either so in love they overlook red flags or so scared to be alone they ignore the monstrous problems. You can never be too careful about your quality of life. It's the only one you're going to get and it deserves to be treated well by everybody you allow to be a part of it.",

We'd been married quite a while and I'd worked to get my mother out of our marriage and out of my life, but I didn't get her out of my head and the resulting maladaptive behaviours were driving him insane. The traits you hone to cope with and survive abuse don't serve you well in a healthy relationship, they're like an antivenom that is toxic in its own right. As kind and loving and self-sacrificing as I was, I was also exhaustingly emotionally unwell.\n\nIn other words, even if your BF completely shuns his family, you'll still be left with a man who needs years of meditation, therapy, reading, and painful self-discovery to be a safe partner. It was so painful to my DH that he was willing to disobey his God to find peace. I had to be willing to tear my personality down to the bone and rebuild a healthy wife, and then start actually doing that work, before he decided to stay. If you have any choice to avoid that kind of pain, it might be a good idea.",

It did nothing. I got some medication from our concierge and it’s helping for sure but I still have this groggy feeling as if I’ve had a couple drinks in me and the feeling doesn’t go away. Is this feeling normal… or will it go away? \n\nWe’re on the 10th deck in a room that’s around the middle of the ship and I find that it’s even worse in the room. My head spins, we have a nice balcony room and we’ve kept the binds closed the whole time as I can’t stand looking out… we have an excursion today and I’m not quite sure what to do… will it be better off the ship? is it normal to feel worse in the room? \n\nShould I take medication when I get off the ship so it kicks in when I’m back on the ship?",

Whichever you take, see if you can take them in the evening so you sleep when the drowsiness is most significant.  \n\nGinger (not 99% sugar and a tad of ginger flavoring) has been proven to be extremely helpful as well.  \n\nYou can chat with the medical center and they may prescribe something else - usually ondansetron (Zofran) via injection.  \n\nAs for where to stay, mid-ship and closer to the waterline may help - at the pivot point of the ship there is far less physical movement.  While everyone is different, I'd strongly encourage you to open those curtains, watch the horizon, and fight your mind on this one, as motion sickness is triggered by a disconnect between the motion you feel and what your see.  You aren't seeing any motion in a closed room.  \n\nGreen apples are a commonly accepted remedy, and IIRC, were tested alongside ginger on Mythbusters once (where they concluded ginger was shockingly good at mitigating motion sickness).  Again, you can chat with the medical center for more assistance and meds.  I don't suspect they'll mention peppermint oil, as well, I'm not sure where that came from (though for those it helps, great).",

She is still walking wobbly. \n\nI looked up the ingredients of this flea collar and it was CLOVE OIL, PEPPERMINT OIL?! these are poisonous oils for cats! I bought this collar on Amazon as a cheap alternative to seresto, like a fool. \n\nWhat can I do to help her get relief??\n\nUPDATE: bloodwork came back okay! She is severely dehydrated and will need daily subcutaneous fluids for a week. I seperated her from her brother so i can monitor food intake and urine output.

I hate spiders in my room.\n\nSo I was originally gonna let it go peacefully by either putting it in a cup and then letting it outside or in a bug catcher thing I have, but because it was in the corner of the walls, I couldn't grab it. I tried and it fled under a poster and then crawled into the corner where the walls meet the ceiling.\n\nObviously I didn't fuck with this and decided the next best step would be spraying it with disinfectant spray, which knocked it off my wall... behind my bed and under my pillow...\n\nAfter gathering my courage I moved my pillow to see if it was still alive, and unfortunately for me, it was. It then proceeded to flee... somewhere... who knows where...\n\nThis freaked me out more and naturally I decided the best option was to ward it away from my body somehow so it wouldn't crawl on me in my sleep.\n\nSo I covered myself in peppermint extract oil.\n\nThe kind for baking.\n\nThis seemed totally logical to me since spiders hate peppermint, but unfortunately for me, my skin hates peppermint too, and had an allergic reaction.\n\nSo instead of getting the rest I deserve, I'm now laying at the opposite end of my bed covered in hives and peppermint oil.\n\nIt didn't occur to me until after that I could've just shoved peppermint gum sticks in my pockets, but I never said I was thinking logically.\n\nTL;DR: The spider won and I'm stuck cosplaying a candy cane until I can eventually sleep and free myself from this torment.\n\nUPDATE: Not entirely related but I learned my lesson and did not cover myself in peppermint oil today!! My mom saw a house centipede in our bathroom so I mixed the oil and some water and sprayed it on the rugs (instead of myself). Also the spider never came back so maybe my method did work? Either way I'm not doing it again lol it burned. Hopefully my new method will work against the house centipede.",

I can’t catch all the squirrels in the neighborhood. None of my other cars have ever had problems and none of the neighbors have problems.\n\nI understand that Subaru doesn’t want to cover this because of wildlife, but they make their wiring harnesses out of squirrel candy. That seems like a defect to me. \n\nAnybody have this happen to them, or ideas of how to keep the squirrels away from my delicious car?\n\n",

        "body": "Hey, this is the kind of repairs I prefer working on.\n\n>not covered by warranty because it was caused by wildlife.\n\nthis part is correct, the car didn't break itself so it's not subaru's responsibility. Depending on your insurance and state laws, rodent damage can be considered an \"act of god\" and both be covered and not affect your rates.\n\n>The dealer looks at it and says it’s the exact same thing, squirrel chewed through it and left a walnut. Another $2000.\n\nThis appears to be what the photo you posted is from?\n\n>The dealer tells me that the wire covers are made of soy and irresistible to rodents.\n\nThis is an ancient myth. Rodents have been chewing wiring since there was wiring, soybean oil-derived polymers or not. Also, basically every car newer than ~2005 will have it. It's just not true.\n\n>Other than deploying squirrel countermeasures such as peppermint oil and moth balls, I don’t know what to do.\n\nYes, there's one more thing you can do and what I've done for all my customers with rodent damage in the past. Honda makes an [anti-rodent tape](https://www.collegehillshonda.com/product/4019-2317.html) - part # 4019-2317 - which is laced with capsaicin. I use that to wrap the new harness in the damaged locations as well as any other common damage areas.\n\n>It’s an 8 hour repair, so the cost is mostly labor.\n\nWhoever billed this at 8 hours is being a *little bit* generous to themselves, lol, I'd bill this at 4. But there isn't a strict labor time guide for wiring harness replacement anywhere, so it's hard to really argue.\n\n>A different shop said it is too close to the connection to be repaired.\n\nGiven the photo, yes that's correct there's no saving the wiring already there. It would be possible to get a [new knock sensor connector ](https://iwireusa.com/collections/1-2-pin-replacement-plugs/products/knock-sensor-plug-h?variant=42173339173017) to splice on, but this does come with warratability implications. It's something I'd offer to a customer if they were really trying to pinch pennies, but harness replacement is preferred especially with a resistance-sensitive signal like a knock sensor wire.",

    "body": "So my boyfriend and I were talking about how he's been moisturizing and how he enjoys it.  It all started from me letting him try my HG moisturizer and of course, he loved it also.  I realized I had a couple back-ups of it so I said I'd be cool with him using it while switched over to pan other moisturizers in my collection.  He promised to buy the next one after we run out.\n\nSo while he is using my HG I've been trying pan a different moisturizer but I don't really like it. I don't really feel any kind of positive effect on my skin and it seems sticky, drying (2nd ingredient is alcohol), sensitizing (fragranced) rather than moisturizing.  I've been using it for 2 weeks and still have about 80% left. I think that equals about 2.5 months of use left.. Been dreading every moment of it.\n\nSo we were talking about ingredients I started to complain about the one I'm using now.\n\nHe said to me: \"You know... You don't have to use things you don't like.\"\n\nMe: \"I don't?\"\n\nHim: \"No.  Just get rid of it. You don't like it.\"\n\nI tried to defend the product and then I realised.  I actually don't like it at all.\n\nIt's such obvious advice if I don't like it.. don't use it and don't keep it.  Over the past 2 months I've hate panned 2 cleansers, just finished hate panning a squeeze tube of face mask, now have been using this moisturizer I hate, and recently started using an eye cream I'm not impressed with.  My skin is hating me as much as I hate these products.\n\nSo I slept on the idea.  So today I tossed/decided to donate/quick pan a bunch of things I was hate panning:\n\nThe moisturizer which had fragrance and alcohol was tossed.\n\nThe backup of the tube of face mask that I hate panned.. that felt like industrial strength gritty citrus mechanics hand cleanser got donated.  Maybe someone else would like it (it has glowing reviews online).\n\nAn eye cream from ipsy I would never pick out for myself which was more greasy than absorbing was quick panned by applying it all over my arms.\n\nA glow cream I made from a cheap lotion + ground up highlighters l wasn't using.  It just applied unevenly, was streaky, and was too dark for my skintone was tossed.\n\nA single use plastic wrapped makeup remover face wipe my mom gave me at least prior to 2017 was tossed.\n\nAnd I redesignated some other products...\n\nA strongly perfumed body wash (I like the fragrance.. But have switched to an acne clearing body wash) will now be a liquid hand soap.\n\nAnother open moisturizer (from my first and only time using ipsy) which has peppermint oil will now be a foot cream.  I don't hate this one but would not purchase.  Peppermint oil is more suited for my feet.\n\nI actually am really happy with these decisions.  I took another moisturizer out of my skincare box and am going to see how that one fares with my needs.  I'm excited and no longer dreading my routine.  And if I hate it.. I don't have to keep using it.",

    "body": "[https://time.com/7020813/do-i-have-ibs/](https://time.com/7020813/do-i-have-ibs/) \\[Full read\\]\n\nWe’re in the midst of a weird cultural moment involving people’s bowel habits. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been [trending](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/hotgirlswithibs) on social media, including TikTok videos and posts about the disorder on Instagram, X, and other platforms. Billboards proclaiming that [*Hot girls have IBS*](https://www.statnews.com/2022/07/07/from-social-media-to-pink-billboards-its-suddenly-hot-to-discuss-gut-diseases/) have popped up over the past few years in Los Angeles and other cities.\n\nAs a result, a subject that was once unthinkable to discuss socially has been normalized. “It’s definitely a phenomenon,” says gastroenterologist Dr. Roshini Raj, an associate professor of medicine at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine and author of *Gut Renovation.* “It’s a topic more people are comfortable talking about, and people are paying more attention to how their guts are feeling.”\n\n# What is IBS?\n\nA functional GI disorder, IBS is characterized by symptoms like bloating, gas, abdominal pain, cramping, constipation, and/or diarrhea. The syndrome is more common among women—[affecting more than twice](https://www.jnmjournal.org/journal/view.html?doi=10.5056/jnm18082) as many women as men—but men experience it, too.\n\nThanks to the social-media trend, people may be diagnosing themselves with IBS based on their symptoms, or they may be bringing them to their doctors’ attention.\n\n**Read More**: [*Why Gut Health Issues Are More Common in Women*](https://time.com/7020911/women-gut-health-ibs-ibd/)\n\n“When people share their stories, awareness \\[of IBS\\] increases, and with that exposure, people realize their symptoms aren’t normal,” says Dr. Shabnam Sarker, an assistant professor of medicine in the gastroenterology and hepatology division at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “And they’re realizing it doesn’t have to be that way.”\n\nDr. Bryan Curtin, director of the Center for Neurogastroenterology and GI Motility at [The Melissa L. Posner Institute for Digestive Health & Liver Disease](https://link.edgepilot.com/s/5f0f1b32/vvnNi2QPWUyARv4bqt7s2A?u=https://mdmercy.com/mercy-services/digestive-health-and-liver-disease) at Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore, agrees. “The upside of this openness to discussing IBS is that it is less stigmatized and people suffering with these conditions feel less alone and isolated,” he says.\n\n# How do you know if you have IBS? \n\nWhile there’s no structural or biochemical test for IBS, there are specific criteria—called the [ROME IV Criteria](https://theromefoundation.org/rome-iv/rome-iv-criteria/)—that are essential for its diagnosis. These include recurrent abdominal pain at least one day per week in the last three months, along with changes in the frequency and appearance of stools (among other symptoms). Subtypes of IBS include constipation-predominant IBS, diarrhea-predominant IBS, mixed IBS, and unclassified IBS. \n\nIn other words, it’s a clinical diagnosis based on someone’s medical history, physical examination, and personal set of symptoms. But because other gastrointestinal disorders—such as celiac disease and inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn’s disease—can have similar symptoms to IBS, doctors often order tests to rule those out before making an IBS diagnosis.\n\nBeyond the hashtags, the[ latest research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016508523048898?via%3Dihub) does suggest that IBS is more prevalent—affecting 6.1% of people in the U.S.—than previously thought. Experts estimate that as many as 10-15%of people in the U.S. have IBS, and many of them may be undiagnosed, Raj says.\n\n# Why is IBS on the rise?\n\nThe digestive system is complicated, and the precise cause of IBS isn’t well understood. It may be related to gut motility or permeability problems, and many experts believe it has to do with the quality of a person’s diet and dysregulation of the gut microbiome: the community of microbes, including bacteria, that naturally live in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nThe uptick also could be related to [stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4202343/). “IBS is a brain-gut axis disorder,” explains Sarker. “The gut has a lot of nerves, and the way the nerves are firing affects \\[gut\\] movement, pain, and bloating. Psychological stressors play a big role in IBS, and there’s been a lot more stress since the pandemic.”\n\n**Read More**: [*Green Tea Is Even Better For You Than You Think*](https://time.com/7017512/is-green-tea-good-for-you/)\n\nThe increase in IBS prevalence also could be related to COVID-19 because “viral illnesses can induce disorders of the gastrointestinal system,” says Dr. Darren Brenner, a gastroenterologist and professor of medicine and surgery at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Indeed,[ ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10644864/)a 2023 [review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10644864/) of studies on the subject found that COVID-19 infection was associated with new IBS diagnoses; this was especially true among women and people with depression or anxiety.\n\nWhile IBS isn’t life-threatening, it can be a miserable experience and[ negatively affect someone’s quality of life](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022399922000940). “With IBS, a lot of people change their behavior to work around their symptoms,” Sarker says. This may lead them to decline invitations to parties or other social events because they’re worried about having a flare-up. Or, it may spur them to avoid physical activity for the same reason.\n\n# How to find relief\n\nOne of the drawbacks to the IBS social-media sensation: Some of the information being shared isn’t correct,[ research](https://gi.org/media/press-info-scientific-meeting/featured-science/b0273-tiktok-and-irritable-bowel-syndrome-ibs-a-cross-sectional-study-of-social-media-content-quality/) has found. Another possible downside? If people with GI symptoms start doom-scrolling, their anxiety and hypervigilance can get ramped up, which could worsen their symptoms. They also might be seduced by online products that promise to eliminate bloating that may not actually work.\n\nBecause the symptoms and severity of IBS can vary among people, there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach to treating it. “The nice thing is because we have so many things in our armamentarium, people can choose their treatment,” says Brenner. “There is no cure for this disorder, and the symptoms wax and wane, but we have multiple modalities that can improve symptoms and quality of life.”\n\n**Read More**: [*What’s So Great About Cottage Cheese?*](https://time.com/7012333/cottage-cheese-health-benefits-recipes/)\n\nThese include dietary modifications such as increasing fiber and water intake and avoiding possible trigger foods like gluten and dairy. “Keeping a food diary can help people identify triggers for IBS,” says Sarker.\n\nOther treatments may include botanical preparations (like peppermint oil, which can reduce intestinal spasms), neuromodulators (such as some antidepressants), antibiotics, or medications that influence gut motility. Mind-body approaches—such as cognitive behavioral therapy, meditation, and gut-directed hypnosis—can also be beneficial because “the gut-mind condition is very real and even more pronounced in someone with irritable bowel syndrome,” says Raj.\n\nGetting plenty of sleep and regular exercise is also beneficial for managing IBS. Many people with IBS rely on[ a combination of therapeutic strategies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8231425/) to treat the condition.\n\n“There’s no definitive cure for IBS,” says Sarker. “But we can manage this and get you to where your quality of life is much better.”",

I've had a colonoscopy, endoscopy, and other blood tests to no avail. The only peace I've known has been the two times I was pregnant. All my IBS symptoms became dormant.

The easiest way to be not fat is with diet and exercise. I always buy a gym membership, work out for a week, then forget about it. I remembered my gym membership today and decided that I could blow off some steam. \n\nI headed over at 7pm, and planned to leave at 8:30pm, as the gym USUALLY closes at 9pm.\n\nI didn't really have an exercise plan, but I knew I was going to go for a swim afterwards in order to cool off. I absolutely adore swimming after working out.\n\nSo, I messed around for a few minutes in the weights area, then decided that the majority of my gym trip would be stationary biking. I put on some music and biked for 30mins.\n\nThe gym was kind of vacant after that, there were only a few other people around. Perfect conditions for a peaceful swim.\n\nI head to the locker room and start getting changed into my bathing suit. An old high school friend was there, and we chatted while I changed. She worked at the gym, and she had just gotten done swimming.\n\nShe leaves a few minutes later, and I head to the pool. (The pool is indoors, on the same floor as the gym)\n\nIt was deserted. There were no lifeguards, nobody in the pool office, nobody in the sauna. I wait around for a couple minutes, debating whether or not I should swim. It SEEMED closed.\n\nFuck it, I went for a dip. Dove a bit, floated on my back, chilled. It was amazing. I saw a couple figures looking in from the 2nd floor's window and thought nothing of it.\n\nAfter my 4 minute swim, I head to the sauna. The sauna was AMAZING. Somebody had put peppermint oil on the rocks, so it was as if I was sitting in a humidifier. I stay there for around 10 mins, and get a text saying I'd be picked up in a bit.\n\nI go to the locker room and toss my clothes on. I usually shower after swimming, but my ride was going to be here soon, so I didn't have the time to shower.\n\nI step out of the locker room and I am met with a shrill ringing.\n\nOh fuck.\n\nI look at the gym area.\n\nEverything is turned off.\n\nOh fuck.\n\nI head up the stairs to the office/lobby.\n\nNOBODY IS THERE.\n\nOH.\n\nFUCK.\n\nI speed walk through the halls, calling out for ANYBODY in between \"OH NO\"s\n\nNO.\n\nRESPONSE.\n\nI glance at the schedule.\n\nSat- Sun. 7am - 8pm.\n\nIt was 8:10pm.\n\nI was locked in the damn gym, and I set off the damn security alarms.\n\nI instantly called my mom, laugh-crying about my situation. She immediately hung up to call all of the authority figures she knows.\n\nI sat my ass right in the middle of the lobby, hoping to prove to security cameras that I mean no harm.\n\nThe alarms shut off a few minutes later, but I just stay on the floor. I wanted to leave, but I assumed it would make my situation worse.\n\nA few minutes later, the police show up. They stroll up to the doors, and unlock them. I called my mom crying, thinking I was going to get in trouble.\n\nI hang up, and look at the police.\n\nThey beckon me to the entrance, and I immediately start BAWLING. My mom showed up at the same time, and she runs up to me and the police, and explains the situation.\n\nI did not get in any trouble, and apparently it has happened before. It was scary.\n\nTL:DR I thought the gym closed an hour later than it really did. I got locked in, set off the security alarm, and had to be escorted out by police.\n\nEDIT: To whoever's comment that was deleted or removed:\n\nI am 17, probably too old to cry at this sort of situation, but it was not a sad cry. It was an \"oh my god I really am this idiotic\" cry.",

    "body": "Howdy all. Long time lurker, first time poster, yadda yadda. I honestly hoped I would never actually HAVE to post in this sub, reading other's stories and seeing the advice/general consensus has been so helpful but every situation is so unique. I would appreciate some advice, and encouragement because this is hard AF. TL;DR at the bottom cause idk where this story will end up. Let's go!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBACKSTORY: My FH is a former cigarette smoker. He started when he was like 11 and got real into the habit by 13-15. By the time he was 18 he was a pack+ a day. Just like Mommy. His father died of alcoholism when he was 19 and FH was on a path of pure self destruction when we started \"talking\" (as the kids would say, pre-dating but a bit more than just friends) right after his 22nd birthday.\n\nI knew he was a smoker but he was kind to not smoke in front of me. I was a fitness professional and asthmatic with a family history of cigarette smokers. I can respect a person's right to smoke, but I do prefer they respect my right to not subject myself to it. At this point in my life, the only people I still see on a regular basis that are also habitual cigarette consumers are my step-mom, my actual mom and my brother. They are various shades of respectful about it. FH found himself smoking less and less because he would rather be around me than get his fix. Eventually he dropped down to almost nothing and now, over three years later he just has the occasional cigarette out in the backyard. Then he comes inside and washes his beard and hands and puts some peppermint oil on and I hardly can tell. And when I say \"occasional\" I do mean like 1 every month and a half or so.\n\nSecond bit of Backstory: about 6 weeks ago FMIL's car blew up. She had been neglecting routine maintenance and it caught up with her and the thing crapped out.  So she began the process of getting a new vehicle. 4 weeks ago FSIL's car crapped out. She SWEARS she kept it up and did NOTHING wrong but somehow the car ran out of oil and the engine got shot. The reasons the cars died is less important than what happened because of it. The solution to these compound problems was for Grandfather-In-Law and FMIL to put some money together and lease two cars both in FMIL's name. FSIL is responsible for paying the insurance and maintenance of her vehicle but she did not purchase it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFMIL and FSIL go on a beach trip to Beach Place every year. Despite it being far, they always drive. FH and I have moved away from Hometown (a story for a different day) and we are now in a different state that is south of Hometown and North of Beach Place. So the plan was for FMIL and GIL to drive down in GIL's car, he would stay a few days, then return to Hometown. FMIL would stay with us until FSIL and Friend came down in FSIL's car for a night and they would all depart for Beach Place in the morning. Great plan. No problems with the plan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell GIL was pretty disappointed and vocal about his confusion and distaste for our way of life. (who doesn't have a microwave???? why are your roosters so loud??? gardens are so much work, just go to the grocery store!!! how do you get spaghetti out of a squash this is DISGUSTING!!) So that was rough but bearable. They did that shit when we lived in Hometown too so it was not a shock. Disappointing, but not shocking.  FMIL wasn't as vocal but she clearly agreed with the sentiments. She said we were \"not normal\" (boo-hoo idgaf) There were some other ignorant and offensive things GIL said that FH wanted to address but we decided that this being the first time they've come to see our home (in the 18 months we've lived here) and the fact that we DO live a very unconventional and perhaps jarring lifestyle, inspired us to be compassionate and understanding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGIL leaves and I actually had a nice day with FMIL and Aunt-In-Law and Cousins-In-Law who live here in town. We did dress shopping and wedding planning and had a really nice time. I chalk that up to me being relatively close and comfortable with AIL and CIL  but it was still good to have a \\*positive\\* day with FMIL. They are so few and far between.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen it's time for FSIL to show up with Friend in FSIL's car. Which is waaaaaay nice btw. It has fabric seats and an inordinate amount of trunk space. It is very similar to FMIL's car which is just a hair younger, different maker and has leather seats. So now the fact that FMIL is a pack+ a day smoker comes into play. You gotta be a on a pretty regular pace to get all that poison in your face over the course of a day. BEFORE the trip started FSIL confronted her mother about some boundaries for their trip and her new-to-her vehicle.\n\nFSIL said \"mom you are not smoking in my car for the 8+ hour ride we'll have to Beach Place\"FMIL said \"to hell I am. that's MY car I paid for I will do whatever I want in it.\"\n\nThere was no resolution, just yelling and crying and finally they got tired of it and just dropped it. Per usual. Big fight, much fuss, many emotions, zero resolution. Drop it, ignore it, forget it, then start again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo last night FMIL and FH and I were in the living room after FMIL had just cut a bunch of bread for sandwiches. FMIL starts complaining about how demanding FSIL is being not wanting her to \"make a mess in her car\". FH said that it was her car and she had the right to set rules for what happens in it. FMIL snaps back that it is in fact HER car and she makes the rules. When asked why FSIL didn't just drive FMIL's car down to solve this problem of \"who makes the rules\" FMIL claims that FSIL is too reckless of a driver to be trusted with her car. (arguably true but kinda not the point)\n\nFH: then you shouldn't have bought a car for her if you're not going to respect herFMIL: but she couldn't buy one her self \\*affected nickname that makes me cringe\\* I  HAD to buy it for herFH: she is 20 years old and has a job. she can go without a car to teach her some responsibility. it's very unfair of you to do this for her and then hold it over her head like this\n\nGo FH!!!  (By now I am channeling my inner houseplant and trying to be as quiet and un-involved as humanly possible. Everything that comes out of my mouth is null and void based on that fact that I said it so it's not very useful to speak up anyway)\n\nFMIL: \\*affected nickname\\* + \\*whine\\* I haaaaaaad to. I'm her mother I have to take caaaaaaare of her.FH: then respect her wishes! it's simple. if she doesn't want you to make a mess, or smoke cigarettes or put your feet on the dash, or WHATever, it's not that hard to just...respect her.FMIL: well that I will put my foot down about. I will be smoking, I can't go that long without a cigarette and I don't want to. And we're not just going to stop every time I want one, that's ridiculous. I'm sorry, but I'm not apologizing anymore. I know \\*\\*you guys\\*\\* think smoking is \\*\\*sooooooooo bad for you\\*\\* but FH you're a smoker you know what it's like.FH: yeah I know I can stop and hold out when the people around me ask me to. you're being really unreasonableFMIL: I'm being unreasonable???? you're sister is the one making demands! I'm standing my ground to prove a point. I'm sorry, but I'm not defending myself anymore. I'm a smoker. I don't need to constantly apologize for it. This is ridiculous. If I want to smoke I'm going to smoke. I paid for the car and I'm paying for this trip. I can't believe you're turning on my like this \\*affected nickname\\* I just can't.FH: I think you're wrong mom. That mindset is wrong and I can't lie to you about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBOOOOOOOM. There is also a bit of Jocasta stuff going on, it's real weird and I try not to think about it but the fact that FH actually stood up to her and told her he wasn't just going to blindly support and justify her really crushed her. She spend the rest of the evening being very, very cold to him and confronted him again in the morning to reiterate how she cannot believe he is being so cruel and awful to her about this. He ruined the whole trip and has made her reconsider spending time with him/us in the future (ohh noooooooo /s)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told FSIL to not take the car and not go on the trip. That at some point she needs to set actual boundaries and enforce them otherwise she is not allowed to complain about the psychological warfare. But as much as I love her this is about ME and my problems with the woman known as mom.\n\nPlz Halp.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: FMIL is using the fact that she bought FSIL a car as reason enough to disregard her wishes to not smoke cigarettes in said car during a 8+ hour car ride. FH stood up and defended FSIL and now he's the worst.",

FMIL views purchasing power as ownership. In the future you can (should) remember not to let her buy or pay for anything for you unless you’re willing to have her controlling that portion of your life. Keep that in mind with wedding planning, home purchases, and any future babies (fur or otherwise).\n\n2. Your FDH can and will stand up to his mother about boundary stomping.

    "body": "This guide for new but not completely new players; Something between 2 weeks playing and not yet 80. This guide intentionally does not cover everything. It just focuses on the, \"oh I wish I knew to have taken advantage of that,\" kind of stuff.\n\n#Seasons\n* Wintersday (Christmas) continues the GW2 seasonal half of the year. It'll continue with Lunar New Year's (early Feb.), and Super Adventure Box (April Fool's).\n* Keep saving your Potions of PvP and WvW (for holiday PvP/WvW reward tracks).\n* Each Daily Achievement will give Wintersday Gifts.\n* There is new Category for Daily Achievements doing Xmas activities (in Divinity's Reach.)\n* **Make sure you do 3 Wintersdays Achievements everyday.** (For Karma farming).\n* If you are playing on a Free to Plays Account try to get to level 10. This will let you enter cities. \n* The Warp Point outside of every city (Rata Sum, the Grove, Divinity's Reach, Hoelbrek, and the Black Citadel) is always unlocked for **ALL** players. Free to Play Accounts and low level players can use this to get to Divinity's Reach and all the other starter areas to get the Wintersday Tree and Star of Gratitude (below).\n\n\n#Wintersday Day Tree\n* In each City there is a location marked \"(Home)\", this is your home instance. It is where-ever you go for your level 10 Story Quests.\n* You can visit any Home in any City with any Race with any Character at any time; it will always be the same and yours.\n* During Wintersday you will get a letter from an Orphan starting the [Warming Grawnk's Heart](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Warming_Grawnk's_Heart).\n* The Bloodstone [Sous-Chef Serimur Oxbone](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sous-Chef_Seimur_Oxbone) will be marked with a Peppermint Candy on the map. (He's very obvious in any city aside Divinity's Reach.)\n* This quest will take at least 3 physical 24 hour days.\n* Complete the quest to get a Wintersday Tree in your home. It is marked with a Peppermint Candy Swirl.\n* You can search the tree once a day for a Wintersday Present; all year long.\n\n\n#Star of Gratitude\n* You can only get the Star of Gratitude during Wintersday.\n* The Star of Gratitude is a \"gobbler\". It will gobble Emperial Fragments and turn them into bags that give basic crafting materials.\n* When a charcter is level 80 it will get several thousands of Emperial Fragments. Having them gobbled up is useful for storage and stuff.\n* First get the Wintersday Tree. See above.\n* Finish the Wintersday Tree quest line by completing [For the Children!](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Warming_Grawnk%27s_Heart#For_the_Children.21)\n* Completing this quest involves opening physical chests on the map in the four main areas of Tyria: the Maguma Jungle, Kryta, the Shiverpeaks, and Ascalon. Remember that the Way Point outside of each City is already unlocked; (starter areas).\n* Physical chests are awarded at the end of mini dungeons and jumping puzzles. Don't hesitate to ask for help finding them.\n\n\n#Gift Contents\n* Wintersday Drinks are for an achievement. The max level is 10000 drinks! The max level is required for the [Winter's Presence Skin](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Winter%27s_Presence_Skin).\n* Don't forget to drink some for yourself for basic Wintersday Day achievements.\n* Fruitcakes (power), Peppermint Oil (healing/boons), and Icicles (condi) are some of the best utility items to use.\n* The Winter's Heart Infusion makes a player have a different aura of snowy glowiness. It is valued around 600g!\n\n\n#Gift Farming\n* The fastest way to farm Gifts is to do the Jumping Puzzle or the Bell Choir game; depending on player dexterity.\n* Speak to (asura) [Tixx](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Toymaker_Tixx) once a day for more presents.\n* You can buy 10 Gifts from the Wintersday Vendor at the cheapest \"tier.\"\n* You can buy Festive Bags of Materials for Karma for mid quality (rather valuable) crafting materials.\n\n#Tixx Toyshop (Dungeon)\n* Press 'Y' to bring up Looking For Group (LFG) menu.\n* Select \"Central Tyria (Parties)\".\n* Join any party you like or make your own. They are often described as \"Tixx\", \"Xmas Dungeon\", \"TT\" (for **T**ixx's **T**oyshop).\n* Enter the Toyshop.\n* You will be boosted to level 80 while inside. Don't worry about being too weak or not ready.\n\n\n#Karma Farm\n* Wintersday is the best time for farm Karma. Karma is used to purchase various things, but also can be converted into gold.\n* Purchase Wrapping Paper and Toy Skins from [Charity Corps Seraph](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Charity_Corps_Seraph). Use the same NPC to turn them into Wrapped Gifts.\n* Stack as much Karma boosting stuff you can.\n* Gift these gifts to Orphan for  ~~50k~~ ~~3000~~ ~~butt load~~ ~~several Kasmeer's~~ 1500 Karma per present. This is affected by Karma bonuses and can be stacked to a **ludicrous** amount!\n* There are 30 orphans per day.\n* Map of [Orphan Locations](http://gw2timer.com/?page=Map&section=Collectible&article=Orphans). A few Orphans have moved this year (2017) but should be in the general same locations.\n\n\n#Karma Boosting Stacking\n* If you have the Candy Corn Gobblering from Halloween, keep eating until you get a Karma Boost. OR use a Karma Booster.\n* Grab a Guild Flag that boosts Karma or Bonfire. Often there will be one by the Wintersday Activities. Another common place for Flags is WvW, especially after the sever reset. Click on WvW icon in the upper right corner and enter any world (not Heart of the Mists or Obsidian Sanctum). Flags should be nearby the entrance. (Living World Season 3 maps also frequently have Karma flags if you own them.)\n* If you are part of an established guild you can buy a Karma boost from the Guild Hall Tavern. Ask your guildmades to show you where it is.\n* Eat several Candy Canes (from Wintersday Activities and Gifts.) The boost only lasts 1 minute but can stack up to 30 minutes.\n* Use a Winter's Blessing snow globe. (You get these from doing Wintersay activities 5 days in a row. This is why its important to do 3 every day.)\n* Use Wintersday utilities if you are level 80; fruitcake, peppermint oil, or icicles.\n* Use Wintersday food if you are level 80; or any ice cream if not. Press 'O' to open the Trading Post. Click on the Balance Scales. Search for \"ice cream\". Buy some. Pick them up at any NCP with Balance Scales. Ice cream is super cheap costing only a few coppers.\n* Complete the Race Event. Renting a Mount is 50s which can be expensive for new players, but you can still run the race on foot. (The Executioner's Axe from Halloween will help out.).\n\n\n*As usual the Internet will be all to eager to correct mistakes or left out information.\n",

    "body": "If you want my creds just look at my post history. Lost over 200lbs naturally and have kept it off for over 15 years, plus endured 4 skin removal procedures. Needless to say, I have a serious sweet tooth. I just can't ditch them entirely and I love brownies. All the brownies, doesn't matter what kind, but all the low cal versions I have tried seems to fail or are loaded with sugar alcohol like erythritol. At best they taste good but have zero structure to them, just a gooey mess that can cause stomach issues. At worse, the high protein ones, are dry and could be used for cannon fodder. As such, I have worked through some available recipes to land on one that never fails and is super simple.\n\nFor those who want to see. https://imgur.com/a/O61NQd9\n\nA frosted version, a carrot cake version, and then 2 shots of the regular old recipe as shown.\n\n**Recipe:**\n\n* 1 serving, 53g of Kodiak Dark Chocolate Powercake mix\n* 1 serving, 30-31g of casein/whey blend protein powder (I use pescience select)\n* 5g of baking powder\n* and sweetener of choice, I use liquid splenda (aka liquid sucralose or Kroger-branded Apriva.) You don't need much since both the mix and the protein powder are sweetened already.\n* You add enough water to make it the consistency of a cake batter, I find this amount varies between protein brands so I can't give an absolute amount.\n\n* (1 tsp of a neutral oil can be used if you desire more fats, it also makes the brownie just a tad moister.)\n\nMix in a bowl, microwave for 2 minutes and eat. In fact, if you get the Dixie large dessert bowls (50 for 6-7 bucks at Walmart, they also sell store brand at both walmart and kroger), it will hold one full brownie and then you can throw it away/recycle it when you're done. No mess other than a spoon.\n\n**What Flavor Protein?**\n\nIn my experience, Chocolate Cupcake gives the best \"chocolate\" flavor. But I have also used Snickerdoodle (more of a cinnamon infused Mexican hot chocolate flavor), White Chocolate Peppermint Bark (a Christmassy feel to it), and Mint Cookie (very girl scout cookie tasting), I've also used Cookies and Cream which has almost a mix between a brownie and a blondie. You can always add a few grams of cocoa powder or vanilla to push whichever way you prefer.\n\nHonestly, chocolate goes with basically the entire pescience line up, although I wasn't a fan of Cake Pop. Didn't taste bad, just seemed \"flat\" tasting.\n\n**Macros:**\n\nThis is roughly 300-310cals, 31g carbs, 3.5g fat and 38-39g protein. (Variations between protein powder flavors account for minor swings in contents) \n\n**Use Cases:**\n\nCan be easily pre-measure, packed in plastics bags and if you use the dixie bowl then you've got an easily portable breakfast or snack w/ a plastic spoon. Or a bit greener with a bamboo disposable one. You can also just pre-do packages of mix for home for a quick chocolaty snack, breakfast, or I even use it for a quick dinner sometimes. Also, the recipe is easily doubled but cooking time will vary. Just watch for the moment when just a little bit of the top of the brownie is still wet.\n\n**Cost per serving:**\n\nAt 6.50/box of Kodiak and 37.00/27 serving container of Pescience, I have about 2.02 in each of these brownies. If you only buy this protein for these brownies 2 boxes of Kodiak will net you 20 brownies, so you'll have about 2.50 in each w/ 7 servings of protein powder left over. Both items can be bought in bulk, so you can get that price down as well.\n\n**Variations on the brownie (obviously changes macros):**\n\nUse white chocolate peppermint bark and a drop of peppermint oil for a chocolate peppermint brownie.\n\nAdd a few grams of coconut flakes for coconut brownies.\n\nAdd a few grams of chocolate chips. Or drizzle the top with sf chocolate syrup.\n\nLet the brownie cool, poke holes in it, and pour in a bottle of a chocolate or coffee flavored Fairlife Protein Milk for a Tres Leche like cake/brownie and more protein. (this is amazing for a breakfast, 450cals and 68g of protein)\n\nMix half a scoop of cookies and cream protein with just enough water to make a glaze for the cake.\n\nMix a vanilla Greek yogurt cup with 1/4 package chocolate fudge FF/SF jello pudding mix, 5-10g of cocoa powder, and a bit of sweetener for a fantastic frosting (makes a great high protein birthday cake).\n\nSF caramel topping is great, so is SF strawberry jam that's been slightly warmed. Nuke some frozen raspberries till warm works too.\n\nA scoop of sea salt caramel Halotop on top is AWESOME.\n\nAnd a final sweet and savory bomb ... finely dice half a strip of well-cooked bacon, mix with 1-2 tblspn of Walden Farms Maple/Bacon syrup, and pour over the warm brownie.\n\n**Major Variation**\n\nYou can make a blondie like cake as well, by switching to Cake Pop or Snickerdoodle protein flavor, some vanilla extract and Plain or Cinnamon Oat Kodiak powercake mix. The oatmeal in the latter will make it dry, so youll need to add some water. Let the batter sit for 2 minutes, then add more to get the right hydration level. But I prefer the chocolate-based recipe MUCH better and its more consistent in the end product in my experience.\n\n**Conflicts**\n\nNone. Both items can be easily found/ordered anywhere in the US, so I won't tell you where to find them. I'm not affiliated with any company mentioned in any way, these are just the ones I have found to give me a consistent product each time I make this recipe, which I will admit is probably more than I should, lol. Lastly, never pay for pricey cookbooks that are ultimately just what someone else likes. Learn the skills needed to cook low-cal, high protein, or low-carb then produce your own recipes and save your money. (And of course share them with everyone for free.)",

    "body": "In my late teens and early 20s, I worked as an elf in the mall. Parents would hand you their screaming and crying babies covered in random food bits, snot and diapers full (wet and solid). Strangely, the people I worked with were such a blast. We had a \"hot\" Santa who knew sign language.\nWe had the former Navy Santa who was covered in tattoos, so we had to wrap his arms in Ace bandages.\nWe had another Santa who smoked like a chimney so we had to douse him in peppermint oil.\nWe started the Santa season a week before Thanksgiving. After weeks we closed operations on XMas Day at 6PM. \nWe were dismantling the sets and walking Santa to the back room when a woman with an infant comes running up to me.\nHER: Wait, my daughter needs her picture taken with Santa.\nME: ma'am, we are closed. The mall is closing and we have to be out of here. We have already taken down the set and packed away the camera.\nHER: But it's her first Christmas. \nME: ma'am, unfortunately, we are closed.\nHER: Where the fuck is your Christmas spirit?!\nME: My Christmas spirit has been here since a week before Thanksgiving. Where have you been?\nHER: This is her first Christmas. I can't believe you are going to take this important moment away from her.\nME: Luckily, she's young enough to not remember NOT getting to sit on Santa's lap. This also means she's probably got many years to come. Next year, you may want to get in line earlier and not wait until Christmas Eve. Happy holidays!\nI then turned around and walked away from her.",

I've worked several retail holidays and I can't believe people are still losing their shit when Christmas pretty much starts in October now.  They demand magical service, literally magical, pull-something-out-of-your-ass magical and then act like you personally held a blowdryer to Frosty if you don't comply.  Especially us customer service robots in any industry where we sell things that no one needs (i.e. most retail) like body care or name brand clothing.

    "body": "Female. 29 years old. 240 on a good day. \n\n**updating daily if anyone happens to see this**\n\nLooking back it definitely started on Saturday 10/24/20.\n\nWe had a crazy weather change Friday night to Saturday. I also slept with my fan on and it was pouring down my face so it was easy to think it was a cold or sinuses. I woke up on\n\nSaturday 10/24/2020\n\nI felt fine but heard a slight crackle sound in my chest. Like a bag of chips or bubbles bubbling. I honestly thought it was from the weather or from my fan. All in all I felt fine. \n\nSunday 10/25/2020\n\nI had the same crackle but it was less. Looking back I must have felt “off”. I thought I was just depressed. I laid on the couch ALL day watching movies. Which isn’t totally unlike me but isn’t very often. I also asked my husband to get me Pho which I tasted just fine. I took some vicks NyQuil and went to bed.\n\nMonday 10/26/2020\n\nI woke up and felt super nasally. I took some DayQuil and felt good. I had a lot of energy honestly. I got to work and was so hungry, like starving. I ate some grapes and tasted them just fine. Around 10:30 am my head started screaming and my stomach was going crazy. I have some random essential oils at my desk and I was like inhaling them to make sure I could smell them. I smelled them perfectly. I felt like I was out of my body though and panicking and told my job I had to leave. I barely remember my drive home. I got home and went upstairs and I had insane diarrhea all night. I couldn’t eat anything as I felt super nauseous. I threw up finally a few times which I thought made me feel better but then all of a sudden my body hurt SO bad. Sharp and long nerve pain down my arms and legs. \n\nMy husband brought me up some crackers and I realized I couldn’t taste them. He brought me a bunch of candles and I couldn’t smell anything. That’s kind of when we both started to panic. So some where between 10:30 am and 3ish PM my senses packed their bags and left. \n\nTuesday (today) 10/27/20\n\nWe went to a rapid testing site and my test came back positive and my husbands was negative. My breathing is super shallow. Like I’ve been taking stairs all day and my body aches are out of this world. I’ve had a headache off and on and my chest definitely hurts. I only really cough if I try to take deep breathes. \n\nI will be ready for this to be over. I’m also crazy tired but can’t really sleep which is very annoying. \n\nMy job is A+ and just rapid tested everyone and everyone else is negative so fair so I have no idea where I got it from.\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nTuesday 10/27/20 evening \n\nI threw up again but I think it was my fault. I opened up some curtains in the bedroom because *depression* and I knocked the curtain rod off and had this wild idea to fix it myself. By the time I was done my abs were ON FIRE. It felt like I had done hundreds of sit ups in a matter of a few minutes. I threw up right after which led to really bad nerve pain down my arms and legs for the rest of the night. When I would stand up my legs felt like they were clotting. Idk if there is a real feeling for that but they felt..ripply? I was surprised they were holding me honestly. I took the vicks NyQuil and went to bed. I tossed and turned for awhile. \n\nWednesday 10/28/20\n\nI think my fever broke in the middle of the night? I woke up in a literal pool of sweat. My hands were so hot. My pants were soaking wet and my shirt was too. I couldn’t move to save my life. I managed to roll over for some fresh air and fell back asleep. I took my temp around 6 am and it’s the lowest it’s been in days at 98.3. \n\nI am taking it again currently and it is...98.6. Well fuck I don’t feel hot at least but I’ll keep an eye on it. \n\nI’ve drank more then I’ve been able to. Mixing some sport Pedialyte and blue power aid. I bet it taste like trash. I’ve taken my vitamins and ate 6 crackers. I also managed to shower which took nearly an hour just to wash my hair, no thank you. Everything feels like I’ve ran a marathon.\n\nI am trying not to panic about my senses but the more I read about it the more anxious I feel about getting it back. I am constantly smelling stuff. Vicks. Peppermint oil. Every candle in the bedroom. And there is eerily nothing. Not even a whisper of anything. I’m trying not to panic but ya know. I think it’s normal.\n\nCoughing actually really hurts today. It just is doing something to my chest and arms where they tingle and burn when I cough.\n\nIt’s a very confusing illness In the sense that I have definitely felt “worse” but also feel “worse” then ever. The stomach flu has sent me to the hospital and i really felt near death. This comes in strange physical waves. One second I think I’m being dramatic and “oh you’re fine” and then the next I can barely walk to the bathroom without needing to stop to catch my breath or I can’t pick up the phone because my finger tips feel exhausted and my muscles burn and ache. It’s not like the flu when you’re throwing up and pooping your brains out. And not like a cold where you are stuffy and full of mucus. It’s just strange and sneaky.\n\nThursday 10/29/20\n\nI ended up going to the hospital today. I spent all night in some insane GI pain and throwing up. I ended up eating two bowls of soup (1 can), half a sleeve of crackers and like three pieces of broccoli yesterday afternoon. I wanted broccoli so badly but maybe the fiber was a bad idea? I spent all evening in pain. \n\nI am not sure how to describe the gas pain. It was...turbulent and constant. I couldn’t push a fart because everything hurt so bad so it was all just sitting and turning. Any time I moved I would seriously burp so hard but it would make me super nauseous. I cried a lot last night. I miss my husband and dogs and I miss feeling healthy. \n\nAnyways. After no sleep and throwing up stomach acid (that I can’t taste) multiple times I threw in the towel. There wasn’t a bed available which I understood and my husband couldn’t stay since I’m positive. They gave me fluids in the waiting room and took my labs. I have either a kidney infection or uti based off the white blood cells in my urine and was dehydrated. I got meds for nausea, the infection and an “Advil on crack” for pain. \n\nMy oxygen thingy came in today which has been a big relief. Thank you to everyone who suggested it. \n\nThe doctor wasn’t super great but idk what I was expecting. He just said all my symptoms are Covid and it is what it is and it’s day 10-14 where my lungs will get shot if they’re going to. So like. That wasn’t fun to hear. I’m on day six so I’d prefer to feel better and not die. \n\nMy husband is amazing and when I got home he had disinfected the entire room and washed everything. I can’t enjoy the smell of my dope laundry detergent but I know it’s there lol I am just trying to relax and stay calm. Anxiety is a bitch currently.\n\nFriday 10/30/20\n\nLast night still sucked. I can NOT sleep. My husband is going to get me melatonin today and I am going to try that. I was nauseous all night but didn’t barf so i will take that as a win. I don’t want to jinx myself but today is the first day I have felt remotely “hopeful”. The sun is shining in the bedroom which is definitely helping. I had a small surge of energy so I put a mask on and watered my plants in the next room. \n\nI have bad anxiety on a regular day so this is doing wonders for my panicking. I took half a chill pill this morning and finally had a real sleep for like two hours with real dreams and not nightmares. I think the real sleep helped tons. I hope the melatonin provides me with some sleep tonight. Nights are the worst for me.\n\nSaturday 10/31/20\n\nI didn’t even realize today was Halloween lol I slept for like 10 hours last night which was honestly so amazing. The melatonin helped a TON and I also took half a chill pill which probably helped as well. My stomach hurt really badly yesterday from a sneeze attack I had on Thursday and today it is feeling much better.\n\nMy husband made me rice last night which was really hard to force down but I got a couple spoonfuls in and wasn’t nearly as starving as I had been feeling. I did have a lot of diarrhea this morning but at least I’m pooping I guess. This morning I ate one egg and showered. \n\nBefore my shower I noticed that my breast are purple. Apparently it’s another symptom, though it’s kind of rare. I’d really like for these rare symptoms to kick rocks.\n\nOver all, yesterday and today have been better. Monday will be day ten so I am hoping for the best.\n\nSunday 11/1/2020\n\nI didn’t sleep for ten hours unfortunately. I was back to being up at 12 and just kind of in la la land until 5. Yesterday afternoon I had gotten a rash in my face and kind of tripped out about it and had my husband take me to urgent care. The last asked “is Covid rash a thing?” And I decided I’d rather just go back home because I feel like I can’t trust anyone with my symptoms lol she also has me using an iPad to check in and it just made me uncomfortable even after I told her I was positive. \n\nI am just barely started my day but I feel tired and am waiting for the sun to come up to gauge how I am really doing. Tomorrow will be day ten and I am hoping to keep improving so I can retest on Wednesday and maybe go back to work the following week.\n\nMonday 11/2/2020\n\nI still have no taste or smell, chest tightness and lose a lot of breath on exertion. And I think I am constipated. It’s been two days anything has come out of my bum lmao but that’s way better then the diarrhea was having. Today my friends, I get to do a Covid positive drive through voting with my husband. I really didn’t think I was going to be able to vote this year and by jolly I am so excited to be able to still. Tomorrow we are getting retested and I am hoping to find out on Friday where I am at. \n\nCovid is NOT like the flu for the majority of us and I for one am going to scream on the mountain tops what my symptoms were to show the world that young bodied people are just as susceptible. I am still going to be updated until I feel 100% and get my fucking senses back.",

Your brain has to delegate tasks much like a manager, and the more you focus on things like trying to determine when your smell will come back the more stressed you are going to become, and the more your brain is going to devote time to elevating cortisol levels instead of ensuring that your immune system is properly fighting the infection. Focus on relaxing, riding this out, and try to enjoy the time you have off as best as you can. Avoid stressors and try to catch yourself feeding your anxiety by focusing on something you enjoy, like a good book or a movie. Maybe use this time to learn to play an instrument or something. Just make sure you aren’t over stressing yourself and that you are truly focused on recovery. It will pass, and you will regain your smell. It may take some time, but it will come back. I caught it earlier this year and went through the same anxieties you’re describing for several weeks. About three weeks in, my smell came back as suddenly as it had left. Your body has to replace the sensory cells that covid affects, and they’re not cells that are replenished as quickly as a lot of them are in your body. The second time I dealt with covid was in June and it was much less severe. Know that you’re going to be okay, and don’t let your fear and stress escalate your symptoms and lengthen your recovery.",

    "body": "Hello everyone! I’m now a lurker-turned-TIFU-er, because I definitely screwed up last night!\n\n\nSo, I had a problem with a finger wart a while back (to the people who go rock climbing with uncovered finger warts, you suck!). It got huge and very unsightly, so I went and bought some Compound W wart remover. For those who don’t know, Compound W is highly concentrated salicylic acid (17%) and it smells like camphor. I bought the gel form that comes in a small tube because I didn’t like how runny the liquid form was. Thankfully, the stuff worked and the wart finally went away, but I still had a lot left in the tube so I put it in my drawer in case I had another wart come up.\n\n\nLast night, I was getting ready for bed and after I washed my face, and did my skin care routine including my facial serum. I have very bad eyesight (I cannot read anything further than about a foot in front of my eyes), so I wear glasses, and I take them off to wash my face (duh). When I squeezed the tube, the serum was stiffer than usual, but I wrote that off to it being cold inside my house, and the oils acting different. After I had put the serum on, it started to tingle a bit which is normal because it has a little bit of peppermint oil in it which gives a cooling sensation, but it smelled off. I was checking the bottom of the tube to see if it was expired, and then the tingle got worse, like my face and fingers were being pricked by needles all over! I turned the tube over and read it in horror... I had accidentally grabbed the Compound W tube instead of the facial serum tube, and now wart remover was starting to burn my face skin off!! \n\n\nI immediately tried to wash it off, which just made the burning turn from needles to feeling like my face was on fire. So I got into the shower (yes, in my pajamas) and blasted my face with cool water for several minutes. When I got out, my face was bright red with thankfully only few small splotches of white (that means the skin is starting die in those spots), but it hurt sooo bad! My eyes were watering so much that I had tears running down my face, and that just made my cheeks burn worse again! My nose was clogged up from the intense smell and starting to run. I blindly ran to my room absolutely soaking wet, grabbed my aloe vera gel out of my outdoor first-aid kit, and slathered it all over my poor face. And after that, I put on some moisturizer to try and get it calmed down more. It worked a little, but I didn’t get much sleep last night. \n\n\nToday it’s mostly fine. I have some small red patches including one on my nose that makes me look like a very sorry Rudolph (the red-nosed reindeer), and a couple spots where the skin peeled off (mostly where I had dead skin from old acne that was almost healed). My fingers are worse, since I kind of forgot about them and they didn’t get as much water from the shower as my face did. My face still hurts a little, but not as much as my pride. I went and put a big blue chunk of tape around the Compound W and have put it in a different drawer, because I never want to go through that again!\n\n\nSo there you have it sports fans! Lesson learned: don’t keep your wart remover next to your facial products! \n\n\nTL;DR: stupid me accidentally used wart removal gel instead of facial serum. My face felt like it caught fire, I took an unexpected fully-clothed shower trying to get the wart remover off, and it hurt like hell. Woke up today fine though, except for some of my skin coming off. 0/10 Would not recommend using wart remover as facial serum.",

For context.\n\n\n\nSorry for the alt account, but I don’t want the bad parts of this story to be traced back to me.\n\n\n\nThat is how the story found me, then a 27 year old female attorney, licensed in CA as well as another state, on a middle seat on a *VERY* last minute flight to Los Angeles. I didn’t even have a return ticket when I left. I think it’s called deadheading?\n\n\n\nYou see, I’m white, but close for decades with my immigrant best friend. When the closest thing I had to a sister, Sara, called me, sobbing and scared that the ban might come down on her parents when they returned from [redacted majority Muslim nation], because others from the same place had been, I went. My brother had a bunch of credit/miles that covered the thankfully short flight. Thanks, bro!\n\n\n\nSo, I found myself in a suit, only carrying my backpack and sweating and fidgeting, getting updates over text and inflight WiFi, looking for my seat. Time to put my degree to use- protect the good Mr. and Mrs. N, who were always kind to me and were and are surprisingly progressive. I hope they don’t mind that their lawyer’s gay. I hadn’t told them yet.\n\n\n\nExcept, I cannot *see* my seat. Yep, the short notice meant losing out on the boarding game. There is a blonde...blob, in very skimpy clothes, in both the aisle and window seats. Glistening with sweat and sharing a bag of chips. Armrests already up.\n\n\n\n*NOOOOOO!*\n\n\n\nI discreetly find a flight attendant, explain the situation. No go, I will have to wedge in, this is a full flight. They can maybe change me to one later in the day? But that won’t work. I *need* to be there when, or shortly after, the long haul flight Sara’s parents took lands. Who will protect them?\n\n\n\nSara’s going to owe me *so* much pizza (sans pork), for this, I think to myself. But, if you know, you know. Duty calls. This is the kind of thing I got my degree for!\n\n\n\n...just wish it involved less contact with sweaty flesh. Go to my row. “This is my seat, the middle.”\n\n\n\nBlob1: No! We were supposed to have the middle seat free! We do this a lot, and that seat was empty when I last checked.\n\n\n\nMe: I know, last minute flight, need to go to LA *right now* to help some people I know affected by the “Muslim ban.” Sorry.\n\n\n\nBlob2: Why do you even care?\n\n\n\nFlight attendant says it’s true, that is my seat! The Blobs grudgingly move over about an inch each. Somehow, I cram myself in, though their hips are so wide that I cannot sit back properly in the seat, or pull anything out of my bag to occupy myself.\n\n\n\nFML. Walls of flesh to either side. Sweaty flesh. Body odor, something that smelled like bleu cheese mixed with cheap perfume. Try to locate airsick bag and will myself not to throw up on my best and only suit. Remember Sara’s mom’s advice for dealing with smells. She’s worked in ER and with cadavers before.\n\n\n\n*Thanks, Dr. N*.\n\n\n\nFrantically dig in my Backpack of Holding, with complaints from the Blobs coming in stereo. At last! Buried treasure! Found it!\n\n\nTiny bottle (TSA approved! Under 3.5 ounces!) of peppermint oil. It overwhelms the nose, so you can’t smell anything else. Put some under my nose. It *burns*, but it’s better than the smell!\n\n\n\nFeign deafness the rest of the flight, ignoring Blobs 1 and 2 and getting updates from Sara. *Shit. Shitshitshit*.\n\n\n\nThe long haul flight from [redacted] got in as my plane made the final descent. By the time I’m on the ground, I hear someone took the Ns for screening, then radio silence. I cried a bit while waiting to finally exit the plane and the Blobs, then tried to keep my shit together. Oh yeah, and the Blobs thought I was crying about being squeezed, to make others feel bad for me and so they would look mean.\n\n\n\nThe best I can say about that day is, with the help of other airport lawyers I met at LAX, that I got the Ns out of CBP custody. And the flight wasn’t cross country.",

Apparently cinnamon was supposed to do the same...it just made a huge mess.\n\nI don't mind them coming out and going to the traps...what I mind is finding them crawling all over my stuff and myself! I've probably squished 100 today at least. I kill the ones that explore...and try not to kill them to close to the traps so the others don't get spooked.\n\nHow do I confine them to one area?\n\nI also don't want to pay a pest company...because these things show up every year...I'm not going to pay every year...I simply don't have that kind of money.",

Before i was officially diagnosed, I had such consistent and painful stomach aches that I basically developed an eating disorder and stopped eating for a year because everything made my stomach hurt. I lost over 30lbs because I dreaded eating because of the pain I knew would follow. That was years ago and I consider myself much more of a healthier person now (i workout consistently, avoid junk food and unhealthy foods, the very few foods that I do eat that don't upset my stomach are pretty healthy and nutrient dense) but none of that matters because this disease still plagues my life every day. I live in a college dorm and it's literally embarrassing having to constantly run to the bathroom and stay there for so long, or the impending fear that i'll miss an exam because of a stomach ache, or not being able to enjoy going out to dinner because my stomach will start hurting immediately after I leave a restaurant. My stomach literally hates me and I've tried EVERYTHING. Now it's Ramadan and I don't even think I'll be able to fast because of the consistent pain Ive been in and it's only getting worse--i discovered peppermint oil pills from this subreddit a few months ago and for a while they became my holy grail. Now they don't even work either. No one really understands how it feels to constantly be in pain, and by constantly I quite literally mean EVERY single day. I had to completely cut so many of the foods i absolutely loved, forcing me to have the diet of a toddler. Not to mention im in the gym 5x a week and its pretty difficult to reach your protein or calorie goals when everything you eat makes you feel like shit. And don't get me started on the pain that ensues once you actually make it to the toilet. Its the most bone crippling, uncomfortable pain ever. I feel like i can't live a normal life or enjoy anything and my \"relationship\" with food is HORRIBLE all because of this stupid illness. \n\n",

I went through the same thing at your age, but back then, we didn’t have the internet to find support. So, kudos to you for reaching out!\n\nI’m also hitting the gym and eating healthy, yet still trying to figure out what’s going on with my IBS. Like many of you, I’m constantly researching and learning how to help myself. This subreddit has been a game-changer for me. The experts and resources here have opened up so many new pathways and given me hope.\n\nI used to think I just had to accept this as my life, but I kept wondering if there was something more I could do. You’re on the right track, even if it doesn’t feel like it right now!\n\nRecently, I learned about a supplement called “Betaine HCL & Pepsin” from this sub, which helped me understand my constipation issues due to low stomach acid. This community also introduced me to the FODMAP diet. I found a site called Diet Vs Disease, which offers webinars and personal consultations, although it’s quite pricey. I couldn’t afford the full program, but I’ve been on a FODMAP diet since Sunday, and I’m symptom-free!\n\nI’m learning that the FODMAP diet is meant to be short-term and that reintroducing foods slowly helps identify triggers. Below are some links and resources I’ve found helpful on my journey. I hope they can help anyone interested. I’d love to give back to this amazing community! 🙏♥️🌺\n\n- [Diet vs Disease](https://www.dietvsdisease.org/food-and-nutrients/)\n\n- [Spoonful App](https://spoonfulapp.com)\n\n- [Monash FODMAP](https://\nwww.monashfodmap.com)\n\n- [FODMAP Everyday](https://www.fodmapeveryday.com)\n\n\nBest wishes to you OP and take care, everyone!",

This summer I started noticing a couple tiny ones in my bath tub. Called the exterminator, haven’t noticed one for a couple months. \n\nLast night I go to take a shower and lo and behold. A baby roach. Quickly kill it, move on. Tonight i noticed the tiniest of baby roaches in my bedroom doorway while vacuuming. It’s the first time I’ve ever noticed them outside of the bathroom. \n\n\nThey clearly live in the neighborhood and are determined to be inside my home. I heard something like 80% of LA residences have roaches. What are some practical (or impractical) things you’ve done to keep them out of your home, or at least keep it from becoming a bigger problem?\n\n\nEdit: \nSo in the morning, per everyone’s advice, I’ll be purchasing sealant, diatomaceous earth, advion, soybean oil and peppermint oil. Going to sprinkle the DT, oil, and advion in the big cracks then seal them up. Not in my house! \n\nThanks to everyone who has shared their methods. If there’s anything else I should do, let me know!\n\nEdit 2: lots of people have recommended boric acid, so I’ll be getting that too!",

A little old lady lived there and he didn’t notice a single roach! The secret? Boric Acid mixed with sweetened condensed milk. Mix until it’s dough-like. Stick small balls in places where kids and animals cannot reach. The roaches take it back to their nests and it destroys them all. I grew up in a very old home and I can only recall roaches once - my dad did this trick and I never saw another for about 7 years!\n\nCheap and extremely effective. :)\n\nEdited for spelling it “sweet & condensed”. Hey I thought it was funny!\n\na few more edits: Thanks for the precious metals guys!\n\nI’m reading a ton of folks say it works on ants too! Score! Also, yes you can sprinkle the boric acid (some are saying borax works too), on the floor but I like the balls because there’s no dealing with a dust layer. To hide them, drop them behind a refrigerator, in a hole under the sink, above a kitchen cabinet. Is it toxic to kids/pets - I was assuming so - many say no, but I’d rather just keep them up and away and not have to find out! Don’t need any diarrhea or vomiting in my life at the moment. I have no idea why it works for years, but I’m guessing it’s because roaches feed on each other when they die so the dead ones become poison to the living ones, so the ratio of dead ones continues to increase!\"",

Get some weather stripping for all your doors that lead outside. They have ones that you can cut to size and will stick on. They won’t last forever but they’ll last awhile. You could also get some you drill in, or you can put in a whole threshold if you’re up for it.  \n4. Be militant with food garbage. It sounds like your issues are in the bathroom so this doesn’t help as much, but don’t leave any food out. Take out the trash often if there’s food in it. \n5. Spray some Ortho home defense. It doesn’t work as well as getting a pro but you just have to do it more often, like once a month. Spray outside your door too and around any openings. \n6. You could probably find an exterminator company that will give you a good(ish) price on a regular service. You’ll just have to shop around a bit and maybe find someone independent. It sucks to spend money on it but if its really bothering you it may be worth the expense. \n\nSo basically cover all openings where they might get in, remove all food they might want, and spray something to deter or kill the ones that still make it in.",

    "body": "Long time lurker, first time posting. Obligatory apology for formatting, as I'm on mobile, but I had to post this immediately. TLDR at the bottom.\n\nSo this just happened today - I was at work, a Barista in a popular coffee chain. The location of our store means we get a good mix of both regulars and once off customers. We also get, in the nicest way possible, some quirky characters. Customers who tell you their life story while waiting for their espresso, customers who come in every day for months and never even manage a hello - after years in the service industry I've learned to just go with it.\n\nSo in walks our insane parent - a mother in her middle to late 20's and I immediately know her type. Trail mix loving, first time helicopter mom who shudders at the thought of gluten and categorises her child misbehaving as \"self expression\". However the kid is just a baby, probably around eight or nine months, so I think nothing of it. She orders her drink and gives polite conversation as I make it - until we reach THIS exchange.\n\nInsane Mother - I.M\n Me - M\n\nI.M: \"This little one has been poorly lately, hopefully a coffee might pick me up! We haven't been sleeping good.\"\n\nM: \"Oh poor thing, just a cold or something?\"\n\nI.M: \"I'm not sure yet. I believe in alternative medicine, so I'm bringing her to my healer tonight as I don't want to risk the doctor. I think it's conjunctivitis\" \n\nNow at this point I'm doing an eternal eye roll that this lady has a sick infant whom she hasn't gotten checked out but I bite my tongue. My little brother used to get conjunctivitis all the time when he was a baby, so I consider myself a bit of an expert, so I lean over the counter and look into the pram.\n\nM: \"My little brother used to get it a lot, he was probably around the same age as your little one, have you been doing anything to treat it?\"\n\nAt this point I notice the child does in fact, have conjunctivitis, not only that but the eye looks extremely irritated and swollen, more so than it usually would.\n\nI.M: \"We've been doing some meditation around her, we were hoping that if we make the environment around her calm it will strengthen her immune system and encourage her body to fight the infection. Oh and I've been putting tea tree and peppermint oil into it, and herbs\"\n\nMe: \".........wait what? Tea tree? Peppermint? Herbs? Into her eye?\"\n \nI.M: \"Yeah! They've got great hygiene and healing properties. We wash the eye out with the oils a couple of times a day. My friend sells them on Facebook and the company is vegan and eco friendly, and she recommended them for my baby. Then for the herbs, I just take a small bowl to our garden, and dig up mostly the roots, and let them sit on her eye for around an hour to pull out the infection\"\n\nAt this point I'm kind of gobsmacked, not only is she rubbing raw, undiluted tea tree and peppermint oil into her baby's eye, the oil is from a fucking M.L.M- and \"herbs\"? I can't even process that one. I can feel myself getting angry - just completely at this woman's stupidity, thinking of how uncomfortable and painful this must be for the little one, and the fact that she doesn't even know half the stuff in the oils she's been using. However, I'm extremely bad with confrontation, so I'm struggling to remain polite and hide my horror. Maybe I wasn't hiding it well, as she kind of narrowed her eyes at me at this point.\n\nMe: \"You can't put undiluted tea tree into your baby's eye? That stuff is super potent, it makes my eyes water if there's a bottle just open near me. What do you mean herbs? As in unwashed? What if you get dirt and soil in her eyes?\"\n\nI.M: \"Well what you suggest? Pharmaceuticals? Do you know what's in those? I could never give anything like that to my baby - everything I use is natural. The soils and herbs draw out the infection, the oils treat it\"\n\nMe: \"Don't you realise how painful that must be for her? It's like putting vinegar in a cut? Doesn't she cry?\"\n\nI.M: *completely deadpan and matter of fact* \"She cries because it's the infection leaving her body\"\n\nMe: \"Are you serious? Listen, she's your baby and I get that and you'll care for her how you see fit but she has conjunctivitis, so she's probably already experiencing some level of discomfort, putting potent oils, which frankly you don't know what are in those either, into her eyes? She's crying in pain are you joking? You're literally putting dirt in your baby's eyes what do you mean?!\" \n\nAt this point, she becomes pretty irate, and begins raising her voice.\n\nI.M: \"How dare you tell me I am hurting my baby. I would never hurt my baby, how dare you!\"\n\nMe: \"Listen, I'm not trying to say that I'm really not, but her eye genuinely looks quite serious and what your doing clearly isn't working, in fact it's probably made it worse, she's a baby her crying is telling you that, the fact is you could really do some serious damage if you haven't already and you're not a bad parent of course I'm not saying that it's just misinformation when clearly this child needs to see a medical professional\"\n\nI.M: \"I know exactly what I'm doing and I don't need some minimum wage glorified waitress to tell me how to care for my baby, haven't you ever heard of my blog? *Insert name of blog*?\" \n\nMe: \"eh what? Blog? What has a blog got to do with anything?\"\n\nI.M: \"Ha! Well, I saved my husband's life, all completely through the pure healing properties of alternative medicine. He had cologne cancer, and through meditation, prayer, and enemas using the oils you claim to know so much about, he's completely in remission and better than ever. You've obviously been spoon fed a dialogue and you ate it right up - so I can, and will, completely heal my daughter the same way and you better believe I am going to publicize how you have treated me and my daughter today\" \n\nAt this point my manager stepped in - he hadn't seen the full exchange and evidently just thought I was arguing with a difficult customer. I genuinely stood open mouthed completely bewildered by the exchange for a few seconds before he growled at me to go into the office and collect myself. I wish I could give a crazy ending, like a bar fight between me and the mother ensued, or I rang the police and immediately had the child removed or something but I didn't. I stayed in the office for a few minutes still shocked about the conversation that had taken place, feeling sad and confused about whether I had some sort of responsibility to the child. Maybe I'm being dramatic, but I wasn't sure. My manager served the woman and when I told him of our conversation he said it wasn't our business, and maybe he's right.\n\nI did however, look at her blog. It was even crazier than she was in real life. For those curious, the blog contridicted what she had told me - her husband had only actually had a cancer scare, he had never actually been diagnosed with it, she just decided to credit the oils. Although that's a whole different story, tea tree and peppermint enemas? I shudder to think of how that mans asshole felt.\n\nTLDR: Crazy mothers kid had conjunctivitis, so she rubbed dirt and oil in it, called me brainwashed when I questioned it.\n\n",

    "body": "# Tl;dr: What’s new this year?:\n\n## Super Mixed Parfait\n\nThe Super Mixed Parfait was a new food item introduced with Super Adveture box in 2021 - the recipe cost is 8 Bauble Bubbles + 50s and can be acquired in LA https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Recipe:_Super_Mixed_Parfait\n\n## Community Service Tips\n\nThis bonus can be acquired for 1050 Karma for 1 hour by completing a heart in New Kaineng City and purchasing the effect\n\n# Overview\n\nKarma is the focus of the Wintersday Festival, it can be grinded endlessly if that is your thing, but if you prefer to spend ~30 minutes or less per day, you can do these quick activities for faster Karma.\n\nBuffs are required to maximize your Karma gain.  Below is a list you can acquire to increase your karma gain.  A similar list is on the Wiki: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Karma\n\nI’ve included the feasible acquisition methods for each boost - if more details are needed, please consult the wiki link above for more information.  For optional buffs, they are only really worth it if they happen to be convenient for your run or you really want to squeeze out the extra karma.\n\n# Karma Buffs:\n* 50% Karma Bonus\n  - Booster (level 28 level up reward / extra life booster / gemstore)\n  - Candy Corn Gobbler (gemstore item)\n  - Bonfire (map hop to look for one / gemstore / 7x black lion statuettes)\n* 15% Guild Karma and Experience Banner (NOT Karma banner)\n  - Guild Commendations\n  - Heroes banner\n* 10% Guild Tavern Karma Bonus\n  - Higher guild levels give better bonuses for this\n* 10% Spirit Banner\n  - 25 Spirit Shards (or try to find one)\n* 15% Karmic Enrichment\n  - Laurels, equip on an ascended amulet\n* 10% Wintersday Utility\n  - Craft or buy from TP\n    - Tuning Icicle\n    - Peppermint Oil\n    - Tin of Fruitcake\n    - Super Mixed Parfait** / Wintersday Food / Birthday Blaster (options below, these do NOT stack)\n* 10-15% Food\n  - 15% karma (largest) - Super Mixed Parfait (TP or recipe to craft, costs 8 Bauble Bubbles)\n  - 10% Buy from TP (or use a 2/9 year old character for cake option)\n  - 10% Any ascended food\n* 10% Candy Cane (30x, stacks 1 minute buff up to 30)\n  - Open WD Gifts or buy from TP\n* 10% Winter’s Blessing\n  - Obtained from completing the orphan donation daily achievement (15 orphans donated)\n* (optional) 10% Community Service Tips\n  - Completing a heart in New Kaineng City & purchased for 1050 Karma\n* (optional) 10% Crowd-Favorite Racer\n  - Completing a race in the map\n* (optional) 5% Volunteer’s Blessing\n  - Don’t bother unless it comes up conveniently; this will remove Crowd-Favorite Racer if active\n\n\n## BUFF WARNING:\n\nAll activity instances are PvP instances, this means the amulet enrichment will not work and that any food/utility must be consumed BEFORE entering the instance.  Candy Cane, notably, is not restricted in the same way.  However, if you save your chests with the daily 5k karma each until you are out of the instance, your amulet will apply its bonus.\n\n\n# Activities:\n\nAll Wintersday activities provide 5k karma as a base amount before modifiers are applied for the first three rounds of that activity per day on top of the 1k base karma.  \n\nThis means that with 0 achievement points using all of the boosts (ignoring optional boosts), at +145% karma a player can get 12.25k Karma per round per day, or for the two fast activities 3 times each; 73.5k Karma per day.\n\nThe fast activities are the Wintersday Jumping Puzzle (Winter Wonderland) and the Bell Choir Ensemble. Completing the Jumping Puzzle 3 times (right path is the easiest path) and 3 songs of Bell Choir, you can easily make the most of your boosters in just a few minutes (about 15 between each activity assuming no mistakes).\n\nNote: The 5k base karma is looted from the daily bouncy chests as they are earned.  It is best to save these bouncy chests until you are out of the instance so that the boost from your amulet can be applied as well.  \n\n**P.S. Any bouncy chests over 4 are auto-looted when changing maps/characters, so be mindful of this when saving these chests.**\n\n\n\n# Orphans:\n\nOrphans are the bread and butter of Karma farming in Wintersday.  You will be donating Wrapped Gifts to the Orphans throughout Divinity’s Reach.  These cost 504 karma + items to create.  A list can be found on the Wiki: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Wrapped_Gift (if you don’t want to spend the gold per day and don’t have the wrappable items on hand, you can spend another 504 karma per gift)\n\nOrphan base karma is 1500 per package - with the boosts allowing up to 3675 Karma per Orphan assuming 0 achievement points & the recommended boosts.  Considering the Karma cost of the Roll of Wrapping Paper + Karma cost of a toy weapon:\n\nBase gains for Karma:\nNet gain (1008 Karma spent per gift): 2667 Karma\nNet gain (504 Karma spent per gift): 3171 Karma \n\nSo for 30 gifts delivered with all recommended buffs, you will gain:\nTotal (1008 Karma spent per gift): 80.010 Karma\nTotal (504 Karma spent per gift): 95.130 Karma\n\nThe wiki has both an image of all orphan locations, descriptions of the locations, and an interactive “map comp” style route to each orphan: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Orphan\n\nThere are also pathing routes for Taco/BlishHud available to use if you use those overlays that can give efficient routing/mount usage for visiting all 30 Orphans.\n\n\n# Optimizing:\n\nPersonally, I recommend having either 1 or 2 characters dedicated to this due to the scarce nature of some of the buffs (Winter’s Blessing / 50% Karma Boost) because they do not expire while not logged in on the character.  This can allow for spreading a scarce booster across multiple days.\n\nOrphan Character (2 character method):  This character is meant to run Orphans only. This character should be stocked up with Wrapped Gifts for multiple days to be optimal since it will make use of the scarce buffs.  The goal is to spend as little time donating to orphans as possible so that your buffs last as many days as possible, and you can use the number of wrapped gifts left in your inventory as a counter for how many you have left.  Doing this you can use less of the scarce boosters overall (and some may not use scarce ones on the activities at all).\n\nOtherwise if using only a single character, your main goal is to have dedicated time to crank out the 6 rounds (3 JP, 3 Bell) and 30 orphans as fast as you can. And then log off of the character to allow the buffs to keep going for follow-up runs.\n\nWhen all is said and done, if you have 0% Karma gain on your account but have all of the boosts, you will be able to net-gain of 153.510 (168.630) Karma per day.\n\n\n# Post-Note\n\nThere are other activities such as Infinirarium, Freezy Strike, Snowball Mayhem, and Toypocalypse.  These buffs apply to those as well - however this guide was originally written with a quick 30-minute-or-less solo-effort in mind.  Check other guides for more info on the other activities to learn more!\n\n# Cheat Sheet:\n\nBuff List:\n\n* Karma Boost\n* Guild Karma Boost\n* Guild Karma & Experience / Heroes Banner\n* Spirit Banner\n* Candy Cane (up to 30)\n* Winter’s Blessing\n* Ascended Amulet Karmic Enrichment\n* Food\n* Utility\n* Race (optional)\n* Volunteers Blessing (optional & obnoxious)\n* Community Service Tips (optional, requires EoD + completing a heart each day-per-character you need to re-up the buff)\n\nJumping Puzzle:\n\n* Easy: Right path\n* Medium: Middle path\n* Hard: Left path\n\nOrphan Locations: \n\nhttps://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Orphan#/media/File%3AOrphans_map.jpg",

I eat about 1,000 calories per day.\n****\n\n**BACKSTORY:** \n\nFor the last 2 years I have been bed ridden with a mystery illness.  I saw a dozen doctors in different fields, got second opinions, got MRIs from head to hips, and had so much bloodwork done that the lab people know me personally.  Not a single doctor could find a thing wrong with me on paper. My basic symptoms were excruciating pain in my bones, and extreme weakness. Medications didnt help much with the pain and I got so weak that even speaking to someone for 1-2 minutes exhausted me to the point that I would feel like I was drunk (slurring, confusion, physically disoriented).  Its a long story but on February 2, 2021, I figured out on my own that I was being poisoned by the aluminum in my Secret - Clinical Strength Deodorant. I immediately stopped using deodorant with aluminum in, it and I am VERY slowly getting better.  Last week I took 400 steps in one go, which I hadn't been able to do for 18 months.  Again progress is so slow its barely noticeable, but progress is progress. \n****\n\n**PROBLEM:**\n\n\nI have tried several aluminum free deodorants since the beginning of February, and they dont work at all.  Not even a little.  I stink 5 minutes after putting it on.  Ive tried Native, Crystal and Kopari. I am currently trying to see if rubbing peppermint oil on my armpits will help. Not sure if its bad for me but it seems to work better than anything else so far. I have tried tea tree oil too but it reeks so bad nobody wants to come near me. I have tried exfoliation too but it does nothing.  Everything online says it can take up to a month for the body to adjust to aluminum free deodorants.  But its been 3 months, and I am still as stinky as ever. \n****\n\n**OBSTACLES:**\n\n\nI am very over weight. In the past I never weighed over 150lbs, even when I was pregnant. But being bed ridden for 2 years has wreaked havoc on my body. I am sure if I could loose the weight it would help. But its impossible to do since I cant exercise yet (unless I want to be bed ridden for 3 days just for doing a minor exercise, believe me I tried). So loosing weight is not an option yet\n\nMeds arent helping with my stench, I am sure. I have noticed that even my urine smells foul since starting the meds at the beginning of my illness in 2019\n****\n\n\n**PS:** I am open to telling the story of how I discovered I had hyperaluminemia if you wish, but its a very long story\n****\n\n**FOR FUN: The study that helped me confirm I had hyperaluminemia**\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/8100764_Hyperaluminemia_in_a_woman_using_an_aluminum-containing_antiperspirant_for_4_years\n\n*\"After experiencing bone pain and extreme fatigue without other obvious explanation, she was evaluated in detail\"*\n****",

Just put the toner in a small spray bottle and spray away. \n\nI’m someone who used to use regular deodorant and smelled terrible.

I have always been insecure about smelling especially now that I’m working out 5 days a week, but honest to god I have little or no smell after 10 hours of wear.

Don’t use a body wash or things with excess added fragrance, just regular soap. I’m a fan of the dove bars for sensitive skin.

I also have tried and had success with a benzoyl peroxide wash under the armpits in the shower, but you’ve got to let it sit for a few minutes! I wouldn’t recommend the Clean & Clear, try Panoxyl or Oxy brand. I imagine the glycolic acid and alcohol and anti-bacterial soap a few other comments suggest will have the same effect: they all reduce the bacterial burden of your armpits. I hope one of these works for you!\n\nAlso, try just using the Stridex (or other exfoliatant/anti-bacterial product) and skipping the aluminum deodorant. Then add it back if necessary. With some products, I found that using deodorant actually made me smell less fresh than using the exfoliant, alone! It was like they were mixing together and cancelling each other out, lol so ymmv.\n\nI’ve also heard that hypochlorous spray has a similar anti-bacterial effect, that might be good for a midday touch-up if you find that you need it. I’ve ordered some on Amazon but haven’t tried it yet. I’m planning to use it post-workouts\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/SkinSmart-Cleanser-Bacteria-Athletes-Multiple/dp/B07VRFC3Y7/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=hypochlorous+spray&qid=1620060375&sr=8-3\n\nhttps://www.walgreens.com/store/c/walgreens-hypochlorous-cleansing-spray/ID=300413877-product?ext=gooKBM_PLA+-+Medicines+%26+Treatments+(2019+Update)Medicines+%26+Treatments__pla_with_promotion_online&gclsrc=aw.ds&&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIwpjq_fqt8AIVEuTICh2wLwf5EAQYASABEgLYsPD_BwE\n\nFinally, a friend of mine is trying the liquid chlorophyll right now. She bought it on Amazon, adds a bit to her drinking water each day.

    "body": "Yesterday, I had some errands to run. I got showered and ready to go, and as I breezed out the front door, I noticed some splotches on my screen door. Upon closer inspection, there were about 5 different clusters of baby spiders. We're talking thousands of them, in squirmy little bundles. I suppose a lady spider or two deposited several sacs on the screen door and they went unchecked.\n\nIt's worth noting here that I was an arachnophobe for many years, and I have clinical OCD. When I was a teenager, I once got sick from inhaling insecticide I'd sprayed all over my mattress, blankets and carpets--so it was that intense and irrational. So when I saw the hordes of impossibly tiny spiders all over my screen door, I felt absurdly pleased that I didn't lose my shit. Triumphant, even. I foolishly thought they'd move on in their own time, and that it was no big deal.\n\nLast night, we had a tremendous storm. Naturally, all the baby spoods needed to find shelter somewhere, and the poorly-insulated front door of my aging house allowed plenty of entrance cracks. \n\nI awoke this morning to legions of baby spiders clustered all over the frosted glass panel beside my front door--on the inside. What I first thought to be 30-50 spiders was actually hundreds of them. This spider fiesta had to go, lest my home and my exotic pets be overtaken with them. \n\nI looked online for homemade spider repellent recipes I could make in a pinch, and the easiest solution seemed to be a spray bottle filled with dish soap, water and peppermint oil. Unfortunately, I have a cat, and peppermint oil is incredibly toxic to cats (if you didn't know, now you do, exercise caution). I secured her in her litterbox room with some food and toys and set about the grim business of committing spider genocide.\n\nAs soon as I started spraying the mixture indoors, the spiders were dead in their tracks. There was very little struggle, if any. However, the spiders outside of my home, still attached to the door, sensed impending doom. I cautiously opened the front door, spray bottle in hand, but I wasn't fast enough.\n\nClusters of spiders DISPERSED on individual silk strands blasted from their butts, and before I knew it, a virtual cloud of eight-legged babies had flown onto my body. It was as though they knew death was imminent, and they planned to go out in a blaze of glory. \n\nI didn't know baby spiders could bite, but judging by the looks of my arms and legs, I suppose they can.\n\nI set about frantically pinching and smushing the cretins and found my reflexes insufficient to get them all. As a last resort, I coated myself in the peppermint mixture. The menthol hit my skin and lit up little cuts and blemishes previously unaware to me, along with the new bites. My minty discomfort was intense. But at last, the spiders had met their end, and I reigned victorious. \n\nI had to hose down the outer doors, thoroughly wash the inside entryway, and then decontaminate myself in the shower before it was safe to let my cat out. The whole ordeal lasted just over an hour, but it felt like a century. I'm not yet sure how many made their way into the basement. I suppose time will tell. Brrr.\n\nTL;DR: One or more spiders laid eggs on my screen door, eggs hatched and spiders made their way indoors. The extermination was fast, vigorous, and my body has paid a price.",

I didn't have my first sit of soda until I was 13.  I got grounded and screamed at for buying gum that had aspartame in it.  She ate 500 calories a day to slim down for my wedding.  For a long time she used to take all our Halloween candy (Halloween is fucking cold here.  We went out in -20c/-4f a lot to get that candy) and she traded us for no chocolate bars sweetened with something that was like a laxative if you are more than one.  Took shots of pond scum because it's healthy?  You get the point\n\nYeah so nuts.  She was also big on oils.  I carried peppermint oil a lot during that time of the month because I'm apparently an old lady and got hot flashes.  Said hot flashes would make the cramps so bad I'd be screaming and curled in a ball.  But I want allowed to miss school 🙄.\n\nSo two years ago she was taking me to a mineral pool.  I had terrible stomach issues after food poisoning and a couple of bites of food would fill me up.  I also have a chronic pain issue in my hip that was also going on then (minds l mineral soak to 'heal' it) and I let her know that.  She said she would bring peppermint tea to settle my stomach.  Ugh ok whatever.  \n\nI don't love peppermint because I burp it up constantly and when I breath it's just cold.  I sipped it though.  It was strong and hard to get down.\n\nTurns out not only was it peppermint tea but she put peppermint oil in there!  It felt like I was breathing ice in and out.  Not only that I'm pretty sure that's fucking dangerous Ohnatural!\n\nUgh.",

I have pain all the time, controlled by meds but that time of the month thing seems to completely send it spiralling, I'm talking being unable to move on waking up in the morning, pain flaring just getting out of bed etc.  I hope your hip gets better soon though.  Any injury to that area tends to be worse simply because you have to use it to get around, same with a knee or ankle injury so healing can be slower.  That said, I do hope you get better soon, and if a replacement is necessary, the things they use today are apparently really good (my dad has had two knee replacements in the past two years and he's walking around fine - the second replacement was only a few months before my sister's wedding and he walked her down the aisle on his own two feet, not a stick or crutch in sight).\n\nWith regard to the \"natural\" thing and her seeming peppermint obsession, I can't say that I love peppermint, I tend to go for ginger and lemon more, but it apparently can help if taken correctly.  Ohnatural sounds like she's a garden variety nut trying to seem like she knows what she's doing but it sounds like she doesn't.  I generally don't take supplements as I don't want any interactions with the meds I'm on but if you go for the medically tested ones they're usually safe if taken as directed.  Dumping undiluted essential oil into someone's tea though, that could have been dangerous, I'm glad that you didn't suffer any major ill effects from it.\n\nHere's hoping things go well for you and Ohnatural doesn't screw things up too much.",

    "body": " Hi all, Today I will share with you some of the best natural and effective things that you can for hair loss. I did face a lot of hair loss and I did manage to reverse my condition to a large extent.\n\nNow let me first tell a bit about the FDA approved medicines for hair loss which are minoxidil and finasteride. These medicines do work but comes with a number of side effects for many people, so I generally advise people to stay clear of these medicines and only use them as a last resort option.\n\nTo better understand the best treatment for hair loss one must first understand the common reasons behind it which are genetic, nutritional, stress, medication or excessive styling related in most cases. Genetic and hereditary hair loss may be difficult to treat but other types of hair loss can easily be taken care of by paying attention to diet, reducing stress and applying less problem causing agents to the scalp.\n\nNow let me tell you the natural things that I used to regrow my hair after doing all the things that I mentioned above.\n\nPumpkin seed oil - This is the first product natural product I would recommend to any male or female who is suffereing from hair loss. Pumpkin seed oil contains phytosterols which could block enzymes and hormones in your scalp that cause hair loss. There are studies that taking pumpkin seed oil as an oral supplement caused 40 more hair growth in people than the placebo group. But i still decided to use it in topical form since I also read a mice study which says that it works well in topical form too. Take 5–6 drop and mix it with the other oil that I will mention and massage it at night.\n\nPeppermint oil - This is an absolute favourite product of mine and I would like to say use it with caution and always dilute it before using as it is very powerful. I started using this product based on a rat study in which rats were divided into 4 gropus and one group were applied saline water, one group was applied jojoba oil, one was applied minoxidil ans the last were applied peppermint oil. All the rats were examined after 4 weeks and in this study it was noted that peppermint oil group rats showed comparable or even better results than the minoxidil group rats. Now many people may not like the fragrance of pumpkin seed oil and by mixing it with peppermint there is only the fragrance of menthol that remains and it cools the head like no other.\n\nGood DHT controlling shampoo - There are many good DHT controlling shampoos in the market. I would suggest you to look for ingredients like saw palmetto, nettle leaf extract as they are natural DHT blockers.\n\nMoringa - Moringa is a nutritional powerhouse which has a ton of health benefits including protecting and nourishing skin and hair. It is said to contain a whooping 92 nutrients and 46 antioxidants which beside being good for hair also contributes towards heart health, bone health, high blood pressure, stomach problems etc. But people with low blood pressure should avoid this as this has the potential to lower the bp further. You can buy himalaya shigru tablets they contain moringa or use organic india moringa leaf powder or any other which you may find helpful.\n\nI hope it helps someone.",

    "body": "TL;DR To help alleviate symptoms of [IBS](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/irritable-bowel-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20360016), find and avoid your trigger foods, don’t overeat or drink (everything in moderation), and stick to the same general (bland-ish) diet every day. Skip the Metamucil and Miralax for magnesium (oxide) supplements instead and find your daily “go time” and stick to it. Avoid tight clothes around your stomach (let her *breeeeeeathe*).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI’ve suffered (with a capital *S*) from **IBS-C** since I was 16 - irregular and infrequent BMs, bloating, abdominal pain, etc. I am now 27 and although this debilitating disorder ebbs and flows, I have generally figured out how to control this grossly under-researched *disease*. Because, according to many doctors, that’s what it is.\n\nThis information may make it seem like I’m some saint who never drinks too much or raids the candy drawer when I know I shouldn’t. I’m human, and sugar is *deliciousssss*. All this to say, I hope these methods help you and to give yourself grace when the holidays come around and you drink one-too-many ‘nogs and have an enormous stomachache afterward. Sometimes, yes pain, but also, a delicious gain.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE:** This is what I've found useful, but everyone is different! Things that work for some may not work for others. I am by no means an expert (of anything) and can only provide my own experience.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**DISCOVERING YOUR TRIGGER FOODS:**\nGIs suggest eliminating one food or drink from your regular diet for at least a few months to measure your gastrointestinal reaction to that particular item. If you have the time and patience, which I did not, go for it! What I did was try to eat the (relatively) same diet for a few weeks. If any meal/snack/drink felt like it caused GI distress afterward, I switched to something else to see if that worked better. From what I've learned, if it's \"bland,\" then the likelihood of upsetting my stomach is much lower. My mom always references the BRAT (Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, Toast) Diet when I'm complaining about IBS (...yet again. Sorry, Mom!). Although not sustainable, the idea is to give the gut a chance to rest; these foods are as bland as they come. So if you get a gnarly stomachache after scarfing down some pigs in a blanket, then feel that same suffering the next week after plowing through some hot wings, it may be time to reevaluate your relationship with fried foods. Sad to say, but for me, it was almost always a High-[FODMAP](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/fodmap-diet-what-you-need-to-know) food that caused the most distress (French fries included :/).\n\nOnce you figure out what’s causing you unnecessary pain, see if you’re able to continue to enjoy it in moderation, or more depressingly, have to eliminate it altogether.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**MY TRIGGERS:**\n\n- Alcohol\n- Carbonated drinks\n- Raw spinach\n- Grapes\n- Apples\n- Bananas\n- Nuts\n- Beans\n- Chocolate\n- (Too much) Dairy\n- (Too much) Sugar\n- Fried foods\n- Highly-processed foods\n- Artificial sweeteners\n- PEANUT BUTTER :’(\n\n… basically everything delicious (and some, nutritious!).\n\nI have found that even if you’re trying to eat healthily, it doesn’t always agree with your gut. For the longest time, I was having spinach salads for lunch, and even if I felt lean and green, my tummy was saying “Please stop, you queen.”\n\nI can eat all of the foods listed above in moderation besides apples and peanut butter – the most delectable snack combo invented. And BANANAS. If bananas are recommended for people recovering from diarrhea, why would I eat them? The goal is *to* go, not to *not* go. Makes logical sense to me.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**MY BLAND-ISH DIET:** I try to eat the same basic (bland-ish) foods every day, and (try not to) overeat. To expedite my “go time,” see below, I start with a fiber-filled, not-so-exciting **breakfast**:\n\n- Cheerios\n- Lactose-free or soy milk\n- 1 cup of coffee\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- For **lunch**, I have a turkey and cheese sandwich on gluten-free oat bread.\n\n- For **snacks**, I stick to Kind Oats & Honey granola bars (they’re less processed and don’t include peanut butter or chocolate, two of my trigger foods), tangerines, blueberries, mozzarella cheese, and gluten-free tortilla chips.\n\n- For **dinner**, I switch it up but make sure to keep the portions moderately small and avoid fried, greasy, or spicy foods. I know, lame. I usually have a protein, veggie, and starch.\n\nWith everything, overeating and drinking is the *killer*. If I indulge too much, my system will be out of whack for days to follow. Just know, if you’re feeling gluttonous, you’ll need to give yourself some time to recover. And that’s okay, we all do it!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**MAGNESIUM SUPPLEMENTS >>>>>:** I have IBS-C, so those of you with IBS-D will probably not benefit from this section.\n\nMy bowel movement schedule looked like this: 4-5 days of no BM, followed by diarrhea, and then the pattern repeated.\n\nI tried it all: Metamucil, Dulcolax, Benefiber, Senokot, castor oil (ew, btw). I was even stirring Miralax *into my coffee* for a time. Because some are bulk-forming laxatives or are taken with lots of water, they blew me up like a balloon. They made me insanely uncomfortable, adding insult to injury, with minimal effects. Then I discovered [magnesium supplements](https://www.target.com/p/magnesium-dietary-supplement-caplets-250ct-up-38-up-8482/-/A-50284728#lnk=sametab), with magnesium oxide as the main ingredient, and my life changed (I know that sounds dramatic, but it’s true).\n\nWomen under 30 are [recommended](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/) to take 310 mg daily, but I take the entire 400 mg caplet - sometimes 2 when it's really bad. Although I don’t have “regular” stools, they’re def loosey-goosey (sorry for that visual), it makes me go, and usually every day — which is a miracle! But I will warn, these are almost always semi-urgent BMs, so make sure a restroom is closeby when it's \"go time.\" Because it’s not a bulk-forming laxative, it doesn’t add additional stomach fullness and discomfort, nor do you have to take it with lots of water (at least I don’t).\n\nYou can get it at pretty much any grocery or drug store. Do(o) itttttt. (Sorry, had to.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**MY \"GO TIME\":** A GI told me a few years ago that, even if I don’t feel the need to “go,” I should *try* to in the mornings after a small meal (and in my case, along with my steadfast natural laxative, coffee). He told me most people have the urge at that time of day and that it could help keep me regular.\n\nI have found it to be true – my sweet spot is typically between 8:30 – 9:30 am. That’s why I try to avoid meetings before 10 am, otherwise, it’s a no-go. Really, anything that disrupts this sacred window of time affects my BMs, which makes me sad, and hurts my tummy. I probably take my daily morning mission too seriously, but I know how important it is to try and stay regular to avoid bloating, discomfort, and pain.\n\nBut if your “go time” is 3:45 pm on the dot, stick to it and try to do your thang at the time each day.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**SWEATPANTS OR BUST:** My mom, who also suffered from IBS in her twenties, tells me, ad nauseam, that wearing tight clothing around her stomach always made her symptoms worse. Makes sense.\n\nThis is not to say you can never bust out those high-waisted leather pants you’ve been dying to display, but that you may want to consider unzipping your jeans or throwing on your fave sweatpants when you’re lounging around the house. Try it, you’ll find instant relief.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**INVEST IN A SQUATTY POTTY?:** Out of recent desperation, I caved and invested in a (foldable) [Squatty Potty](https://www.target.com/p/7-fold-n-stow-foldable-toilet-stool-white-squatty-potty/-/A-54626871) to help alleviate and eliminate. I know, it's a $25 stool, don't judge me. I have only been using it for a few days, and haven’t found much improvement, if at all; but I feel when my GI tract is less distressed, it will help, as it reduces strain.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe methods above helped get my IBS (almost completely) under control for *so long*, over a year now, but for some reason, I can’t seem to kick it atm. I'm headed to the GI, so I hope to get some more answers (and solutions). **Hope this helps! :D**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[UPDATE]**\nI’ve compiled all of the aids/advice/treatments provided in the comments to make it more easily accessible. Please keep in mind, some of the suggestions may need a doctor’s referral and/or prescription. **This information is not my own.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**FOR CONSTIPATION:**\n\n- Magnesium citrate\n- DualBiotic (Pre and Probiotic) \n- Metamucil \n- Linzess \n- VSL#3 \n- Restoralax\n- Avoiding gluten\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**FOR DIARRHEA:**\n\n- Viberzi \n- Anti-anxiety medication\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**FOR BLOATING/GAS:**\n\n- Simethicone\n- Nortriptyline\n- Quatrase\n\n&nbsp;\n\n **FOR ABDOMINAL PAIN:**\n\n- THC-Free CBD oil \n- Heating pad/blanket \n- Peppermint oil \n- Ginger tea \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**FOR STRESS MANAGEMENT:**\n\n- Meditation\n- Diaphragmatic breathing\n\n&nbsp;\n\n **OTHER POSSIBLE DIAGNOSES:**\n\n- Celiac disease \n- Candida \n- Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO)",

Maybe this will be helpful to you too.\n\n* Apples, Grapes, bananas: I believe the underlying issue may be the high amounts of fructose. After avoiding high fructose fruits and sweets with high fructose corn syrup I was able to eliminate all my IBS issues related to sweets. [Here](https://med.virginia.edu/ginutrition/wp-content/uploads/sites/199/2014/04/Low-Fructose.pdf) is a PDF about a low fructose diet.\n* Peanut butter and fried foods: I have found another group of foods that trigger my IBS were foods with canola oil or highly processed oils. Peanut butter is typically mixed with canola or palm oil which are both major triggers for me. After switching to a peanut butter without any added ingredients my symptoms disappeared. I also found that some salads would trigger me and it was because the dressing would have canola oil or another highly processed oil.\n\nThe underlying triggers may be different for you than me, but if they are the same then it could be useful in finding safe foods moving forward!",

    "body": "Most of us hate visiting the dentist. The idea of someone sticking tools in our mouths and fiddling around inside while we lie on a chair helplessly like a gaping goldfish is no one’s idea of fun. Let’s not even get started on the whirring little buzzsaw tools they use.\n\nYet, we endure this ordeal for the sake of our teeth. Walking around with a few missing teeth like a meth addict is worse than being at the dentist. \n\nBut what if you were told that regular dental visits just aren’t enough?\n\nThere are many people who visit their dentist regularly and take care of their teeth by brushing and flossing religiously – but they still develop weak, wobbly teeth over time. \n\nWhy does this happen?\n\nThe answer is simple! Having strong healthy teeth is not just about external care; you need to be healthy internally too. Very often, this pertinent fact is either ignored or we’re not aware of it.\n\nOver the past couple of years, one particular dental health product has skyrocketed in popularity. It’s called Dentitox Pro and is created by Marc Hall.\n\nSince it’s a current bestseller, we decided to look at it in greater detail, despite Marc’s slightly grumpy profile pic on the sales page. Here’s what we found…\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Good Points:\n\n1) The product itself is a supplement that’s in liquid form. You’ll need to consume 6 drops daily to enjoy the benefits that it purportedly provides. With the dropper that’s provided, consuming Dentitox Pro is easy. But does it work?\n\n2) The best way to know if a product works is to see how well it’s selling… and this product is flying off the shelves. It’s an online bestseller for quite a while too. So it definitely works and is not some snake oil that’s all hype and no results.\n\n3) The product is made out of natural, plant-based ingredients and is manufactured in an FDA-approved facility in the USA. So that’s comforting to know. It’s NOT addictive because there are no stimulants and toxins in Dentitox Pro.\n\n4) If you’re wondering how Dentitox Pro works, you’ll need to look at the ingredients in this proprietary blend. A quick Google Image search for the ‘Dentitox Pro label’ showed us that it contains ingredients such as: cinnamon, sage, neem, Indian liquorice root extract, peppermint oil, potassium, zinc, xylitol, and much more beneficial products.\n\nYou’ll use the drops by applying them to your teeth and gums daily. As mentioned earlier, 6 drops will do… and yes, you should still use toothpaste.\n\nNow, knowing the ingredients is not enough. You need to have a rough idea of the benefits these ingredients provide. We’ll look at them in the points below.\n\n5) Dentitox Pro will freshen your breath. The xylitol and peppermint will ensure that.\n\n6) The neem and sage will see to it that your gums are healthy and this will prevent any infections from taking root in your mouth.\n\n7) The blend of herbs in this ‘serum’ will restore the oral microbiome in your mouth. Generally, when you consume too many acidic foods, sodas, etc. the balance of bacteria in your mouth is thrown askew. Dentitox Pro will fix this problem ASAP. \n\n8) Just when you thought it couldn’t get better, it does. Dentitox Pro comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee. This is fantastic because you’ll definitely be able to see positive results after using it for 3-4 weeks. \n\nIf you feel it doesn’t work for you, you can always get your money back. There’s no risk here for you.\n\n9) Overall, Dentitox Pro shouldn’t just be viewed as a product that’s only for your teeth. The ingredients in this serum will benefit your teeth and gums… but over and above that, it’ll benefit your health overall. The antioxidants and herbal properties of this product will enhance your well-being.\n\n10) The product is massively discounted if you get the 3 or 6-bottle pack. You definitely want at least get the 3-bottle pack so that you can use Dentitox Pro for 90-days to fully benefit. These types of ‘holistic’ remedies work wonders if applied consistently over time.\n\nShipping time is fast too. If you live in the US, you can expect to get your order in 3-5 days. International orders will take about 10-14 days. Either way, Dentitox Pro is definitely worth the wait.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Bad Points:\n\n1) Despite the efficacy of Dentitox Pro, you’ll still need to see a dentist every 6 months. Dental issues such as cavities, gum problems or even the usual teeth cleaning is best addressed by a medical professional.\n\nThat said, Dentitox Pro will boost your dental health to reduce the likelihood of you encountering adverse problems. This will ensure you won’t have to pay through your nose just to treat your teeth.\n\n2) You can only purchase Dentitox Pro from the official website. You won’t be able to amble over to your local GNC and get it. However, their shipping is fast. So, you’ll get your Dentitox Pro drops within a few days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShould You Get It?\n\nThis is one of those products that seems like a ‘want’ when it’s actually a need. Having good dental health goes far beyond your visit to the dentist every 6 months. \n\nHealthy gums and teeth require specific nutrients. Fresh breath is a sign of good health and requires antioxidants and a healthy balance of oral microbiome. \n\nThis can be difficult to achieve on your own… and commercially-sold mouthwashes and mints only work temporarily. That’s why people keep using them, but nothing changes in the long term.\n\nIf you want to prevent inflammation in your gums, reduce infections and have breath that doesn’t make others run away from you – all you need is Dentitox Pro.\n\nIt’s just a few drops a day, but will make a world of difference to your teeth and gums. If you purchased the 6-month supply, that amounts to just $1.63 a day. It’s very affordable.\n\nDentitox Pro doesn’t need to be hyped up. It works.

    "body": "After 4 years of being natural,some trauma in my scalp that are healing. I’m pleased to inform I have reached the comfortable hair length. It should be more, but I wasted the first 2 years really bad…(won’t get into details💀)\n\nFinally lately Ive been prioritizing 2 things, the health of my scalp and the health of my ends \n\nHow long your hair grow each month? I suspect mine is the typical average of half an inch. However I increase it when I massage every night and take my vitamins, even my nails are flourishing. (I only know my hair rate is increasing when I go back to scalp massage and vitamins bc my nails grow Longgg)\n\nFigure out your hair porosity (mine is low) and the average grow rate of your hair \n\nMeasure your hair. Both now and when you finish the braids, use a T-shirt etc. You have to measure it at the end of month or after 4 weeks to see how much it grew. It have to be half an inch or an inch, if it less idk ma boy.\n\nI’m doing a 1 month/4 week protective style challenge. In which I let the braids, cornrows or twist for 4 weeks. I tried multiple times and now I know what to fix.\n\nI choose normal sized braids for my challenge, because when is too small it get matter faster and take longer take down\n \nScalp:\n\nI will be moisturizing my scalp (ONLY) the first 2 weeks with Dove Scalp Serum. Last 2 with either tea rinse in spray bottles, or aloe Vera juice, then seal with rosemary oil or Peppermint oil. (Making sure to not rube in, simply apply,massage for like two minutes and cover with satin scarf and bonnet then massage with scalp\nMassager. It don’t mess my hair when I do this so it don’t get matted.)\n\nI scalp massage every night with bonnet on and scalp massager. And idk if I’m crazy but I swear it works. \n\nIn week 4, I will take down the braid body and let the start of it so I don’t lose the parting. Section in 8, then wash my scalp with a clarifying shampoo then moisturize. Deep condition etc. I said this here already I seal with silicon products after I moisturize. I use an oil with silicon or cream at the ends. It works wonders for my 4c hair man is insane the change. If I’m having problem detangling of course afro Prepoo or flaxseed gel, but if I’m lazy a conditioner with Silicone. Pantene work the best for me, I get the job done in minutes!\n- Silicon sealants:\n• Silicon Mix Bambu Hair Polisher\n• John Frieda Frizz Ease Serum\n\nThen I let all the care/leave in sit for 1 or 2 day (in chunky twist) Then I blow dry WITH HEAT PROTECTANT 💀 With silicones. Yes. Chi Silk Infusion is my go to. and braid again (the parts I kept in (that I didn’t unbread) one by one.\n\nIf you prefer do twist, I did is cute, matted is minimum last month bc I blow Dried, it was pretty, a good length so I went out with it! But even the prior month to this I had very shrunken twist bc I put water everyday and I still end out with it! Cute ponytails with some extra down. Was fine But nah, I get bored with twist fast. So cornrows in the front and braids in the back, is so prettyyy! But next time I’ll braid the front too, I still look pretty either ways honestly. 🙂‍↕️ Go out with your natural hair in your protective style, TRUST! The shine and confidence is unmatched. Don’t lay no edges too, just add some golden hair accessories or silver and rock it. DO IT👹\n( i will put myself in the comments so you can see, but will delete it after some hours. )\n\nEnds:\nCut the ends till is clean. With a SHEAR scissor 💀💀💀\nDon’t leave it because is ugly,useless and not even hair anymore. I call it grass cutting lmao.\n\nWhile doing the braids I put each flaxseed gel on the cut clean ends, and after the section is finished, the ends are hard and protected\n\nThen  I go with a clean bead or fold (the golden decorative ones are easier just curve and wrap) I prefer beads. I don’t curve my ends, but I make sure a long part of my ends is up and curve where my hair is already thick then I go with a rubber band and tie it,then cover my end (a little more always should be left) and cover with other more beads, like 3 or 4 or a very long one!\n(In summer I will use shells though. So pretty!)\n\nThis keeps my hair straightened and elongated, it even prevents it from rubbing each other which keeps it  all neat and clean. \n\nIt keeps my ends extremely protected and safe both from the beads and from rubbing each other.  After 4/6 weeks, when taking down simply take the loose part of the rubber band, with the small shear scissor cut it. Then take it out. Be of course extremely careful lmao, which is why I leave a loose part, I put my ends very up to not even touched it while managing the braid too.  idk how to explain this sorry. Will show when I’m taking down.\n\nIf you want other options:\n- Easy Beads. Is like a clip in beads, but I don’t like that is 3 in one. I plan to create my own perfected easy beads, safe length for my taste.\nI’m working on creating my own brand with the exact fabric,color and needs I have, will put in my google document Once finished. \n\n- Silicone Beads. Look the same, don’t make any noise, pretty and simple. You can cut the bead directly too, more safe.\n\n-Just the Flaxseed keep it moisturized and hard for the weeks, put in a high LOOSE ponytail with a SATIN tie. The safe beads or folds is just for my anxiety little self that NEED to keep my ends out of touch🥹I used to break it by myself…is like eating nails for me. So I put myself on time out by locking it away with beads/folds etc.\n\nOkay so scalp is cleaned after 4 week, hair is conditioned too. Ends are moisturized, hardened and kept away for 4 weeks too.\n\nThen after this we repeat.\n\nI wish I could go 2 months, but my hair can’t. And that’s okay! But if you can do 2 months,even better. Don’t put water in your 4c braids during the 4 weeks, remember all the sprays are for your SCALP only 💀 If you don’t want to end up with a matting world like me before lmao. If you want to add something in your braids, just oil the body of the braid. But then again, don’t put nothing. \n\nThis challenge is for 6 months before I take all down and wash then do cute hairstyles to enjoy my length 🤭\n\nAlso, I will be recording myself in the 4 weeks to hold myself accountable. \n\nAnyways there’s so much more. But I’m doing a big document for every 4c hair person level of availability. If you are a lazy natural with medium length and low porosity who wants a simply routine I have the perfect routine for that. Or this type of extended stuff that I enjoy a lot, I fuck with my hair hard, love it a lot. But when I was going to college everyday I had an extremely simple routine to be cute, functional and keep my hair healthy and protected while it grew.\n\nSo I know most people prefer to keep 4c hair in a simply routine. My goal is for people with 4c hair that want to take care of it, but don’t have time can have access to how their hair works, what can protect their fragile ends, what hairstyles and routines are quick, beautiful and protecting. With low Price products, (silicon products that protect your ends are like 20 dollars and less in dollar stores like Pantene. Aloe Vera juice is affordable,rinse tea the same! )\n\nOr some obsessed like me to have access to longer regimens. And track our growth!\n\nAnd most importantly to love,enjoy it and go out with your hair without edges or added hair. Anyways goodbye.🌨️",

    "body": "The damage that is caused from incessant picking creates a worse more untenable, unbearable situation than whatever it is you want to pick at. \n\nFor the love of God, do everything to stop. I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy. I have struggled with wanting put out of my misery thoughts which I have never had before. That has improved a lot now with some time NOT PICKING and letting things heal. \n\nPut both your hands in casts and tell everyone you broke your hands if you have to. Even if you lose a few months of your hand usage in life, it is better than the year at least I have spent trying to untangle this weird subsurface nightmare. I know I still have another 6-12 months to go if it ever gets better at all. Y’all, it is wicked. It is absolute hell. I am asking what I did to deserve this but I did it to MYSELF.  \n\nOne day, I noticed how swollen a part of my finger had gotten by proxy whilst attacking my head all day. (That has totally healed now!)\n\nI struggled with picking other areas before, like my face when I had acne. But managed to stop after seeing a dermatologist. At that point I became fascinated with how and how quickly the skin heals. This logic didn’t transfer to my head but it should have. \n\nSo I am looking at this spot on my finger and realizing how bad it would get if, say, I picked it every day like my scalp. And something clicked. This is what I am doing, creating layers on layers of skin trying to heal and getting excoriated and swollen again. And regrowing more skin over that..)\n\nThe PROBLEM HERE is that my hair keeps growing. (In the beginning I worried that I would permanently damage hair follicles). My scalp has built a mound of flesh and probably scar tissue trying to heal and the hair just grows underneath and through. \n\nIt knots. Under the scalp and eventually surfaces into knots. I shaved my head. Twice. The hair grew so matted and twisted in and out of the scalp and began to tug all over. I could feel hairs growing through an impossible mound of flesh. Now I have layers of scalp comprised of knots of hair. There’s a spot that won’t show hair. Its not bald. There’s hair under there and is stuck in the wrong spot knotted in the flesh adjacent. It HURTS. I spend my days trying to brush out knots now. They are never ending. Like numbering in the million range. \n\nThe good news is I am not picking. I am messing with my hair almost obsessively which I think is important if you’re still reading and seeking help. \n\nI have tried for 6+years how to overcome this. I have learned more about my brain (OCD) and how it works, how this operates, and why it has such a control over me. \n\nPicking is an obsession. The behavior of obsession is ingrained and would transfer elsewhere (like another spot) if you were to stop. I have a head self-care toolkit that I use to obsess now in a self-care manner. You need to find your toolkit- not just stuff- replacement behaviors that satisfy this function involving a self grooming obsession.        \n\nSome things that have helped: Head massages (WITH 2 scalp massage brushes and NOT my hands- otherwise just setting yourself up for an episode), hot oil treatments (use a bag overnight- olive oil has been the best for me). Glycolic acid (the ordinary) had been good for dissolving and sloughing dead skin. I think moisturizing shampoos and conditioners have been better for me than medicated/ salicylic acid products. APPLE CIDER VINEGAR is awesome to cleanse and remove buildup without stripping natural oils. Don’t over shampoo. I am trying not to shampoo daily. Our scalps like the natural oils. I have a regimen. I can’t do any one thing every day. 2-3 times a week for glycolic acid, less shampooing, I use Dermarest shampoo once a week, overnight coconut/olive oil bag once a week or so. Head massages are so relaxing and good for hair growth. OMIGOD THE STRESS ALONE IS SO NEGATIVE TO HEALTH) \n\nSo I need a whole regimen. ACV when I need to clean out buildup. I got a tool for hair growth but also good for healing that shocks my head and has UV light. Any thing I can do to messs with it but not excoriate. I have invested so much of my disposable income on this. \n\nMy suggestion is to find a range of alternatives and maybe something will reinforce you to do that or any one of them instead of pick. I don’t think things like petroleum jelly and bacitracin are good for the head.  These are not the types of oils your scalp wants. \n\nStress is a trigger. I can’t eliminate that but I know I lose self control in that moment of weakness. I don’t keep tools with which I can pick in my space and I keep dip nails on so I can’t do as much damage. \n\nThe thing that has really helped me transfer the obsession, though admittedly is specific to my situation- you kind of need thousands of ingrown hairs in your head and a boar bristle brush (also something you can use to obsess but is GOOD for your scalp), is brushing the knots out and inspecting the brush and revealing what ingrown hairs were freed that day. (I have 1/4 inch long hair but my head is producing strands ranging from 1-2” to sometimes 8” or even 12”!- my hair was really long before I shaved. Also I know shaving can cause hair to be ingrown but I didn’t shave it that closely the first time. More the second time but the problem seems to be alleviating as opposed to being exacerbated … albeit the slowest you can imagine). I’m spending portions of my day bent over my brush in my iPhone flashlight instead of with my arms over my head DAMAGING my scalp. \n\nThough that is super weird (scalp picking is pretty weird :/) it is an example of what works. The only other thing that satisfied similarly was cutting my own hair but do not recommend. Lots of people suggest fidget toys but I think it has to be body focused - at least the FIRST or early behavioral transfer/s). We are struggling with BFRBs (body focused repetitive behaviors)!! Find anything else other than picking on your body to obsess with in a healthy way. Please. \n\nI hope any of this helps someone. Please do anything you can. This is awful. I swear you do not want this. \n\nEdit to add: wow this post has gotten more interaction than expected. I appreciate the support out there. This sub has been really good and insightful for me over the years. podcasts have been too!\n\nother things that I keep remembering that are great. Exercise-yoga for me and meditation has been incredible for mental health in general. Showering can interrupt the behavior. Increasing social activity and having some accountability after sharing A LOT to try to help a new partner understand how to deal/help. I also think peppermint oil and arnica salve have been life changers for scalp condition. ",

For the first time in 20 years, my Zoloft/Bupropion combo stopped working (they never helped the picking) and my Dr put me on Prozac with the Wellbutrin. Once the Prozac reached a therapeutic dose,  that driving insatiable urge to pick my scalp went away.  Not 100%, but more like 90% and I can stop myself now and could never control it before. \n\nI’m so sorry you’re dealing with this. Have you talked to a dermatologist? Not being flippant as I know many of us have, but they can do scar revisions and other things that would probably help, especially with the pain.

        "body": "I am not trying to downplay your progress but it seems more like you have changed obsessions/compulsions  than stopped. Clearly it is causing you a massive amount of distress. While hair absolutely can become ingrown and stuck under scar tissue, it can’t knot under your skin. Brushing with enough force to free trapped ingrown hairs is still going to cause irritation and some level of damage. It’s still feeding into the ocd cycle. \n\nit still sounds like you are causing much less damage and that is worth celebrating. \n\nI have ocd and outside of picking my primary compulsions are actually non-harmful and non-disruptive. They are actually things that many people do in a non-compulsive manner. My main two are always having a water bottle and always having gum. These seem like things that would be fine to do since they are so innocuous.  The problem is that by performing the compulsions I am further reinforcing my worst most distressing and disruptive obsession. The only way I can get free of that obsession is to retrain my brain to see that the compulsions are actually not solving anything, because the perceived danger is not real. By facing things that trigger the obsession, not following through with the compulsions, and then coming out the other side of the situation ok I can retrain my brain into understanding that the perceived threat was never real.  \n\nSo while your new compulsion is less destructive than the old one, it is still reinforcing the thing causing you the most distress. I urge you to discuss this with your therapist and look into seeing a dermatologist. They might be able to help you heal your scalp. Best of luck",

Try washing and conditioning it more often, like 1-2x week and use a leave-in. Most leave-ins have oil infused in them, so more oil isn’t needed. I think you’ll find that your hair is more moisturized.",
