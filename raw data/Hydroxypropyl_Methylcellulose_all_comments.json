    "body": "I think it’s a good idea to list all of the newly reformulated sunscreens of the failed Korean sunscreens. The new formulas look promising and many of the brands are being extra careful this time with independent testing, so we can be 100% confident that these sunscreens are the labeled SPF. I will list the sunscreens that I have came across that have been reformulated. If I missed any, leave them in the comments below.\n\n1.) ***Round Lab Birch Juice Sun Cream***\n\n* **Old version:**\n\n1. Manufacturer: Green Cos\n2. UV Filters (2):  Uvinal A Plus, Tinosorb S\n3.

I personally would go for the Be Plain when it's available because it has a simplified formula without the unnecessary plant extracts and flower oils. I think the Be Plain one would be better for oily skin than the Round Lab one. Both of the Hyggee sunscreens look promising, but I'm gravitating towards the Vegan Sun Cream because it is a chemical sunscreen and I have a tan complexion, I don't want to risk a white cast. However, the Real Sun Cream does have an interesting ingredient list and whipped texture (as I can see on Yesstyle)  and I will be looking out for reviews to see whether it leaves a white cast or not and make my decision accordingly. What I love about the Hyggee sunscreens is that they are fragrance/essential oil free, but they still contain alcohol. I prefer alcohol because it allows the sunscreen to set better and be less tacky. If you have oily skin, I would think that one of the Hyggee sunscreens would work better for you because I have a Kolmar sunscreen (Isntree Watery Sun Gel) that is similar to the new Round Lab and Be Plain sunscreens and I definitely wouldn't recommend it for oily skin as it is way too shiny.\n\nEdit: I just noticed that the Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream has beet root extract, which made me think of the Krave Beet Shield. Get this, the Beet Shield was also made in Cosmax, same as this new Hyggee one. So I did some digging and found out that the Beet Shield has the SAME exact 5 filters as this new Hyggee sunscreens in the same order. The rest of ingredients are not too similar though, so I do not think they are the same exact sunscreen, as opposed to how I feel about the Be Plain and Round Lab sunscreens, which I do think are almost identical. I do think this Vegan Sun Cream is inspired by the Beet Shield, with maybe an improved formula, since the Beet Shield did not pass SPF tests. So if you are looking for a replacement of the Krave Beauty Beet Shield but with verified SPF protection, get the new Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream!",

    "body": "First of all, these are a list of products available in Boots that I've found, so they're non-exhaustive. Apart from some Neutrogena products and No7 Beautiful Skin Blemish Defence Serum, they contain \"alcohol denat.\", which is a dealbreaker for me as I try to avoid drying alcohols as much as I can. \n\nBHAs are few and very far in between, in addition to not being labelled as such and most probably without the percentage of salicylic acid contained or whether it's in the right pH to be effective. \n\nI haven't done a price comparison, and since I found them in Boots I've used the online site's price point. Prices are only as a guide, they may be cheaper/more expensive elsewhere. Ingredients are highlighted to point out the position of salicylic acid, as well as presence of drying alcohols and parfum for those irritated by them. \n\nAdditional suggestions, opinions and reviews are very welcome!\n\n* PRODUCT: Boots Skin Clear Deep Blackhead Cleansing Lotion\n\nPRICE: £2.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua (Water), **Alcohol denat.**, **Salicylic acid**, PPG-1-PEG-9 lauryl glycol ether, Butylene glycol, Potassium hydroxide, Ammonium glycyrrhizate, **Parfum (Fragrance)**, Dipropylene glycol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Deep Cleansing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.29 for 65 exfoliating pads\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat., Salicylic Acid,** Isoceteth-20, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Hydroxide, Triethanolamine, Allantoin, **Parfum**, **Menthol**, Benzyl Salicylate, Disodium EDTA, Limonene, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Pads\n\nPRICE: 5.39 for 65 pads\n\nINGREDIENTS:Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, **Salicylic Acid**, Hydrogen Peroxide, **Parfum**, Sodium Hydroxide, Dextrin, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben.\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Superfruits Refreshing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.07\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, Glycerin, **Salicylic Acid**, **Parfum**, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Sodium Hydroxide, Propylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Citric Acid, Limonene, Citronellol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Hexyl Cinnamal, Rubus Idaeus Juice, Trideceth-9, Vaccinium Macrocarpon Fruit Juice, Geraniol, Bisabolol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Garnier Pure Active line (various)\n\nPRICE: from £4.99 to £7.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: I can't find an ingredients list anywhere, which is frustrating but as a guide, I remember putting all the Garnier products down because they contain \"Alcohol Denat.\" The packaging lists 2% salicylic acid.

While I could see the improvements, it would feel like my skin was burning. I'm not sure if it's due to the age of the bottle, or just the ingredients, but I discontinued use.\n\nThen I bought *Boots Skin Clear Deep Cleansing Lotion* which is exactly the same as the Blackhead version just with an extra word on the front. It feels just like[ L'Occitaine's Shea Butter Toner](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8adf20777.html) that's alcohol free, but a month in and I don't really feel like it's doing anything.\n\nI used to use Neutrogena a lot and I really liked their grapefruit range, but the *Neutrogena VISIBLY CLEAR Pink Grapefruit Oil-Free Moisturiser* stopped being effective far too quickly. It goes on really light which I like, but after a while my skin either feels dry, or really oily. I felt it was super hit and miss.\n\nWith the Neutrogena Visibly Clear Spot Stress Control Hydrating Spot Treatment, is that just on acne, do you put it on under moisturiser or as a moisturiser?",

    "body": "**TL;DR: Don't fuck up like me. Make sure your moisturizer, primer, and foundation all have the same base or you will regret it.** \n\nOk, I know that this topic has come up a lot recently, but I feel like a lot of discussions leave out a key part of the problem. By now, I think most people know that you have to make sure your primer and foundation have the same base i.e. are they water based or silicone based. It makes sense since those two are layered one on top of the other and if they're immiscible then the foundation will just settle on top and come off on everything, defeating the purpose of a primer. Now, what I haven't seen discussed is how your moisturizer may be interacting with your primer and foundation. I've discovered some interesting things through trial and error recently and wanted to share it with the MUA community.\n\nFirst, I recently switched moisturizers. My skin has been a disaster this winter and I needed a major skincare overhaul. I have sensitive skin and Neutrogena has always had my back with great products that don't irritate my skin. One of the new things I got was a moisturizer with hyaluronic acid, the [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/hydro+boost+water+gel.do?sortby=ourPicks). I love this product because it absorbs quickly, eliminated my dry spots, and hasn't caused any irritation. What I didn't take into account when I bought this product was the ingredients list; I was just happy to find a non-irritating hyaluronic acid delivery system. \n\nwater, **dimethicone**, glycerin, **dimeticone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer**, phenoxyethanol, polyacrylamide, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, dimethiconol, C13-14 isoparaffin, **dimethicone crosspolymer**, chlorphenesin, carbomer, laureth-7, sodium hyaluronate, ethylhexylglycerin, fragrance, C12-14 pareth-12, sodium hydroxide, blue 1 \n\nThe bolded ingredients indicate it's a silicone-based primer. Yes, the first ingredient is water, but the silicone is present in large amounts, and it interacts differently with water-based products.\n\nMistake 1: I was going for a low-effort look one day and decided to used some of my face powder and call it good. With face powder I usually wear my [NYX HD Primer](http://www.nyxcosmetics.com/high-definition-primer/NYX_180.html) because it's lighter but still holds the powder in place. That day my makeup was slipping and sliding everywhere and I looked like a cakey hot mess when I got home. I checked the ingredients on my moisturizer, found all the silicone, then looked at the primer ingredients. \n\n**Water/Aqua/Eau,** Propylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Diethylhexyl Maleate, Glycerin, Ethylene/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Dimethicone, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, PEG-15 Glyceryl Isostearate, Trihydroxystearin, Adipic Acid/Neopentyl Glycol Crosspolymer, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Tocopheryl Acetate, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax/Cera Carnauba/Cire de Carnauba, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7, Silica, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin,  Propylene Glycol Stearate, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Laurate, Propylene Glycol Laurate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Butylene Glycol, Salicornia Herbacea Extract, Copper Tripeptide-1,  Chlorphenesin, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, VP/VA Copolymer, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, C12-14 Pareth-7, Amodimethicone,  Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance/Parfum, Citronellol, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. MAY CONTAIN / PEUT CONTENIR (+/-): Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Zinc Oxide (CI 77947), Chromium Hydroxide Green (CI 77289), Ultramarines (CI 77007).\n\nThe water-based primer just sat on top of my moisturizer, making my makeup come off all over everything.\n\nMistake 2: I somehow spaced and forgot all about my moisturizer issues and yesterday I was rushing to leave and decided to just throw on some Sonia Kashuk Radiant Tinted Moisturizer and go. Wrong move. I had already washed my face and moisturized previously, so the Neutrogena moisturizers was under the tinted moisturizer. As I was rubbing the tinted moisturizer on my face, it started to ball up and look disgusting. I quickly wiped it off and left bare faced, but later I looked at the ingredients in the Sonia Kashuk Tinted Moisturizer. \n\nFluorphlogopite, Sorbitan Is Os Tearate,\nTris Iloxane, D Is Teardimonium Hectorite,\nCetyl Peg/Ppg‐10/1 D Imethicone,\nD Imethicone Cros S Polymer, Butylene Glycol,\nSilica D Imethyl Silylate, Synthetic Bees Wax,\nTetras Odium Ed Ta, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium\nChloride, Alcohol, Talc, Peg‐30\nD Ipolyhydroxys Tearate, Aluminum\nHydroxide, Potas S Ium Sorbate, Stearic Acid,\nCaprylyl Methicone, As Corbyl Palmitate,\nTocopherol, Pentaerythrityl Tetra‐Di‐T‐Butyl\nHydroxyhydrocinnamate.\nMay Contain: Mica, Titanium D Ioxide, Iron\nOxides , Zinc Oxide.\n\nThis one is a little more tricky, as it does have some dimethicone ingredients, but my best guess is that the other ingredients react negatively with the ingredients in the Neutrogena moisturizer.\n \nNow, I know this sounds like using the Neutrogena moisturizer is too much of a pain, but it's really not that big of a deal. My favorite primer, the [ELF Poreless Face Primer](http://www.elfcosmetics.com/p/poreless-face-primer?dept=face-faceprimer), works perfectly with this moisturizer and my HG foundation, [Revlon Colorstay Whipped](http://www.revlon.com/products/face/foundation-makeup/revlon-colorstay-whipped-creme-makeup#309971347054||0), goes on better than ever. I just wanted to make this post to inform people that mismatched moisturizer can cause just as many issues as mismatched primer and foundation!",

I would probably go with the Innifree though because I prefer alcohol in my sunscreen, otherwise they are too too dewy and greasy looking, and the ingredient list is rather simple. If only it didn't have fragrance, but I can compromise with that. The Dr. G has too many unnecessary ingredients and many comedogenic ingredients like myristic acid, so I would stay away from it.",

Viraleze is the main product that the study was seeking to investigate. \n\n**TLDR:** \n\nThis was a good study for Astodrimer sodium (Viraleze), showing it highly effectively against SARS-Cov-2 in vitro, while also displaying a pretty good safety profile. Iota-carrageenan (Betadine, NoriZite, Boots, etc). wasn’t as effective, but has a great safety profile so you can use liberally without much risk at all. Nitric oxide (Enovid, VirX) is pretty effective, but maybe use sparingly as there are some safety concerns. I would probably definitely avoid Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (Vicks, Taffix) as well as Povidone Iodine (CofixRX) on safety grounds. \n\n———————————————————————————————-\n\n**Reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infectious virus:**\n\nAstodrimer Sodium was most effective with a 96.6% reduction, and Nitric Oxide second most effective with a 90.0% reduction. Iota-carrageenan and Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose unfortunately did not show a significant departure from the control. \n\n**Safety profile - Cell viability (quantitative):**\n\nAt a dilution of 1:270, cell viability in all nasal sprays remained nearly 100%, however significant differences started to emerge with a higher concentration. At a 1:10 dilution: Iota-carrageenan was the safest, reducing cell viability to about 80%. Astodrimer Sodium was the second safest, reducing cell viability to about 60%. Nitric Oxide was third safest, reducing cell viability to about 55%. Povidone Iodone and Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose both showed significant damage, reusing cell viability to nearly 0%. \n\n**Safety profile - Cell viability (qualitative):**\n\nMirroring the qualitative results, cultures exposed to 1:10 Iota-carrageenan and Astodrimer Sodium  showed healthy confluent cell monolayers. In contrast, cultures exposed to 1:10 Nitric oxide, Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, or Povidone Iodone showed severe disruption in the cell monolayer structure. \n\n**Safety profile - Tissue integrity (TEER):**\n\nExposure to either Iota-carrageenan and Astodrimer Sodium for either 4 or 24 hours did not compromise the integrity of the nasal epithelium, meanwhile inserts treated with Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose showed TEER values consistent with severe disruption of the nasal epithelial integrity.",

So the results don’t really say “iota-carrageenan is not effective”, the experiment showed that it isn’t virucidal (expected). Given the funding and involvement of the mfr this makes sense, they want to only show theirs working and others not.\n\nThis study also doesn’t look at how effective it would be in real life for prevention.

Made from plant-based materials like hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), veggie capsules do not contain synthetic additives, preservatives, or potential hormone-disrupting chemicals. They are non-toxic, easy to digest, and suitable for a wide range of dietary needs, including vegan and vegetarian lifestyles.\n\nUnlike softgels, veggie capsules do not require chemical solvents or petroleum-based ingredients to hold their shape. They dissolve efficiently in the stomach, ensuring your body absorbs the nutrients as intended, without any unwanted extras.\n\nIf you’re looking to support your health with clean, effective supplements, the capsule delivery system is just as important as the ingredients inside.

    "body": "https://i.redd.it/5h8s8iwl4x811.jpg\n\nHi there! Firstly, I want to say that it's my first review ever and I tried my best to make it! I Also, Im not a native english speaker so if I made any mistakes, please correct me in the comments.\n\nMoving onto the review, I'll be writing about a fairly new (I think) physical Innisfree sunscreen, it only has one review on the innisfreeworld and a lot of people have been wondering about how it feels and performs so I decided to order it while I still could since Innisfree stopped shipping to my country at the end of may.\n\n* **My skin type, skin problems and climate**: Very fair, normal skin, clog-prone. Central Europe - The climate is horribly hot and humid in the summer, winters are really cold and dry most of the times.\n* **Texture**: First of all, it's probably one of the most watery skincare products I've ever tried. It's really watery, light-weight, moderately runny and glides on very easily.  Does not leave smudges like lots of sunscreens do. Sounds like a perfect sunscreen, right? Well... I'm always really anxious when Im applying it since it sinks in really easily and fast that Im not sure if I even applied enough, for most people it's probably a big plus but I guess Im the one who's strange here. It's also fairly moisturizing for a *physical* sunscreen. It's not called an ESSENCE for no reason.\n* **Scent**: Really mild one, pretty similar to the Triple Care one, shouldn't be too much for anyone unless you're TERRIBLY sensitive to fragrance.\n* **White cast**: It does leave a slight whitecast, but in scale 1-10 I'd say it's a solid 3. I'm pretty white myself so personally, it's not a problem for me at all. Could make you ashy if you're darker than NC35 but the color pretty much disappears after it's fully soaked in, because it does not have any sort of a tint like the Triple Care sunscreen.\n* **Performance**: After applying, it does leave you REALLY glowy, not oily though and it stays like this for the rest of the day. It's also is easy to reapply, especially if you put it in a cushion case, since it's not creamy and is soaked well by the it. The real struggle is that Innisfree does not claim it to be waterproof, but... Well... As stated in the description on Innisfreeworld: \" *The easy-washable formula of this daily sunscreen is conveniently removed by primary cleansing.*\" I tested it and it actually washes off with just a water-based cleanser, even if you reapplied it a lot throughout the day. I used the Cosrx Good Morning Gel Cleanser and it removed it completely. In that case, I would not recommend it to my oily friends or those who sweat a lot unless you want to reapply every 30 minutes.\n* **Size and price**: $16 USD for 50ml so pretty resonable.\n* **Ingredients**: Now... This is where it gets tricky. A full list:\n\nWATER, C12-15 ALKYL BENZOATE, ***TITANIUM DIOXIDE***, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, CAPRYLYL METHICONE, DIPROPYLENE GLYCOL, BUTYLOCTYL SALICYLATE, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, CETYL ETHYLHEXANOATE, SILICA, ALUMINUM STEARATE, POLYHYDROXYSTEARIC ACID, POLYMETHYLSILSESQUIOXANE, ***BENZOTRIAZOLYL DODECYL P-CRESOL***, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, ***TITANIUM DIOXIDE*** (CI 77891), CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, ALUMINA, PROPANEDIOL, AMMONIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE/VP COPOLYMER, SACCHARIDE HYDROLYSATE, HYDROXYPROPYL METHYLCELLULOSE STEAROXY ETHER, OCTYLDODECANOL, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, POLYACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER-6, STEARIC ACID, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, CENTELLA ASIATICA EXTRACT, SALVIA HISPANICA SEED EXTRACT, CURCUMA LONGA (TURMERIC) ROOT EXTRACT, PORTULACA OLERACEA EXTRACT, HOUTTUYNIA CORDATA EXTRACT, ECHIUM PLANTAGINEUM SEED OIL, T-BUTYL ALCOHOL, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL, CARDIOSPERMUM HALICACABUM FLOWER/LEAF/VINE EXTRACT, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL UNSAPONIFIABLES, TOCOPHEROL, FRAGRANCE\n\nAs you can see, its only filter is Titanium Dioxide which is stated twice on the list. This'd mean that there is Titanium Dioxide in both smaller and bigger particles. TiO2 is pretty sticky so the particles stick together really easily so it shouldn't penetrate your skin deeply.\n\nThis also means that this sunscreen does not protect you from UVA1 rays. I started wondering - why is it PA++++ then? I messaged Innisfree and here's the response:\n\n*Dear customer,*\n\n*This is innisfreeworld.*\n\n*Thank you for contacting us.*\n\n*We understand your concerns and would like to inform you about this products and its titanium dioxide.*\n\n*Please be kindly informed that the Titanium Dioxide can be used non only for UVB protection but also for the UVA protection by controlling its size.*\n\n*We hope that we have cleared your question.*\n\n*Have a good day and please feel free to contact us again.Yours sincerely,innisfreeworld.*\n\nEDIT: Apparently,  Benzotriazolyl Dodecyl p-Cresol (Tinogard TL) is also a filter, but there's not much information about it anywhere. Im supposing they'd tell me if it'd protected against UVA1 but they sidestepped the question instead so I don't want to spread false information.\n\nSo, they pretty much avoided the question about PA rating and UVA1 rays.\n\n* **Final thoughts**:  I overall think that this is a really good sunscreen, maybe not for the summer but for winter. I also recommend it to people who have dry/dehydrated/normal skin and want something light-weight that'll look great under makeup and give them a glow like a makeup base. I'd rate it a solid 8,5/10.",

Now, I’m just a BB cream with SPF type of gal but she really sold me with this product and I gotta say, it blew me away. It’s so light and it’s not greasy! Ugh, as someone who has dry skin, it’s annoying when my skin manages to still get greasy somehow WHILE my skin flakes. I used to use the milk Biore but after I bought this, I’m never going back to that. If you have eczema-prone, dry skin, I promise you that this is all you need. The white cast is so barely noticeable too!!! I personally would rate this a 9.5/10!",

    "body": "I rarely see this sunscreen being talked about on this sub and it breaks my heart! I feel so happy with my purchase that I decided to write an in-depth review. I was recently on the hunt for a new sunscreen because I got too tired looking up which reformulations of Biore Watery Essence were good and I honestly preferred something Korean (I’m Korean so it’s easier for me to look up information and Korean products tend to arrive faster in Canada than Japanese products imo).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Skin Type:** Slightly oily but dehydrated, flaky around my mouth. I’m on tretinoin 0.025 which I use every 2-3 nights.\n\n**Skin Tone:** Fair-medium, I wear a no. 21 in terms of Korean foundations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile this sunscreen is touted as being a gel, it looks like a lotion at first glance. It is white and appears creamy in the tube. However, it spreads on my skin completely colourless and does not feel heavy. This sunscreen appears to be completely chemical and contains no zinc or physical sunscreens, so I imagine this is why there is no white cast. It is slightly thicker than Biore Watery Essence, but still sits very light on the skin. For that reason, I think this might be good for people with dry skin who like the finish of Biore but want something less drying. (Biore lists alcohol as its second ingredient, while Etude House lists alcohol as its fourth ingredient.)\n\n>**Ingredients:** WATER, ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE, HOMOSALATE, ALCOHOL, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE, DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE, ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE, SILICA, NIACINAMIDE, CAPRYLYL METHICONE, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, DIMETHICONE/VINYL DIMETHICONE CROSSPOLYMER, AMMONIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE/VP COPOLYMER, PROPANEDIOL, SACCHARIDE HYDROLYSATE, OCTYLDODECANOL, ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, TROMETHAMINE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, ADENOSINE, HYDROXYPROPYL METHYLCELLULOSE STEAROXY ETHER, CENTELLA ASIATICA EXTRACT, PORTULACA OLERACEA EXTRACT, HOUTTUYNIA CORDATA EXTRACT, CURCUMA LONGA (TURMERIC) ROOT EXTRACT, ECHIUM PLANTAGINEUM SEED OIL, SALVIA HISPANICA SEED EXTRACT, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF EXTRACT, BAMBUSA VULGARIS WATER, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL UNSAPONIFIABLES, CARDIOSPERMUM HALICACABUM FLOWER/LEAF/VINE EXTRACT, GLYCERIN, PHENOXYETHANOL, ETHYL HEXANEDIOL, IRIS FLORENTINA ROOT EXTRACT, CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA (MATRICARIA) FLOWER/LEAF EXTRACT, TOCOPHEROL, FRAGRANCE\n\nAs you can see from the ingredients list, there is a ton of good stuff in the latter half of the list including niacinamide, adenosine, centella, aloe, and a bunch of other extracts. We all know that all this might not mean much if there’s only 0.000001% of it in there, but I do feel like my skin is calm and happy with this product. With Biore, I never broke out or became dry but I also felt like my skin was… chemically? And for some reason, while Biore dried down to a lighter sheen I also found myself more oily in the afternoon compared to Etude House. I guess my dehydrated skin was over-compensating for the drier finish. There is fragrance in this gel, but I don’t particularly notice any scent. If there is one, it’s unoffensive to say the least.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am prone to acne, hence the tretinoin, but I don’t think I clog too easily. I have never broken out with this product, but YMMV if you have more acne-prone skin than I do. Also, this sunscreen is not sweat or waterproof, but it’s perfect if you’re sitting by a window all day or it’s not too humid where you’re located.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI recently went to Korea and Etude House had BOGO sales for ALL their sunscreens. You bet I stocked up and got my family some sun protection gifts! I bought 2 jumbo sized tubes (150 mL) for 25,000 won or around 23 USD and 2 regular sized tubes (50 mL) for 12,000 won or around 10 USD. It is priced more expensively online, but it’s cheaper than Biore for me on eBay shipping to Canada.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll in all, this is the perfect sunscreen for me :) Please consider this if you’re on the hunt for a sunscreen.",

Also the price is insanely good; hopefully eBay offers similar pricing. Good sun care luck to us all.",

It is not greasy nor drying and I would really recommend this to people who hate the feeling of sunscreen.\n\n\n(Honestly, I do not get why the biore one is so popular... it is drying due to the alcohol, it contains lemon extract (which is very irritating to the skin) and the scent is too strong. My sensitive skin hates it! But I guess that the biore is good compared to US sunscreens (Im from Europe so I am more spoiled with UV filters))\n\n\nAnyways, I love the way the etude sungel applies on my skin. It works to well under make up and it feels like I have applied nothing!!I also love the fact they have a jumbo sizes version of the sungel  Just most chemical filters STING my eyes like hell. So I had to stop using it. (My eyes hate ethylhexyl metoxcinamate and homosalate, the only chemical uv filters I can use are tinascorb I think...)\n\n\nBut I bought this for my mom (extremely dry skin) and my sister (oily acne prone skin) and they both love it. On a side note tho, my friend who has lots of flower allergies (so many she cant count) had an allergic reaction to it. Not sure if it is the fragrance or one of the extracts at the end of the ingredient list.",

Aldi replaced it with Formic Acid for which CosDNA has no irritant/acne score, but did replace Laureth-10 with Laureth-4 which is worse according to CosDNA (but it’s very low on the ingredients list). \n\nAldi foaming wash has added Lactic Acid lower down on the list (Moisturising in low concentrations).\n\nBoth kinds of Aldi wash have added Glycerin.\n\nAt first glance, Aldi improved their face wash while Simple made theirs possibly slightly worse. \n\nAll product images here https://imgur.com/a/Y2qE1LZ",

    "body": "I posted about this before on the sub, so again, here is a short background: \n\nGepirone is in the azapirone group of drugs, the same class as Buspar. It was synthesized by Bristol Myers Squibb in 1986 and is now finally being brought to market by Fabre-Kramer Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of MDD (major depressive disorder) and GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) under the brand name EXXUA. On September 22nd, 2023, the FDA approved Exxua for the treatment of MDD, while trials for GAD are currently still in phase 3. \n\n\nSimilarities to Buspirone:\n\n* Both drugs function as 5HT1A serotonin receptor partial agonists. Meaning, they occupy the 5HT1A receptor sites and have an effect less than that of serotonin which allows them to function as an inhibitor. Inhibition at the 5HT1A site results in anxiolytic activity.\n\n* Both drugs produce 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-piperazine (1-PP) as a metabolite, which is an agonist of the Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor.\n\n\nDifferences from Buspirone:\n\n* It’s an ER (extended release) medication, meaning it will only need to be taken once daily. “Gepirone ER uses a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose formulation to mediate extended release of the active ingredient, which facilitates absorption over 16 hours. This extended release mechanism allows for once daily administration.”\n\n* When taken with food, AUC (area under the curve, which is the amount of the drug that gets absorbed by your body) increases by “up to 37%”, compared to 100% (fully doubling) with Buspirone.\n\n* It is not an antagonist of the dopamine D2 receptor, unlike Buspirone. \n\n\nAccording to Fabre-Kramer, “EXXUA™ is a significantly stronger anxiolytic than buspirone, with no dopaminergic effects.”\n\n\nIf you’d like to read more:\n\n[Highlights of prescribing information from the FDA](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2023/021164s000lbl.pdf)\n\n[Briefing to the FDA](https://pink.citeline.com/-/media/pmbi-old-site/supporting-documents/the-pink-sheet-daily/2015/november/gepirone_ac_fk_briefing.pdf)\n\n[Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gepirone#:~:text=Gepirone%20is%20an%20antidepressant%20and,has%20yet%20to%20be%20marketed.)\n\n[Fabre-Kramer site](https://fabrekramer.com/)",

One of the sunscreens that I was most excited for that did get along with my skin was the Purito Centella Green Level Unscented. It left my skin with a rash and ever since I have been reluctant to try other chemical sunscreens (even though I'm not really sure why my skin had an allergic reaction: I have used centella/niacinamide products before and never had experience such a thing). Nonetheless, I have decided to try mineral sunscreens and one of them was the Cotz Sensitive SPF 40. Although it left my skin \"greasy\" (I didn't really mind it since I have dry skin), it gave my skin a very tight and dry feeling :(.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThe ATO Mild Sun Cream is a mineral sunscreen with the most runny lightweight texture. Despite it being lightweight oh my it is so pleasant to put on! It does not leave my skin tight and dry and best of all it is fragrance and essential oil free!! It is very easy to blend and it leaves a very minimal white cast in the beginning but it quickly disappears. I believe there was a video with Juan putting on the sunscreen on Ohlolly's instagram page. Overall, I really love this sunscreen :)\n\nEdit: SPF rating: 45 PA+++\n\n**Star Rating 5/5**\n\n​ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n**Ingredient List**\n\nWater, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Propanediol, Titanium Dioxide, Methylpropanediol, Cyclomethicone, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Aluminum Stearate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Caprylic/Capric/Succinic Triglyceride, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Silica, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Alumina, Cetyl Hydroxyethylcellulose, Cellulose Gum, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tromethamine, t-Butyl Alcohol, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Butylene Glycol, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phosphatidylcholine, Ceramide NP, Glycine, Serine, Glutamic Acid, Alanine, Threonine, Proline, Arginine",

It contains titanium dioxide and zinc oxide (both physical sunscreen filters), and it claims it's waterproof, doesn't have a whitecast, and has a watery texture. It retails for 3,780yen with tax (about $35 USD, 25GBP, $45CAD, $48AUD, $48SGD) - to give you a comparison, Biore UV Watery Gel is about 700yen here. It's not cheap! You get 40g of product.\n\nI picked it up as it felt very light on my hand and left a nice 'hydrated' look without any obvious stickiness or heaviness, which seems great for summer.\n\nLet me know if you'd like a more in depth review of it - I plan on trying it out this week.\n\nIngredients (apologies for any spelling mistakes, I translated this myself):\nWater, Zinc oxide, ethylhexyl palmitate, butylene glycol, titanium dioxide, dimethicone, hydrated silica, hydrogen dimethicone, hot spring water, lavender extract, rosemary extract, sage extract, mugwort extract, shiso extract, ginger root extract, Japanese angelica root extract, French maritime pine bark extract, ceramide NP, hydrolyzed conchiolin, glycyrrhizic acid dipotassium, aloe vera extract, sagarame (kelp) extract, HDI/ trimethylol hexyllactone crosspolymer, aluminium starch octenylsuccinate, talc, silica, alumina, isononanoic acid isotridecyl ester, pentylene glycol, polyhydroxystearic acid, ammonium acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP copolymer, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose stearoxy ether, aluminium hydroxide, t-butyl alcohol, phenoxyethanol\n\nEdited for spelling and formatting.",

Then, I massage the lather into my Skin for 1-2 minutes…making sure to do a gentle yet thorough job of cleansing. Then, I rinse with warm water.\n\nWhy I Use It: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* After having such a positive experience with the Facial Mist and slowly becoming more interested in “Clean” Skincare/Sustainable Packaging…I began collecting the rest of the Youth To The People Line. This Cleanser was particularly interesting as the version I have was for Pride Month. All of the proceeds for these Limited Edition Cleansers went to the support of GLSEN…an organization dedicated to safe and inclusive education for LGBTQ students (up to $50,000 USD). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Aside from that, Youth To The People in particular has some really long Product Names…but they totally draw me in. Seeing Ingredients like Kale and Spinach was intriguing to me.\n\nOverall Review:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* When I first used this Cleanser I immediately thought “Okay, I can just go ahead and give away/sell all of the other Cleansers in my Stash…shut it all down…we have a winner.” LOL! I wish I could say that I wasn’t totally impressed by this Product immediately so as not to seem biased…but here we are. Let’s dig in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Some of the initial things that I liked were the packaging and size of this Cleanser. The glass bottle will be SUPER easy to re-use for another Product like Hand Wash or something. And, even though this Cleanser is a bit pricey at first glance…the amount you pay per OZ is actually much less than some of my other favorite Cleansers (the Peach & Lily Power Calm Hydrating Gel Cleanser and Sulwhasoo Snowise EX Cleanser come to mind). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The consistency and feel of this Cleanser isn’t necessarily “mind blowing” by any means. It looks and feels a lot like a basic Gel Cleanser. But, although this is a gentle/low pH Product…it lathers up quite nicely and holds that lather throughout the cleansing process. Many gentle Cleansers like this offer little to no lather or one that dissipates really quickly. I’ve learned to love the no lather way of life…but its nice to find a Product that is gentle and gives me that foamy satisfaction LOL!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* As for the Formula…thats where things get extra interesting. Panthenol makes it pretty high on the Ingredients List followed by Vitamin E, Ascorbic Acid, Kale Leaf Extract, Spinach Leaf Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, Chamomile Flower Extract, Alfalfa Extract, and Aloe Leaf Extract. There are of course various texturizes and preservatives…but the concentration of them seems pretty low with a bigger focus on the Featured Ingredients.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What really surprised me about this Cleanser is the focus on hydration/nourishment…which is almost as key as the cleansing when you look at the Ingredients List. And I totally found this to be the case as I used it. This Cleanser is honestly one of the most hydrating and gentle ones I have tried. I have to say it is at least on par with the Peach & Lily Power Calm Gel Cleanser…but maybe just slightly more intense. After each cleanse my Skin feels soft and almost dewy…like I’ve just used a hydrating Serum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Aside from that...the “Superfood” Extracts in this Formula are also surprise winners. I typically don’t put too much stock into soothing, anti-oxidant, or brightening Ingredients when they are included in Cleansers. This is a Product that is washed off of the face rather quickly…so those Ingredients don’t have a ton of time to do their magic. However, over time I did notice an overall brightening effect from using this Cleanser (along with the other Youth To The People Products). I cant say specifically that this Cleanser alone made it happen…but I have to think it didn’t hurt. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* By the second or third week of using this Superfood Cleanser…I was hooked. The incredibly refreshing scent of “cut greenery” is probably one of the best around…all without Synthetic Fragrance. This in addition to the results I was seeing and I was really happy I decided to give this Product (and Brand) a try.\n\nSo thats it, I love it, love it, love it. It comes in a bottle I want, its a relatively decent value compared to other Cleansers/Brands in this category, and its probably the most gentle and hydrating Cleanser I have used second to the Peach & Lily Power Calm Gel Cleanser. But, I have to give this Superfood Cleanser a couple of bonus points for all of the antioxidant rich, brightening, and soothing Ingredients. Peach & Lily’s Cleanser is also quite calming…but I think I just saw more “in your face” improvement to my Skin with the Superfood Cleanser supporting the rest of my Routine.\n\nThis is a Product that I would absolutely recommend to all Skin Types as it was super gentle yet offered enough of a cleanse that I think those with Combination/Oily Skin will get along with it just fine. That plus the addition of hydration and antioxidants makes this a real winner to me. I know I said I’m ready to say goodbye to the rest of my Water based Cleanser Stash…but you know I cant do that LOL! I’ll continue to try/Review but I’m keeping a back-up bottle of this Youth To The People Cleanser on hand at all times!\n\nThings To Note:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I just wanted to give you all a quick Per OZ price breakdown of my top three Water Based Cleansers to give a better idea of the “value” I saw in this Youth To The People Product:\n\nYouth To The People Superfood Cleanser: $4.50 USD Per OZ (as priced on their website)\n\nSulwhasoo Snowise Brightening Cleanser: $7.72 USD Per OZ (as priced on YesStyle)\n\nPeach & Lily Power Calm Hydrating Gel Cleanser: $8.28 Per OZ (as priced on their website)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nWater (Aqua), Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Butylene Glycol, Brassica Oleracea (Kale) Leaf Extract, Spinacia Oleracea (Spinach) Leaf Extract, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Medicago Sativa (Alfalfa) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Natural Fragrance, Lecithin, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Chlorophyll\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3r7jttoe39p41.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc83beec429adbdf289f87ad9a3facccf90897ad",

For the past month or so I've tried cutting down on my use of silicones and sulfates (only use a sulfate shampoo once a week or so because my hair feels too gross without it), but overall my hair feels worse than before. About a month ago I bought some natures gate products, because I really like how they're relatively inexpensive and also vegan/cruelty free. \n\nFor anyone who's curious: \n\nThis is the ingredients list for the shampoo I've been using: Water, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, sodium cocoyl isethionate, disodium cocoamphodiacetate, lauryl glucoside, glycerin, chamomilla recutita (matricaria) flower extract, panthenol, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, borago officinalis (borage) seed oil, tocopherol, ascorbic acid, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, equisetum arvense (horsetail) leaf extract, geranium maculatum (geranium) extract, salvia officinalis (sage) leaf extract, mimosa tenuiflora (mimosa) bark extract, ascorbyl palmitate, polysorbate 20, leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium hydroxide, phenoxyethanol, glyceryl undecylenate, citric acid, fragrance (parfum)*\nMade in the USA from globally sourced materials.\n* Phthalate free\nNo - sodium lauryl/laureth/coco sulfates, phthalates, butylene glycol, artificial colors.\n\nAnd this is the ingredients list for the conditioner - Water, Glycerin (Vegetable Derived), Stearyl Alcohol (Vegetable Derived), Cetyl Alcohol (Vegetable Derived), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Vegetable Derived), Benzyl Alcohol, Stearalkonium Chloride (Vegetable Derived), Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis (Borage) Seed Oil, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Hordeum Vulgare (Barley) Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Fruit Extract, Viola Tricolor (Pansy) Extract, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hydroxyethylcellulose (Plant Derived), Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Fragrance*.\n*Phthalate free.\n\nMy hair feels straw-like even in the shower, there's no slip unless it's absolutely coated in conditioner and then as soon as it rinses out it feels gross again. I also feel like my hair is falling out more often (if I pull at the tips, long strands will start coming out in the shower). I don't really know what to do. I feel like my hair gets buildup pretty easily because when I've tried cowashing with thick shampoos or have put oil in my hair it always feels really weighed down and greasy the next day. I also have a lot of problems with an itchy, flaky scalp. \n\nI was thinking that using a conditioner with water soluble silicones would be the best compromise - all the benefits of silicones but without the buildup. \n\nDoes anyone have any product recommendations? *I've also been looking for a heat protectant spray* that contains water soluble silicones, since I usually straighten my hair a bit to get rid of the really weirdly shaped waves. I've started using a bit of salt spray in my hair as well (not that often), but I feel like it's been drying out my ends. I considered mixing a bit of conditioner or oil (I've heard jojoba is closest to the scalp sebum) into the mix to make it less damaging, but I have no idea what the salt is doing to my hair with or without silicones. On one hand, it seems like silicones would protect my hair from the salt penetrating it too much. But on the other, it would also prevent the moisturizing ingredients from penetrating my hair, so it seems like a catch-22. I do think I need silicones though, because my hair just doesn't seem to be doing too great without them.   \n\nI'm sorry for such a long post! But if anyone could help me, that would be wonderful.

I'm not sure why you are using salt spray if your straighten your hair.

    "body": "Long time lurker, first time poster please be gentle\n\nI have a very long history with Wellbutrin XL that goes all the way back to 2008. The reason why generic versions of this drug have caused so much harm to myself and others is because the unique matrix-based drug delivery system of Wellbutrin XL is very difficult to replicate. \n\nWellbutrin XL tablets are manufactured with bupropion embedded within a matrix of inert ingredients like polymers (e.g., hydroxypropyl methylcellulose), diluents (e.g., microcrystalline cellulose), and lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate).\n\nThese excipients play crucial roles in the extended release mechanism. Once swallowed, the tablet enters the stomach. Water gradually begins to penetrate the matrix, causing it to swell and become porous. The swollen matrix acts as a barrier, slowing down dissolution and diffusion.\n\nThe polymer chains then control release through a gel layer around the tablet regulating water uptake. As the tablet passes through the intestines, the matrix erodes further for a consistent, prolonged delivery of bupropion.\n\nBecause most generics can't recreate this matrix faithfully, most generics suck. I remember starting off on brand because I received a ton of free samples and then trying a few different generics before I convinced myself that Par Pharmaceuticals was the closest to brand. By 2010 I was taking two white round **A 101** 150 mg pills per day. \n\nI did miss brand however so eventually I convinced myself that $150 a month for 30 tabs of 300mg provided through direct success pharmacy was worth it. Then this happened:\n\n* [How Valeant Tripled Prices, Doubled Sales of Flatlining Drug](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-08/how-valeant-tripled-prices-doubled-sales-of-flatlining-old-drug)\n* [Another shady business relationship has Wall Street worried about Valeant](https://www.businessinsider.com/valeants-direct-success-pharmacy-has-raised-questions-about-wellbutrins-price-2016-10)\n* [Valeant's still raising prices on long-generic Wellbutrin XL. Who's paying up?](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/cheaper-generics-available-who-still-paying-for-valeant-s-wellbutrin-xl)\n* [Valeant defends its latest round of price increases--but critics aren't buying it](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/valeant-defends-latest-price-increases-but-critics-aren-t-buying-it)\n* [Valeant Patient Access And Pricing Committee Comments On Recent Pricing Action Decisions](https://ir.bauschhealth.com/tools/viewpdf.aspx?page=%7B3B128F48-211D-4EC6-AB87-189637E44C59%7D)\n\nIn less than 3 years the drug quintupled in price. \n\nI love this quote directly from Valeant:\n\n**\"We believe the actions  announced today are consistent with our commitment to ensure\nthat patients continue to have access to the medicines they need at an affordable price and demonstrate that we are taking our approach to responsible pricing seriously.\"**\n\nLiars. Have fun in hell.\n\nBack to **A 101**. That was hard. Then about a year or two before PAR discontinued manufacturing Wellbutrin XL their quality started to degrade. I searched and searched for so many alternatives. I tried brand from Canada manufactured in Turkey. It was cheaper than brand in the US but it made me sick. I tried **SO** many generics. I thought I was going to have to try and taper off this drug and just be done with it.\n\nBut if tapering worked then I'd be back to where I was in 2008 in terms of my ADD and my depression. Could I live without Wellbutrin XL? *I suppose I could*. Could I live without my prescription glasses? Sure if I didn't drive and I moved my computer monitor forward on my desk a foot closer to my face. Yes, technically, I **COULD** do it. Would it make sense to actually live that way? Not really. \n\nThen someone told me that there are **two** brand manufacturers of Wellbutrin XL. Forfivo XL was brand Wellbutrin XL but in a dosage of 450 mg.\n\nBingo. My time with brand had taught me some important lessons. Yes I'm aware we've all been told that splitting pills is dangerous and not to do it. But I've seen those same physicians contradict themselves when asked how patients should taper off of the drug. What if I were to tell you that this restriction only applies to generics and not to brand? Don't believe me? Of course you shouldn't believe me. But you do believe [the American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy](https://academic.oup.com/ajhp/article-abstract/56/6/575/5150785?redirectedFrom=fulltext) don't you?\n\nYou absolutely should not split any generic versions of wellbutrin XL because, like I mentioned previously, most fail to faithfully reproduce the matrix-based drug delivery system. Some of them do rely upon coatings to extend the release of the drug. \n\n**Forfivo XL was my savior!** I could definitely afford it. 30 tabs was $500 out of pocket without insurance. Since I could split tabs I was effectively paying $250 a month. 225mg of Forfivo XL once a day worked just as good as 300mg of brand wellbutrin which costs today 10x as much. I've been self employed for many years but once I obtained coverage through [Opolis](https://opolis.co/explore/benefits/) I was fully covered and the prescription was free.\n\nThen this happened:\n\n**[Bora acquires six US brand product licenses, rights](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2023/08/18/2003804896)**\n\nIn August Bora killed Forfivo XL but it would take me two months before I realized this. I got a call at the end of October from my pharmacy that their distributor (Cardinal health) could only fill 30 days of a 90 day script because their stockpile was completely exhausted. *\"Did I want to transfer my script to another pharmacy to have it filled?\"* **What?!**\n\nI was driving to get breakfast and I immediately parked my car and before I did anything else I went to forfivoxl.com to find the contact number of Almatica pharmaceuticals. I called 1-844-889-8686 opt. 1 and I followed the phone tree to get to a live person. \n\n**\"Yes or no was Forfivo XL being discontinued??\"** My worst fears having been confirmed, I then called [TWi Pharmaceuticals since this was the division of Bora that would be manufacturing the generic version of Forfivo XL](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7118251062788055040/). Maybe someone there could convince me that their generic was going to be as good as brand?? Perhaps their acquisition strategy was to kill the brand so that their generic could capture the market??\n\nI left messages, no one called me back.\n\nI had a stockpile of 6 months, maybe 8 months if I rationed. Oh God what now?! Let me spare you the details. Through desperate searching realized the following:\n\n1. Almatica the makers of brand Forfivo XL is [actually Alvogen](https://www.almatica.com/contact-us)\n2. Although there are no *authorized generic* versions of Wellbutrin XL there **ARE** *authorized generic* versions of Forfivo XL. ([see list here](https://www.fda.gov/media/77725/download))\n3. The authorized generic manufacturer of Forfivo XL is Alvogen.\n\nAt first this made absolutely no sense to me. I was incredibly skeptical. You're telling me that a brand is going to undercut it's own market share by selling the **EXACT SAME DRUG** for less except it has completely different labeling? in 2022 Your paying a markup of like 4x the price when you buy ForfivoXL rather than Alvogen's Buproprion HCl because ...

Someone tell **[Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/)** they need to produce an episode on this cause I honestly don't get it.\n\nFrom the [**FDA's website**](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/abbreviated-new-drug-application-anda/fda-list-authorized-generic-drugs):\n\n**Is an Authorized Generic Drug the Same Thing as a Generic Drug?**\n\n> \"No. The term “authorized generic” drug is most commonly used to describe an approved brand name drug that is marketed without the brand name on its label. Other than the fact that it does not have the brand name on its label, it is the exact same drug product as the branded product. An authorized generic may be marketed by the brand name drug company, or another company with the brand company’s permission. In some cases, even though it is the same as the brand name product, a company may choose to sell the authorized generic at a lower cost than the brand name drug.\"\n\nHow is this rational behavior on the part of the manufacturer exactly? I still don't get it but does it really matter? -.- ****squints**** I mean maybe I'll figure it out.. someday? For now I don't care because I know that I don't have to figure out how the heck I'm going to pay for this god forsaken expensive drug that I can't seem to live without anymore.\n\n~JD31",

    "body": "To preface, I have dry skin and had heard good things about the Missha cleansing milk (this is not that product). I picked up this cleanser (around $10-11, on sale) because I couldn't find the cleansing milk at my local Missha store. Apparently they had run out so I decided to try my luck at what I hoped to be a similar product. I did look up the ingredients before buying since my skin is susceptible to a burning sensation when it doesn't like things. \n\nHere is the list: \nWater, Myristic Acid, Lauric Acid, Butylene Glycol, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Potassium Hydroxide, Glycol Distearate, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Nymphaea Coerulea Flower Extract, Lauramide DEA, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Acrylate Coploymer, Polyquaternium-7, Capylyl Glycol, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Hexylene Glycol, PEG-90M, Methyl Gluceth-10, Ethoxydiglycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Buthoxy Diglycol, Glycereth-26, Diglycerin, Diethoxy Diglycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nSo I've been using this since December and am almost out. I used to only use this during the PM but started using this both morning and night to wash away the eye goo and stuff (lolew?). I normally lather it up before I apply it to my face. \n\nThe product does claim to be a one step type of product - the kind that can remove your make up. I didn't really use it this way so I'm unsure how well it functions as one. I will say that I did use it a few times to remove my every day make up but I don't wear a lot of makeup to begin with - mascara, light eyeshadow, bbcream and light blush at most (mascara always). However, it DID remove all of that makeup when I tried to use it as a one step. So for lazy, light make up days I think it works. Of course, it worked just fine as a second cleanser. \n\nThe cleanser didn't burn my skin while in use nor did it feel stripping or drying or tight when I finished cleansing. It didn't have that \"clean\" feeling that ordinary soaps give but it felt like my face...was my face, if that makes sense. It felt like the whole day had been washed away but all the natural oils hadn't. I didn't even feel the need to rush to put on my toner when I get out of the shower, which is where I cleanse my face. I'm unsure what the ph is though, unfortunately, so I apologize since many people look for that in reviews. \n\nThere is a fragrance that goes away after you wash. The strength was that of a normal shampoo, I think. However if you're super sensitive to fragrances, this may not be for you. \n\nAnyway, I think I'd rate this a 4/5 only because it's not an HG right now. I would definitely repurchase this, but I'm still experimenting with cleansers so I can't say it's HG status just yet. It does its job without making my skin cranky! I also like that it's available at my local store lol. \n\nTLDR: It's a foamy milk cleanser, does agree with my dry, sensitive, hates the world skin. Not super drying, not super stripping and would RP. PH level currently unknown. \n\n",

With three filters covering UVA range, it seems impossible that this sunscreen would provide PPD of only 6.\n\nI can just notice that the official Eucerin website for China doesn't mention PPD, and this picture is one of the local importer's label. I used to see non-matching data on such labels before. (In this case, for example, according to your translation, the label says that the formula contains Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, when the Chinese site doesn't mention it. There could be more differences in the ingredient lists on the web site and this label.) Also, the translation that you provided says that it is a spray product, packed in a 120 ml bottle, which is not the case here. So, this label is really off.\n\nAs for EU regulation, it says that UVA protection should bet at least 1/3 of the UVB protection.

My other option was a mineral/physical sunscreen, but a lot of them are not cosmetically elegant -- often leaving a whitecast and/or a heavy, greasy feeling on top of my face.  This sunscreen is 100% brown skin-friendly, acne-prone skin approved!  It leaves no whitecast and it actually goes on like a chemical sunscreen.  It reapplies on top of make-up beautifully.  Best of all, it has not broken me out! Usually, within 4 days of using a sunscreen, I'll start to break out daily, but I have not had a new pimple since using this.  I wish the SPF was higher and had a PA rating of 4 +'s, but for now, this will have to do!  I will forever buy this sunscreen until I find something with a higher SPF and PA rating that ticks all the same boxes: does not cause breakouts, does not leave a whitecast, not heavy/greasy on face, and under $20 for 1.7 oz.",

Shave and rinse\n\n\n\nSo last night I used my go to cheap synthetic brush I picked up from AliExpress that works great with tube creams. I applied a little PreShave Oil, I applied three small drops of Gillette Pure to the brush. I did not know how much would be needed or if it would a make a lather at all since the cream right out of the tube was a little bit runny,  three drops was more than enough the cream lathered up like a champ and when dialed it had a bit of volume to it. The cream was very slick and I had plenty of residual slickness although I do use a PreShave as a heads up. Those three drops of cream gave me enough for about 7 passes. The shaving cream was definitely not artisan quality but for 6 oz at 6.50 it could be a decent bargain, the performance was solid the skin sensitivities part not so much \n\n\n\n\nThe negatives: The shaving cream was designed for people with skin sensitivities having no alcohol, parabens, sulfates, and dyes is great I just don't understand why they would include menthol and peppermint oil. The peppermint oil lit my face up like a Christmas tree plenty of redness and stinging. The menthol when in small doses can be pleasing but the Menthol and Peppermint combo was pretty brutal for my skin. If Gillette would drop these two ingredients I feel as if they'd have a nice product on their hands that I would gladly purchase but these two ingredients forced me to the return the tubes.All in all not a bad cream performance wise if you can stand the peppermint and menthol combo or enjoy those scents/feelings this may just be the best drug store cream for you , thanks for reading! \n",

    "body": "Cyclosporine, cyclosporin and ciclosporin are the same drug. It seems different ways of spelling you see are the result of spelling and naming/spelling conventions in different countries that happened and thus spelled them differently. How that happens is as follows from Wikipedia:\n\n*The natural product was named cyclosporin by the German-speaking scientists who first isolated it and cyclosporine when translated into English. Per* [*International Nonproprietary Name*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Nonproprietary_Name) *(INN) guidelines for drugs, the y was replaced with i so that the INN for the medication is spelled ciclosporin.*\n\n*Ciclosporin is the INN and the* [*British Approved Name*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Approved_Name) *(BAN), while cyclosporine is the* [*United States Adopted Name*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Adopted_Name) *(USAN) and cyclosporin is a former BAN.*\n\nIn the USA it is spelled cyclosporine and that is how I will go forward since I am in the USA.\n\nAdditionally, cyclosporine goes by different brand names since they are formulated differently and come from different companies. The brands include the following:\n\n[Restasis](https://www.restasis.com/) = 0.05% cyclosporine in a solution of glycerin and castor oil…some people are irritated by castor oil…it is preservative free\n\n[Cequa](https://www.cequa.com/) = 0.09% in a Nano micellar solution (it is complicated, but as I understand the word, it means very small molecules than make the solution in question more bioavailable to the targeted location) that does not require an emulsion. It is preservative free.\n\n[Vevye](https://www.vevye.com/patient/index.html) = 0.1% cyclosporine in a new water free solution that has some research that indicates the formulation starts to show positive results in 30 days…it is preservative free. It will released as early as this week.\n\n[Ikervis](https://www.drugs.com/uk/ikervis.html) = 0.1% Cyclosporine It also contains medium-chain triglycerides, cetalkonium chloride, glycerol, and tyloxapol, poloxamer 188, sodium hydroxide (to adjust pH) and water. It is preservative free. It is not approved in the USA. It is approved in Europe, Australia and some Asian countries.\n\n[Klarity-C](https://www.imprimisrx.com/s/klaritycdropspf) = 0.1% cyclosporine with twice as much of the drug as in Restasis; it has lubricants with it (dextran, glycerol, and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose) in a chondroitin sulfate emulsion. It is preservative free.\n\nBasically cyclosporine is an immunosuppressant and anti-inflammatory drug. The idea is to reduce inflammation. This effect is expected to increase tear production via improving the lacrimal systems ability to produce tears. Thus it is commonly prescribed for those with Aqueous Tear Deficiency (ATD) and may reduce inflammation that causes Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD).\n\nOne of the downside issues for patients with most of these cyclosporine drugs is it can take up to 6 months for the drug to show positive results, if it is going to do so, depending on which type one receives and your unique biology. That is why the newest cyclosporine to just come on the market in January of 2024 (Vevye) is desirable since it has some research to show it begins to take effect in 15 days and show improvement in symptoms in 30 days. Better still 99.8 percent of patients reported no, or only mild stinging or burning when putting the drops in their eyes which is not the case for some with the other versions of the drug.\n\nAs usual, I have asked our new AI friends to tell us what they know and I will put any of my comments to what they have written in italics.\n\nQuestion put to ChatGPT\n\n**What can you tell me about the use of cyclosporine for treating dry eye disease with eye drops that includes the history of the drug, the risks/benefits of using the drug and the efficacy of the drug?**\n\nAnswer:\n\nCyclosporine, used in eye drops for treating dry eye disease, has an interesting history and efficacy profile:\n\nHistory:\n\nDevelopment:\n\nOriginally developed as an immunosuppressive drug to prevent organ transplant rejection.\n\nOphthalmic Use:\n\nIts anti-inflammatory properties led to its adaptation for ophthalmic use, particularly for chronic dry eye disease.\n\nMechanism:\n\nAction: Cyclosporine acts by inhibiting certain immune factors that contribute to inflammation in the eye, helping to increase tear production and improve tear film stability.\n\nEfficacy:\n\nClinical Trials: Studies have shown that cyclosporine eye drops can effectively increase tear production and reduce symptoms of dry eye.\n\nLong-Term Use: It's beneficial for long-term management of dry eye, especially in cases related to autoimmune conditions like Sjögren's syndrome.\n\nRisks/Benefits:\n\nBenefits: Reduced eye inflammation, improved tear quality, and relief from dry eye symptoms.\n\nRisks: Potential side effects include eye burning, stinging, redness, or temporary blurred vision. Rarely, allergic reactions can occur.\n\nUsage:\n\nDosage: Typically prescribed as a twice-daily regimen.\n\nSlow Onset of Action: Full benefits may take several weeks to months to manifest, as the medication gradually alters the underlying inflammatory processes.\n\nConclusion:\n\nCyclosporine eye drops offer a valuable treatment option for dry eye disease, particularly for patients with an underlying inflammatory component. Its benefits in improving tear production and reducing discomfort can significantly enhance the quality of life. However, like any medication, it should be used under the guidance of an eye care professional, considering the balance between its efficacy and potential side effects.\n\n*OK, that all seems pretty straight forward and consistent with all I have read about these drugs. On to the next AI bot.*\n\n**The same question was put to Anthropic’s AI named Claude:**\n\nWhat can you tell me about the use of cyclosporine for treating dry eye disease with eye drops that includes the history of the drug, the risks/benefits of using the drug and the efficacy of the drug?\n\nClaude answers:\n\nHere is a summary of the use of cyclosporine eye drops for treating dry eye disease:\n\nHistory\n\n\\- Cyclosporine is an immunomodulatory drug that has been used systemically since the 1980s to prevent organ transplant rejection.\n\n\\- In the 1990s and early 2000s, researchers began investigating cyclosporine as a topical eye drop to treat dry eye disease. It works by suppressing inflammation.\n\n\\- Restasis was approved by the FDA in 2003 as the first prescription eye drop to treat chronic dry eyes. It contains 0.05% cyclosporine.\n\nBenefits\n\n\\- Reduces inflammation and irritation associated with dry eye\n\n\\- Increases tear production in some patients\n\n\\- Improves symptoms like grittiness, soreness, burning sensation\n\n\\- Enables some patients to decrease their use of artificial tears\n\nRisks\n\n\\- Burning or stinging when the drops are administered\n\n\\- Potential risk of eye infection\n\n\\- May take weeks or months to notice improvement\n\n\\- Does not work for all patients\n\n\\- Expensive without insurance coverage\n\nEfficacy\n\n\\- Restasis has been shown in trials to improve signs and symptoms compared to vehicle in patients with moderate-to-severe dry eye. *(Henry note: well it is a bit interesting that Claude only names the Restasis brand. Understandable as it has been around the longest.)*\n\n\\- One study found cyclosporine 0.05% worked in about 15% more patients compared to vehicle drops.\n\n\\- Complete clearing of symptoms is uncommon - most patients see improvement but may not achieve complete relief. *(Henry note: This is certainly true. Additionally thing could be getting worse while one is waiting the up to 6 months for it to show any positive results if it will show positive results for you.)*\n\n\\- Frequent administration (twice daily) seems to produce better results than less frequent dosing.\n\nSo in summary, cyclosporine eye drops can provide symptomatic relief for many patients with chronic dry eye, but they do not work for everyone, can take time to work, and the benefits have to be weighed against potential side effects.\n\n*This seems to be an accurate assessment from Claude to me from my readings over the years. I would add my experience was good for 5 years with just Restasis. What I did not know during that time (and the prescribing doctor probably did not know) things were relentlessly progressing for the worse in the background as my obstructive Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD) got worse.*\n\nOK, I think we have the job done on an introduction. \n\nThe research list page and a video on this topic are linked for you below:\n\nCyclosporine = Restasis; Cequa; Ikervis; Klarity-C; Vevye…Published Research List\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/MeibomianGlandIssues/comments/195psgx/cyclosporine\\_restasis\\_cequa\\_ikervis\\_klarityc/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MeibomianGlandIssues/comments/195psgx/cyclosporine_restasis_cequa_ikervis_klarityc/)\n\nWhat Is Cyclosporine? | Restasis, Cequa, or Klarity-C For Dry Eye\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/MeibomianGlandIssues/comments/196kuos/what\\_is\\_cyclosporine\\_restasis\\_cequa\\_or\\_klarityc/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MeibomianGlandIssues/comments/196kuos/what_is_cyclosporine_restasis_cequa_or_klarityc/)",

    "body": "Hi All,\n\nI just wanted to report my experience with a popular Italian supplement brand showing up on amazon in the eu.\n\nI recently purchased quite a few supplements from this company in a late night moment of poor decision making.  I knew I was taking a risk and stocked up on ALA, Astaxanthin, Vitamin K2, Astragalus, and Bromelain.\n\nProduct page: [https://www.bandini-pharma.co.uk/bromelain/](https://www.bandini-pharma.co.uk/bromelain/)\n\nThe only ingredient is listed as Bromelain - \"Bromelain 2500 GDU/g from Ananas comosus (L.) Merr. dry extract, vegetable capsule (glazing agent: hydroxypropyl methylcellulose).\"\n\nBromelain is expected to be water soluble.\n\n**Tests Performed**\n\n* Solubility - I emptied 3 capsules in 10ml of phosphate buffered distilled water (ph 7.5) and observed that that the coarse white powder did not dissolve. Up to 500ml was added with the same result. This indicates that there is either an unlisted ingredient, or the Bromelain was a poor quality incomplete extraction, or it's not bromelain at all.\n   * The water was removed from the sample via a buchner funnel after 1 hour.  The dry weight was 80% of the original sample, therefore no more than 20% bromelain - and I likely lost some due to handling.\n* Gelatin Hydrolysis - 3 capsules were once again emptied into 10ml of phosphate buffered water.  A small amount of cystein was added as a reducing agent to preserve enzymatic activity. A control of 10ml phosphate buffered distilled water was prepared.  A thin gelatin strip was submerged in each.  The temperature  was brought to 40C and the strips were checked every 30 minutes for 6 hours (after which the enzymatic activity is likely to be exhausted).\n   * There was zero difference in the state of hydrolysis / any visible signs of breakdown between the Bandini Bromelain test and the control.\n\nThere are shelf stability issues with Bromelain.  But it is the responsibility of supplement sellers to take this into account in how the product is prepared.  The \"best by\" date is listed as October 2027 at which point no bromelain supplement will have much activity left unless it is Lyophilized - and even those lose 10% every 100 days or so.\n\nI wrote to the company with the concerns above and did not hear back after a week.\n\nBandini markets themselves as a \"premium\" company and also use \"pharma\" terminology.   Hope this helps anyone that is considering purchasing one of their products.",

I suspect other pills that turn to slime also use the same mechanism.\n\nHypromellose (aka hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC)) is a gelling agent which turns into a moisture-retaining slime in the presence of small amounts of water. It's based on cellulose and I therefore suspect that this can be broken down by the enzyme cellulase. \n\nYou can buy \"digestive enzyme\" supplements containing cellulase online, I suspect that this could be mixed into water and put with the HPMC solution at around 35*C to break down the HPMC. \n\nI haven't tried it yet, please let me know if you do.",

I did try searching for this issue but couldn't seem to turn up the result I needed, so I'm sorry if this has already been asked and answered or if I do anything wrong!\n\nBasically, I've been searching for a perfect match in foundation for years, and I think I've finally found it in Bare Minerals Original SPF Foundation. I love the colour match, the feel, the way it doesn't seem to break me out, everything. Except... I've been finding that I end up with really patchy skin, exactly like the picture in this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/3zys04/help_why_is_my_makeup_patchy_is_it_the_products_i/ \n\nFrom reading the comments in that post, it seems that the issue tends to stem from using a water based primer against a silicone based foundation and vice versa. But I can't figure out if that's what I'm doing. I'm using Bare Minerals Blemish Remedy Mattifying Prep Gel as a primer (which feels nice and seems to be helping any spots) which I think is water-based, but I'm just not sure of the foundation. So I'm hoping someone here can help! If it is the case, I'd rather drop the primer than the foundation so if anyone has any primer recommendations I'd love to hear them :)\n\n**Ingredients of BareMinerals Original Foundation:** Bismuth Oxychloride (CI 77163), Zinc Oxide (CI 77947), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, 77492, 77499), Mica (CI 77019).\n\n**Ingredients of Blemish Remedy Mattifying Prep Gel:** Water (Aqua/Eau), Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Adipic Acid/Neopentyl Glycol Crosspolymer, Silica, Sclerotium Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Lecithin, Populus Tremuloides Bark Extract, Ganoderma Lucidum (Mushroom) Stem Extract, Micrococcus Lysate, Serenoa Serrulata Fruit Extract, Dimethicone, Zinc Pca, Vp/Va Copolymer, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Amodimethicone, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Sodium Hydroxide, Limonene, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.\n\nIf it's relevant, I've recently (as in about a week now) started an Oil Cleansing Method routine using jojoba oil, a foaming cleanser with BHA and argan oil - could any of this be part of the issue if it's not the makeup? I know oil dissolves makeup but I usually only apply a light coverage of argan oil as moisturiser in the morning, and let it dry completely for 10+ minutes. It's doing absolute wonders for my skin, so I wouldn't want to drop it but would love to hear if this is the issue so I can try and work around it.\n\nThank you all so much!",

The only thing I know to suggest is that honestly a lot of people have seemed to dislike the Blemish Remedy Gel. I've heard better results when it's used with the Blemish Ready Foundation, but overall it doesn't seem to be a favorite. It might be worth just trying out a couple of primers to see if that's the problem. If you have a bareminerals boutique near you, you can ask for samples of a few primers--I'd suggest trying the oil control version of Prime Time and maybe the original!",

In cases where that has happened to me, the patchiness is much more apparent in areas where my skin get most oily, (around the nose/inner cheeks) and if there's less product to rub off, the patchiness will be less obvious.  \n\nPersonally I've seen this problem a lot with powder products, although it can happen with and formula. I think they just don't layer very well compared to liquids. \n\nLastly, as you already said, try ditching the primer. If using no primer is unsuccessful, you'll just have to start experimenting with different bases/textures. I know it sounds annoying but if you're wedded to a particular product sometimes that's what you get stuck with!",

I've tried using different types of primers, foundations, powders, and setting sprays but so far I've only learned a few things:  \n  \n- It tends to happen on days where I'm quite stressed or sweating a bit more.  \n- It also happens if I keep powdering my nose all day. Basically the build up of too much product getting cakey.  \n- It looks worse when I use primers instead of moisturisers as a base.  \n  \nThings that helped:    \n\n- Using a longer lasting foundation like MAC's pro long wear nourishing foundation or Max Factor's Lasting Performance foundation for a more affordable alternative.  \n- A mineral based loose powder dabbed/patted on (not wiped on)  \n- NYX's matte finish setting spray.   \n  \nIf it starts happening during the day and I'm at work so I can't just take it all off and start again, I sometimes use a very light CC cream (I use Bourjois 123 Perfect CC cream) and pat a tiny bit on the affected area to smooth it out and then after a minute or so pat on some powder.  \n  \nI hope that makes sense or any of it helps :)",

Comparatively, to the other 4 I've done so far this one literally outshines all of them. \n\nThe mask fit my face like a glove. It was like wearing a second skin. The slight honey smell was heavenly. It also wasn't too saturated with serum/goopy stuff. (Like there wasn't stuff running down my neck) \n\nThe next morning I was glowing so much (despite being sick for the past week) that my co workers were commenting that I must be feeling better because my face looked amazing.

        "body": "Hi all! I'm a moderate level sheet masker, just a couple times a week. I tried both the Kocorium and Wonjn masks, and I also tried a Papa Recipe Bombee Honey mask for the first time. \n\n**Kocorium Royal Jelly Mask**    \n**Ingredient Pros and Cons**    \n*Pros:* Alcohol-free, royal jelly extract, sodium hyaluronate, Betaine, Trehalose, lotus extract, Beta-Glucan, Panthenol, Arginine    \n*Cons:* Lime, Lemon, and Grapefruit Extracts (irritants), Ascorbic Acid (likely oxidized in this formula and therefore actively bad for skin), Apricot Kernel Oil (comedogenic for me), Saccharomyces Ferment (doesn’t agree with me), fragrance    \n**Thoughts:** There are a lot of good humectants and skin conditioners in this formula, but the number of “bad” ingredients in this for my super picky skin means I probably would not normally try this mask. Since it was a club freebie, I figured I would risk a trial. Right now, I particularly don’t mind things with a little more oil than I would usually use, because I’m doing a series of weekly microdermabrasions, so my skin is more dry than usual. However, this was still a bust for me. The perfume of the mask, while not an unpleasant scent (sweet and and a sort of spicy floral and honey), was absolutely overpowering. That alone would rule it out for repurchase for me, and I had to throw out the extra essence, which is sad because there was a ton of essence in the packet! I was intrigued by the texture of the mask. It has an unusually slimy feel--is it some kind of special fabric? It had a slightly irritating feel while on for me--I would have guessed it had alcohol in it, if I didn’t know otherwise. It dried in about average time while on, around 30 minutes, but it didn’t end up feeling particularly hydrating, which surprised me considering the hydrating ingredient list. I don’t know how to describe the residue it’s left, but it isn’t terribly pleasant. It’s not exactly sticky, but it feels sort of...dirty. It reminds me of when you get a residue on stuff in a kitchen from aerosolized cooking oil building up on something. This isn’t the worst mask I’ve ever used. I don’t seem to be having any adverse reactions. But it’s definitely not something I would use again, either. \n\n**Wonjin Effect 3 Step Honey Bomb**    \n**Ingredients Pros and Cons**    \n*Pros:* Alcohol free, hydroxyacetophenone (I only just learned that this is an antioxidant and soothing agent, not just some filler chemical for texture!), Trehalose, Arginine, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (getting on the licorice train early), sodium hyaluronate, panthenol, royal jelly extract, propolis extract    \n*Cons:* Argan Oil, Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Jojoba Oil, Shea Butter extract. These are all oils that I legit know break me out. Booo. PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil is really high on the ingredients list, which is usually okay for me in very small amounts, but gets dicey when there is more. \n\n**Thoughts:** This is another mask I would not have tried on my own, based on the relatively large breakout potential here. The skin soothing, hydrating, and nourishing ingredients here are really fantastic, though. I liked the very light honey scent. It appears to be just a function of the actual ingredients and not an added synthetic fragrance, which I also like. I’m pretty easy to please in terms of texture and fit--it seemed fine to me. It dried down in about average time. Alas! I immediately had two small pustules afterwards. I basically only get pustule-type blemishes in response to certain skin care ingredients, so I’m pretty sure it was the mask. Sad face. But, read on for some additional thoughts on that subject below. I did not register a strong overall moisturizing effect, but I used this mask on a day when my skin was super dry and dehydrated, and I think it might not have been able to overcome all that. Also, I think it’s possible the honey milk step might be somewhat occlusive and have prevented the mask from working to its maximum effect.\n    \nWhich brings me to the steps. I personally feel like the three step thing is overkill. It also seems like they are out of order. It seems strange to me that you are meant to apply a cream product *first*, *then* an ampoule, *then* the sheet mask. I felt weird going through my normal toners, essences, etc, and then adding in another extra 2 steps before getting to the sheet mask. I applied the “honey milk” lightly, but decided to skip the ampoule step and try using it separately another time. In retrospect, I wish I had skipped the honey milk, since it is a cream type product I would not normally use at all due to the presence of problem oils. When I contemplated this later, I realized that the problem oils listed on the mask ingredients are probably mostly or entirely in that honey milk step! The mask essence itself is clear (whereas ones with significant oil content are usually cloudy “milky” essences). So, my guess is that if I skipped the honey milk step entirely, this mask might actually *not* break me out. So I’m going to try using up the remaining essence and then the ampoule as face stuff. It’s nice that the steps are in little separate perforated packets, because it to use them at separate times and stash the honey milk somewhere to use as a hand cream. (I put little hand creams everywhere in my house and purse and desk at work, because my hands are super dry, and I always want one in reach.)    \nEven if the essence and ampoule turn out to be skin-safe for me on their own, I probably won’t repurchase because of meh performance for me at a premium price. However, considering the stellar ingredients list, inoffensive scent, and lots of good reviews, I would still recommend trying it to someone who doesn’t have problems with the oils. \n\n**Papa Recipe Bombee Honey**    \nI hate to be an forum clone, but the Papa Recipe Bombee mask was absolutely amazing, and I have totally joined the cult. I won't go into a ton of detail on it, since there's so much written about it everywhere, but it's the first sheet mask I've used where I ever had that immediate visible effect everyone is always talking about in AB. My skin was softer, plumper, and \"glowing.\" This persisted the next day. I had no idea I could love a sheet mask this much. I bought a whole box. \n\nI’m a little obsessed with bee products now, and I want them all. I’ve already got way too much to test in my lineup right now to buy more, though!",

        "body": "**Kocorium Royal Jelly Mask**\n\n\n\nA little late, but I used the Kocorium Royal Jelly mask last night. Traveling over the holidays meant I didn't mask for the past three weeks, but I'm glad to be back into the groove!\n\nThe first thing I noticed about this mask was the oddly slippery essence. It reminded me a little bit of the Naruko snail masks. The fit was near perfect for my face, close around the eyes and mouth but not too small and only a tiny bit of extra coverage on my hair line. My skin has been a bit irritable lately since I haven't been masking, but this was very soothing and didn't sting or itch despite the citrus extracts. \n\n\nThe smell was strong enough for me to notice through a stuffy nose, and a bit floral? I'm not the best with scents. I wore the mask for only 30 minutes instead of adding in extra essence as it dried like I normally do. There was a ton of extra, enough for me to pat some in after I took it off last night and again this morning. \n\n\nIt dried a little tacky, but it went away after I applied lotion. I didn't notice any brightening or redness reduction (I'm so red right now it would have been nice...) but it did make my skin incredibly soft! Even this morning after applying some extra essence I kept touching my face while on the way to work. My skin also felt a bit moisturized as well as hydrated, like when I add a drop of oil to a toner. Overall pretty happy with the masks, but they don't seem easy to find now that Kmall24 stopped carrying them.\n\n\n\n**February Masks**\n\n\nI already have some of the Tsaio and Evercos, so I'll definitely review those along with any others we pick. I haven't tried Lovemore or Maskingdom masks before, so I'd love to do one of those two. The Lovemore masks are available on Amazon prime as well.",

I also used an old favorite [Papa Recipe Bombee Honey](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_1322251027.html) ($19 for 10). \n\nThe *Bombee Honey* smells like apple pie and the paper is very thin and they fit well. The essence is rich and luxurious.  It's a lovely product and has honey and propolis. I use it when my skin is dry.  \n\nThe *Hada Labo* come 30 folded in a zip lock bag and they are milky. The paper is thick and ill fitting (long). But they have a ceramide and squalane and HA and are very hypo allergenic.  I love that they are unscented. Very gentle quick fix, though not elegant.   \n\n *Leaders* are quite nice and thin like Recipe's. They felt moisturizing. Has 17 amino acids and a bit of ceramide. It's got a lot of essence and they fit well.  This one is suited for dry skin. Alas, it ihas some mild fragrance. It's not a problem as it's not an essentail oil or extract, but I really prefer unscented products these days. It seems like a decent brand. I'd have to use it more to fully judge it.  \n\nNot a big masker, as I have sensitive skin and so many have extracts and that I prefer to just layer my toners & essences.  I use them once or twice a month. As it's really cold and dismal out. So I have been doing a nightly sheet mask this week.   I haven't tried the new Benton masks. Can't say I am happy at the loss of azelaic but I'd use it. So few unscented options:  Benton, CosRX snail, Hada Labo.  Those are mostly what I use.  Also been doing some DIY masks with colloidal oatmal and water. I shove one of those plastic mask covers over it, but I cut the ear flaps as it was so tight.",

At first when I opened, I was like ... \"where's the honey?\" I was expecting a stronger honey smell. But maybe I became accustomed to the smell after some time, because I felt like I could smell the honey a lot more later on? Anyways, I didn't mind it. The smell sorta reminds me of those, like, fragrant \"guest soaps\" you put out, but not in a bad way. \n\nThe material and fit were good for me. Thicker mask. (Honestly, sheet mask material and fit aren't really factors in whether I like a mask or not. I don't care if it's thin, thick, silk, cotton, cellulose, etc. And I have a huge head/face, so it's not super hard for me to get a mask to fit.)\n\nThe essence was clear and rather thick. Very slippery. Lube-y, in a good way. Be careful when you're unfolding it, cause it will go EVERYWHERE if you're not careful. Also, there's TONS OF ESSENCE. Hooray! :D Honestly, I wish that re-soaked the mask after first use, since, imo, there was more than enough for a second go. Instead, I just kept re-applying, re-applying, re-applying the excess in the bag on my bare face. \n\nIt takes a while to absorb completely. (But, then again, I ended up with, like, ten layers of the essence on my face.) But I like the results! My face feels quite hydrated, and I think it looks quite a bit brighter. If I had more of these, I'd try them before bed. \n\nI'd definitely use again! \n\nAlso, I vote for the Lovemore mask. (It'd be the easiest for me to obtain, not gonna lie.)",

One popular hoax that was circulated claimed that lemons were 10,000 times as effective as chemotherapy and that there was a coverup by pharmaceutical companies because they couldn't profit from it. As much as I would love for that to be the case, it is sadly not accurate, as investigated by snopes: [https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/lemon-zinger/](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/lemon-zinger/). I did my own research on it as well, and could not find any reference to these laboratory tests, nor find any reproduction of anything close to those results in any clinical trial.\n\nHappily, it is true that lemons do seem to posses some amount of anticancer activity, through several pathways. One of the more promising is the limonene, found in citrus peels: \"\\[...\\] limonene distributed extensively to human breast tissue and reduced breast tumor cyclin D1 expression that may lead to cell cycle arrest and reduced cell proliferation.\" - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3692564/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3692564/). It's an active area of research,\n\nAnother pathway is by the simple fact that fruit is generally good for you. There's an endless amount of studies that prove what we already know - eat your fruits and vegetables if you care more about lowering your chances of getting cancer than you care about that bag of potato chips: \"In this large multinational European cohort, the consumption of food products with a higher FSAm-NPS score (lower nutritional quality) was associated with a higher risk of cancer.\" - [https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002651](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002651)\n\nInterestingly, eating citrus fruits seems to reduce the rate of gastric cancer as well:\n\n\"The result was 13% reduction of gastric cancer according to the intake of citrus fruit (sES, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.99; I-squared=69.6%). In subgroup analysis, it was found that the intake of citrus fruit inhibited cardia gastric cancer (CGC) (sES, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.81; I-squared=46.1%) and as a result of DRMR, 100 g of citrus fruit intake per day inhibits CGC by 40% (relative risk, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.83).\"- [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27457064](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27457064). While this is not quite as directly useful for the case of breast cancer patients, it is interesting nonetheless and lends additional credence to the supposed anticancer properties of lemons.\n\nThis seems to prove true for breast cancer patients as well: \"Among the tested limonoids, 11 limonoids exhibited cytotoxicity on MCF-7 whereas 8 limonoids showed cytotoxicity against the MDA-MB-231 cell lines. Although most of the limonoids showed anti-aromatase activity, the inhibition of proliferation was not related to the anti-aromatase activity. On the other hand, the anti-proliferative activity was significantly correlated with caspase-7 activation by limonoids. Our findings indicated that the citrus limonoids may have potential for the prevention of estrogen-responsive breast cancer (MCF-7) via caspase-7 dependent pathways.\" - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23117440](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23117440)\n\nOne important thing to note from that study is that the limonoids were extracted from lemon seed powder. This is an interesting area of research, as there may be different limonoids contained in the fruit, the peel, and the seeds. We know that the fruit and the peel are beneficial, but I have not come across any recipe for the seeds yet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 2: Garlic**\n\nGarlic has been shown to both help prevent cancer, and exhibit anticancer properties in cancer patients. A decent, but conservative, overview can be found here: [https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/garlic-fact-sheet](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/garlic-fact-sheet)\n\n\"Several population studies show an association between increased intake of garlic and reduced risk of certain cancers, including cancers of the stomach, colon, esophagus, pancreas, and breast.\"\n\n\"Protective effects from garlic may arise from its antibacterial properties (17) or from its ability to block the formation of cancer-causing substances (18), halt the activation of cancer-causing substances (19), enhance DNA repair (20), reduce cell proliferation, or induce cell death (10). \"\n\nIf you're familiar with garlic, then you're likely already familiar with some of its side effects - primarily bad breath, and a potential burning sensation if you eat it raw. I like to think that those are pretty easy to endure in exchange for a potential anticancer effect. However, garlic may also increase the risk of bleeding or bruising, as well as having a few drug interactions - start with those listed here [https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/garlic](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/garlic) and, as always, consult with your doctor to make sure that it won't interact.\n\nAnd those benefits are quite impressive -\n\n\"\\[...\\] found that 2-3 hours of exposure to garlic extract (fresh but not boiled) was sufficient to arrest the growth and alter the morphology of MCF7 \\[breast cancer\\] cells.\" - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3463925/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3463925/)\n\n\"Collectively, these results indicate that structurally distinctive organoselenium compounds are superior to their corresponding sulfur analogs in cancer chemoprevention. Additionally, synthetic aromatic selenocyanates are more effective cancer chemopreventive agents than the naturally occurring selenoamino acids. \\[...\\] these potent cancer chemopreventive synthetic selenium compounds can be synthesized by garlic and related allium foods.\" - [https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/136/3/864S/4664422](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/136/3/864S/4664422)\n\n\"This investigation of CGE \\[crude garlic extract\\] clearly highlights the fact that the lipid bioactive compounds in CGE have the potential as promising anticancer agents.\" - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25608085](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25608085)\n\nGarlic also appears to help improve the immune system, which as we all know, is critical in cancer patients:\n\n\"The included study found that people who took garlic every day for three months (instead of a placebo) had fewer colds. That is, over the three‐month period, there were 24 occurrences of the common cold in the garlic group, compared to 65 in the placebo group.\" - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0013804/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0013804/)\n\n\"After 45 d of consuming an encapsulated aged garlic extract, γδ-T cells (p = 0.039, n = 56) and NK cells (p = 0.043, n = 56) were shown to proliferate better compared to placebo. After 90 d of supplementation, illness diary entries showed that the incidence of colds and flu, a secondary outcome, were not statistically different; however, the group consuming the aged garlic extract appeared to have reduced severity \\[...\\]\" - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22280901](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22280901)\n\nNote that the primary benefit comes from raw garlic. You can't cook it (no, not even light heat), nor can you use garlic powder. The reason is that compounds like allicin are present only in raw, uncooked garlic after it has been crushed. So, only fresh, raw, uncooked garlic. Again, not ideal, but hey, neither is cancer - \"These studies suggest that heating destroyed garlic's active allyl sulfur compound formation, which may relate to its anticancer properties.\" - [https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/131/3/1054S/4687116](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/131/3/1054S/4687116)\n\nUpdate: I've done some research on what the best alternative garlic delivery mechanism is, since eating it raw is unpalatable for most. This study analyzes the allicin yields of various supplements: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6073756/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6073756/) See Table 1 for a list of supplements tested and Table 12 for the results. \n\nIt also contained helpful instructions for how to create your own garlic capsules, which would allow you to guarantee the highest quality yield:\n\n\"The control for 100% ABB was prepared by homogenization of 500 g of peeled raw garlic cloves (California Late variety, Garlic World, Gilroy, CA, USA; 39.5% dry weight), after addition of water at 0.60 mL/g, in an Osterizer blender at the highest speed for 2 min. This allowed alliinase to transform all of the alliin to known amounts of allicin and other allyl thiosulfinates. The homogenate was divided into 50-mL jars and stored at −80 °C, under which condition the allyl thiosulfinates have been shown to be stable for at least 24 months \\[37\\]. Prior to consumption, the homogenate was thawed overnight at 4 °C, at which temperature the allyl thiosulfinates have been shown to be stable for at least 3 days \\[30\\]. After thawing, the homogenate was further macerated with a high speed Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann, Kinematica AG, Luzern, Switzerland) with a 12-mm generator for 1 min at speed 6 of 10. This made it possible for the viscous homogenate to pass through the modified tip (drilled to 3 mm, inside diameter) of a 10-mL disposable syringe. At the time of consumption, a specific weight of the homogenate was transferred by syringe into the bottom of one or more size 0 hypromellose (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose) capsules (vegetarian capsules). The bottom of the size 0 capsule rested inside the bottom of a size 00 capsule to prevent aqueous allicin from coming in contact with the throat. The capsule was then closed with the top of a size 00 capsule. Under these conditions, the outer capsule remained firm and tasteless for 6 min. The standard control was 1.4 g of garlic homogenate, which was made from 0.88 g of raw garlic (0.35 g dry wt).\"\n\n...If you're willing to buy one of these [https://www.thomassci.com/scientific-supplies/Polytron-Homogenizer](https://www.thomassci.com/scientific-supplies/Polytron-Homogenizer) or its equivalents and go through all of those steps, that is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 3: CROSSOVER EPISODE!**\n\nSo, lemon is good, garlic is good. What happens when you put them together? Even better things!\n\n\"The combination of both extracts \\[garlic and lemon\\] acts synergistically against breast cancer in mice. Of the treated mice, 80% were cured using this combination. This combination inhibited angiogenesis, induced apoptosis, and caused systemic activation in the immune system.\" - [https://www.nutritionjrnl.com/article/S0899-9007(17)30126-0/fulltext](https://www.nutritionjrnl.com/article/S0899-9007(17)30126-0/fulltext)\n\nSo they loaded up mice with breast cancer, fed them a regular diet, regular diet + garlic, regular diet + lemon, and regular diet + garlic + lemon. 60% of mice treated with either garlic OR lemon had no detectable tumor at the end of the study. 80% of mice treated with both had no detectable tumor at the end of the study.\n\nThat should be extremely exciting news. Now, of course there are several caveats, being that this is merely a mouse model, the effect may have been specific to that specific breast cancer cell line, and so on. However, from my time of reading lots of these types of studies, I would personally file this under the category of \"really #@$!ing exciting results\".\n\nHere's the relevant bits of how they created their cancer-wrecking supplement for mice:\n\n\"Fresh garlic (Allium sativumL.) bulbs and lemon (Citrus limonL.) fruits were provided from local farms in Jordan. Plant materials were washed and dried in a shed. Peeled garlic bulbs and whole lemon fruits (peels and fleshy parts) were used to prepare extracts. To mimic the method for preparing lemon juice and other recipes, water was selected as a solvent to prepare extracts. We chopped 500 g of each plant material into small pieces and vigorously mixed them with 1 L of distilled water using electric mixer. The resulted solution was filtered to remove insoluble material and diluted to prepare different concentrations for each extract. The stock solution (500 mg/L) was diluted by tissue culture media to prepare increasing concentration (30 – 100 mg/mL) of each extract. Extracts were freshly prepared before each experiment to avoid deterioration due to storage. Mice were gavaged daily with 50 mg/kg garlic extract + 50 mg/kg lemon extract.\"\n\nNow, for the unfortunate part - scaling up that mouse dose for a human model requires significant amounts of garlic and lemon. For a 150lb (68kg) human, that would require 3400mg of extract, which would mean about 3400g of plant material. Each. Last time I prepared this, that turned out to a bit more than 30 lemons and 30 bulbs of garlic. Which then has to be ingested every day.\n\nThis is a significant barrier to trying this on a larger scale, not only because of the difficulty of preparing that much raw material ever day, but then figuring out how to ingest it. Because let me tell you, while the prepared lemon mixture may be tolerable to drink, but raw garlic is an incredibly intense experience that probably is not for the faint of heart. I am actively searching for ways to ease this, so any insight or suggestions would be greatly appreciated - because as annoying as it is to try to consume, those results simply look too good to ignore, despite the early stage of the research.",

I'm talking closed comedones, itchy red pustules on cheeks and jaw. I continued applying it for another week in hopes that it was merely purging, both on its own and layering it over another moisturizer, yet my skin kept getting worse and I had to stop as I saw no benefits and my eyes stung after a few hours.

I used this in hopes of repairing my barrier.\n\nIt pilled after a few hours of wear - I noticed it pills less after using it on its own, without moisturizing my skin with another moisturizer first. There is a noticable sheen when applying only a pea-sized amount of product, but after a while it went away - cannot imagine the sheen upon applying the \"proper\" sunscreen amount, though.\n\nOverall, this made me wary of Cicaplast in general, I'm no skincare expert so I'm wondering if I should give the regular one a try after some time.",

It was synthesized by Bristol Myers Squibb in 1986 and is now being brought to market by Fabre-Kramer Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of MDD (major depressive disorder) and GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) under the brand name EXXUA™. Clinical trials for MDD have concluded, and trials for GAD are currently in phase 3. For MDD, The FDA has set a PDUFA action date (which I understand is a regulatory review) for June 23, 2023, so from what I understand it should be hitting the market soon after that.\n\n\nSimilarities to Buspirone:\n\n\n* Both drugs function as 5HT1A serotonin receptor partial agonists. Meaning, they occupy the 5HT1A receptor sites and have an effect less than that of serotonin which allows them to function as an inhibitor. Inhibition at the 5HT1A site results in anxiolytic activity.\n\n\n* Both drugs produce 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-piperazine (1-PP) as a metabolite, which is an agonist of the Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor.\n\n\nDifferences from Buspirone:\n\n\n* It’s an ER (extended release) medication, meaning it will only need to be taken once daily. “Gepirone ER uses a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose formulation to mediate extended release of the active ingredient, which facilitates absorption over 16 hours. This extended release mechanism allows for once daily administration.”\n\n\n* When taken with food, AUC (area under the curve, which is the amount of the drug that gets absorbed by your body) increases by “up to 37%”, compared to 100% (fully doubling) with Buspirone.\n\n\n* It is NOT an antagonist of the dopamine D2 receptor, unlike Buspirone\n\n\nAccording to Fabre-Kramer, “EXXUA™ is a significantly stronger anxiolytic than buspirone, with no dopaminergic effects.”\n\nIf you’d like to read more: \n\n[Briefing to the FDA](https://pink.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/-/media/pmbi-old-site/supporting-documents/the-pink-sheet-daily/2015/november/gepirone_ac_fk_briefing.pdf)\n\n\n[Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gepirone)\n\n\n[Fabre-Kramer site](https://fabrekramer.com/pipeline/)",

It provided me with a lot of valuable insight. For one, it gave me a template for the core ingredients (0.3% E3, 1% E2, and some ascorbic acid). Sadly, since it doesn't seem that there are any premade topicals suitable for the task available on the gray market, I'm probably going to have to make my own.\n\nWhile I'm not a chemist, I am a very stubborn high-functioning autist (which is just as good as far as I'm concerned), so I immediately began trying to scrape the internet for as much information on the subject as I could. \n\nI found that I was likely going to need a few components: my core ingredients, a solvent to dissolve them in, a penetration enhancer, and a preservative.

Though getting E2 seems pretty doable, I'm still not quite sure how I'm going to get E3 (Taobao, 1688, and smaller US/Canadian biochemical suppliers seem to be my main options).\n\nAs such, I've come up with a relatively simple recipe.\n\n|Ingredient|Purpose|%|g/mL|\n:--|:--|--:|--:|\n|Estriol (E3)|Core ingredient|0.30%|3|\n|Estradiol (E2)|Core ingredient|1%|10|\n|Ascorbic Acid|Core ingredient|10%|100|\n|Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose|Gelling agent|1%|10|\n|Propylene Glycol|Solvent, humectant, and penetration enhancer|15%|150|\n|Phenoxyethanol|Preservative|0.70%|7|\n|Potassium Sorbate|Preservative|0.10%|1|\n|Sodium Benzoate|Preservative|0.10%|1|\n|Purified Water|Base|71.80%|718|\n\nThe heavy lifters here are the HPMC (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose) and the propylene glycol. The HPMC is more or less my way of avoiding having to deal with a commercial base. In theory, it should be simpler to create a solution with all of the other elements, and then only have it become particularly viscous once the HPMC is introduced.\n\nThe propylene glycol is another heavy lifter. I've read that E3 and E2 are soluble in propylene glycol, which is great for me because propylene glycol also carries weight in other areas as well, since it is a good humectant and penetration enhancer. Though it is viscous, I've read that it doesn't require much heat to become significantly less so. Heating it to 50-60C should probably do the trick.\n\nI've also got a whole bunch of preservatives mixed in there. The phenoxyethanol, potassium sorbate, and sodium benzoate were picked because I know for a fact that they won't do me any harm (they are the preservatives of choice in the facial moisturizer I use), and they are pretty cheap. Three preservatives (might) seem like a lot, but I *really* don't want this stuff going bad.\n\nI've read the ascorbic acid should compliment the E2 and E3 insofar as collagen production. \n\nAs for the E2 and E3, I just added in the concentrations I've seen floated around. Even if they are high enough to mess with my hormonal levels a bit, I'm not particularly concerned. If anything I don't like happens I'll just make a fresh batch with lower concentrations.\n\nAs for dosage, I'll likely shoot for around a gram either every other day or every day.\n\nI'm also looking at adding hydrolyzed collagen, azelaic acid, alpha lipoic acid, and/or DMAE, but I'm not sure how useful any of those would be.\n\n# Now, onto the crux of my post.\n\nI'm not actually entirely sure whether or not I'm entirely in over my head here. I plan to run tests with all of the ingredients other than the E2/E3 to try and get the viscosity and consistency right, so that should play in my favor. \n\nWith that said, it's entirely possible that I'm missing some important ingredient that my topical will be useless without, or that some of these ingredients simply won't play well together.\n\nIf anyone here has more experience or knowledge than me on this sort of thing, I'd greatly appreciate any advice or critiques of my plan here. \n\n**Further, if anyone knows a good place to buy estriol (E3), *please* tell me.** I'd prefer to either buy domestic (US) or import from Canada. Customs usually releases Canadian goods quickly, and Canadian businesses are generally pretty easy to deal with.\n\nI also plan to try and post some kind of before and after post here once I get this stuff made, as well as a finalized recipe. I've noticed that, while there are reports of people having good luck with this stuff, there is a notable lack of proper before and after comparisons.\n\nAnyhow, that's enough rambling. Hopefully I didn't say anything profoundly stupid or incorrect. Any help here would be very much appreciated. Cheers!\n\n**EDIT 1:** I noticed that I messed up the header (g/mL). Before it said mg/mL, which isn't right.\n\n**EDIT 2:** I tried making 25ml without including the E2 or E3 (which I have yet to source), and it seems that all my ingredients yielded about what I wanted in terms of consistency. I might tweak the propylene glycol and HPMC percentages to make it a little thicker, but frankly I'm not too worried about it. The product was a bit sticky, but that is expected because of the ascorbic acid.\n\n**EDIT 3:** I have managed to source E2 and E3. I had to import from a Chinese supplier. ",

There's some more info on that [here](https://transfemscience.org/articles/nonbinary-transfem-overview/).\n\n  \nOtherwise, to my limited knowledge your recipe seems fine, it's similar to pharmaceutical estrogen creams. I would take into consideration the solubility of estradiol in propylene glycol, though. [This paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0378517383901424) suggests at 22c, you can dissolve 75 mg of estradiol per gram of PG. That would mean you need at least somewhere around 140 mL of PG (1 gram of PG=\\~1.04 mL), which you have enough of, but you would still have 3 grams of estriol which I can't find much solubility data on, but I imagine is somewhat similar to estradiol. You'd almost definitely need more solvent for it. I don't think there's a way to get estriol domestically US or from Canada either, it would be much harder to source. I think there's some sellers on amazon that sell creams with actual (small) amounts estriol in it, but does estriol have any particular benefits that just estradiol wouldn't bring (correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't estradiol also convert into estriol in your bloodstream)?",

I figure something with similar ingredients, or ingredients that do the same thing would be best, but I have no idea where to look. They are:\n\n>Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Lauryl Glucoside, Glycerin, Cannabis Sativa Seed Oil, Panthenol, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis (Borage) Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil, Tocopherol, Ascorbic Acid, Ruscus Aculeatus (Butcher’s Broom) Root Extract, Pimenta Dioica (Allspice) Fruit Extract, Pilocarpus Pennatifolius (Jaborandi) Leaf Extract, Silybum Marianum (Milk Thistle) Seed Extract, Sambucus Nigra (Elder) Flower Extract, Chrysanthemum Sinense Flower Extract, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Polysorbate 20, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Glyceryl Undecylenate, Citric Acid, Fragrance (Phthalate free), Caramel\n\nThis list is what I see on my bottle. They must've reformulated at some point before going under because it's different from what's listed in the link.\n\nSo yeah, that's where I'm at right now. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

    "body": "A short background: Gepirone is in the azapirone group of drugs, the same class as Buspar. It was synthesized by Bristol Myers Squibb in 1986 and is now being brought to market by Fabre-Kramer Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of MDD (major depressive disorder) and GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) under the brand name EXXUA™. Clinical trials for MDD have concluded, and trials for GAD are currently in phase 3. For MDD, The FDA has set a PDUFA action date (which I understand is a regulatory review) for June 23, 2023, so from what I understand it should be hitting the market soon after that.\n\n\nSimilarities to Buspirone:\n\n\n* Both drugs function as 5HT1A serotonin receptor partial agonists. Meaning, they occupy the 5HT1A receptor sites and have an effect less than that of serotonin which allows them to function as an inhibitor. Inhibition at the 5HT1A site results in anxiolytic activity.\n\n\n* Both drugs produce 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-piperazine (1-PP) as a metabolite, which is an agonist of the Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor.\n\n\nDifferences from Buspirone:\n\n\n* It’s an ER (extended release) medication, meaning it will only need to be taken once daily. “Gepirone ER uses a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose formulation to mediate extended release of the active ingredient, which facilitates absorption over 16 hours. This extended release mechanism allows for once daily administration.”\n\n\n* When taken with food, AUC (area under the curve, which is the amount of the drug that gets absorbed by your body) increases by “up to 37%”, compared to 100% (fully doubling) with Buspirone\n\n* It is NOT antagonist of the dopamine D2 receptor, unlike Buspirone\n\n\nAccording to Fabre-Kramer, “EXXUA™ is a significantly stronger anxiolytic than buspirone, with no dopaminergic effects.”\n\nIf you’d like to read more: \n\n[Briefing to the FDA](https://pink.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/-/media/pmbi-old-site/supporting-documents/the-pink-sheet-daily/2015/november/gepirone_ac_fk_briefing.pdf)\n\n\n[Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gepirone)\n\n\n[Fabre-Kramer site](https://fabrekramer.com/pipeline/)",

I'm specifically mad because they added salicylic acid and I have a sensitivity to it. It is VERY hard to find a drugstore face wash without salicylic acid in it lol.\n\nAnyway, when I was on my mission to find a face wash with a similar formula to the old one, I wasn't able to find a summary of how the formula changed. I assume it's out there somewhere, but I didn't see it. So, if you're like me and want to know what they changed, here are the two ingredients lists:\n\nC&C Morning Burst OLD FORMULA (taken from the back label of my last physical bottle I had)-\n\nWater,\nSodium Laureth Sulfate,\nGlycerin,\nAcrylates Copolymer,\nCocamidopropyl Betaine,\nFragrance,\nPhenoxyethenol,\nSodium Hydroxide,\nMenthyl Lactate,\nMannitol,\nCellulose,\nDisodium EDTA,\nMethylparaben,\nMenthol,\nPropylparaben,\nEthylparaben,\nSodium Ascorbyl Phosphate,\nTocopheryl Acetate,\nHydroxypropyl Methylcellulose,\nCucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract,\nRetinyl Palmitate,\nPanax Ginseng Root Extract,\nZingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract,\nAcrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer,\nTriethyl Citrate,\nCitrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract,\nCitric Acid,\nIron Oxides,\nTitanium Dioxide,\nMica,\nTalc\n\nC&C Morning Burst NEW FORMULA (taken from C&C website)-\n\nWater,\nSodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate,\nCocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine,\nSorbitol,\nSodium Hydrolyzed Potato Starch Dodecenylsuccinate,\nAcrylates Crosspolymer-4,\nSodium Ascorbyl Phosphate,\nTocopheryl Acetate,\nMannitol,\nCellulose,\nHydroxypropyl Methylcellulose,\nIron Oxides,\nSodium Hydroxide,\nCitric Acid,\nDisodium EDTA,\nSalicylic Acid,\nMenthol,\nFragrance\n\nHere is a summary of the changes:\n\nWhat they added-\n\nSodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate,\nCocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine,\nSorbitol,\nSodium Hydrolyzed Potato Starch- Dodecenylsuccinate,\nAcrylates Crosspolymer-4,\nSalicylic Acid\n\nWhat they removed-\n\nSodium Laureth Sulfate,\nGlycerin,\nAcrylates Copolymer,\nCocamidopropyl Betaine,\nPhenoxyethenol,\nMenthyl Lactate,\nMethylparaben,\nPropylparaben,\nEthylparaben,\nCucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract,\nRetinyl Palmitate,\nPanax Ginseng Root Extract,\nZingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract,\nAcrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer,\nTriethyl Citrate,\nCitrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract,\nTitanium Dioxide,\nMica,\nTalc\n\nI'm not a chemist so I'm not going to claim any of these changes to be good or bad or whatever, but if you found the new Morning Burst formula isn't working for you anymore, I think it's good to examine the ingredients lists.\n\nI will note that the first 5 ingredients (excluding water) in the new formula are all new additions, and that the first 4 ingredients in the old formula were all removed.\n\nSo, did I find a replacement? Maybe. Neutrogena's Deep Clean Invigorating Foaming Scrub's first 2 ingredients are the same as C&C MB's old formula (Glycerin and Sodium Laureth Sulfate). It also has the little exfoliating bits that I love, and NO salicylic acid. I haven't tried it yet, so this isn't an official recommendation, but the ingredients are giving me hope.\n\n(EDIT: After 3 weeks of using this new face wash, I do recommend the Neutrogena wash as a replacement specifically for C&C's Morning Burst. It has been working very well for me, personally.)\n\n(Side note: I'm not being paid by Neutrogena lol. I used this product's full government name because Neutrogena also has a product of a similar name with different ingredients. They were right next to each other at the store when I went. If in doubt, check the formula!)\n\nI hope that compiling this info is helpful for at least 1 person out there!",

But recently i switched to a sulphate free shampoo and conditioner from petal fresh (Ingredients below). I used your ingredient checker to see if these products were okay and they were :).\n\nBut now i got this problem that after i wash my hair and use the conditioner my hair kinda feels waxy and heavy (for some reason its mostly at the back of the head) + my ends of my hair kinda feel brittle. Like there's something in it but i pay attention that i rinse everything out. But when i wash my hair it kinda sticks together and is difficult to rinse everything out but i really pay attention to it. I don't know why this is happening but it is really bothering me. \n\nCould this be that i am using conditioner now and never used it before? Or that i am using sulphate free shampoo which makes something build up in my hair? Because when i just used shampoo with sulphates i didn't had this problem. Or is this the way the hair should feel when using no sulphates and conditioner? Because i noticed that my hair is more wavier now then it was when i used sulphate shampoo and no conditioner? Or is it hard water build up? Because i have moderatly hard water.\n\nMy hair is not really curly (more wavy actually) but i didn't know where to post this question and i have been reading this reddit for the past few days and i am really impressed by the knowledge of this subreddit.

    "body": "For your reference, my skin type is sensitive and acne-prone. All the products I use and review here are completely fragrance free, contain no masking fragrance, no “natural” fragrances or essential oils, no photo-sensitizing plant oil/extracts (lavender, eucalyptus, citrus, etc ). So here we go: \n\n**BEST**: \n\n1. **Acne.org cleanser**: this is my HG face cleanser that I have repurchased so many times. No matter how many products I try over the years, I always come back to this because it’s cost effective, works well without drying out my skin, and does not leave a residue behind. It has a gel texture and come in a pump bottle which make it super convenient to use. \n\n**Ingredients:** Water, PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, PEG-150 Distearate, Sodium Laureth 13 Carboxylate, Disodium Cocamphodiacetate, Butylene Glycol, Sage Extract, Cucumber Extract, White Oak Bark Extract, Panthenol, Allantoin, Acrylates Copolymer, Methylgluceth-20, Polysorbate-20, Quaternium-15, DMDM Hydantoin, Disodium EDTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. **First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Face Cleanser:** This cleanser is one of my recent discovery and I like it a lot. It’s a little more pricey than the [Acne.org](http://acne.org/) cleanser, but it works well and is gentle on the skin. It comes in a tube which makes it convenient for travel. \n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua/Water/Eau, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Stearic Acid, Hydrogenated Coconut Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Stearyl Alcohol, Allantoin,  Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Tocopherol, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides Citrate, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Sodium PCA, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Coco-Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Sodium Chloride, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Maltodextrin,  Tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. **Soon Jung pH 5.5 Foam Cleanser:** This is a Korean product. It comes in a tube and does cleanse well, doesn’t over dry, and leaves no residue behind. Overall, this is a good cleanser. If you are looking for a good Korean water based cleanser, I would recommend this one. This would be best for people with normal to oily skin, IMO.\n\n**Ingredients:** Water / Aqua / Eau, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Coco -betaine, Potassium Benzoate, Sodium Chloride, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Disodium EDTA, Panthenol, Pentylene Glycol, Madecassoside\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**WORST**: \n\n1. **Hada Labo Goku-jyun Foaming Face Wash:** This is probably the worse cleanser out of everything I tried in a long time. I decided to purchase this product to try because I like the oil cleanser from Hada Labo, but this one is a total let down! This cleanser come in a pump bottle, which makes it easy to dispense the product, but that’s the only pro. Now the cons: This foam cleanser does not cleanse well. For me, It’s too gentle on the skin, leave a greasy residue on my skin and made me break out. I believe the greasy feeling is due to the Vaseline in the formula. I think this cleanser will only work for people with dry to very dry skin, but even if you have dry skin, there are so many other better cleansers out there. Those of you with oily, acne-prone or combo skin, this product will be a disaster! So stay away!\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, BG, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate, PEG-8, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cocamide DEA, PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Sodium Taurine Cocoyl Methyltaurate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate(Super Hyaluronic Acid), Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate(Skin-adsorbed Hyaluronic Acid), **Vaseline**, Citric Acid, Polyquaternium-7, EDTA-2Na, BHT, Methylparaben\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SO-SO:**\n\n1. **Rovectin Skin Essentials Conditioning Cleanser:** This is another Korean product. It comes in a pump bottle and is very convenient to use. However, this is a very average cleanser. It’s not the worst, but not the best either. It works and is gentle on the skin, but there’s nothing wow worthy about it. Also, there’s nothing it does that the other cleansers I mention above cannot do. I won’t be repurchasing this one. \n\n**Ingredients:**  Water, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Decyl Glucoside, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Centella Asiatica (Gotu Kola) Extract, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Glycine, 1,2-Hexanediol, Serine, Glutamic Acid, Aspartic Acid, Protease, Leucine, Alanine, Lysine, Arginine, Tyrosine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Proline, Valine, Isoleucine, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Histidine, Cysteine, Methionine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Potassium Benzoate, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Trioleate",

None of these leave my skin dry or tight. \n\n* **Simple Hydrating Cleansing Oil** - this is very nice for such a cheap product. My HG until I tried out fancier stuff. For drier and dehydrated skin that isn't acne prone, you could use this as a single cleanse. I have all winter. \n\n* **Clinique Take The Day Off Balm** - I got this as a sample pot and it's really cosmetically elegant. Lathers up beautifully. Very satisfying to use. Single cleanse works for me. \n\n* **Beauty of Joseon Radiance cleansing balm** - this is so fancy! Unlike the Clinique, it turns straight to an oil texture when you rub it in. I prefer that the Clinique is a slightly thicker texture when you rub it in personally but I'm trying a fermented skincare routine which is why I bought it. The packaging is amazing - it comes with a spatula in a little compartment in the lid! I'm not sure it emulsifies as well as the Clinique so I double cleanse my T-zone to be safe. \n\n* **Simple Refreshing Gel face wash** - very nice, good second cleanser. Cheap but effective. Also Fungal Acne safe according Folliculitis Scout but please check yourself. I use this as my second cleanser on my T-zone and my sole cleanser on my neck/upper chest.",

    "body": "**Key Points**\n\n* CAR-T therapy is promising against lymphomas but not solid tumors. This is because CAR-T cells are typically delivered via IV infusions, but this approach struggles to concentrate enough CAR-T cells against solid tumors. Today, activating CAR-T cells against solid tumors entails exposure to toxic levels of cytokines.\n* Stanford researchers developed a simple-to-make, injectable hydrogel to localize delivery and activation of CAR-T cells. This hydrogel houses both cytokines and CAR-T cells, allowing local and specific activation while minimizing toxicity to other tissues.\n* The gel consists of water and two ingredients: biodegradable nanoparticles and Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), a commonly used polymer made from cellulose. When combined, the two components bind together like molecular Velcro. The gel’s mesh-like nature is tight enough to prevent cytokines from escaping yet weak enough for CAR-T cells to break free.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nAdoptive cell therapy (ACT) has proven to be highly effective in treating blood cancers, but traditional approaches to ACT are poorly effective in treating solid tumors observed clinically. Novel delivery methods for therapeutic cells have shown promise for treatment of solid tumors when compared with standard intravenous administration methods, but the few reported approaches leverage biomaterials that are complex to manufacture and have primarily demonstrated applicability following tumor resection or in immune-privileged tissues. Here, we engineer simple-to-implement injectable hydrogels for the controlled co-delivery of CAR-T cells and stimulatory cytokines that improve treatment of solid tumors. The unique architecture of this material simultaneously inhibits passive diffusion of entrapped cytokines and permits active motility of entrapped cells to enable long-term retention, viability, and activation of CAR-T cells. The generation of a transient inflammatory niche following administration affords sustained exposure of CAR-T cells, induces a tumor-reactive CAR-T phenotype, and improves efficacy of treatment.\n\n**Paper**\n\n[https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abn8264](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abn8264)\n\n**Articles**\n\n* [https://engineering.stanford.edu/magazine/simple-new-delivery-method-enhances-promising-cancer-treatment](https://engineering.stanford.edu/magazine/simple-new-delivery-method-enhances-promising-cancer-treatment?utm_source=marketo&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=issue135&utm_content=040822gelforcancertreatment&mkt_tok=ODg0LUZTQi0zMDcAAAGED-Ejiyv_oEzEEvqRRdLZyy6hbM3YXk3BPkPX6L8Hm5evOS9fbpMP3ANzswAAchfTnYvz30oCFPrL7gKBx9ugX6DU006Y4aCkQzTe0VoEs9s)\n\n**Key Terms**\n\n* CAR-T: chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells\n* Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC): Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) belongs to the group of [cellulose ethers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/cellulose-ether) in which hydroxyl groups have been substituted with one or more of the three hydroxyl groups present in the cellulose ring.

HPMC is also soluble in polar organic solvents, making it possible to use both aqueous and nonaqueous solvents. It has unique solubility properties with solubility in both hot and cold organic solvents. HPMC possesses increased organo-solubility and thermo-plasticity compared to other methyl cellulose counterparts. It forms gel upon heating with [gelation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/gelation) temperature of 75–90oC.",

    "body": "Read Part 0, for an introduction to me and why I'm doing this, [here.](http://redd.it/25q7hv)\n\nA 2-for-1 special on reviews today! I have kind of a complicated relationship with Ocean Potion sunscreens. I do like that they do not test their products on animals, and their sunscreen is dirt-cheap, so I really want to like these sunscreens. But, I can go through a bottle and hate it one day, love it the next, and be back to hating it on the third. It's also impossible to find locally. In the past, I've chalked up some of the problems to getting old or nearly-expired stock from online stores, but they changed their packaging for 2104, and I thought I've give them one last shot. I ordered three bottles from drugstore.com:  Protect & Renew SPF 45, Protect & Nourish SPF 50, and Sport SPF 30. The Sport SPF 30 was in the old packaging, with an earlier expiration date, so I didn't bother with that one. \n\nThe [Protect & Renew SPF45](http://www.drugstore.com/ocean-potion-suncare-protect-and-renew-body-anti-aging-sunscreen-lotion-spf-45/qxp516988?catid=184136) product was advertised as being specifically targeted for anti-aging. It's not targeted for active use, and has no claims to be water-resistant. At $9 for 6 oz, ($1.50/oz) it's quite cheap.\n\nActive Ingredients: Avobenzone 3% (Sunscreen), Homosalate 15% (Sunscreen), Octocrylene 2.35% (Sunscreen), Octyl Salicylate 5% (Sunscreen), Oxybenzone 5% (Sunscreen)\n\nInactive Ingredients: Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Butylparaben, Caprylyl Methicone, Citric Acid, Diisostearyl Malate, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexyglycerin, Glycerin, Glyceryl Malate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Niacinamide, PEG-100 Stearate, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, PPG-17/Ipdi/Dmpa Copolymer, Polydimethylsiloxane, Saccharide Isomerate, Silica, Sodium Citrate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Water \n\nIt's a pretty strong formula overall, though I'd prefer a touch more octocrylene to stabilize the avobenzone. It applies really nicely, absorbing quickly. It did cause a moderate amount of eye sting, my perennial demon when it comes to chemical sunscreen. It felt very moisturizing on my skin, though. However, about 2/3 of the way through, the printing on the bottle starting flaking off on my hands whenever I went to apply it, getting gross glittery label residue all over my hands. I dealt with it as best I could, but it ended up getting all over my face and into my eyes, which stung like *hell*. Since it's not water-resistant and I tend to sweat, I don't plan on using this one again.\n\nOnto the [Protect and Nourish SPF 50](http://www.drugstore.com/ocean-potion-suncare-anti-aging-quick-dry-sunscreen-spf-50/qxp187810?catid=184131). This one is targeted more for everyday use, and is water-resistant (rated for 80 minutes). It as on sale for under $8 for 8 oz, making less than $1 an oz!\n\nActive Ingredients: Avobenzone (3%), Homosalate (15%), Octisalate (5%), Octocrylene (7%)\n\nInactive Ingredients: Acrylates/C10 30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Acrylates Copolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D), Diisopropyl Adipate, Dimethyl Capramide, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Macrocystis Pyrifera Extract, Phenoxethanol, Polyester 8, Propylene Glycol, Sorbitan Oleate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Water \n\nThe first application of the day is glorious-- it feels a little sticky at first, but quickly dries to the point where I don't even realize I've put it on... as long as there is no humidity in the room when I apply it. A couple of times I applied it while my wife was in the shower, and it turned into a sticky mess that stayed with me the entire day. Reapplication is the real problem, though-- when I reapply it pills and balls up into really gross marbles of stuff all over my skin. Since I reapply at least once, sometimes twice a day, that's just not going to cut it. The eye sting wasn't as bad with this one, but still a problem.\n\nDespite my negativity in some of these reviews, I do feel like I'm narrowing in on my holy grail sunscreen. I do want to express how grateful I am for all of the suggestions I've picked up from SCA, thank you all! \n\nI'm going to try some of the slightly more expensive physical sunscreens next. Before I pull the trigger, what does SCA think of these: \n[Thinksport SPF 50](http://www.drugstore.com/thinksport-kids-sunscreen-spf-50/qxp405583?catid=184131), 20% ZnO\n[Cotz Sensitive SPF 40] (http://www.drugstore.com/cotz-sensitive-sunscreen-spf-40/qxp359725?catid=184131), also 20% ZnO\n[Kiss My Face Mineral SPF 40] (http://www.drugstore.com/kiss-my-face-natural-mineral-sunscreen-with-hydresia-spf-40/qxp405771?catid=184136), 10% ZnO, 7.5% TO2\n",

    "body": "First time poster.\n\n**Background:**\n\nHave been suffering with loose stool last 5 years, I think following an infected scab I had on the back of my neck and a period of overtraining (I used to do a lot of running). I'm UK based so went to my GP November last year. Bloods came back fine but a stool test I took revealed a fecal calprotectin score of 1,250 so my GP, suspecting IBD, referred me for a colonoscopy. Given my only gastrointestinal symptom was the stool (with no urgency or pain, just loose) I was sceptical and thought it was more likely to be IBS. Tried a low-FODMAP diet and saw some success but was unable to maintain normal stool consistently, even with sticking to elimination phase foods.\n\n**Probiotics:**\n\nApril this year and I still hadn't got a colonoscopy appointment so I decided I'd try some probiotics. On the recommendation of a dietician (also a family friend) who'd been helping me with the diet, I took the following products:\n\n'Cytoprotect GI tract' containing Apple pectin, lactoferrin (from milk), slippery elm *(Ulmus rubra)* powder, quercetin, marshmallow root *(Althaea officinalis)* powder, zinc carnosine, *Bacillus coagulans*, vitamin A (as retinol palmitate), vitamin D3 (as cholecalciferol), copper bisglycinate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (capsule shell), corn starch, maltodextrin, sucrose, silicon dioxide, fractionated coconut oil, d-alpha tocopherol, ascorbyl palmitate.\n\n(I checked with the manufacturer and the BC strain is MTCC 5856)\n\n'Nutri advanced probiotic plus' containing B.bifidum LMG 25628, L.acidophilus LMG 030101, L.rhamnosus LMG 25626, B.longum LMG 26652, B.infantis LMG 25627, B.adolescentis LMG 10502, L.plantarum LMG 26654, beta galactosidase, amylase, cellulase.\n\nI also started taking liquid apple cider vinegar with meals.\n\n**Histamine intolerance:**\n\n2 days into taking the above (1 capsule of each once a day in the evening), things got very weird. I was hot in the night and woke suddenly gasping for air around 3am, felt under the weather, had a sensation in my head as if it was being squeezed from the sides, struggled with concentration, felt literally as if I was running on adrenaline, and had diarrhea. I stopped the supplements immediately and stopped overheating but the other symptoms persisted. After a couple of weeks, I realised I'd developed a histamine intolerance. Decreasing histamine containing foods before slowly building them back up to normal saw me very close to back to where I was before I took the supplement, with loose stool the only remaining symptom.\n\nDuring this period I had the colonoscopy and a CT scan which both came back clear. Bizarrely, my calprotectin also came down to around 50. I checked with the manufacturers of both probiotics and neither contained a histamine producing strain.\n\nI have to confess this left me rather baffled, but my symptoms matched so closely with a histamine intolerance that I struggled to believe it was anything else. I decided that I'd like to fix my gut issues (which I believe to be a result of dysbiosis) and so for the last couple of days I've experimented with taking the Cytoprotect again. The consequence of this has been that the headaches have suddenly come back. In light of this, I strongly suspect that the Bacillus Coagulans modulates my microbiome in favour of a histamine producing strain. I can't find any other reports of this online, but am very curious to hear if anyone else has experienced a histamine intolerance when taking a probiotic that is not itself histamine producing?\n\n**TLDR: Took a non-histamine producing probiotic (Bacillus Coagulans MTCC 5856) and it appears to have given me a histamine intolerance.**",

So at the GI's recommendation, I took a probiotic. Digestive Advantage, which is **just** Bacillus Coagulans. (Mine was 6086 though)\n\nEver since then, I've had a persistent fatigue. About ten months now. It hasn't gone away no matter what I do. I'm not 100% confident that it's a histamine intolerance, but it's one of the things I think it might be. I did a stool test and have a lot of fecal secretory IgA, so something in my gut is setting off my immune system, at the least.\n\nDoing my best to deal with it, but don't have a lot of answers so far. My next plans of action are to try activated charcoal, and introducing more probiotics to try to rebalance my gut.",

I personally haven’t had any issues with expiration date and authenticity from my orders and their customer service can’t be beat!

I think of it as a “wash\\-off” mask and I’ll use it after my weekly glycolic acid 30&#37; peel. It’s an ointment\\-like texture that turns into a light foam. You have to work fast or it starts foaming up on you! I use maybe 4 pumps per session, the instructions do say “use liberally”. The instructions say leave on for about 10 minutes but I HATE the way it feels as the bubbles subside, it feels incredibly itchy to me. On washing off it leaves a slippery feel on the skin, so beware if you’re one of those people who hate that feeling.\n\nI don’t know that it does much but it does seem to reduce my irritation post\\-peel.

My understanding is that efficacy is still in question but once a pet is in their \"twilight years\" a supplement like this may help and likely won't hurt. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf she does well at the vet, a schedule of chondroprotec injections may be an option.

I do shower acrobatics so none of the stuff in my shampoo gets in my face. I use the regular red-cap Gilette shaving cream (only tingles for a little while, doesn't seem to have that great of an effect on my skin) and shave every night with a good non-burning razor before using the cleanser (started doing this in June, seems to really help with keeping me breakout-free). I keep my hair short and out of my face (had that long-hair period in 8th grade, around the height of my forehead acne). I rarely touch my face throughout the day. I don't pick at my skin or pop pimples. Sometimes I do get oily and duck into a public washroom to blot it out, more on that later in this post. Pics may or may not be coming soon, since I'm currently staying in a dim-lit basement apartment with mirrors only in the dimmer-lit rooms, and with only a 2 MP iPod camera to take pictures with. Diet doesn't seem to affect my acne. I cut down on dairy for a while, and that seemed to reduce it a little, but I have now reintroduced it to my diet and there's been no change, positive or negative. I wear glasses which I clean with alcohol-based lens cleaner each time before putting them on. I drink enough water pretty much every day, but sometimes I forget to/don't notice I'm thirsty. I usually break out a little those days. I've been to a derm once, but all that I got from them was a confirmation that what I had was indeed acne and not some obscure skin condition, and a prescription for accutane which my mother didn't let me get. I've never tried accutane or any prescription cream. Antibiotics helped for a little while (got prescribed them for an unrelated illness) but lost their effectiveness pretty quickly.\n\n**-- Begin actual post --**\n\nHey, SCA! Mostly a complete newbie here, but ready & willing to learn! Thanks for giving my post a look. I'm a 17 year-old Canadian male going off to university in about two weeks, and I'm looking for a solid plan to improve my skin. My dad never got acne, but my mom did a lot. I've sadly inherited that part of my mom's genes. Asian acne is the worst.\n\nI started getting acne around 7th-8th grade (11-12 years old?), starting on my forehead. It used to be pretty mild, but in 9th grade it migrated down to my cheeks and flared up like hell, started getting big cysts. Thankfully, since then, my forehead has been left untouched and has no noticeable marks. By 10th grade it had mellowed out, though pimples also began appearing around my chest/neck/jawline, and pretty much stayed constant throughout 11th and most of 12th (with the exception of some appearing in, uh... private... areas in 11th :( ). In the summer before 12th grade, I began using sunscreen to mitigate PIH/redness, as suggested on the sub, and that has worked quite well!\n\nNow, in the summer before first year uni, I'm finally actually reading your posts properly and not skimming them in episodes of frustration and emo-ness like I used to. I've been paying attention to what affects my skin. I started using the routine above in mid-late June, and where I was getting 1-3 large cysts a week before, I now get maybe 1 large cyst a month (mostly around my neck/jaw area) and a lot smaller breakouts which are on their way out after a couple days using the spot treatment.\n\nI'm mainly looking for advice on three fronts:\n\n**1)** If you guys & gals have any general advice on how to improve my routine, I will listen with open ears. Explanations for why you're making suggestions is appreciated!\n\n**2)** Sunscreen. I've been sticking to Ombrelle (first used the Ultra-Light Cream 45 SPF, instead of the Ultra-Fluid Lotion 60 SPF) up until now because I've not heard anything bad about it, but something that just clicked in my idiot brain is that it both products I've used regularly do a couple of annoying things. First, they make my skin way oilier by the end of the day than normal. Second, they have a tendency to leak into my eyes with the oil they create, which stings a lot if I mess around with my glasses during the day or touch my eyes at all. I recently went on a two-week road trip where I wore the Ultra-Fluid Lotion every day (I usually stay in the house most of the time, and since it's a basement with very little light coming through the windows, I don't bother with the sunscreen most days because of the effects stated above) and noticed that my face broke out like it used to circa grades 10-11. Granted, it could have been that we were eating out for virtually every meal, but I do make an effort to balance my diet in terms of calories/nutrition, so I doubt that was it, since I wasn't eating too terribly (sorry for being graphic, but I observed my stool, I'd give it a B+). Does anyone have an idea as to why these sunscreens make me oily/sting my eyes/break me out, and what sunscreens are good as an alternative? Also, as Fitzpatrick IV, is 45+ SPF still a requirement for me if I want to mitigate PIH/redness?\n\n**3)** Moisturiser. If you'll notice, it's not a regular part of my routine. I've been staying in this basement apartment for the past month with my dad in lieu of our main house in another province, since it's closer to my university & blah blah other reasons. When I moved here, I did not bring my moisturiser because I'd forgotten about putting it on/that it even existed for a couple of weeks. Before that, I used to put it on every night before bed. I used Aveeno Active Naturals Clear Complexion Daily Moisturiser with salicylic acid. It always seemed to oil up my face more than normal when I used it in the day and could see what it did. (Sidenote: My skin really has me confused as to whether it's oily or dry or normal, since whenever I used/use moisturiser/sunscreen as per my routine, it's oily, but when I don't use either, I find it's sort of tight immediately after cleansing and starts feeling normal a few minutes after patting dry [but it still gets oily at the end of the day if I don't use moisturiser/sunscreen! Just less so]. I've only begun paying attention to that now, so maybe I'll update this post later.) I went out to Shopper's Drug Mart and bought Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturiser 15 SPF a couple of days ago on a whim, and it immediately broke me out all over (didn't patch test, I'm sorry, I'm new to this!!) after putting it on and going to bed with it. My skin was so oily that morning. Luckily, going back to the routine above has all the little spots it made on the way out now. Anyone have any ideas on what moisturiser would be best for me, and also why the Cetaphil broke me out?\n\nThanks for reading this far!

Check the sidebar for a list of symptoms and see if you match up.

Darker skin can provide only up to [the equivalent of SPF 13](http://www.bidmc.org/YourHealth/Therapeutic-Centers/Skin-Cancer.aspx?ChunkID=157004), which is still lower than what we recommend. Besides, darker skintones are more susceptible to hyperpigmentation, and since that's a concern of yours, you should definitely not neglect sunscreen.\n\nFourth, patch test. It's hard to tell what is breaking you out (e.g. the alcohol, the silicones) from these ingredients lists.\n\nYou should add something to proactively prevent acne (e.g. BHA, BP) instead of treating it reactively with the spot treatment.

In the USA the FDA has more information that can be accessed here:\n\n[https://www.fda.gov/drugs/buying-using-medicine-safely/what-you-should-know-about-eye-drops](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/buying-using-medicine-safely/what-you-should-know-about-eye-drops)\n\nThe Dry Eye Foundation has a website dedicated to eye drop safety here:\n\n[https://www.eyedropsafety.org/](https://www.eyedropsafety.org/)\n\nYou can sign up with them for alerts as well if desired no matter what country you are in.\n\nLet’s dive in with some information:\n\nBenefits of Over-the-Counter Artificial Tears:\n\n* Lubrication: Artificial tears provide immediate lubrication to the eyes, helping to relieve symptoms of dryness, irritation, and discomfort.\n* Moisture Retention: They help to maintain moisture on the ocular surface, providing relief from dryness and preventing further irritation.\n* Improved Vision: By lubricating the eyes, artificial tears can improve visual clarity which may be affected by dry eye symptoms.\n* Convenience: Over-the-counter availability makes them easily accessible for immediate use without the need for a prescription.\n* Variety of Formulations: Available in various formulations (e.g., preservative-free, gel drops, ointments) to suit different needs and preferences.\n\nRisks of Over-the-Counter Artificial Tears:\n\n* Preservative Sensitivity: Some artificial tears contain preservatives that can cause irritation or allergic reactions, especially with frequent use.\n* Temporary Relief: They often provide only temporary relief and may not address the underlying cause of dry eye disease.\n* Overuse: Excessive use can lead to dependency and may sometimes exacerbate symptoms or mask a more serious underlying condition.\n* Contamination: Improper handling can lead to contamination of the eye drop bottle, increasing the risk of eye infections.\n\nMechanism of Action:\n\nThe primary mechanism of action of artificial tears involves mimicking the natural tear film to provide lubrication and moisture to the ocular surface. The tear film consists of three layers: lipid, aqueous, and mucin. Different formulations of artificial tears target these layers to improve tear film stability and reduce evaporation.\n\nCarboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose (HPMC): These polymers increase the viscosity of the solution, providing longer-lasting lubrication and hydration by retaining moisture on the eye's surface.\n\nPolyethylene Glycol/Propylene Glycol: These ingredients act as humectants, attracting and retaining moisture to the ocular surface, thereby providing relief from dryness.\n\nHyaluronic Acid: Known for its high moisture retention capacity, it helps to provide prolonged hydration and lubrication to the eyes.\n\nGlycerin: Acts as a lubricant and humectant, drawing moisture into the eye and providing a smooth, lubricating effect.\n\nLipid-Based Drops: Contain oils such as mineral oil or castor oil, which help to replenish and stabilize the lipid layer of the tear film, reducing tear evaporation and improving tear film stability.\n\nCritiques of over-the-counter (OTC) eye drops for dry eye disease (DED) and meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) highlight several key concerns and limitations. Here are some common points raised by critics:\n\n1. Temporary Relief Only:\n\nSymptom Management: OTC eye drops primarily provide symptomatic relief without addressing the underlying cause of dry eye disease or meibomian gland dysfunction. This means they offer only temporary alleviation of discomfort. Frequent Reapplication: Because the relief is often short-lived, patients may need to apply the drops frequently, which can be inconvenient and costly over time.\n\n1. Preservative-Related Issues:\n\nIrritation and Allergic Reactions: Many OTC eye drops contain preservatives, such as benzalkonium chloride (BAK), which can cause irritation or allergic reactions, especially with frequent use. Preservatives can also damage the ocular surface cells over time.\n\nCumulative Toxicity: Prolonged use of preservative-containing drops can lead to cumulative toxicity, potentially exacerbating dry eye symptoms and damaging the corneal epithelium.\n\n1. Masking Underlying Conditions:\n\nDelay in Diagnosis: Reliance on OTC drops might delay the diagnosis and treatment of more serious underlying conditions. Patients may not seek professional medical advice if they find temporary relief from OTC products.\n\nMismanagement: Misuse of OTC drops, such as using them for conditions other than what they are intended for, can lead to inappropriate management of eye health issues.\n\n1. Lack of Efficacy for Severe Cases:\n\nLimited Effectiveness: For moderate to severe cases of DED and MGD, OTC drops may not be effective enough. Such cases often require more advanced treatments.\n\nIneffectiveness in MGD: Meibomian gland dysfunction, in particular, often requires treatments that address the lipid layer of the tear film and gland function, which many OTC drops are not designed to do effectively.\n\n1. Economic Considerations:\n\nCost Over Time: While OTC eye drops are relatively inexpensive per bottle, the cumulative cost can be significant for chronic users, especially if they are using preservative-free formulations, which tend to be more expensive.\n\nInequitable Access: Not all patients can afford the repeated purchases of OTC eye drops, particularly high-quality or preservative-free varieties.\n\n1. Potential for Overuse:\n\nRebound Dryness: Overuse of certain OTC eye drops, especially those with preservatives, can lead to a paradoxical worsening of symptoms, sometimes referred to as rebound dryness.\n\nDependency: Patients might develop a dependency on the drops, feeling the need to use them constantly to manage symptoms, which can lead to neglect of more effective long-term treatments.\n\nDilution of Tear Film: While artificial tears are designed to mimic the natural tear film and provide relief for dry eyes, using them excessively can potentially dilute the natural components of the tear film. This might slightly alter the composition of the tears temporarily, but it is unlikely to have a significant long-term impact.\n\nSummary of Critiques:\n\nCritiques emphasize that while OTC eye drops can be useful for immediate, short-term relief, they are not a comprehensive solution for managing dry eye disease or meibomian gland dysfunction. Concerns about preservatives, temporary relief, potential delays in proper diagnosis, and the need for more effective treatments for severe cases highlight the importance of consulting with an eye care professional. Proper diagnosis and a tailored treatment plan that addresses the underlying causes of dry eye and meibomian gland dysfunction are crucial for long-term management and eye health.\n\nThe use of preservatives in over-the-counter (OTC) eye drops, particularly benzalkonium chloride (BAK), has become a contentious issue among medical professionals and consumers alike. Here's a look at the situation and what both supporters and critics are saying:\n\nConcerns About Preservatives\n\nCritics of BAK and Other Preservatives:\n\nOcular Surface Toxicity: BAK, a common preservative in many eye drops, is known to cause several adverse effects on the eyes. It can exacerbate dry eye symptoms, disrupt the tear film, and cause direct toxicity to the corneal epithelium, leading to inflammation and cellular damage. This is particularly problematic for individuals with pre-existing dry eye conditions.\n\nLong-term Effects: Chronic use of BAK-containing eye drops can lead to significant ocular surface damage, including tear film instability and reduced corneal sensitivity. Patients often use these drops for extended periods without being aware of the potential risks, under the assumption that OTC products are inherently safe.\n\nIncreased Sensitivity: Individuals with sensitive eyes or those prone to adverse reactions may find that preservatives worsen their symptoms. For these patients, preservative-free eye drops are often recommended to minimize the risk of irritation and long-term damage.\n\nSupport for Preservatives\n\nProponents of BAK and Other Preservatives:\n\nMicrobial Contamination Prevention: The primary benefit of preservatives like BAK is their effectiveness in preventing microbial contamination. This is crucial for maintaining the sterility and safety of eye drops, especially those used over long periods.\n\nCost and Convenience: Preservative-containing eye drops tend to be more cost-effective and have a longer shelf life compared to preservative-free alternatives. This makes them more accessible and convenient for many users.\n\nThe Middle Ground\n\nCurrent Recommendations:\n\nFor Dry Eye Patients: Ophthalmologists often recommend preservative-free eye drops for patients with dry eye syndrome to avoid exacerbating their symptoms. These formulations help minimize ocular surface toxicity and provide better symptom relief.\n\nPatient Awareness: Consumers are encouraged to read labels carefully and consult with eye care professionals to choose the right eye drops for their specific needs. Discussions about the potential risks and benefits of preservatives can help patients make informed decisions about their eye care.\n\nIn conclusion, while preservatives like BAK play a crucial role in preventing contamination, their potential adverse effects, especially for long-term use and in sensitive individuals, cannot be ignored. Preservative-free eye drops are increasingly recommended for those with dry eyes or sensitivities, highlighting the importance of personalized eye care and informed decision-making.\n\nOver-the-counter artificial tears can be a helpful solution for managing symptoms of dry eye disease, providing immediate relief through lubrication and moisture retention. However, they are primarily a symptomatic treatment and may not address underlying causes. Users should be aware of potential risks such as preservative sensitivity and overuse, and consult with an eye care professional if symptoms persist or worsen.\n\nYou may want to look over research on artificial tears. You can find 1,459 of them when searching the term “artificial tears” at PubMed as of this writing here:\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22artificial+tears%22](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22artificial+tears%22)\n\nThen fortunately we have found some videos that will likely be very helpful to you in finding the best OTC Eye Drop for you or at least give you some leads to begin with since there are probably dozens of options in the marketplace. Here goes:\n\nNeal Guymon, DO who is known on YouTube as Doctor Eye Guy on: [7 Best Preservative Free Artificial Tears (Dry Eye Drops Explained)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XgOCJJ3EKU)\n\nJoseph Allen, DO who is known on YouTube as Doctor Eye Health on: [Best Eye Drops for Dry Eyes - My Top Picks!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8ja7kB-tTM)\n\nMelanie Denton Dombrowski, DO who is known on YouTube as Dr. D on: [Top 5 Artificial Tears | Which drop is best for dry eyes? How can I treat dry eyes at home?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCLp2C72zZY)\n\nMelanie Denton Dombrowski, DO who is known on YouTube as Dr. D on: [Do Artificial Tears Help or Hurt Your Eye? | Do Artificial Tears Help or Hurt Dry Eye Disease?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ-qnJt0O7Y)\n\nOverall, while OTC artificial tears are a cornerstone in the management of dry eye disease, their effectiveness varies significantly depending on the formulation. Personalized treatment approaches, considering the specific needs and conditions of patients, are essential. Continued research is necessary to identify the most effective and safe formulations, especially given the limitations in the quality of existing studies and the variability in clinical outcomes.",

For the past month or so I've tried cutting down on my use of silicones and sulfates (only use a sulfate shampoo once a week or so because my hair feels too gross without it), but overall my hair feels worse than before. About a month ago I bought some natures gate products, because I really like how they're relatively inexpensive and also vegan/cruelty free. \n\nFor anyone who's curious: \n\nThis is the ingredients list for the shampoo I've been using: Water, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, sodium cocoyl isethionate, disodium cocoamphodiacetate, lauryl glucoside, glycerin, chamomilla recutita (matricaria) flower extract, panthenol, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, borago officinalis (borage) seed oil, tocopherol, ascorbic acid, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, equisetum arvense (horsetail) leaf extract, geranium maculatum (geranium) extract, salvia officinalis (sage) leaf extract, mimosa tenuiflora (mimosa) bark extract, ascorbyl palmitate, polysorbate 20, leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium hydroxide, phenoxyethanol, glyceryl undecylenate, citric acid, fragrance (parfum)*\nMade in the USA from globally sourced materials.\n* Phthalate free\nNo - sodium lauryl/laureth/coco sulfates, phthalates, butylene glycol, artificial colors.\n\nAnd this is the ingredients list for the conditioner - Water, Glycerin (Vegetable Derived), Stearyl Alcohol (Vegetable Derived), Cetyl Alcohol (Vegetable Derived), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Vegetable Derived), Benzyl Alcohol, Stearalkonium Chloride (Vegetable Derived), Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis (Borage) Seed Oil, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Hordeum Vulgare (Barley) Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Fruit Extract, Viola Tricolor (Pansy) Extract, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hydroxyethylcellulose (Plant Derived), Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Fragrance*.\n*Phthalate free.\n\nMy hair feels straw-like even in the shower, there's no slip unless it's absolutely coated in conditioner and then as soon as it rinses out it feels gross again. I also feel like my hair is falling out more often (if I pull at the tips, long strands will start coming out in the shower). I don't really know what to do. I feel like my hair gets buildup pretty easily because when I've tried cowashing with thick shampoos or have put oil in my hair it always feels really weighed down and greasy the next day. I also have some issues with an itchy, flaky scalp. \n\nI was thinking that using a conditioner with water soluble silicones would be the best compromise - all the benefits of silicones but without the buildup. \n\nDoes anyone have any product recommendations? *I've also been looking for a heat protectant spray* that contains water soluble silicones, since I usually straighten my hair a bit to get rid of the really weirdly shaped waves. I've started using a bit of salt spray in my hair as well (not that often), but I feel like it's been drying out my ends. I considered mixing a bit of conditioner or oil (I've heard jojoba is closest to the scalp sebum) into the mix to make it less damaging, but I have no idea what the salt is doing to my hair with or without silicones. On one hand, it seems like silicones would protect my hair from the salt penetrating it too much. But on the other, it would also prevent the moisturizing ingredients from penetrating my hair, so it seems like a catch-22. I do think I need silicones though, because my hair just doesn't seem to be doing too great without them.   \n\nI'm sorry for such a long post! But if anyone could help me, that would be wonderful.

    "body": "Hi! I have very sensitive, combination/leaning dry skin. I’ve been using the Purito Fermented Complex Boosting 94 Essence and have not seen the results that so many people online have claimed. I find it to not really hydrate my skin at all or even out my tone, and I even suspect that I have been breaking out a bit more since I’ve started using it. I’m perplexed because I’ve tried Missha’s Time Revolution Essence and and Neogen’s Ferment Micro Essence and loved both of them! I was looking for something cheaper so happened across Purito’s Essence. Any clues as to what the difference could be for me? I’ll list the ingredients I’ve taken from Incidecoder for each down below.

        "body": "Could be any number of things.\n\nFerments break some people out. Some will claim it's purging. It is not purging. Some find they only break out from ferments in certain products/formulations.\n\nCould be the different ferments in each product. Some have better results with one type (like rice vs galactomyces, etc).\n\nCould be other ingredients in either product causing a break-out. Could be the formula itself for some reason, independent of the fermented ingredients.\n\nFermented ingredients aren't always interchangeable -- so if you had good results with X, you may see nothing with Y even if they use the \"same\" (again, these can be handled, processed, filtered, etc totally differently) fermented ingredient.\n\nBeyond that, ferments don't give everyone a \"glow\" or even out skin texture. I've used many, many, *many* of them -- including all three of these! -- and never seen any glow. I really like the Neogen and find it very hydrating, and think is an overall \"evening\" *over a long period of time* given the amino acids (which aren't overnight-result kind of things), but no glow. AHAs are the only thing that give me a \"glow,\" and it's temporary.",

(It also found several CYP450 mutations).  \n\nHere is verbatim what it says for MTHFR: \n\n>Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (MTHFR) C677T: C/T A1298C: A/C \\[Intermediate activity\\]\n\nI recently found that a generic Multi-B vitamin with Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, B6, Folate, B12, Biotin, Pantothenic Acid REALLY kicks the \\*\\*\\*\\* out of my depression and anxiety.   \n\nThe actual ingredient list is: thiamine mononitrate, pyridoxine hydrochloride, D-Calcium pantothenate, riboflavin, nicotinamide, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, biotin, cyanocobalamin, folic acid, magnesium stearate, polyvinyl alcohol.  \n\nI am pretty sure I am supposed to be avoiding folic acid, so that's a reason to find something else.  \n\nI'm not sure if I should avoid the cyanocobalamin, I have already found B12 in the form of Methylcobalamin and I take it as a separate pill.   \n\nI want to see if I could find any advice on getting an equivalent to this \"multi-B\" but in a MTHFR friendly way.   I'm not finding any great answers with product searches.  I already take L-methylfolate and methylcobalamin B12 daily. \n\nThe hard way would be to research and test each ingredient of my multi, which will take work and I'm not sure if we have definitive guidance on each ingredient.  \n\nThank you very much for your time.",

My phototype is III (it does matter because not all phototypes are as sensitive to sun damage ([https://www.laroche-posay.fr/l-edito-peau/conseils-peau-et-soleil/comprendre-les-indices-de-protection-uvb-uva/protege-ta-peau-comprendre-uva-uvb.html](https://www.laroche-posay.fr/l-edito-peau/conseils-peau-et-soleil/comprendre-les-indices-de-protection-uvb-uva/protege-ta-peau-comprendre-uva-uvb.html)) \n\n* How oily am I? At night, i cleanse with lrp foam, then apply adapalene then nothing, then in the morning i'd wake up with a \"nice\" layer of sebum on my face.\n* How sensitive it is? Its mostly allergen dermatitis that I get, to give a few examples of products I reacted to: cicaplast b5, sebium sensitive, uriage cica gel creme, cicalfate, avene tolerance control , vichy 89 serum etc and most fragranced products. I have sensitive eyes too: they get blurry/teary when I react to something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE PRODUCT:**\n\n* Suncreen: chemical. >!Can't find infos on official site....!<\n* ingredient list :  >!Aqua, Alcohol Denat, Butylene Glycol DicaprylateDicaprate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Dibutyl Adipate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Silica, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Silica Dimethyl Silylate, Copernicia Cerifera Cera, acide-glycyrrhetinique, Glycyrrhiza Inflata Root Extract, carnitine, glycerine, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Carrageenan, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Sodium Hydroxide, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Decylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyacetophenone !<\n\n**REVIEW in detail**\n\n* **Product texture/ comfort to apply**: 5/5, it's a gel consistency that is enjoyable to apply on face (unlike the lrp uvmune anthelios oil control gel creme that is 0 to 1/5 in terms of spreadability,).\n* **greasyness**: 5/5 (not greasy at all, like you wear almost nothing)\n* **shine**: 5/5 (no shine. For comparison cerave ultra light spf 30 looks dewy on me so 2/5, lrp oil control gel creme is 1/5 ).  I separated shine from greasy because some products makes me shiny without greasy (serums especially such as to niacinamide + zinc ), or greasy without as shiny if that makes sense .\n* **matte**? This is hard to say because my skin is naturally shiny on tret , but it's definetely matte leaning, and the one the mattest overall skincare product (serums/moisturizers included) I tested. \n* **moisturizing/drying/**? 3/5 (0 is drying, 2 bare skin,  5 is intensely moisturizing) I don't use moisturizer at all right now mostly because I can't find one that is pleasant to wear doesn't making me flush/shiny/greasy. Eucerin spf is slightly moisturizing i'd say, and not drying despite the alcohol in it. It's better than wearing nothing on my skin basically. Slightly moisturizing, not drying. tl;dr: it's better than bare skin. For the nerds, this product has  humectants/ and emollients such as good ol glycerin, cetearyl alcohol, cyclomethicone etc. So it makes sense to say that at the very least this product have some moisturizing properties. To which degree would be the question.\n* **stinging** : I apply it in the morning after my shave. I shave against the grain to get close shave so my beard area is quite sensitive (on top of adapalene use). Sensitive because it reacts easily so when a product stings even just a little, my beard reacts quickly, meanwhile rest of face doesn't. Eucerin doesn't sting when applying it after shaving in the AM so 5/5. \n* **feeling/comfort** of skin (light or heavy): 5/5 .Does it makes skin feels hot (warm)/flushed and uncomfortable? It's a bare skin finish as if you wear nothing. It feels like my skin is \"breathing\" and not suffocating. Extremely enjoyable for daily use, especially active days, were you get a bit sweaty and hot (walking a lot, getting into overlycrowded suburbs that are \"suffocating\"and hot etc). I \"work\" as a med student at hospital and everything is \"overheated\" especially patient's rooms because they wear lightweight hospital clothes or are shirtless. But we have to wear coats... on top of clothes so it feels really warm. Other moisturizers/spf would makes me overly disgustingly greasy/shiny because of oilyskin + slight sweating, but  with eucerin it's fine. No more have the urge to blot my whole face with blot sheets or cleanse my face as soon as I get back home.\n* **white cast**: I can't see one so 5/5.\n* **eye stinging/blurry:**  3/5? That rating is not objective/helpful because my eyes react easily to anything, even simple things such as cerave foam cleanser. But I have to say that I have a mild discomfort in my eyes, but nothing extreme.\n* **Sun protection**: 3/5\\* ngl i'm not an expert on it, but apparently we have to look at \"ppd\" with higher better. Eucerin oil control is apparently at least 20 because it must be higher than EU norms. For comparison lrp anthelios uvmune oil control gel creme is 39. So we could say LRP has better sun protection, so I might try lrp oil control FLUID (not gel creme) and see if I can use it for really sunny days. But the reason I didn't try it yet is because reviews i've seen showed that fluid has the same dewy/shiny finish than the gel creme... \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CONCLUSION:** \n\n* Good , enjoyable, matte daily spf for (truly) oily skin. Great most of the year in temperate weather (think france, germany, uk etc) and for office to semi active lifestyle.\n* Not drying despite alcohol. \n* Slight moisturizing properties (better than bare skin). \n* Fragrance free. No stinging to face, freshly shaved beard or eyes.\n* Slight eye blurryness 3/5: Maybe it's just my eyes that are oversensitive. I cope with by no going as close to my eyes with the product.\n* SPF 50 with ppd>20 so it's better than no spf, but weaker than LRP anthelios. Not a toptier protection so those with lighter skin tones (type I) and who sunburn easily yearlong, it might not be enough. However I personally prefer a daily enjoyable spf to one i'd struggle with or have to cope with by excessive blotting, powders etc, water rinse midday etc. The luxury of putting it on and not having to check mirror every hour to see if I'm overly greasy/shiny.Being able to put it on and don't think about it.Right now the weather is cloudy so I'll settle with this enjoyable spf for the moment.\n\nedit: about matte finish, I use this term to refer to the product properties not the finish on my skin. On my skin it leaves a pleasant healthy glow but that's not the product, that's my skin.",

While many people do apply tretinoin around their eyes, this can cause permanent damage to the oil glands in the eyes, and can result in permanently dry eyes.

Also, some medications cause burning down my legs. Sleeping pills caused me to have siezures. Now I get palpations and tremors with medication and some foods.I get palpation's when I get too hot like a sauna or bath. Also when I eat certain foods I get tremors. I have a chronic soar throat as well. Numbness and tingling in the hands. I never had any of these issues before taking those tablets.\nI have do have Rheumatoid Arthritis and now Restless leg.

I cannot eat anything beside fruits, vegetables, and fish that how sensitive my immune system is now due to those pills.

It is widely used in the pharmaceutical, food, and  cosmetic industries as a thickener, emulsifier, and binder.\n\nThe chemical formula of hypromellose is C56H108O30, and it is  produced by the reaction of alkali cellulose with propylene oxide and  methyl chloride. Hypromellose has a variety of properties that make it a  useful ingredient in a wide range of applications. Some of these  properties include:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Solubility: Hypromellose is highly soluble in water and forms clear, colorless solutions.  \n \n2. Viscosity: Hypromellose has a high viscosity and is commonly used  as a thickening agent in food and pharmaceutical formulations.  \n \n3. Stability: Hypromellose is stable in both acidic and alkaline  environments, making it a useful ingredient in many products.  \n \n4. Film-forming properties: Hypromellose has film-forming properties  and is often used in the production of capsules and tablets.  \n \n5. Compatibility: Hypromellose is compatible with many other  ingredients and can be used in combination with other polymers and  excipients to achieve specific product characteristics.  \n \n\nOverall, hypromellose is a versatile and widely used polymer with a  range of chemical properties that make it a useful ingredient in many  applications.",

If used properly, will it remove viruses from your hands like any typical bar soap?\n\nI reached out to Dial and they couldn't answer that question, and I want to ensure the term \"hand wash\" is the same as \"hand soap\".

As far as I know it's still effective against viruses. Technically, it is not \"true soap\". The cleaners are detergents called surfactants and are derived from long chemical processes in labs.  \"True soap\" is the result of a chemical reaction between a fatty acid and lye (which is usually sodium hydroxide but not always).  True soap also has hydrophilic and hydrophobic ends and is proven effective at removing coronavirus. You can tell if what you're using is true soap beacuse the scientific names will usually begin with \"Sodium\" and end with an -ate suffix, like Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Olivate, etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntibacterial soaps are now no longer recommended, fyi.

    "body": "I wanted to share my experience with two medications and see if anyone else has encountered something similar or has insights into potential causes.\n\nAbout a year ago, I started taking **Zetron XL (Bupropion)** from Libbs, which also has extended release mechanism. I initially began using after already using Ritalin IR (Ritalin IR was awesome and never experienced the metioned side effects on the title). I stopped using it and transitioned to Ritalin LA later on. The problem is that, Ritalin LA gave me the same side effects as bupropion for 3 weeks. Recently, I transitioned to **Concerta** for ADHD, but I noticed that the reactions I had with Concerta were almost identical to what I experienced with Zetron XL (Just a lot lighter).\n\nHere’s what happened:\n\n* **Symptoms**: I experienced confused thinking, anxiety, a kind of chest pain, and respiratory issues where I felt like I had to remind myself to breathe.\n* **Medication History**: I thought it was just an individual reaction to Bupropion at first. However, the fact that I had similar symptoms with Concerta made me question what might be causing it beyond the active ingredients, until I saw a lot of posts complaining about it. \n\n**Potential Similarities and Explanations**:\n\nAfter looking deeper, I found a few common excipients between these medications. While not always the focus of allergic reactions, excipients (inactive ingredients) can cause sensitivities in some people, and they might be worth discussing with your healthcare provider.\n\nHere are the key similarities I found:\n\n1. **Povidona (Povidone)**: This is used as a stabilizer in both Zetron XL and Concerta. While povidone reactions are relatively rare, they can happen, especially when taken consistently over long periods.\n2. **Hypromellose/Hiprolose**: **Concerta** lists **hipromelose (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose)**, and **Zetron XL** has **hiprolose**, which is a derivative. Both act as controlled-release mechanisms or coatings and have a similar structural function in drug formulations.\n\nThe most notable difference might be with **Zetron XL**, which contains **methacrylic acid copolymer and ethyl methacrylate**. Methacrylate copolymers are used for controlled-release coatings and can sometimes cause allergic reactions or sensitivities in those susceptible to methacrylate compounds.\n\n**Concerta**, on the other hand, uses **acetato de celulose (cellulose acetate)**, which also serves as a controlled-release coating. While structurally different, both compounds act as sustained-release agents in their respective medications, potentially leading to similarities in their effects on sensitive individuals.\n\n# Why This Could Be Important:\n\nIf you're sensitive to methacrylate-based polymers or certain coating agents, reactions may manifest as systemic symptoms like respiratory issues, anxiety, or chest discomfort. These are often overlooked as drug-related sensitivities, especially since excipients are not usually discussed as the primary culprits.\n\nI’m sharing this to see if others have experienced something similar and to highlight that reactions to medications can sometimes go beyond the active ingredient. If you’ve had a similar experience or have additional knowledge about excipient reactions, I’d appreciate your input!\n\nps. Of course, it could be other substance, but for now, that's what I found out similiar between them both. ",

I was recently prescribed tretinoin by my MD. I never struggled with acne for my whole life until about 1.5 years ago (when I started graduate school).\n\nMy medical esthetician seems to think I don't need it, because she's bigger on eating healthy (avoiding dairy/sugar/starches) and a simple but effective regimen. My skin gets a bit better when I'm really strict with my diet and when I see her regularly (every 2 weeks), but it requires a lot of self-discipline and $$$ to do those things, respectively. Also, it never really goes away, just reduces it a bit. Of course, I'm still going to eat healthy and drink lots of water and follow a good regime, but I'm frustrated and I think I need something stronger at this point.\n\nPer my medical esthetician, I am currently using:\n\n**Ayur-Medic Antibacterial Wash with Exfoliating Beads for Blemish-Prone Skin**\n\nActive ingredients; *Benzoyl Peroxid*e 2.5%\n\nInactive ingredients: (INCI) Water (Aqua), Cocoamidopropyl Hydroxsultaine, Polyethylene beads, Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulfate, Glycerin, Carbomer, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hexylene Glycol, Aloe barbedensis Leaf Extract, Triethanolamine, Mentha viridis (Spearmint) leaf oil, Melaleuca alternifolia leaf oil, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA, Chamomilla recutita flower extract, Rosemarinus officinalis leaf extract, Eucalyptus globulus leaf oil.\n\nand\n\n**Cosmedix Clarity Skin-Clarifying Serum:**\n\nHamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Alcohol Denat., Aqua, Alcohol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Salicylic Acid \\[Exfoliant\\], Acetylsalicylic Acid, *Retinol, Retinyl Acetate,* Galactoarabinan, Hydroxyproline (L), Saccharide Isomerate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Epilobium Angustifolium (Willowherb) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Collinsonia Canadensis (Stone Root) Extract, Serenoa Serrulata Fruit (Saw Palmetto) Extract, Ruscus Aculeatus (Butcher's Broom) Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice Powder, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate\n\n**and NO moisturizers** since she said that, if the serum feels moisturizing enough (and, surprisingly, it does), it's fine. It sucks, because I love how these products feel on my skin, and it's definitely improved since she's helped me develop a better regimen, but my skin is nowhere near where I want it to be.\n\nI realize that the ingredients in these may not be compatible with using retinoin. I'm considering investing in Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Daily Face Cleanser, La Roche Posay cicaplast baume B5, Cerave healing ointment, and maybe some sort of serum/oil, or an occlusive, and, of course, sunscreen. I've perused through a lot of the threads here, and there seem to be so many options, I'm not even sure where to start. I wish I could just integrate it into my skincare routine, but I'm also hoping that maybe I can still use the two products I'm currently using occasionally.\n\nI plan to ease my way into it (I plan to use it 1-2 a week for a while, buffering it with a moisturizer).\n\nCliffs:\n\n\\-Have been seeing medical esthetician for months to treat forehead/cheek/jaw acne (pustules) that I've struggled with for 1.5 year\n\n\\-Esthetician doesn't want me to start tretinoin, and though my skin has improved a little over the past several months, it's back and forth a lot and nowhere near where I need it to be\n\n\\-Currently using a cleanser and serum with active ingredients not compatible with tretinoin (benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, respectively) \n\n\\-Struggling to establish a regimen that is good for me (need recommendations!)\n\n\\-Is there a way I can switch off with the above products and and a new tretinoin? I.e., use those on the days I don't use tret, and then use a tret-friendly cleanser/moisturizer on the days I do?\n\nThank you for reading! :) Open to any and all suggestions...I'm desperate!",

If she promotes a simple, but effective routine, then tretinoin should be up her alley.  \n\nSo you need to decide if you want to continue to spend money with your esthetician, or if you want to actually simplify your routine and save money with lower cost products. If you choose the latter, then try the tret!",

Unfortunately after trying ketogenic diet my diarrhea and steatorrhea never stopped (eventhough i stopped the diet after 12 days and started eating carbs again). It went downhill and became this otherwordly fatigue and brain fog that i didnt know existed. I dont experience great gi disturbances meaning bloating or pain etc but so high of an inflammation after meals that my eyes starts to burn and  cant see properly, high pulsation, dead fatigue and and a brain fog sometimes literally makes me unable to register a normal daily used sentence.I also lost 7 kilos, which is a bit concerning regarding i was already a bit underweight before the complications (i did the keto diet for the anti inflammatory reasons for my lower back pain) I am not quite sure how much of these inflammatory crisis' my body can handle, which also affects my emotional health creating a state of depression and irritation understandably because of highly inflamed nerves and brain. \n\nHad endoscopy and colonoscopy and nothing is there other than mild gastritis. Which ofcourse it was the expected outcome for me since it was obvious that the problem in was my small intestines. Doctor didnt say anything further, which i didnt expect anything further either since i already read all the subreddits and literature and was aware of the blind spot on the small intestines in the field.\n\nMy blood results showed low pancreatic elastase levels so i started digestive enzymes which eased the symptoms a bit, but a couple of days ago i noticed the orange capsule in my stool, and a day later another one. It looks opened but not digested. The capsule is made of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose so i was thinking does this means i have low stomach acid ? I was thinking it needed to dissolve in my stomach. I take it just before starting a meal.\n\nAnyone had the same kind of experience ? Any opinions ?\n\nLots and lots of love to you all ! I hope health comes back to your lives soon and with stability friends 🌸",

    "body": "Tile adhesive, a fundamental component of modern construction, plays a pivotal role in ensuring the durability and aesthetics of tile installations. One of the key ingredients that significantly enhances the performance of tile adhesive is Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose (HPMC). This hydrocolloid compound, derived from cellulose, offers a plethora of benefits that contribute to the overall quality and longevity of tile installations. This article delves into the crucial importance of adding [*HPMC to tile adhesive*](https://www.maissen-hpmc.com/news/hpmc-for-tile-adhesive.html) and how it revolutionizes the world of construction.\n\n### Enhanced Workability and Application\n\nHPMC serves as an exceptional thickener and rheology modifier in tile adhesive formulations. Its addition imparts improved workability and spreadability to the adhesive mixture. The adjusted viscosity ensures that installers can effortlessly apply the adhesive evenly onto surfaces, facilitating accurate tile positioning and alignment during installation. This enhanced workability translates into a smoother and more efficient installation process, ultimately saving time and labor costs.\n\n### Prolonged Hydration and Bond Development\n\nWater retention is a pivotal aspect of tile adhesive performance. HPMC excels as a water retention agent, regulating the rate at which water evaporates from the adhesive mixture. This controlled hydration process is paramount for the thorough hydration of cementitious components, leading to robust bond development between the tile and the substrate. The prolonged hydration afforded by HPMC prevents premature drying, thereby minimizing the risk of cracking and ensuring a stronger, longer-lasting bond.\n\n### Superior Adhesion and Cohesion\n\nHPMC's impact on adhesion and cohesion cannot be overstated. It enhances the adhesive's ability to adhere seamlessly to both the tile and the substrate. By promoting a steadfast and continuous bond, HPMC elevates the adhesive's performance to new heights. Additionally, the incorporation of HPMC mitigates the potential for shrinkage and cracking during the drying and curing phases, reinforcing the adhesive's adhesion and cohesion properties.\n\n### Sag Resistance for Vertical Applications\n\nFor vertical tile installations, sag resistance is of paramount importance. HPMC's unique properties contribute to preventing tiles from slipping or sliding out of place before the adhesive sets. This attribute ensures that tiles remain securely affixed to vertical surfaces until the adhesive achieves full curing, a critical factor in achieving impeccable and long-lasting tile installations.\n\n### Compatibility and Customization\n\nThe versatility of [Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose (HPMC)](https://www.maissen-hpmc.com/mailose-me75k/methyl-hydroxyethyl-cellulose-ethers-for-skim-coat.html) extends to its compatibility with a diverse range of additives and raw materials. This characteristic empowers manufacturers to fine-tune tile adhesive formulations to meet specific performance requirements. Whether it's adjusting setting time, open time, or final bond strength, HPMC's compatibility opens doors to tailor-made adhesive solutions that cater to unique construction demands.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn the realm of modern construction, the inclusion of [Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose HPMC in tile adhesive](https://www.maissen-hpmc.com/news/hpmc(hydroxypropyl-methyl-cellulose)-for-tile-adhesive.html) formulations stands as a testament to innovation and excellence. The multifaceted benefits of HPMC, including enhanced workability, prolonged hydration, superior adhesion, sag resistance, and compatibility, converge to elevate the quality and reliability of tile installations. As construction practices evolve, HPMC continues to play an indispensable role in shaping the future of tile adhesive technology, ensuring that every tile installation is not only aesthetically pleasing but also built to withstand the test of time.",

Biome (LeanBiome) by Lean for Good® offers a science-backed solution, restoring your gut microbiome with nine lean bacteria strains, prebiotic fiber, and natural fat-burning botanicals to support healthy weight loss naturally. In this complete LeanBiome review, we uncover how Biome works, the specific ingredients it uses, the benefits you can expect, and why rebalancing your gut may be the missing key to sustainable fat loss and long-term health. Supported by real user testimonials, clean manufacturing standards, a 180-day money-back guarantee, and transparent pricing, Biome stands out as a trusted, legitimate option for those ready to address belly fat and weight management at the root cause.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nIf you’ve been battling stubborn belly fat, creeping weight gain, or constant hunger despite doing everything you thought was “right,” it’s not your fault. You try to eat healthier, you watch your portions, you even push yourself to exercise more. And yet, the scale barely moves. Clothes start feeling tighter. Energy levels dip. Worst of all, the cravings for sweets, bread, and snacks seem to grow stronger, not weaker. It’s exhausting, physically and emotionally.\n\nDeep down, many people start wondering if something inside them is broken. They silently blame themselves for \"lack of willpower\" or \"getting older.\" They try harder, eat less, and still get nowhere. It’s a frustrating, lonely cycle. Maybe you’ve felt it too, staring at your reflection, grabbing at your waistline, and wondering what more you can possibly do. The fear creeps in that maybe this is just how life is going to be now: a slow, painful drift into more weight gain and less control.\n\nBut the truth is, the real problem often runs much deeper than calories or exercise routines. New research shows that when your gut microbiome, the delicate balance of bacteria inside your digestive system gets thrown off, it can silently sabotage every effort you make to lose weight. A damaged gut doesn't just slow your metabolism; it ramps up your hunger hormones, locks your body into fat-storage mode, and even triggers intense cravings for the very foods you’re trying to avoid.\n\nIn other words, when your gut is out of balance, your body isn’t fighting with you, it’s fighting against you. That’s why traditional diets and workout plans so often fail. They don’t address the root cause: the unhealthy shift happening deep inside your gut. And until that swamp-like environment is drained and replaced with the right “lean bacteria,” true, lasting weight loss remains frustratingly out of reach.\n\nThis is exactly where Biome (or **LeanBiome**) by Lean for Good® steps in. Instead of blaming your willpower, it helps you fix what’s broken inside, starting with the hidden ecosystem in your gut that could be the real reason behind your stubborn belly fat, slow metabolism, and constant cravings. We’ll explore everything about it in this LeanBiome review.\n\n**Biome (by Lean for Good®) Overview**\n\n* **Product Name:** LeanBiome\n* **Formulation:** Capsules\n* **Primary Ingredients:**\n   * Lactobacillus gasseri: 25 mg (10 Billion CFU)\n   * Lactobacillus rhamnosus: 10 mg (5 Billion CFU)\n   * **Proprietary Blend (10 mg / 5 Billion CFU):** Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium lactis, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium breve.\n   * Inulin (from Chicory Root)\n   * Greenselect Phytosome®\n   * Sphaeranthus indicus\n   * Garcinia mangostan\n* **Other Ingredients:** Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, silicon dioxide, gellan gum.\n* **Bottle Contents:** 60 Capsules (Servings Per Container: 30, Serving Size: 2 Capsules.

It’s a science-backed formula designed to help fix one of the biggest hidden causes of stubborn weight gain: an unhealthy gut microbiome. Instead of trying to force your body to lose weight through willpower alone, Biome (or LeanBiome) focuses on healing the internal imbalance that’s been working against you from the start. It helps restore the good bacteria your body needs to naturally burn fat, control cravings, and fire up a healthy metabolism again.\n\nInside each capsule of Biome, you’ll find a carefully selected mix of nine specific \"lean bacteria\" species. These are the good guys, friendly bacteria that, according to research, are linked to better fat metabolism, reduced belly fat, fewer hunger cravings, and a naturally leaner body type. But Biome doesn’t stop there. It also includes a unique prebiotic fiber (inulin) to feed these good bacteria, a patented green tea extract to support gut health even further, and natural plant extracts that may help your body burn fat more efficiently.\n\nWhat’s even smarter about Biome is how it delivers these powerful ingredients. It uses special delayed-release capsules (called DRcaps®) that protect the live bacteria from getting destroyed by stomach acid. That way, more of the probiotics survive the journey and actually reach your intestines where they can get to work rebalancing your gut and turning your body into a place where fat has a harder time sticking around.\n\nIn short, Biome isn’t about fighting your body harder. It’s about helping your body finally work the way it was meant to naturally, steadily, and with less struggle. And once your gut is back in balance, everything else can start falling into place: fewer cravings, better digestion, a faster metabolism, and yes, real, lasting weight loss.\n\n**Ready to support your gut health and naturally encourage healthy weight loss? Order Biome today and start experiencing the benefits from the inside out.**\n\n**How Does Biome (or LeanBiome) Work? Step-by-Step Mechanism**\n\nBiome isn’t about forcing your body to lose weight through extreme dieting or endless workouts. Instead, it takes a smarter, gentler approach — by going straight to the hidden root of stubborn weight gain: your gut microbiome. Here’s how Biome quietly but powerfully helps turn things around inside your body.\n\n**Step 1: Protect and Deliver the Good Bacteria Where They’re Needed Most**When you swallow a capsule of Biome, it doesn’t just dissolve in your stomach and disappear. Thanks to special DRcaps® delayed-release technology, the probiotics are shielded from harsh stomach acids and carried safely to your intestines — the real headquarters of your gut health. That way, the good bacteria arrive alive and ready to do their job, instead of getting destroyed before they even start.\n\n**Step 2: Rebuild a Stronger, Leaner Gut Microbiome**Once inside your intestines, the nine \"lean bacteria\" strains in Biome get to work. They help rebalance your gut environment by outnumbering the harmful bacteria that promote fat storage, sugar cravings, and sluggish digestion. It’s like sending reinforcements into a battlefield — tipping the odds back in your favor, one microscopic ally at a time.\n\n**Step 3: Feed the Good Bacteria to Strengthen Their Impact**To help the lean bacteria thrive and multiply, Biome includes Inulin, a natural prebiotic fiber. Inulin acts like food for the probiotics, encouraging them to grow stronger and create a healthier, more balanced gut ecosystem. A better-fed microbiome can mean fewer food cravings, a smoother digestive process, and better control over your appetite.\n\n**Step 4: Support Fat Burning and Reduce Belly Fat**Alongside the probiotics, Biome also unleashes the power of Greenselect Phytosome® and the herbal duo of Sphaeranthus indicus and Garcinia mangostana. Together, these ingredients help fire up your metabolism, encourage fat loss especially around the belly area and shift your body away from fat storage mode. It’s a steady, natural support system that helps your body burn fat more efficiently over time.\n\n**Step 5: Help You Feel Fuller, Longer and Cut Down on Cravings**With a healthier gut and more balanced hunger hormones, you’ll likely start to notice something surprising: you’re not as hungry all the time. Those intense cravings for sugar, bread, and snacks start to fade. Instead of fighting your body at every meal, you begin to feel more in control, making better food choices feel easier, not forced.\n\nBiome’s goal isn’t just temporary weight loss. It’s to help restore a gut environment that naturally supports a healthier metabolism, a slimmer waistline, and more energy for the long run.\n\n**What's Inside Biome (or LeanBiome): The Ingredients**\n\nBiome isn’t just a random mix of probiotics and herbs thrown together. Every single ingredient was handpicked to target the real reasons behind stubborn fat gain, especially the ones most people don’t even know exist. The formula focuses on three key areas: restoring a healthy gut microbiome, feeding the good bacteria to help them grow stronger, and encouraging the body to burn fat more efficiently.\n\nHere’s a closer look at what makes Biome different, and why these ingredients could finally make weight loss feel natural again.\n\n**Lactobacillus gasseri**This powerful probiotic strain has been linked in studies to noticeable reductions in belly fat. It’s known for helping calm down inflammation in the gut and encouraging the body to shed stubborn fat more easily. For people struggling with midsection weight that just won’t move, L. gasseri could be a real game changer.\n\n**Lactobacillus rhamnosus**Another \"lean bacteria\" superstar, L. rhamnosus has been shown to support overall fat loss and better weight management. Some research suggests it can even help people lose more fat compared to those who don’t have enough of this bacteria in their gut. It’s like adding a powerful teammate to your fat-fighting squad.\n\n**Lactobacillus fermentum**Studies point to L. fermentum’s ability to promote reductions in body fat percentages meaning not just weight loss, but actual fat burning. It’s also believed to strengthen gut health overall, creating a stronger, more resilient digestive system that works for you, not against you.\n\n**Other Lean Bacteria:** Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium lactis, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium breveTogether, these additional strains make up a well-rounded team of good bacteria. They work to crowd out bad bacteria, promote better digestion, reduce bloating, and help reset the gut’s natural fat-burning rhythm.\n\n**Inulin (from Chicory Root)**Inulin is a natural fiber that acts as food for the probiotics. It helps the good bacteria thrive and multiply once inside your gut. A healthier, more balanced gut means fewer cravings, better metabolism, and a stronger foundation for long-term weight management.\n\n**Greenselect Phytosome® (Caffeine-Free Green Tea Extract)**Unlike regular green tea, Greenselect uses a special technology that makes it easier for your body to absorb. It’s been linked to significantly greater weight loss results in people who combined it with simple diet changes. Plus, it supports gut health and metabolism without any jittery caffeine side effects.\n\n**Sphaeranthus indicus & Garcinia mangostana**These two botanical extracts work in synergy to help reduce stubborn belly fat. Clinical studies suggest that when taken together, they can support both fat burning and a decrease in overall body weight. They act like an extra push, helping your body shift away from fat storage and toward a naturally leaner state.\n\nEach ingredient inside Biome has been selected with care, not just for weight loss, but for restoring a healthy, fat-fighting environment inside your body where true transformation can happen.\n\n**Stop struggling against your body and start working with it. Choose Biome now and begin your journey toward sustainable fat loss and lasting energy.**\n\n**Real Benefits of Using Biome (or LeanBiome)**\n\nBiome isn’t about chasing quick wins or temporary results. It’s about rebuilding your body’s natural ability to stay lean, healthy, and energized — starting deep within your gut. As your microbiome gets stronger and healthier, the changes don’t just show up on the scale; they ripple into every part of your life. Here’s what you can truly expect from using Biome consistently.\n\n1. **Supports Healthy, Long-Term Weight Loss**Biome helps restore the natural balance of gut bacteria that’s often missing in people who struggle with stubborn fat, especially around the belly. By reinforcing your gut with nine strains of \"lean bacteria,\" it encourages your body to burn fat more efficiently instead of clinging onto it. This isn’t about dropping a few pounds only to gain them back later — it’s about resetting your body’s inner systems so that losing weight feels steady, natural, and sustainable.\n2. **Reduces Persistent Hunger and Uncontrollable Cravings**One of the most frustrating parts of weight struggles is the constant mental battle with cravings. It’s exhausting to feel like you’re always fighting your own appetite. Biome helps by supporting better hunger hormone balance. As your gut health improves, many people notice they feel fuller longer, experience fewer blood sugar crashes, and find it easier to walk away from that bag of chips or that late-night dessert. It’s like finally being able to breathe again after years of feeling trapped by food urges.\n3. **Fires Up a Sluggish Metabolism**When your gut is unhealthy, your metabolism tends to slow down — no matter how much you diet or exercise. Biome helps by giving your metabolism the internal support it needs to wake up and start working properly again. A healthier microbiome means your body is better able to convert food into energy instead of fat. Over time, you might find yourself feeling more energetic, more active, and more alive — without having to over-caffeinate or crash midday.\n4. **Helps Flatten Belly Fat and Support a Leaner Body Shape**Because Biome is specially formulated to target the gut issues connected to fat storage, many users notice a visible reduction in belly fat first. The stubborn bulge that refused to move despite years of effort can start to soften, slim down, and shift. Clothes may begin to fit better. Confidence slowly starts to return.\n5. **Rebalances Your Gut for Better Digestion and Overall Health**Good digestion isn’t just about avoiding bloating or gas. A healthy gut influences everything from your mood and immunity to how your body processes nutrients. Biome’s ingredients help clean up the \"swamp\" inside your gut, making digestion smoother, nutrient absorption better, and reducing that heavy, sluggish feeling after meals. A better gut often means a better you — not just physically, but emotionally too.\n\nBiome isn’t about punishing your body into weight loss. It’s about healing your body into a naturally lean, vibrant, and healthier state, starting from the inside out.\n\n**Affordability, Bonuses & Guarantee**\n\n**Pricing:**\n\n* **1 Bottle (30-Day Supply)** – $59\n* **3 Bottles (90-Day Supply)** – $49 per bottle ($147 total)\n* **6 Bottles (180-Day Supply)** – $39 per bottle ($234 total) + **FREE US Shipping**\n\nConsidering what most people spend monthly on quick fixes that don’t last from pricey supplements to diet programs. Biome feels like an investment in real change, not just another short-lived promise.\n\n**If you're serious about flattening stubborn belly fat and regaining your energy, Biome is ready to help.

Biome makes saying \"yes\" to your health easier and smarter than ever.\n\n\n\n\n\n**FAQs About Biome (or LeanBiome)**\n\n**How is Biome different from regular diet pills or probiotics?**Biome is different because it combines nine specific “lean bacteria” strains with gut-nourishing ingredients that help rebalance your metabolism naturally. It’s designed not just for digestion, but for real weight and belly fat support from the inside out.\n\n**When will I start seeing results with Biome?**Everyone’s body is different, but most people start noticing changes in their digestion, energy, or cravings within the first few weeks. For the best results, giving Biome at least 60 to 90 days is recommended. Remember, it’s about real, lasting change, not just a quick fix.\n\n**Is Biome safe to take daily?**Yes, Biome is made with naturally sourced ingredients, carefully formulated in an FDA-inspected, GMP-certified facility in the USA. It’s vegan-friendly, free from gluten, dairy, soy, nuts, sugar, and GMOs. Most users tolerate it very well without any issues. As always, if you have specific health conditions or are pregnant or nursing, it’s a smart idea to check with your doctor first.\n\n**Can Biome help if I’ve struggled with weight for years?**Absolutely. In fact, Biome is made for people who feel like nothing else has worked. If you've been stuck in a cycle of diets, workouts, and frustration, the root cause might have been your gut health all along. Biome aims to fix that foundation so that losing weight can finally become easier and more natural — even if you've been struggling for years.\n\n**Do I have to change my diet while using Biome?**While Biome supports gut health on its own, simple healthy habits can definitely speed things up. Eating more fiber-rich foods, drinking plenty of water, moving your body regularly, and cutting back on processed junk will all help your lean bacteria thrive faster. Think of Biome as your inside helper — and your everyday habits as its teammates.\n\n**Is Biome suitable for both men and women?**Yes, Biome works for both men and women. Weight struggles connected to gut imbalance don’t discriminate. Whether you’re male or female, 30 or 70, if you're dealing with stubborn belly fat, cravings, or slow metabolism, Biome is designed to support your journey toward a healthier, leaner body.\n\n**Real LeanBiome Review: Before & After Testimonials**\n\n*\"I honestly thought I was broken. I'd tried every diet you can name keto, fasting, low-carb and nothing seemed to stick. I'd lose a little, gain it right back. It was exhausting. Then I found Biome. It felt different from the start. Within a few weeks, my cravings calmed down. I wasn't constantly thinking about food anymore. And the stubborn belly fat that haunted me for years? It's finally starting to shrink. I feel like I have control over my body again.\"*— **Priyanka, 42, New Jersey**\n\n*\"The thing no one tells you about weight struggles is how much it messes with your confidence. I used to avoid mirrors and pictures at all costs. Biome didn’t just help my digestion or flatten my stomach — it helped me feel proud of my body again. I wake up with more energy, my jeans fit better, and for the first time in years, I feel excited to get dressed in the morning.\"*— **Marcus, 51, Texas**\n\n*\"I was skeptical at first. I mean, how could gut bacteria have anything to do with my cravings? But after trying Biome for about six weeks, I noticed I wasn’t raiding the pantry at midnight anymore. I wasn’t even thinking about sweets all the time. It's like my body’s hunger signals finally calmed down. And the bonus? I’m seeing my waistline come back without starving myself. I only wish I'd found this sooner.\"*— **Leah, 36, California**\n\n**Final Verdict: The LeanBiome Review**\n\nIf you’re tired of fighting your own body, exhausted from endless dieting, cravings, frustration, and self-blame. If you know deep down that something inside isn’t working the way it should then Biome could be the missing piece you’ve been searching for.\n\nIt doesn’t promise overnight miracles.

    "body": "**Introduction**\n\nMelaColl™ hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) is one of the members of the cellulose ethers where hydroxyl groups have been alternated for one or more of the three-hydroxyl groups in the cellulose. Our HPMC is a water-loving, biocompatible, and biodegradable polymer that has several ranges of applications in construction. This polymer dissolves in polar organic solvents, which implies that it is compatible with both non-aqueous and aqueous solutions. Having such distinct solubility property, makes HPMC possess solubility in both high and low-temperature organic solvents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**About EIFS**\n\nEIFS, which is the abbreviation for **Exterior Insulation and Finish System**, is also referred to as ETICS **(External Thermal Insulation Cladding System**). It is a term related to the construction industry. EIFS is concerned with the building of non-bearing cladding systems that offer additional protection to the external walls of buildings. The purpose of performing an EIFS on a construction building is for providing insulation to heat, prevent the penetration of water through the walls, and give a stylish finish surface.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[EIFS](https://preview.redd.it/98hjietkw3561.jpg?width=580&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d02e793c1489cf3d45cacb8ef6a218805a505428)\n\n**Functions of HPMC**\n\nFor most Engineers and project managers on construction sites, the chemical used to achieve an exterior insulation and finish system (EIFS) is hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC). \n\n● This cellulose has different properties that make it effective and preferred for EIFS. HPMC performs a key role in making insulated exterior walls while maintaining a smooth and attractive finish. \n\n● Experts depend on the properties of HPMC that makes it the best option for this construction work. Some of these properties include HPMC high resistance to sagging, water retention quality, and extended embedding time. \n\n● However, there are certain inherent qualities of HPMC that should be taken into consideration when using it for EIFS. These qualities include the viscosity, PH level, Gel temperature, particle size, light transmittance, and weight. HPMC water retention property is affected by these factors; hence, experts need to understand each properly.\n\n**Reasons for Applying MelaColl™ HPMC in EIFS**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MelaColl HPMC in EIFS](https://preview.redd.it/3p89uijow3561.jpg?width=583&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88083bded866c050bf77a5ad01e27127cd662a8d)\n\nUsing MelaColl™ hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) for Exterior Insulation and Finish System (EIFS) offers the following benefits:\n\n● Improved adhesion: The materials of the exterior walls are firmly held together by using this cellulose material.\n\n● The adequate wetting ability for EPS board and substrate: HPMC improves how effective the wetting of the board and substrate.\n\n● Reduced air entrancement and water uptake: The air spaces within the external walls of buildings become resistant to the passage of air, which may weaken the structure. Water uptake is reduced as well, HPMC increases the water retention of the walls and this does not allow water uptake.\n\n● Good consistency: This cellulose allows the walls to maintain a consistent finish look and appearance, and this adds beauty to the walls.\n\n● Good anti-bleeding: HPMC prevents the occurrence of bleeding within the exterior walls\n\n● Anti-crack and anti-shrinkage: The occurrence of wall cracks and shrinkages are prevented with the use of Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose.\n\n● Good workability: It also offers good workability. The designated particle size distribution assures quick or lumps free dissolution. It is suitable for all conventional mineral and organic binders.\n\nIf you are looking for excellent HPMC for EIFS/ETICS, please do not hesitate to [CONTACT US](https://melacoll.com/contact-us/) or find information on our [WEBSITE](https://melacoll.com/etics-eifs/).",

Contains 2% or less of: Carnauba Wax, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Magnesium Stearate, Natural Vanilla Flavor, Propylene Glycol, Stearic Acid.**\n\nIs there anything in here that you would avoid?

    "body": "Testo ultra legit supplement? According to my analysis, It may be fit for purpose, from containing a variety of all-natural ingredients, that are thought to increase testosterone levels. \n\nThe label below has been extracted directly from the TestoUltra official website. \n\n‘Ingredients: Capsule Shell in powder form on L-arginine base: hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, maca, carrot, 4: 1 Extract, 90% Powder, Calcium Ascorbate Dihydrate (83% Vit. C), Powder, Ginkgo Biloba 24% Glycosides 50:1 Extract Powder, Siberian Ginseng Extract 4:1 Extract, 90% Powder, Cocoa Beans (12% Polyphenols) Extract 90% Powder, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate (700 IU/g Vit. E) Powder, Nicotinamide (Vit. B3) Powder – VEGAN, Sodium Selenite, Zinc Gluconate, D-Calcium Pantothenate, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Riboflavin, Folic Acid, Thiamine Mononitrate, D-Biotin, Methylcobalamin\n\nFor More Info:- [http://testoultratestosteroneenhancer.com/](http://testoultratestosteroneenhancer.com/)\n\nWhat Does TestoUltra Cost?\n\nThe Testo ultra price currently stands at £34.99 (19/12/2022) for a 1 month supply of 60 capsules. However, the company has many offers available if you bulk buy. These offers include:\n\n£66.40 for 2 = £33.20 each\n\n£94.34  for 3 = £31.46 each\n\n£118.84 for 4 = £29.71 each\n\n£139.80 for 5 = £27.96 each \n\n£252.10 for 10 = £26.21 each \n\nFinal Thought\n\nDoes TestoUltra work? All in all, the TestoUltra supplement has a good range of testosterone boosting substances, but are the doses effective? We cannot be certain.\n\nA ‘normal’ testosterone range, may counter the chain of adverse effects like reduced sex drive, low muscular mass, and a decline in health.\n\nIn terms of Testo Ultra side effects, you could experience dizziness, muscle aches, and an upset stomach, but these are very rare.\n\nThe prices range between £26.21-£33.20 each depending on if you go for a 10 month supply or 1 month supply.\n\nEach container contains 60 capsules, of which are 30 servings (2 capsules per day) or a 1 month supply.\n\nTestoUltra Official Website:-

    "body": "hey everyone, I don’t have much knowledge on skincare, so hope y’all can help me out! \n\nSome contexts: \n• Broke my skin barrier due to over/cleansing & over/exfoliating. Trying to stay away from alcohol/fragrance/ active ingredients.\n\n• Skin type: Sensitive, Acne-prone \n\nBought LRP Dermo cleanser recently, gives off stinging effect a-bit. Not sure whether it’s because of its ingredients or my skin barrier that’s already damaged. Same goes for my moisturiser that have been working fine all these while. \n\nI’ll drop the ingredient list below, for reference.\nCleanser\nAQUA / WATER • ETHYLHEXYL PALMITATE • GLYCERIN • DIPROPYLENE GLYCOL • CARBOMER • SODIUM HYDROXIDE • CAPRYL GLYCOL / CAPRYLYL GLYCOL • ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\n\nMoisturiser \nAqua, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Acrylates/ Beheneth- 25 Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Arbutin (And) Vitis Vinifera/ Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Glutathione, Centella Asiatica Extract, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil And Ascorbyl Palmitate, Squalane, Panthenol, Copper Tripeptide-1, Sodium Carboxymethyl Beta-Glucan, Ceramide Eop, Ceramide Ns, Ceramide Np, Ceramide As, Ceramide Ap, Cholesterol (And) Hydrogenated Lecithin (And) Glyceryl Stearate (And) Dipropylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Didecylmonium Chloride, Polyquaternium- 80, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid (EDTA). \n\n\nThought of trying Pyunkang products to heal my skin barrier :( that’s been itching my face quite bad recently 😭 heard the toner are good. Is it really worth the hype? Also, should I change my current LRP dermo cleanser? Really don’t know what to do\n\nIf y’all have any advice/ tips/ opinion on my current skin barrier condition. Let me know! Thanks in advance and have an amazing week ahead. \n",
