    "body": "*Edit for disclaimer: ~~For those messaging me asking for the brand name, STOP. I will continue to ignore. I asked for one boundary and stated my reason for doing so. I don't need any more qualifiers.~~\n I also did not intend for this post to become a chat about encouraging unhealthy and damaging eating habits. Please seek help if you are suffering from an ED or trying to find a \"quick and easy diet\" in the form of laxatives or other methods; these are damaging. I did not consider this intially, but it's something that has been made aware to me. The story might be written in a funny way, but that's my process of the events. It wasn't funny or cool that I lost weight and dehydrayed myself in this method. It was painful and I'm going to need some recovery.*\n\nEdit 2: Removed indentifiers and potential encouragement for harmful ED behaviors\n\n\n\nSo, here's the thing. I may or may not have a slight to moderate addiction to these delicious violet mint candies.\n(I'm choosing not to give away the name of the maker of these candies ~~in an effort to protect the small company.~~ I won't sully their reputation because I sullied my toilet.) \n\nI recently found these succulent fragrant treats again after trying them years ago on a whim. They are the perfect blend of strong fragrance and chalky texture. I am enthralled with them. \nOr...I *was*.\n\nI forgot all about them until that first fateful day, about 4 or 5 weeks ago, while browsing online for nostalgic candies.\n\nFuck up 1: I found the same brand of violet candies and was very excited to have them again. I ate all four packages of mints in an embarrassingly short time. I started having some minor poopy issues here and there, but chalked it up to basic bacteria and subsequently forgot about them. I even went to so far as to passively blame by boyfriend by asking him if our dinners were giving him issues too. \n(He has been picking up a lot of the slack in the cooking department since I got a second job. Bless him.)\n\nFuck up 2: Seeing how I needed to refuel my latest addiction, I went directly to the manufacturer's website and...you guessed it...ordered 2 WHOLE BOXES of mints. \n\n-Fuck up 2.0: Almost a moment of clarity-\nSomething told me look up the ingredients of the mints, just for shits (lol) and giggles. I briefly read something about - specific chemical name-, but the article had too much of that darn fancy science mumbo jumbo. So, I went on with my life, or...what was to become of it, my careless days of yore.\nI should have trusted my gut...literally. I've read that animals have basic instincts of impending doom, like a signal of their own death. If only I knew my impending doom would result in the lament of my toilet. My triumph turned to tragedy. My seemingly harmless addiction leading me into a dark bathroom of despair.\n\nThird and final fuck up, or, \"The Violet Flower Enrapture and Evacuation of the Bowels\": \nSince the delivery date of my precious violet goldmine, I prided myself in how well I was conserving the candies. I only ate a few here or there, and would just pop a few in my mouth at work. Luckily I have been busy with both of my jobs, so I only ate them at home for the most part.\n\nAnd so began the turmoil of my poor gastrointestinal system. I began to notice more frequent trips to the bathroom, oftentimes more and more painful and horribly-smelling diarrhea. I mentioned it to my boyfriend because I was becoming concerned. I told him \"It's the smell...it's like nothing I've ever dealt with. It's not normal, but more like a chemical smell?\" I even asked my boyfriend a few more times if he was having similar issues.\nI was also very projective and passive-aggressive about his cleanliness around the kitchen. I feel awful and know I owe him a big fat apology when I see him. Poor guy :( \n\n(Sidenote: I chalked these bathroom trips to stress from the recent zoom family therapy  sessions, thinking I was so clever for remembering that \"stress can do that to you, y'know.\" I totally didn't take into account that I was EATING THE MINTS DURING THERAPY. Yeah, I'm *such* an academic.)\n\n\nFuck up assurance and toilet resolution:\nA few days ago I started noticing my weight was dropping pretty fast. Again, in my brilliance, I credited this to me working a lot as well as quitting soda. I switched to tea and coffee. (I also thought the coffee was to blame, but coffee never gave me those painful, cramping, and horrid blowouts.)\n\nLast night I stayed up very late talking on the phone for almost 3 hours with my sister, catching up about stuff that happened in our family therapy. By the time our call was up, I had consumed 1 and one-third entire packages....about 20 mints or so in just that phone call's time. A new record. But there are no wins here, only profound losses.\n\nToday's Fuck Up Confirmation:\nI woke up a few hours later at the asscrack (lol) of dawn. I was strangely feeling hungry. Bf went to work. I kissed him goodbye and went back to bed. Or so I thought. A violent violet cramp began to rumble until I was nearly doubling over on my way to the bathroom. Total (violet) Recall. (Bonus Willy Wonka quote: \"You're pooping violent violet!\")\n\nAnd somewhere between my agony and my confusion, something just *clicked*.\nI went to search that pesky chemical I remembered from the ingredient list. \nAnd welp, what would you know: magnesium stearate, when consumed beyond small doses, acts like a LAXATIVE EFFECT...........Fuck.\n\nFor clarification: I consumed almost 14 entire packs of mints, plus a few extra from the first order, in 4-5 GODDAMN WEEKS?! I did the math for 18 packages....that's 270 MINTS. 270?!?!?!\n(My bowels when reading this: I gotta get outta here!)\n\nPls kill me.\n\nJesus Christ I'm so dumb it hurts. It literally hurts. My butthole. My pride. My self-assurance. But most of all, my butthole. \nThe memory of these mints has been tainted by my willful ignorance, now conditioned by my folly. I feel sick just looking at them now. \n\nRIP my sweet violet mints of long ago: once held in the light of careless happiness, now fallen to the deepest recesses of a hell where toilet blowouts reign.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - \nBut most of all, I'm sorry to you, my sweet innocent boyfriend. You're amazing and I will be reading you this after work. Love u bby :{\n\nTL;DR for those with normal gut health: I ate a fuckton of violet candies in a very short time and got horrible diarrhea for weeks. Turns out it was a chemical ingredient that caused a laxative effect. \n\nTL;DR Lite Version: Bad thing in candy make tum tum go ouchie. Ate many candy in short time. Feel sad and not smart in brain.",

Immediately i pulled a can out and was like \"RYAN! let's play with this PLAY-DOH! I love this shit!\" Seconds later both Ryan and his mother (Amy) arrive in the kitchen, \"PUT IT BACK IN THE REFRIGERATOR TAYLOR!, that play-doh is for Ryan's dad\" Confused i said \"But Mark is like 100 yrs old, what does he need play-doh for?\" Amy told me \"He likes to open the cans and sniff the Play-doh, he's done it his whole life\" \"Don't touch, play with it or disturb it in any way.\" And that was the first time i learned what a Fetish was, i was 11.",

Like /u/TheDivergentStars said, you have to dilute them either with water or a carrier oil like Jojoba or Avocado oil.  To me, the real benefit is out of carrier oils for the most part.  Carrier oils are what provide the benefit as moisturizers for hair and skin, essential oils provide the scent that makes you not smell like a literal nut.\n\nA few drops of lavender oil, a drop of peppermint, and a drop of cedarwood in jojoba oil make an easy and effective beard oil without having to pay some etsy shop $25 for a 30 mL bottle.  Hell, you can put it in your head hair if it's dry.  I've gone the full yeard and made my own oils to keep it from not being stiff and looking like a mess of pubes.  It worked, smelled great but I can't say it cured any ailments.\n\nThe best and effective oil I have found is a 1 drop of tea tree oil mixed with water -- it will reduce swelling of pimples if you apply it on the pimple itself.  It'll also dry the fuck out of your skin if you overdo it.\n\nSource: I read a couple books, websites on \"essential\" oils and almost started a beard oil company...then I realized I didn't want to run an Etsy shop.",

He agrees so she shows up with her boyfriend, goodbye middle seat ‚òπÔ∏è\n\nOk, I'm not entitled to an empty middle seat, so no big deal. But after she settles in, she pulls out a vial and spritz, spritz, spritz... and makes as if she's offering to spray her boyfriend...

    "body": "Well, this had actually been going on for some time but I thought I'd share it. A few years ago, when I started the 9th grade, I noticed something odd. The guy next to me was endlessly sniffling and rubbing his nose. It quickly became clear that he was smelling something awful by his reactions. I couldn't pick it up at first, but I eventually came to find out that it was me by the comments that people made, even though I couldn't smell it myself. \n\nThis was odd to me as I showered and used deodorant every day without fail and even wore cologne sometimes. For about a year, I didn't even know what was happening. I only knew that I smelled gross and people hated me for it. And no matter how many deodorants and body washes I switched through, or how aggressively I showered, I still smelled awful. And I didn't have health insurance at the time so the doctor was a no go. It was extremely strange. I eventually came to find that a new line of deodorants I had discovered actually stopped me from smelling instead of worsening my odor issue like usual. \n\nThe problem was that it gave me constant chemical burns and only lasted a few hours out of a work day in the heat. But I didn't care, it worked so I carried it everywhere and used it four or five times in a day. I eventually managed to get health insurance and went to a doctor. For the longest time, they had no idea what was going on. They ran test after test to check for any diseases or major organ problems or anything, even going so far to test for rare conditions like PATM. I also had to stop using the deodorants that worked and switch to more generic ones because the former were causing permanent scars from all of the chemical burns. Every test came back negative, which was surprising because this odor issue had been ruining my life with the social isolation that it caused and I could have once sworn that some sort of major disease was the culprit. It was the only thing I could think of causing this major issue. \n\nEventually, my doctor had the idea that if some deodorants worked and others didn't maybe it was a fragrance sensitivity and I should try similarly scented deodorants. I had already gone through around 40 or so different types of deodorant by the time I saw the doctor( because i took one of each from the deodorant section and tried it), so I saw the suggestion as more or less useless. but I went around and tried like thirteen new types that I hadn't before and actually found one that worked without causing chemical burns or worsening my odor, it was a newly released scent from dove. And just like that, years of suffering came to an end more or less. As it would turn out, I developed an extremely rare genetic fragrance sensitivity impacting a fraction of one percent of the entire country, and there isn't any concrete testing to figure out the issue so it was rather hard to diagnose. \n\nFunnily enough, it's sometimes hard for me grasp how absurd the entire thing was and it's only now that I'm slowly picking up the pieces of a  devastated social life am I seeing how far reaching the effects of the condition was. Before i developed the issue, I thought that only the extremely unhygienic could reek so awfully to the point where their presence was intolerable. And yet there I was, reeking every day and not knowing why. Smelling bad once is a joke, smelling bad constantly is a very serious issue. Strangers look at you in disgust and scorn as they would a rapist for you offending their senses, especially on public transport, that was the reason I got a car even though I lived in the city actually. \n\nI had been stripped of a human ability so basic that most never even think of it, the ability to work closely with other people. I simply smelled to awful  due to the condition so my presence was an extreme hindrance. I had been isolated from much of my family due to depressive episodes and a few failed suicide attempts from the condition. I find myself on the receiving end of disdain and extreme scorn that I thought was reserved for a type of person I was simply incapable of ever becoming, but that wasn't the case. \n\nWell, I guess if anything maybe I learned empathy for other people's circumstances in a  very fucked up, brutal and absolutely soul crushing way. \n\ntl;dr smelled awful for years due to extremely rare condition but managed to end it.",

There was a $20 limit, so I decided to get her favourite brand and scent of fragrance oil she used in her office diffuser. The oil cost $15, so I put it in a cute box full of tiny origami stars I‚Äôd made and strung into a garland for the back of her monitor (she loved decorating her office.)\n\nI received a card, and inside was a note that said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a pleasure working with you this year, now go clean out the store room.‚Äù I smiled and pretended there was a big joke inside, but my boss - laughing and smiling - took my card and read it aloud to everyone.\n\nA few people laughed, then the HR lady (her best friend) asked if there was a gift. My boss said she‚Äôd ‚Äútake care of me‚Äù later. The ‚Äútaking care of me‚Äù was letting her drive me through the Starbucks drive thru and having a coffee on her company credit card while she spent the 10-minute drive not-apologizing and raving about her very funny joke. \n\nI smiled and chuckled and sipped my Pike Place and held back tears. $15 isn‚Äôt much, but every dollar counts and I had decided to short my own mother a stocking stuffer because of the secret Santa. I found a new job a few months later and spent the last few months there avoiding my boss. \n\nThe kicker: HR asked if I received a present from my boss. I told the truth and said she bought me a coffee on the company card. She said she was sorry and would look into it. Crickets. Meanwhile, my boss‚Äôs monitor looked adorable, her office smelled fragrant, and I hope she told her story of how she fucked me over the holidays and got at least a small side-eye.",

NO, YOU DONT NEED TO SPRAY 5 TIMES WHEN YOU ARE HANGING OUT (unless you are going to a party, but let not discuss this now). If you apply one in each side of your neck, and one in your back neck, then you know it won't last more then 5 hours. But you spray two times, in each location? Add some 15 min more. At the same time, the more you apply in yourself, the worst the smell get (Rule - you don't need to show that you are perfumed - but, if you hug, the person must notice).",

In Chanel, for example, all EdTs have highlighted ingredients to ensure they're always more casual, dynamic and fresh than the EdP counterparts. \n\nThe second, is that due to the higher alcohol content making them more volatile, an EdT might \"last\" less, but it will also likely \"travel\" more; while a parfum might last a very long time, and have a very dense scent, but will likely travel quite a bit less.",

I'm so tired of this being shared here. It's wrong.\n\nThe time a fragrance lasts changes according to several factors, concentration being one of them, and not the most impactful.\n\nThe 3 most impactful are:\n\n1- the notes used in the fragrance. Heavier notes last more than lighter notes. A heavy note could be tobacco, vanilla, amber, oud, insence, some woods, etc. Light notes are things like citrus, aldehydes, aquatic notes, floral notes etc. A fragrance like spicebomb extreme will last basically 16+ hours, because it's based on tobacco and vanilla, with spices supporting it.\n\n2- the chemistry of that specific fragrance on your skin. Thata why you have to try them yourself. My favorite fragrance, polo red extreme, has an insane chemistry with my skin, lasting very long while it dosent last well on some other people.\n\n3- the concentration does impact it, but not nearly as much as the previous two. Dior homme cologne, for example, is an EDC, and it does impact how long it lasts, even if the main reason it lasts very little is the focus on citrus.\n\nThere's also other stuff. An interesting one is how hot is it. Hotter climates tend to make a fragrance project more but last less, with the opposite being valid for colder places.\n\nAs an example: Versace Eros is an EDT, it lasts 12h on me, due to the heavy dose of vanilla it has and a good chemistry with my skin. Chanel allure homme edition Blanche/ Bleu de Chanel EDP are both EDP, and they last 4 to 6h on me, with much less projection (from how far you can smell the fragrance) than Versace Eros. This is due to them being very fresh fragrances focused on notes such as lemon, grapefruit.",

Original post by** u/Thatsnotmyfoot **in** r/confession\n\n*Reminder - Do not comment on linked posts!*\n\nmood spoilers: >!Sarcastic, Annoyed, Exasperated!<\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[**I destroyed my work project, and I hope I get fired**](https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/b094pd/i_destroyed_my_work_project_and_i_hope_i_get_fired/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - Tue, March 12, 2019\n\nThis is petty. I don't care.\n\nI've worked at a company for two years. In that time, I've gone from an 'incredible asset to the company' to 'babysitter'.\n\nI wish I was joking.\n\nThis company is owned by several people, but managed by a relative to the higher-ups. A guy who has never worked for anyone except his Mommy (who owns the company). A guy who is incapable of doing basically anything for himself. Someone who will 'one day' take over the company, who currently can't even figure out Bluetooth.\n\nMoron would be a compliment. You think I'm just being harsh on my boss or exaggerating.\n\nI wish. I wish it was just me being dramatic.\n\nLast phone call I had from him was him asking where he was. No, I'm serious.\n\n\"Foot, I'm driving. Where am I?\"\n\nHe asks me to track his phone, find his location, see if I can find a store near him that sells a certain item (that he can't remember the name of the store either, or where it is exactly), and then I am to GPS voice navigate him there using track his phone to tell him when to turn.\n\nThis is my life. 50+ phone calls a day from this man.\n\n\"Foot, did you get my email?\"\n\n\"Yes, I responded to it and answered your questions.\"\n\n\"Oh good. Read it out to me.\"\n\nProceed to read the email to him. He is happy.\n\nFast forward two hours. Get a scathing email from him, responding to my reply:\n\n\"Foot, why did you email me again when we just talked about this on the phone?! This wastes my time.\"\n\nI no longer do my regular job. I've been transitioned into this 'Personal Assistant' role, even though I did not want it. At all. To the point I'm currently searching for a new job.\n\nThe company is bleeding money like someone cut off both of its legs. Boss is supposed to be figuring out why, but the guy can't even pour himself a cup of coffee from the machine we've had for six years.\n\nIn my day to day, I also assist other departments. I have access to various software. I work alongside multiple managers and assist with their projects as well (when I'm not being asked to identify the brand of socks Boss is wearing so that he can figure out where to buy more, and have me call to 'have them set aside a package for me so I don't have to walk through the store looking for these like an idiot').\n\nBased on my observations, I found several problems that are costing us money. Either by purchasing, distribution, or just a general lack of adequate price adjustments. Some were serious enough that I even spoke to a different department manager, who was impressed and took me to the CEO to ask if I can be moved to their department to help fix some of the identified problems.\n\nCEO is Boss's Mother.\n\nI get told that I absolutely am not allowed to transfer. That I am far too valuable as a personal assistant to be shared with other departments. That Boss will handle and oversee the changes that need to be made.\n\nManager and I were stunned. Turns out, Mother wants to step away from the company and wants Boss to run it. That Boss just needs more projects to work on to get a better understanding of how to run the company.\n\nBoss gets called in, told that I identified several issues and that Boss needs to get them resolved. Boss gets mad at Mother, telling her he doesn't have time to do that. Mother says she understands, that he is a very busy boy. (Again, I'm not joking. Sitcoms can't even write this kind of shit).\n\nBoss later calls me into his office, and tells me that I am to work on fixing all of these issues, but that I'm to give him all my notes, tell him how I fixed it and he will present it to the board. Boss then proceeds to leave for the day, calling me later to ask what kind of mustard was the mustard he liked the most on his deli sandwiches. Then proceeded to lecture me on mustard, because the answer I gave him was obviously not the right kind of mustard and that I need to pay more attention to things like that.\n\nI hung up the phone, picked up all my notes on this 'bleeding money' situation/project, and shredded them.\n\nOops. Sorry! I'm too much of an idiot to handle doing any type of investigation work into our financial records for the past 5 years. I'm certainly too much of an idiot to notice that your profit margins went from 32% to less than 18.3% on the majority of our products we manufacture, all the while giving our distributors more than 46% discount so that they 'keep coming back for more'.\n\nHere is hoping Boss can figure that out, especially considering the layoffs we keep having.\n\nExcuse me while I make note of what kind of mustard he prefers on his Montreal smoked meat sandwich, which is a much more important use of my time.\n\nBecause, in the words of Boss: \"Maybe one day you'll be capable, like me, if you keep working at it.\"\n\nI hope I get fired.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[**UPDATE**](https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/bxid0k/update_for_i_destroyed_my_work_project_and_i_hope/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - Thu, Jun 06, 2019\n\n*Taken from ceddit*\n\nDespite a few interviews, I am still in this god-forsaken hole. You may be wondering: \"So! Foot! Did you get fired for shredding the project notes?!\"\n\nNope. Lectured? Yes. Got told I was a disappointment? Yes.\n\nThings that have happened since then:\n\nBoss has determined that fixing these issues isn't actually that important after all and that me shredding the documents wasn't a huge loss. Boss proceeded to inform me that I was 'looking for problems' and that I should keep my nose clean regarding company matters. AKA: Stop trying to find things that are wrong that he would have to fix.\n\nStill getting 40+ phone calls a day. Today my first phone conversation was:\n\nBoss: Foot, it's raining.\n\nFoot: Yes... it is...\n\nBoss: Did you get more rain at your house than at my house?\n\nFoot:... I don't know...\n\nBoss: Well don't you measure your rain?\n\nFoot: No.\n\nBoss: You should! Then you'll know how much rain there was.\n\nFoot: Do you measure your rain?\n\nBoss: Oh no, we just water the garden when it gets dry.\n\nFoot:... So... why did you ask?\n\nBoss: Well if you told me how much rain you got by measurement, I could guess at how much rain I got and I could see who got more rain! But now I can't, so whatever.\n\nFoot: ... Anything else, Boss?\n\nBoss: No that's it. I'll be at work soon.\n&nbsp;\n\nOn a good note, I have actually stopped doing my job. I don't get paid enough for this shit. I spend my days babysitting, doing the most mundane of tasks, doing only 'enough' to not get caught and spending the rest of my time spread out between working on a novel, watching training videos online related to my field or upgrades, on Reddit, writing the same list over and over, creating spreadsheets for things that don't matter and submitting my resume to new job listings.\n\nI've realized I can't get fired at this point. Not because it's impossible, but because the funds aren't there to do severance. I've even been warned that our paychecks might bounce next week and that they will be writing manual checks that we can take to the bank teller and have them check if there is enough money BEFORE we deposit them.\n\nObviously I'm looking for anything at this point.\n\nAre we still hemorrhaging money? You bet your sweet ass we are.\n\nDid I ask for additional access to sales orders as part of my research? Sure did.\n\nDid I manage to confirm that we are selling almost all of our wholesale products for below cost? Yep.\n\nDoes CEO care? Nope. Cause 'sweet baby boy' will 'make things all better once he gets the hang of running a company'.\n\n- On that note, here are additional things I have done this past month:\n\n- Replaced Boss's pens in his office entirely with crayons\n\n- Purchased the bathroom scent spray fragrance that Boss says he hates, with enough supply for the next year so they can't justify buying more\n\n- Had the boys from the shop string up his office chair from the overhead crane\n\n- Called all my vendors that I have working relationships with and had Boss's authorization removed from all accounts, citing a need for 3 signature approvals to override\n\n- Destroyed my notes for fixing the inventory system, which had been neglected for 15 years and I re-organized to a functional point. This was deemed 'not necessary', so I removed all my work and shredded those documents too\n\n- I listen to music all day, or podcasts, despite the policy against it\n\n- I take extra-long breaks, up to an hour where I disappear\n\n- I took a week off with only 5 hours notice, and came back to not being fired.\n\n- I sign my email signatures with increasingly strange job titles. Today I am 'Unicorn Wrangler and Wizard Assistant'.\n\nAnd now I'm sitting on Reddit, updating you all.\n\nIt's been a magical, wonderful ride and I wouldn't wish this on anyone. I hope you've been entertained, shocked, awed, and perhaps a bit more disappointed in the human race.\n\nI'll survive, but I don't think the horrors of the shit I've seen will ever go away.\n\nThere was that one time that Boss couldn't get his suspenders back on and came into my office with his pants around his knees asking for help in nothing but old man tighty whiteys.\n\nSeriously. I didn't get paid enough for this shit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Reminder - I am not the original poster.**",

    "body": "1- hijab being a choice is a privilege. \n\nHijab culture is so toxic it's pretty much women one upping eachother on how invisible they could be because the more you cover up, the more brownie points you get on being a \"good muslim women\".\n\n This reaches it's top in the [niqab/burqa](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/yFluUS_2sRRHGWg47fV4AUT5Cexm1zgo0zqwtaizq8LHIz6uuuoy796c02mP_iyQ9mCMPI26L9OkYWhaYql6-GiAKXvlJMwCpQw5qWbpnu4p_MOUNIKBGAZjIyBk2O5b7tDaAYWJ26HpE3IE3_LJqexW9Amc6G8A82JlSFugOBnLFycssUigNw) whose women give up their enitre idnetity becasue it's a race to the bottom. How invisible can you be to avoid triggering men sexually.. well the face is an attractive part of the body.. cover that.\n\n \n\nIf you grow up in a Muslim community, they will not teach you that hijab is a choice. They will teach you that hijab is mandatory to all women in Islam. Depending on where you live/ your family the option of it being a true free choice is different for every person. And best case scenario in which you are only doing it for Allah it's the choice of wearing it or going to hell. \n\n Instead of advocating that women live their life freely islam advocated that women live their lives trying to avoid triggering men sexually. For example you shouldn't speak softly to avoid triggering men with your voice. Another example there is a religious saying by the prophet that if a woman wore perfume and walked by a group of men and they smelled it, she is considered an adulterer cus she might trigger them with her perfume lol it's so effed up\n\n2- the pressure on men to enforce it \n\n Because of honor culture women are already not free to do what they want anyway, add to that the idea of hijab and you have a society where women's clothes is considered a reflection of how much of a man her husband is. \n\nSo, not only is the woman considered less because she doesn't cover up, her husband is also considered less of a man because he doesn't make her do it. Men are shamed for how their wives dress/behave and are called dayouth ÿØŸäŸàÿ´ ie why do are you letting your wife showing her body to people ..This is because of a hadith by the prophet mentioning the dayouth word. \n\nThis means that it's not just men forcing women to do it. It's a whole community that enforces Islam on everyone. Other women can be worse than men. \n\n3- Extreme slut shaming.\n\n Women are called / \"motabraja\" which is a dergatory term for uncovered women or those who wear makeup/ whores / \"naked meat\" \"cheap meat\"/ the wood of hell fire if they take the hijab off. This is because of one \"hadith\" ( a saying by the prophet mohammed) where the prophet goes to the upper sky and sees women tortured because they were \" dressing nakedly\" \n\n\nWomen are constantly made to feel guilty over how they dress. To give you an example most women are made to feel guilty for wearing pants or jeans.. Even if she's covering every inch of her body she isn't wearing \"proper hijab\" becaause to be a good muslim women you should wear clothes that \" don't show the size of your legs\" why? well ofc to avoid triggering men sexually \n\nIt's an important thing to know that it's not just men subjecating women. Women themselves shit on other women who aren't modest like them. Women who don't wear it think  of themselves as sinners and are made to believe those who wear it are better than them. Sometimes women can be worse than men tbh. \n\n4- victim blaming is the norm\n\nWomen are almost always blamed for their sexual assault, they weren't modest enough and did the ulitmate sin of triggering the guy sexually. This happens everywhere but here it's to the extreme. again \"nromal clothes\" like a wearing a t-shirt or showing your hair are considered immodest and provoking the attack. \n\nBeing raped or sexually assaulted is considered a scandal to the victim and her family. I know of one girl who was beaten by her family for reporting her sexual harassmer to the police. Another family cut off their daughter and pressured her to avoid filing a lawsuit against her rapists. Their thinking is to avoid other people knowing that their daughter got assaulted which is again is scandalous for the girl. \n\n[Here is one extreme example of a Cleveland clinic researcher who says all women are responsible for their rape except those who wear burqas ]\n\n5- it's not oppressive because some freely wear it? \n\nSome people will say some women freely wear hijab so it is not oppressive for me it's like saying some Chinese people freely like the CCP so there's no political oppression in China. You can freely wear it but taking it off requires you have to consider the backlash you will face from everyone around you and the [physical danger you would be in if you spoke out against it.](https://youtu.be/TwXHx2JG4Dk) I was one of those ppl who freely wore at 11! But when I grew up found out that I can't freely not wear it.\n\n\n\nIf the government threatens you with torture if you don't cover up, no one has a problem calling that oppressive. Well Islam threatens women with torture in hell fire  if they don't cover up. How is there an argument of whether it's oppressive or not? \n\nIt is the existence of a mandatory religious dress code that is for women only to avoid triggering men that is oppressive. It's not to judge any specific person's choice. I don't care why you wear hijab personally. I care that that there is this discriminatory rule that women are penalized (religiously and socially) if they don't follow. \n\n \n\n6- it's only in the middle east that's oppressive? \n\nSome people say it's only in the middle east.. [Please watch Dina Tokio's video where she's reading hate comments of being called a whore and a porn star because she is showing her hair](https://youtu.be/i3kIJd-_yiY). This has happened with many Muslim hijabi youtubers who chose to take it off. So it's a problem with the Muslim community everywhere!\n\n7- other religions have it too? \n\nThe difference between the Islamic rules and other religions is that people take them incredibly seriously and literally. Liberal Muslims are a minority. The laws of the most Muslim countries is mainly inspired by the religion or out right theocratic. In the west you can escape your religious family and live a normal life else where. In the Middle East you have to leave the whole country for that which of course not everyone can afford. \n\n8- that's just culture? \n\nSome ppl will say it's culture but this is not true it's a mix of both toxic religious ideals of what a good woman is like plus a toxic patriarchal culture. Women being considered adulterers for wearing perfume is a religious saying for example! How do you expect a culture inspired by that will be like? \n\n\nBut I am happy to answer the question of how do we know if it's religious enforcement or truly what women want. In the Middle East, Christian women aren't pressured to wear the hijab or the niqab even though they live in the same culture that western Muslims always try to stick every bad aspect to it and not the religion.\n\n\n In Egypt, Christian women wear short dresses and have their hair out VS their Islamic peers can't do the same as freely. Christian women wear these short dresses in their gathering among themselves (ie other Christians) but can't wear them on the street where the majority of ppl are Muslims. It's not exactly like being in a western country but the rules are much lax for them and the only difference is religion.\n\n9- so you want us to ban hijabs \n\nOfc not. Women should be able to live how they want to even if that choice is to follow an oppressive rule. I am just against the glorification of this choice and the minimization of the social and religious baggage that comes with it. It's not a fashion accessory. It's a mandatory dress code for women. \n\nI just hope western feminists will stop accepting it as freely as they have. It's incredibly naive to try to water down the experiences of millions of women who were programmed with the toxic religious mindset and just start promoting that it's a choice without questioning why the hijab exists in the first place. Western women don't know how good they have it just being able to Show Your Hair. Wear what they want. Wear cute dresses. Show some skin. It's sth I had to spend 25 years of my life trying to do. \n\n10- but I it's bad to criticize another culture \n\nI don't know how that became a thing but some how white or western feminist are made to feel guilty if they critique the Islamic treatment of women. They are gas lit into thinking that saying women are oppressed in Islam is stereotyping people. If you are against the hijab you are an Islamophobic Nazi. \n\nThis is so so dumb. I don't have to be Chinese to say that footbinding is bad. A culture can be wrong and you should be able to say so. It doesn't make you alt right to say mandating women spend their entire lives covered up to avoid sexual harassment is bad, it makes you a regular feminist. \n\nPlease don't let any one make you feel bad for advocating against misogynistic ideas because it comes from 'brown people'. You should be able to call out Islam just as you do others. \n\nBTW Muslims shit on western culture all the time lol \n\n\n11- hijab is not about men I wear it for another reason \n\nThis is something you only hear western Muslims say. This is maybe what it's for you personally but it's not what it's in Islam. For example, the day you are required to start wearing hijab is the same day you are able to get married which is the day you start getting your period. \n\nIn the Quran, the context in which the hijab is mentioned is that some people were sexually harassing women so God ordered free women to cover up to mark themselves  as free women not slaves and thus be protected from sexual harassment. \n\nWomen are allowed to stop covering  themselves up so much  once they are so  old that they  \"have no hopes of getting married\" per quranic verses. \n\n\n.\n12- but I visited a Muslim country and it wasn't like that\n\n\n\nPlease understand that the Middle East has many different countries. [Not all of them are Saudi arabia and not all of them are Lebanon either.](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/01/08/what-is-appropriate-attire-for-women-in-muslim-countries/) There is also variation in different cities within the same country. Usually the touristy and rich Areas are the ones westerners have access to and are the most lax. \n\nYou can go to a touristy area in Egypt and wear a bikini but if you wear one in a regular beach where regular middle class Egyptians go, you will probably get raped.\n\nIt really depends on where you are but these ideas are always there in the background even if you can't see them in the place you visit.\n\n\n\n\n13- Men also have to cover\n\nThis is also one of the favorite lines apologists like. A covered Muslim man is one who covers between his belly button and his knees. So basically a coverd Muslim man is half naked one.\n\nObviously, there is no hadith speaking of uncovered naked men being tortured in hell or anything like that it's just the woman lol. This rule is also mostly ignored socially anyway. Very rarely will you ever see anyone giving a guy shit for not abiding by it.\n\nAnyone who has seen a woman in a burqa walking with her casually dressed husband or you could also go to to a swimming pool and see women covered from head to toe with their husband's in shorts and you can immediately tell that this argument is utter bullshit. and you really can't compare the rules for men and women.\n\n\n14- some final words \n\n\nFrom  \"the world‚Äôs first feminist\" prophet Mohamed :\n\n-I had a chance to look into the Paradise and I found that majority of the people was poor and I looked into the hell Fire and there I found the majority constituted by women.\n\n\n - I have not left after me any (chance) of turmoil more injurious to men than the harm done to the men because of women\n\n \"The life of the world is sweet and green. Allah makes you generations succeeding one another so that He may try you in respect of your actions. So beware of the beguilements of the world and those of women. The first trial of Banu Israel was through women\"\n\n\n\n- Any woman who puts on perfume then passes by people so that they can smell her fragrance then she is an adulteress.'\"\n\n- When a man calls his wife to come to his bed (ie to have sex with her) and she refuses and does not come to him and he spends the night angry, the angels curse her till the morning\n\n\n \"There are two types of people who will be punished in Hell and whom I have not seen: men having whips like the tails of cows and they will be beating people with them, and, women who will be dressed but appear to be naked, inviting to evil; and they themselves will be inclined to it. Their heads will appear like the humps of the Bactrian camel inclined to one side. They will not enter heaven and they will not smell its fragrance which is perceptible from such and such a distance.\"\n\n\n\nAban bin Sam'ah narrated that his mother said:\n\"I heard 'Aishah say: 'The Messenger of Allah [SAW] forbade the woman who does tattoos and the woman who has that done, the woman who affixes hair extensions and the woman who has that done, An-Namisah (the one who does the eyebrow plucking) and Al-Mutanammisah (the one who has it done)\n\n\t\nAishah narrated that: The Messenger of Allah said: \"Whichever woman married without the permission of her Wali (male guardian) her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid. If he entered into her, then the Mahr(dowry) is for her in lieu of what he enjoyed from her private part. If they disagree, then the Sultan is the Wali for one who has no Wali.\"\n\n\nThe Prophet (Ô∑∫) said: If any woman asks her husband for divorce without some strong reason, the odour of Paradise will be forbidden to her.\n\n\nIf a woman prays her five (daily prayers), fasts her month (Ramadaan), guards her chastity and obeys her husband, it will be said to her: Enter Paradise by whichever of the gates of Paradise you wish.‚Äù Narrated by Ahmad (1664) and others\n\n\nTldr: Dress code for women bad. hijab bad. No free Choice can be made under threat of torture. The bad culture is in many ways inspired by the religion. Western Feminists need to stop being scared of criticizing it!",

        "body": "You've made some very good points, and I think it's undeniable that the Hijab is a tool of oppression. It represents a facet of muslim culture which clearly believes that women are less human, and so they have fewer rights. When it is enforced through inhumane tactics it is deplorable.\n\nBut I just want to play devil's advocate here: do you know it isn't *sometimes* a choice?  We should stamp out all of the lies and misogyny that islam peddles, but after doing that, will there still be women who choose to where a Hijab? Are they allowed to do so, if they truly make that choice freely?\n\nI'll give you an example: I'm a cis man, and I don't feel comfortable in public without a shirt on. I know I *could* go for a walk topless, but I just don't feel comfortable doing it. I would feel too exposed. So I choose to wear a shirt. I don't think anybody would have a problem with this. \n\nIf we're willing to allow me to make choices about how I cover my body in public, everyone should have that privelige. So if a woman who was raised muslim doesn't feel comfortable showing her hair in public, it might *be her choice* to wear a headscarf. And that's okay. I might not agree with it, but that's her choice. \n\nAnd as long as women are saying \"I choose to wear this,\" then I'm forced to believe them. Otherwise I'm doing something almost-as-bad: assuming all muslim women are liars. Surely some of them are telling the truth.\n\nThat's why we atheists land in a difficult position: we must fight against mandatory coverings and misogynistic muslim laws. We must stamp out religion itself, but never the freedom to practice it. We have to use reason to overcome hate, but never dogmatically force our views on others.\n\nAnd we have to defend the right of women to be allowed to wear a headscarf. **Because only when women are *truly* free to choose to wear a headscarf, will they also be free to choose to take it off.**",

I think it is fine to criticize Western feminists for giving some support to the \"my choice to wear the hijab\" stuff.  that is wrong headed and not helpful.  I suspect they think they are helping muslim women in Western countries who were being terrorized by Western non-muslims when they wore their hijab in Western countries.  Still I do think it is fair to criticize them for not understanding how that affects muslim women in muslim countries.  I also think that same criticism should be put on all the women in muslim countries that do not stand up and fight back against the muslim patriarchy.  \n\nYeah, I know - there are laws, they can be jailed and tortured for speaking out - BUT - where else do they expect this change to come from?  Do they expect muslim men to suddenly become \"enlightened\" and give them their freedom?  That just won't ever happen.  Do they expect the West to lead the charge for them?  More Western influence is the last thing they say they want.\n\nThe change must be driven from the inside.  That is exactly how Western women obtained the rights they now have and that some muslim women say they want.

My skin is especially sensitive to fragrance, citrus and floral essential oils. Because of this I‚Äôve become a bit of a skincare nerd and an obsessive ingredients list reader.

Didn‚Äôt do much.   \n*Bottom Line:* Last time I was at sephora I did notice that the cream is no longer a light green color, so I think they changed the formula.   \n¬†   \n28.¬†¬† ¬†**Caudalie Beauty Elixir Face Mist ‚Äì 0/10**  \n*Pros:* None.   \n*Cons:* Doesn‚Äôt smell great, does nothing, has alcohol, fragrance, rosemary oil, citral, linalool, citronellol‚Ä¶).   \n*Bottom Line:* Outdated product imo.  \n¬†   \n29.¬†¬† ¬†**Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen 40 SPF ‚Äì 5/10**  \n*Pros:* Doesn‚Äôt leave a white cast.   \n*Cons:* Expensive and broke me out.    Feels very silicone heavy. like my skin was suffocating.    \n*Bottom Line:* Sensitive acne prone skin beware.   \n¬†    \n30.¬†¬† ¬†**U beauty The Plasma Lip Compound (Rose) ‚Äì 0/10**   \n*Pros:* Couldn‚Äôt keep it on my lips long enough.   \n*Cons:* Smells so bad like straight up chemicals.   \n*Bottom Line:* So disappointing because it was really expensive.   \n¬†   \n31.¬†¬† ¬†**Youth to the People Polypeptide-121 Future Cream ‚Äì 7/10**   \n*Pros:* Hydrating and plumping.   \n*Cons:* Started to smell a little funny when I got halfway through the jar.   \n    \n32.¬†¬† **Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm ‚Äì 8/10**   \n*Pros:* Nice creamy texture that melts into the skin. Smells delicious and removes makeup well.   \n*Cons:* Leaves a greasy film on my eyes\nBottom Line: One of the few glow recipe products that I actually like.    \n¬† \n33.¬†¬† **Fresh Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream (Night) ‚Äì 1/10**\n*Pros:* lovely texture.   \n*Cons:* Smells way too strong, like straight up perfume. Has citral, limonene, lemon peel oil and fragrance.   \n*Bottom Line:* Sensitive skin beware.   \n¬†    \n34.¬†¬† **Typology Niacinamide 12% - 5/10**   \n*Pros:* Inexpensive.   \n*Cons:* 12% niacinamide is too strong for my skin.   \n*Bottom Line:* studies show that your skin reacts best at a 4% concentration. I like to add a little into my moisturizer every so often to dilute it.   \n¬†    \n35.¬†¬† ¬†**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask ‚Äì 3/10**  \n*Pros:* Smells delicious (but has fragrance).       \n*Cons:* Made my lips more dry. I don‚Äôt like having to scoop into a jar.        \n*Bottom Line:* I don‚Äôt understand the hype of this product.    \n¬†     \n36.¬†¬† **Clarins Lip Comfort Oil - 9/10**  \n*Pros:* Not sticky, lasts a while and very shiny.   \n*Cons:* Wish there was more color payoff and kinda pricey (not doir expensive but getting there).    \n*Bottom Line:* My fav lip product to date.

    "body": "**I am NOT the Original Poster. That is** [mirsw](https://www.reddit.com/user/mirsw/)**.** She posted in r/relationship_advice\n\nParagraph breaks added for readability.\n\n# Do NOT comment on Original Posts. Latest update is 7 days old.\n\n**Mood Spoiler:** >!happy ending!<\n\n**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i7igab/my_boyfriend_24m_threatened_to_break_up_over_miss/)**: January 22, 2025**\n\nHi guys, my boyfriend (24M) and me (22F) have been together for almost 2 years now. Aside from some small bumps in the road, we have been in a very good place throughout the whole relationship. However, last night things escalated, over - in my opinion - something super dumb. But he thinks differently of that, and now stopped talking to me.\n\nIt started when we were on bed, he was gaming and I was on my laptop looking to order a new perfume. Since I stopped my job (to focus on studying) I don‚Äôt have as much income, so I decided to not get the expensive perfume I usually go for, Miss Dior. I thought it‚Äôd be better to find a body spray with a resembling scent. As he was looking over my shoulder he asked me what I was doing, so I explained.\n\nHe then reacted saying I wore Miss Dior in our first period of dating and it is ‚Äúmy smell‚Äù, and how it was one of the things that attracted him to me. I must admit this made me a bit annoyed, because I‚Äôd rather get that perfume too - but it‚Äôs just not responsible to do so right now. He started rambling on how I care more about saving money than I care about him. I said that‚Äôs not true, but then he kept saying his hypersensitivity issues can‚Äôt deal with adjusting to a new scent.\n\nI said I‚Äôd find a scent similar to my old one, but he wasn‚Äôt content. At this point he said he‚Äôd have to break up with me if I would go for another scent. I found this hilarious and thought he surely must be joking so I laughed, which made him go silent. I let him be, because I was really annoyed, and we went to sleep.\n\nNow he left early morning and doesn‚Äôt respond to my texts or calls. I have no idea what to do and I‚Äôm starting to doubt how I handled the situation.\n\nDid I fail him by not taking his hypersensitivity into account?\n\n***Top Comments:***\n\n**EmceeSuzy:** I'm concerned that you are even asking this question.\n\nThis boyfriend of yours tried to assert that you must stick with the Dior perfume and never once offered to buy it? What is wrong with him?\n\nIn any case, his reaction to your perfume choice is very strange. What are you asking us if YOU did something wrong?\n\n**Shelby\\_the\\_Turd:** Lol threatening to end the relationship because you don‚Äôt stick to the brand of perfume he likes. Say that aloud. He is holding the relationship hostage because you didn‚Äôt smell a certain way.\n\n**AuntyVenom:** \\>.He started rambling on how I care more about saving money than I care about him.\n\nDid he offer to buy it...for you? This is some of the dumbest shit I've ever heard, sorry. OFC if you're in saving money mode you're gonna pull back on admittedly frivolous purchases, and any regular partner with their head on straight would be glad they had a frugal partner when circumstances demand. He wants you to overspend in order to satisfy his pantsfeelings.\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ib4ao7/update_my_boyfriend_24m_threatened_to_break_up/)**: January 27, 2025 (5 days later)**\n\nWow, first of all, thanks everyone who gave me advice (and some tough love). I did not expect so many of you to help me and definitely teared up at some of your replies.\n\nAfter I posted this I was a bit of a mess, but after hours of ignoring me he texted me late in the evening and asked me to meet up, because he does not want us to be in a bad place. I really wanted to talk to him, at least to clear things up, so I went to his place. When I got there he acted a bit disappointed still, but he did say he didn‚Äôt want us to fight. I felt the same, but also took your advice to heart: the idea of letting HIM buy a bottle.\n\nHowever, for some context, I do think he might be on the spectrum (no diagnose but his dad is too, and it‚Äôd make sense) so I did want to show him I care and take his hypersensitivity seriously. Therefore I decided to suggest we pay half/half for a new Miss Dior and then until that one would be finished, I‚Äôll make sure to do research to find a really good dupe.\n\nHe was not as convinced, told me it wasn‚Äôt my birthday anytime soon. I explained that I understood but we‚Äôd have to both compromise. Well, to quote his literal words: ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre such a feminist, you should be so financially too‚Äù. This got me fuming. I had no words, so this time I left.\n\nAs per your advice (in the replies), I did some thinking about the rest of our relationship. I realised other things in our relationship that at the time didn‚Äôt sit quite right with me, were situations of him being controlling and self-concerned, situations I always considered as little things he‚Äôd mean differently or would learn from. I was wrong. You were right.\n\nI asked him to meet up today and I dumped his ass. I feel terrible right now, but I know I‚Äôm better off. So, anyone advice for a cheap, nice body spray?\n\n***Some of OOP's Comments:***\n\nCommenter: That was a difficult decision, but the right one. I don't know where you live but in the UK/Ireland Aldi does a great miss dior dupe on occasion. It's called perfect pink.\n\n>**OOP:** We do have an Aldi here so I‚Äôm going to check it out! Thank you!!!!\n\nCommenter: Good for you, he sounded unreasonable. I would have said that he should pay the difference between the perfume you would have bought and the perfume he wanted you to buy but his comments are so out of line it‚Äôs not even worth thinking about anymore¬†\n\n>**OOP:** I didn‚Äôt even think about this, it would have been a good reaction but since he thinks I have to pay everything because I‚Äôm a feminist, I don‚Äôt think he would‚Äôve been okay with that either‚Ä¶\n\nCommenter: I‚Äôm so tired of people weaponizing feminism. Good riddance.\n\n>**OOP:** This. I always found it very hard to be mad at him for long, but when he said this I felt like he showed his true colours and I was so, so done\n\nCommenter: What did he say when you broke up with him?\n\n>**OOP:** He mumbled something along the lines of ‚Äúgood, I deserve better‚Äù but after that he did text me to say sorry and if we can talk again, so he‚Äôs not very consistent ://:\n\nCommenter: Good on you for throwing him out, OP! I‚Äôm glad you also got recommendations for a dupe perfume, although maybe a change of fragrance may not be a bad idea so you don‚Äôt associate it with him!\n\n>**OOP:** Thank you a lot!!! I was thinking the same thing, I feel like it‚Äôs a good time to re-invent myself, starting off with a new signature scent hehe",

    "body": "Course: XenoBiology\n\nInstructor: Professor Ed (Note: The Professor's real name is unpronounceable to the majority of sapients thus a monosyllabic name was chosen at random by his previous institution.)\n\nRating: 4.7/5\n\nTop Comment: Beware the Chalk.\n\nMost asked: What‚Äôs Chalk?\n\nMost Helpful: Good luck on the first day. Take the bags.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLecture Hall 47, was, by far, the largest one in the complex. It was a point of pride for Professor Ed something that he, in his mind, had earned. It also had the dubious honor of possessing a piece of history so archaic that it was shunned by every other professor in the university: A blackboard. Blackboards were, according to the professor, one of the few useful things Humanity had provided in the two decades post contact. It‚Äôs not that his people, or any other people for that matter, were incapable of producing slate and chalk it's that nobody else clung to such archaic traditions with quite as much vigor. But it was a useful one, and thus it was tolerated, and when he was feeling charitable, it was defended. It helped him single out those students who were meticulous enough to take their own notes instead of relying on digitized lectures and holographic slides. The fact that it gave him projectiles with which to discipline the stupid and the unruly was a completely unintentional and entirely secondary benefit.\n\nProfessor Ed‚Äôs exterior mandibles twitched in excitement. It was the first day of the first semester, the heady perfume of innocence and optimism was as infectious as it was omnipresent. Many of the, arguably saner, custodial staff would claim that the professor simply spent too much time inhaling formaldehyde and cleaning agents and it had finally gotten to him. Whatever the air quality of hall 47 may have been, the true source of the Professors glee was his students. He wouldn't waste time covering the syllabus and explaining his expectations, the idiots could read it themselves. Those of them who couldn't or wouldn't had no place being at the best university in the spiral arm, if not the galaxy. He'd go strait for the throat and disabuse them of any notions of complacency, any vestiges of naivety and any, physical or psychological frailty. He hummed, a terrifying sound produced by his species vocal cords and jaws, as he lined up his chalk. The pieces used for writing, pristine and fresh from their boxes, were carefully slotted into styli to prevent premature breaking while the old ones, used for throwing, were set into four distinct piles: One for each manipulator\n\nThe doors at the front of the building unlocked and the sounds of hooves, feet, wings, suction cups and whatever else the myriad species of the galaxy used for locomotion filled the building. The cacophony of movement only occasionally disrupted by the quiet murmurs of uneasy students seeking directions. He sighed when the humans arrived. Of course, they had arrived together, of course they all knew each other, and it was only natural they would be the loudest mammals in the damn building. They weren't a bad race per se they were just...insufferably cocky. Sure, they had arrived on the galactic scene with all the subtly of a supernova, won a war, turned religious fanatics into a fine mist, and were possessed of a few amusing mutations and adaptations but still...they could at least keep up some pretense of humility. Dr. Ed was amazed that even after 20 years not a single human had been devoured by a Skrilat, especially given the number of them that had either tried to pet them or gotten drunk and tried to fight them. It might be that he was underestimating the impact that the Styx firestorms had had on the galaxy or the mental scars left by St. Urbans guns but really... it was just a matter of time.\n\nThe students finally arrived at his hall, the multitude of shapes and forms brought a renewed smile to his face. The tapestry of life was one of the most beautiful sights in the galaxy and there was no better place to witness it than a university. Every species, every race, every sapient in attendance had to coexist in close proximity without prejudice, at least on paper anyways. The confusion on the students faces as they entered the hall was one of the few things which Dr. Ed lived for, a brief moment of levity before his work began. It was a natural for a generation who had grown up rarely holding a stylus. The projectors weren‚Äôt on, there were no models to reveal the subject of the day there, there weren't even any displays, there was only the blackboard which none of the students had ever seen...almost none of them anyways.\n\n‚ÄúDude...A Chalkboard!‚Äù One human said elbowing his friend in the ribs, shattering the moment.\n\n‚ÄúHuh? Man... it‚Äôs like being in Mrs. Braun‚Äôs class!‚Äù\n\nThe first human laughed the second one laughed with him...both were deserving targets. Chalk, fired with pinpoint accuracy, hit the two humans in the forehead shutting them up and motivating them to find their seats.\n\n‚ÄúJust like Mrs. Braun‚Äù The tall one grinned.\n\n‚ÄúDude shut up!‚Äù The other punched him in the shoulder. A display of violence that granted them a wide berth and ensured the seats around them remained empty.\n\nThe two humans fell silent under the gaze of a cluster of their professor‚Äôs eyes, both suddenly interested in brushing the chalk dust on their clothes in silence while the other students waited in relative sedation for their professor to speak, lest they too suffer a barrage of chalk.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúSo.‚Äù Professor Ed began letting his gaze wander the hall ‚ÄúSince the humans have drawn attention to themselves. Can anyone classify their home world and species?‚Äù It might be a bit beyond them but understanding the classification system was part of the reading he required his students to have done before the year began.\n\nA student from the third row raised its appendage, the third row...where students eager not to appear too eager sat.\n\n‚ÄúYes?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHomo Sapiens, the Thinking Man colloquially known as Humans, evolved on Earth. A Category 6 Death world.‚Äù The student proclaimed\n\nProfessor Ed regarded the student silently for a moment before directing his eyes to the hall at large ‚ÄúHow many of you also *know* that Earth is a death world?‚Äù\n\nMost of the hall save for the pair of humans sitting off to the side raised their appendages ‚ÄúHow many of you *KNOW* that from watching the Terminatus trilogy?‚Äù Again, most of the hands, reluctantly, stayed up.\n\n‚ÄúWell. You are all, as is colloquially known‚Äù He turned all his eye clusters to the student who withered away under his glare ‚ÄúWRONG!‚Äù He whipped a piece of chalk at the student‚Äôs head.\n\n‚ÄúIf you're going to be pompous, be right. Earth is NOT classified a Death world, and even if it were it would be a solid Category three, maybe a five if you squint and play with the data but never. NEVER. A Category 6.‚Äù He paused to survey the assembled students ‚ÄúDoes anyone know what Earth is actually classified as?‚Äù\n\nA few hesitant students slowly marshaled the courage to speak ‚ÄúE-Earth is a Crucible World.‚Äù A Syrinx chirped, wings fluttering to bat away any chalk that might go its way\n\n‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Dr. Ed began writing on the blackboards behind him ‚ÄúWhy are crucible worlds not scaled?\n\n‚ÄúBecause there was no reason to?‚Äù The student ventured.\n\n‚ÄúCorrect, conventional wisdom holds that crucible worlds are too unstable to host sapient life. Now...taking a step back.‚Äù Dr. Ed continued speaking as his lower two arms began writing on the board behind him ‚ÄúThere is one thing that must be made abundantly clear. Everyone please read, aloud, what is written on the board.‚Äù\n\nThe hall was silent for a moment as the Professor stepped out of the way ‚ÄúACTION MOVIES ARE NOT VALID SOURCES OF INFORMATION.‚Äù The walls shook with the voices of hundreds.\n\n‚ÄúExcellent. And the next person to proclaim what they heard in a human action movie as a fundamental law of the universe will cover every blackboard I can find, in this martyr damned cluster, with lines.‚Äù His third and fourth eye clusters trained on the Carlag who was having a hard time hiding his massive bulk from the professor‚Äôs predatory gaze.\n\n‚ÄúNow‚Äù Dr. Ed continued as though he hadn‚Äôt just caused the largest species in the galaxy to shrink to half its size ‚ÄúSome of you may be wondering why I‚Äôm harping on this, why I‚Äôm stressing the importance of nomenclature. It‚Äôs true that I have a personal stake in this, I am the highest ranked deathworlder with a doctorate from a reputable university. But more importantly‚Äù He directed his eyes, all of them, at the two humans who sat in the fourth row ‚ÄúI served alongside the Marshall of Fire aboard the Nautilus during its slaver hunting campaign in the early 70‚Äôs. I‚Äôve seen what happens when sapients regard each other without the bigotry of caste, clade or, species and‚Ä¶‚Äù The Professor trailed off shaking his head, face twitched slightly ‚ÄúI know from painful personal experience what happens when we do and am also aware of the consequences when otherwise good people look away while our work is exploited.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúConsequences?‚Äù One of the Tra‚Äôzeth asked timidly\n\n‚ÄúYou mean aside from slavery?‚Äù Dr. Ed snarled, showing a part of his upper torso that had been disfigured and mangled by the hooks slavers used to control his kind. ‚ÄúAside from treating sapients like animals because of a designation given by some forgotten biologist a millennium ago? Aside from that you mean‚Ä¶Right?‚Äù He demanded letting the Tra‚Äôzeth stutter and squirm before waving him to silence.\n\nEveryone knew the slave trade existed, and everyone knew that in a galaxy of 250 billion stars and a trillion planets, there would always be a dark corner for slavers to hide. But as far as these children of the rich and powerful were concerned, slavery and piracy were a problem for people who wore cheap uniforms and wielded cheaper guns. What did they care about pirates in the trade lanes or slavers on the fringe when they had private security, personal ships and never left the core? So, for them it was a shock to stand face to face and be lectured by an ex slave, especially a chattel slave whose body bore the scars and mangled limbs of years of forced labor. A shock they desperately needed if they wanted to delve into Xenobiology and Xenopsychology. If they couldn't survive even such a mild shock without suffering a fit of vapours well...Dr. Ed was not known for tolerating the weak of spirit.\n\n‚ÄúDo you know what the Marshall asked when he came to the cage, it wasn't comfortable enough to call a cell, I had been left in?‚Äù Some of his students, the ones who had taken the course planning to pass time, twitched towards the doors ‚ÄúWhen his men broke open the cages of the others, they tried to kill their would-be rescuers. So thoroughly had my people been reduced, so completely had they been reduced to animals, that as his men broke their cages open, their only thoughts had been to kill. The last thought they had as thinking beings was of revenge so when they were made into animals, that's the only one that remained.\" He paused feeling his eyes roll. A hatred for slavers, a passport and, over time shared values had brought Dr. Ed closer to his human friends. Chief among them: an irrational hatred for injustice. ‚ÄúThe only question he asked was if I planned on trying to kill him. I said no and then he gave me a gun. The rest... where I was from, what level of death world I was born on, where I had been captured, if I was a citizen of a relevant authority...because yes, I see your skepticism, some people would have left us on a burning station to die.‚Äù More students looked ready to bolt as they looked and properly took in his appearance, discomforted by his blinded eyes, his mangled limbs, his torn shoulders.\n\n‚ÄúThe natural world is brutal, ruthless and remorseless...\" Dr. Ed's voice rose for the first time, gaining passion and power as he spoke \".... for every good person there is a depraved savage set on making the galaxy colder and darker. For every group of herbivores there is a predator lurking in the shadows and every thing that has ever lived will die! Some brutally. As biologists you will have to observe this with dispassionate interest and absolute objectivity. As psychologists you'll often have to do more than observe and yet remain even more objective.‚Äù He raised his ruined arm to point at the doors. ‚ÄúAnyone disturbed by that can kindly fuck off and join another section.‚Äù\n\nA hundred or so left, maybe more, maybe less, probably more... Dr. Ed didn‚Äôt care: his priority, his concern, his obligation was those that remained, those that would at least try to see the world without blinders or tinted lenses. Some of those who left did so with communicators in hand, ready to call their parents and complain about the quality of the staff. Some left nauseated, unwilling or unable to handle the violent death that was so common in much of the galaxy. A facet of reality that they, as herbivores, had never had to consider as more than an abstract. Some simply realized that Dr. Ed wouldn‚Äôt suffer indolence or idiocy and his class might require effort to pass. And some, more than he would have liked, simply would not tolerate being lectured by a deathworlder slave.\n\n‚ÄúGood.‚Äù He nodded ‚ÄúNow the rest of this lesson I will be doing one thing and one thing only: Impressing upon you the importance of our work and the importance of being thorough, truthful and, objective. Who here is familiar with the history of the Agazid?‚Äù\n\nShrugs, universal shrugs, which prompted Dr. Ed to mutter a curse and wish, as he often did in situations like these, that he had a human face. Their fleshy muscular faces were capable of showing so many degrees of emotion. ‚ÄúA clerical error saw them classified as a low or non-sapient B6. Does anyone know the implications of such a classification?‚Äù Again, there was silence ‚ÄúA low or non-sapient B6 designation means that it was perfectly legal for military units to train against them in live fire exercises.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSir.\" One of the humans spoke, he knew hot to be respectful at least \"This was in the reading. The biologists classified them, the military applied for a permit, it was granted, they did what soldiers do. All the correct protocols were followed. This just seems like a standard clerical error.‚Äù One of the humans, Phillippe from French Mars according to his name tag, stated looking for an answer to his unasked question.\n\n‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt it?‚Äù Dr. Ed sighed ‚ÄúBenevolent Bureaucracy or even benevolent Bureaucrats are rare on Earth and even rarer in the galaxy as a whole.‚Äù The professor chuckled at some joke no one else understood.\n\n‚ÄúThe Agazid were classified as inhabiting a B6 World. Meaning that it was one of the most vicious, predatory and, dangerous worlds in the galaxy, thus, when xenobiologists landed, they were more concerned with their own safety than doing their jobs properly. When they encountered what could have been intelligent life, they wrote it off as low-sapient, because what else could evolve in such a hellhole, and nobody bothered to follow up.\" Dr. Ed laughed a bitter laugh \"Never mind a follow up, nobody bothered to go over the initial survey reports until the atrocities came to light. When the initial survey report was released to the galaxy at large, the Kal-eth applied to use the world as a training ground for their military. An undesirable world, inhabited by undesirables in a relatively far flung region of the galaxy‚Ä¶‚Äù Dr. Ed trailed off to survey the class. The Kal-eth students were largely uncomfortable, those who knew what was coming were trying to repress their instinct to run and hide, a few remained defiant... until their death world professor showed his teeth. The Humans... they had read enough of their own history to know how this lecture was going to end and Philippe from French Mars felt like an idiot. Good. ‚ÄúTheir application was quickly granted and their military set up a station in orbit to facilitate the planet side training. Kal-eth soldiers quickly encountered the Agazid and, if their logs are to be believed, enjoying using them as practice given their natural ferocity, cunning and, use of primitive tactics.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Dr. Ed cut the student off, his voice hard enough to cut Ruhr steel, causing the student to recoil ‚ÄúIt should have tipped the Kal-eth off to their intelligence. It should have caused a re-evaluation but they didn‚Äôt feel obliged to concern themselves with a savage race. So what if they were intelligent? The survey had shown them to lack true sapience. The learned and trustworthy xenobiologists had classified them as such, their hands were clean. Besides, they were *just* soldiers who were *just* following orders.‚Äù Professor Ed stopped himself before his lecture turned into a rant ‚ÄúNot to mention that, even if anyone suspected that the Agazid were intelligent, most militaries will **not** forgo the opportunity to train against deathworlders if they can do so in *relative* safety. So, if the military wasn‚Äôt going to do spearhead a re-evaluation, it would have fallen on politicians to step in, but why would they? The world wasn‚Äôt inhabited by anyone useful or by the ‚Äòright‚Äô kind of species. To the political class, it wasn‚Äôt worth the possible blowback or political capital. Much better to apologize after the fact, pass the blame back to the military, and build a memorial than to risk one's career trying to stop something useful. The final hope for the Agazid lay with civil society. Now...It is important to acknowledge the realities of the universe before we continue.‚Äù He paused to watch his students and their reactions, nothing major, good.\n\n‚ÄúNine in ten sapient species evolve on Garden Worlds, Paradise Worlds, Gardens of Eden as the humans call them. This means that the perceived default sapient is a two to six-legged flightless herding herbivore that evolved to live either exclusively or primarily on land. These species evolved on worlds that were either largely or completely devoid of large predators and lacked parasitic life forms including most viruses or bacteria. Given these non-competitive comfortable environments, most species prefer to eschew actual physical violence in favour of displays of power and force *if* things escalate that far. From their perspective, wars where you actually use weapons are needlessly destructive and only used as a last resort or pre-emptively when success is guaranteed. This stands in stark contrast to the remaining ten percent of life in the galaxy, species that evolved on either primarily or exclusively carnivorous worlds. On those worlds, life lives not in competition so much as in a continuous state of conflict. Among higher order creatures this process is driven more by instinct and the pursuit of glory which in turn allows social advancement than the need to feed. Violence is exceptionally commonplace and shows of force are usually only precursors to the actual use of force Additionally, moderate to high category B planets are dominated by obligate carnivores as opposed to omnivores, thus they tend towards low populations of highly aggressive individuals who, most importantly, have the capacity to act on their tendencies. Now, who wants to tell me which adjectives are frequently used to describe my kind among civil society?‚Äù\n\nThe silence was deafening, the herbivores who dominated the room sat in nervous silence, perhaps aware of the fact that the few deathworlders present could kill many of them with little or no effort and they were loathe to provoke them in such tight quarters.\n\nDr. Ed laughed, at least they knew when to keep silent ‚ÄúEven the common name for my people‚Äôs category of world should tip you all off as to how we‚Äôre viewed by the larger galaxy ‚ÄúLower Deathworlders‚Äù though most people drop the ‚ÄòLower‚Äô and ‚ÄòLesser‚Äô and simply call us Deathworlders. There are also \"Savage Death worlds\", even more vicious and horrible than Lesser Death worlds. Lesser or Lower were frequently used due to cast doubts on our intelligence. In modern society that has fallen from use as people generally assume that deathworlders are second tier at best, while savage deathworlders are more akin to beasts of burden than sapients. Other common adjectives are: stupid, aggressive, violent, destructive, untrustworthy, lazy, disease ridden and other delightful variations on the theme. Unfortunately, given that species higher up the food chain tend towards lower overall populations and the fact that Herbivorous species outnumber carnivorous ones almost ten to one to begin with, means that ‚ÄòDeathworlders‚Äô have been unable to muster the political capital to change our reputations.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBecause they‚Äôre accurate.‚Äù A student couldn't help but mutter in what was, for him, a low voice but to the nine predators in the hall he might as well have shouted\n\n‚ÄúPersonal beliefs, dogmas, and opinion have neither place nor bearing on our work. If you can‚Äôt accept that... Leave. I lived on Earth for two decades, I've heard slurs more creative than anything you could ever come up with.‚Äù Dr. Ed gestured to the door for a second time and let the silence drag on for a moment before continuing ‚ÄúSo when considering the muted response of Kal-Eth civil society during the Agazid affair, we also have to consider how they were viewed by said civil society. They were a technologically backwards, deathworlder species of questionable sapience, whose existence had barely warranted a few lines on a slow news day. As such, civil society, if it was even aware of the question of their sapience, was probably not going to act in their defense when there were so many other things with which to fill their time. On top of that, many would have been willing to tolerate combat training given how close their home world is to the hinge of empires This is compounded by the fact that one of them IS a deathworlder empire. By the time the killings ended over 80% of the Agazid had been exterminated. They lost much of their technological and social progress and have regressed from bronze and iron tribal confederations to primitive, isolated, Xenophobic clans. It will be centuries at the earliest before they join the galactic community if ever and frankly most of our field is leaning towards half a millennium. That! Is why our work is so important: If we do our jobs properly, thoroughly and, well we play a central role in expanding our understanding of life in our galaxy and ensuring that all species, no matter their origins, can find a place in the larger galactic whole. However. If done poorly we simply serve a source for bigots and racists to legitimize their views. If corrupted we become tools for whatever ends our paymasters have envisioned, if done maliciously we may become complicit in genocide and the destruction of whole species and cultures.\"\n\nHe surveyed his students who looked like the immature students they were. They heard his lecture, they heard his speech, they heard his words...but they didn‚Äôt understand. They couldn‚Äôt... but they would. In this hall they would grow into adults or they would cry to a councillor, Dr. Ed had said as much in his course outline. They hadn‚Äôt believed it then, but they would. Because... everyone knew‚Ä¶ that seeing was crucial to believing. He would make them see.\n\n‚ÄúAll of you are wondering I‚Äôm sure, what I plan to say now. Now that my speech about responsibility, one you‚Äôve heard a thousand times from your parents, is done‚Äù He smiled, he had too many teeth to make his smile anything more than a gruesome pantomime of the human variety.\n\nThe projectors that had sat dormant came to life, it was one thing for students to be told that their choices might lead to genocide, it was quite another to be confronted with that reality and the hall had been specially outfitted with the best projectors money could buy... and some projectors that money couldn't. It paid to have friends on Earth and Ruhr IV who would lend advanced tech to friends under the auspices of ‚Äúfield testing‚Äù.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBodies...the Agazid were a bipedal species that could drop to all fours, this allowed them to sprint at high speeds and granted them considerable acrobatic ability for their size. Their bodies were covered in hard plates giving them a modicum of natural armour while curved horns and thicker plates covered their head preventing them from wearing helmets. Instead they opted for decorated bronze masks and additional layers of bronze and iron armour over their bodies.\n\nIron and Bronze that had been punched through by guns. Lasers and Plasma had done their deadly duty and cut the Agazid down like so many stalks of grain...The Kal-Eth had carried out their training missions like professionals inflicting fatal injuries without prejudice or remorse.\n\n‚ÄúAs you can see, at this point the Kal-Eth were still acting like soldiers and not blood crazed lunatics. That changed shortly after the construction of the orbital station and the arrival of more experienced officers.‚Äù\n\nThe images and video clips that followed showed changes, not in the Agazid who still wore bronze and iron now with a few scraps of Kal-Eth armour. Their ability to scavenge Kal-Eth armor was a testament to their natural skills given that they had little else to rely on. The changes that the audio and video revealed were in the Kal-Eth and how they acted. Gone were the precise lethal wounds inflicted from a safe distance, in their place were deep gouges inflicted by blades, the crushing impacts of blunt force weapons and the gruesome burns of point-blank plasma. Where there was previously the efficient silence of a military force, broken only by commands, there was now the raucous noise of a frontier mercenary band. On top of that, sometimes, in some clips, they could hear how the Agazid were killed: slowly, painfully, and with obvious relish.\n\n‚ÄúWhat prompted this change?‚Äù Dr. Ed asked\n\n‚ÄúUndisciplined recruits?‚Äù Someone hazarded\n\n‚ÄúA good guess but no. Additional and more experienced officers had arrived with the construction of the orbital station.‚Äù Dr. Ed repeated\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôd think hand to hand and close quarters is valuable, especially on ships‚Äù the other human ventured ‚Äúbut‚Ä¶‚Äù he shook his head, replaying the audio and video in his mind ‚ÄúThis must‚Äôve started out as proper training and these final sections are from later when...when something changed.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúExcellent, but what prompted the change?‚Äù The professor prodded\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôd have guessed a breakdown in discipline from shitty officers who couldn‚Äôt or, probably, wouldn‚Äôt keep their soldiers in line.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right in that it did start as routine combat training exactly for boarding maneuvers. But the escalation was due to two separate factors. The first pair were boredom and indifference. Threats to ground stations kept soldiers constantly on guard and on edge, they didn't have time or energy to screw around. Once they got eyes in the sky and an orbital station, it became possible for the soldiers on the ground to relax. They knew there was no real threat, the primitive tactics that were occasionally effective in an ambush were useless when the Kal-Eth could see them coming from, literally, miles away. Bored soldiers quickly become stupid and they promptly began competing with each other, which in this case took the form of increasingly stupid engagements with the Agazid. The second reason was for revenge. Deathworlders don‚Äôt have their reputation for nothing and many of the officers who were experienced had earned that experience in piracy suppression campaigns and border skirmishes. It follows then, and deployment records back this up, that many of the friends and soldiers they had lost were to deathworlder pirates and mercenaries. They couldn‚Äôt avenge or take blood from the pirates themselves but the Agazid were functional stand-ins and when they realized that there was little to no risk of a reprimand from higher powers...\" Dr. Ed shrugged, the still frame spoke for him \"This second phase lasted about seven years.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSecond phase? It gets worse?‚Äù A Capra, descended from mountain stock if appearances were anything to go by, asked. His fur clinging tightly to his body, distressed...He should be.\n\nDr. Ed looked at him with his dead eyes ‚ÄúMuch. The standard contract for a Kal-Eth soldier is about seven standard years, give or take a few months. Some of them went home with fantastical stories...and even more fantastic trophies.‚Äù\n\nThis time, Dr. Ed didn‚Äôt rely on a hologram, he lifted a case onto the oversized lectern and lifted the cloth. ‚ÄúThis Agazid skull was acquired by a Kal-Eth Sergeant during the fourth year of operations, here...‚Äù he moved another crate into position ‚Äú.... we have tusks and horns which were occasionally kept whole but usually made into decorative weapons or gun stocks and finally‚Ä¶‚Äù he lifted a glass jar and placed it atop the skull case ‚Äú.... this is an Agazid heart. Which, when properly broken down, can improve many outward signs of aging.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúTrophy hunting.‚Äù One of the humans, Mark of Terra, whispered\n\n‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù Dr. Ed nodded ‚ÄúThe vanity of the upper classes never changes. Not across time and not across worlds. Some Agazid were killed for personal trophies as soldiers wanted to prove their bravery and strength. Some were killed for their various bits and pieces that were of use to the pharmaceutical industry or, more commonly, miracle cure peddlers. But those were the lucky ones...they generally died quickly given how dangerous a species they were and how much of a risk it was to leave them alive.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe unlucky ones?‚Äù A Syrinx asked quietly\n\n‚ÄúRecords are hazy regarding exactly when this began but...\" Dr. Ed paused \" The unlucky ones were used for testing. Weapons testing mostly, but everything from poisons to exposure to who knows what else was carried out in secret.‚Äù Dr. Ed paused, shock, horror and, the most vehement kind of disbelief that only surfaces when someone's view of the universe if being directly challenged. ‚ÄúThe military no longer had to worry about the public‚Äôs collective conscience now that they too had wholly embraced the status of the Agazid as being animals. This in turn meant that they no longer had to bother with the veneer of deniability. Kal-Eth leaders rationalized testing on the Agazid the same way amoral savages always have: ‚Äòthe greater good‚Äô. It was for the greater good that Agazid were used to test laser and plasma weaponry, it was for the greater good that the limits of deathworlder survivability were explored, it was for the greater good that drugs and poisons were tested on them, and it was for the greater good that they were killed in the hundreds of thousands.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBULLSHIT!‚Äù A Kal-Eth student exploded to his feet chest heaving, trapped with nowhere to run.\n\nDr. Ed chuckled ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs one in every class. Direct your attention to the front. This is standard audio and video.‚Äù\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúI can assure you. All our weapons have been extensively tested.‚Äù A Kal-Eth, presumably an officer, spoke, footsteps echoing off the cold metal\n\n‚ÄúBut not in combat?‚Äù A human asked, he spoke one of the more heavily accented dialects.\n\n‚ÄúNo.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre offering us such a deal.‚Äù The Human chuckled\n\n‚ÄúIndeed. We need someone who‚Äôs willing to test our weapons against a... variety of targets.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúVaried targets, I guess that‚Äôs one way of putting it.‚Äù\n\nThe two men arrived at a set of heavy doors and, for a moment, the oppressive silence of the lecture hall reasserted itself.\n\n‚ÄúWhat. The. Fuck.‚Äù The human breathed, and the students saw what he saw. The men stood at a walkway that crossed over a massive hall, divided roughly into four. Cages housing Agazid, a testing laboratory, a range, and a morgue where the dead were laid out and studied like so many pieces of meat.\n\n‚ÄúAs I said, the weapons have been tested extensively.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOn animals.‚Äù The Human asked, though it fell like a statement that brooked no argument.\n\n‚ÄúOf course. Sapient testing is illegal, not to mention unethical.‚Äù The Officer affirmed, voice smooth and steady\n\n‚ÄúIndeed‚Äù\n\nDr. Ed chuckled to himself, the predators had noticed it, the humans too: The veiled distrust and suspicion. Nobody knew what tipped the human off to the fact that the things in the cages weren‚Äôt just animals. It might have been nothing, it might have been the ethereal and inexplicable feeling that they get between their shoulder blades or it might have been an itch on his fighting hand that ran into his trigger finger. Joachim had refused to elaborate on how he knew that something was off and humans in general couldn‚Äôt explain their ‚Äògut feel‚Äô in any useful way.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äù Dr. Ed spoke up as the men on screen began signing documents ‚ÄúWas Joachim von Ros, a pirate turned privateer. The treaty protecting the Agazid has his name for his role in putting an end to the atrocity, and because humans love putting their names on things. Now prepare yourselves, I‚Äôve had months.‚Äù\n\nDr. Ed waved a hand and the lights changed, to more accurately reflect the atmosphere of Algoth, the Agazid home world, though few students would appreciate the attention to detail. The humidity rose with the temperature to well above standard. Then came the sounds but, where there should have been the vibrant cacophony of tropical life, there were only a few cries and the omnipresent buzzing of insects. Some students snickered while others sat in guarded silence unwilling to risk the chalk. The smart ones saw the Syrinx instinctively puff their feathers, the warning call they heard might not have been a Syrinx but among avian species, warning calls were universally understood. The smell followed, Dr. Ed had spent months working with humans to concoct the right fragrance. The smell of organic rot and decay as well as that of the fresh growth and blooming flora that permeates any jungle. Then they were hit by the stench of fear; urine, feces and, a touch of sweat and finally the cloying richness of dead flesh, already decomposing the in the sweltering heat mixing the ferric stench of blood. Most of the students were retching, some had already vomited, a few proud fools had neglected to take a sick bag, further contributing further to the horrific miasma that filled the hall. Then came the projection to match, a village untouched by flame, peaceful...until you saw the bodies.\n\nThe students might not have known what a dead Agazid child looked like before, but they did now. They might not have known what a person butchered for its trophies looked like before, but they did now. They might not have known what a tortured form looked like before, but they did now. They might have been children before...but they weren‚Äôt anymore.\n\nThe scene in front of them wasn‚Äôt a statistic, wasn‚Äôt an abstract from a textbook, this was the sight, the smell, the sound of murder... of genocide.\n\n‚ÄúSon of a bitch.‚Äù The voice of Joachim von Ros from before cut through the retching that filled the hall and paralyzed even those students who had thought to flee.\n\n‚ÄúWhat the fuck!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúJESUS!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúShit!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBASTARDS!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat the sweet hell...‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGod have mercy‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nIt continued, frame after frame, as the human soldiers moved silently through the ravaged village only breaking the jungle sounds to swear at a particularly grisly scene. Parents shielding their children, elders too old to fight, beaten and left to bleed out, bodies crushed by armored vehicles...bodies...corpse after corpse, each new dwelling holding a few more mangled and desecrated corpses. Only when the last room was cleared, holding what must have been the very young. Only once the humans returned to the center of the village, where boot prints and the trails left by feet being dragged through the dirt ended where the vehicle tracks began did the projectors cut. It was a mercy to be torn from a forgotten village on Algoth and deposited back in Hall 47 where the only proof of what they had seen was the smell of vomit, but that too was processed by the ventilation systems until all they were left with were there maelstroms in their minds.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúThose of you who need to, clean yourselves up. I will continue.‚Äù Many left on shaking legs, eyes dazed still trying to process what they had seen, only a single handful would return. Some stayed and to those Dr. Ed would dedicate his time without reserve because they would confront whatever came at them with open eyes, they had offered sufficient proof of that.\n\n‚ÄúThree days after this footage was taken, Joachim von Ros and his crew stormed the training facility and slaughtered the soldiers on the planet. They then seized the orbital station and held the crew hostage. Four days later, and thirty minutes after the arrival of the human Titan Fleet around the the Kal-Eth homeworld and threats from every Deathworld species as well as Caralis High Command, the Kal-Eth to publicly admitted to what they had been doing and signed of the Von Ros treaty which led to the creation of protectorate class worlds. It was the fastest that large scale crisis was resolved, the threat of total annihilation tends to have that effect.‚Äù Dr.Ed chuckled ‚ÄúThe Agazid still don‚Äôt communicate with outsiders save the human delegation that goes down once a quarter to deliver supplies and data packets and... their population will likely remain depressed for several centuries.‚Äù  Dr.Ed shook his head \"What you just saw was our work stretched to its most horrific extreme.\"\n\n‚ÄúWe classify, quantify and qualify all life in the galaxy. We study, analyze, process and once all is said and done, we are the ones that assign life its final designation. We are the final arbiters of the realities which all newly discovered life will face. We determine how long and hard their road to acceptance will be. We are the ones who can, through biased and research and deceptive findings, either build up stereotypes to confirm what everyone knows. We can lend legitimacy to acts of genocide and become willing pawns in campaigns of bigotry and prejudice that produce only pain and suffering on an unimaginable scale. Or we can stand for truth in whatever form it may take. Truth is not always be pretty, it may not always be what we want to see nor what we had hoped to find. But it will ensure, that when the people of tomorrow fix their gaze upon us, that we can look back unflinching. It is truth above all else that we must pursue, for it is truth, above all else, that will set our souls, if not our hearts, at ease.‚Äù\n\nDr. Ed sighed ‚ÄúWas it a clerical error? Was this‚Ä¶‚Äù The projectors came on, a still image ‚Äú.... A clerical error?‚Äù He let his eyes wander across the hall, across the students who would likely never see things the same way. The humans were remarkably unaffected, it wasn't a surprise, they were crucible forged after all...and to them, this was nothing new. But the rest...many of them would skip the rest of the day. They would go home and cry, they would call their mothers and their siblings they would demand to know why... why we were so cruel, why we were so base, why there was still evil in a time of plenty. Even the deathworlders like him, wouldn‚Äôt be unaffected, they might drink more than the others and once deep in their cups they would reach out to their trainers and masters and... slowly...with halting words and broken sentences they would try to express the pain they had seen, pain not their own. They would ask question to which their all-knowing masters would only offer silence. The question, of a clerical error, hung in the air, where Dr. Ed decided to leave it.\n\nHe let his gaze wander over his class as they shuffled out, some still covered in sick. It had been, and he hoped they would agree with him in the future, for the best. The children of today must grow to be the beacons of tomorrow and he would weather whatever the administration threw at him at to ensure that they did.

        "body": "So this was phenomenal. You really hammered home the brutality of war (the \"rape and pillage\" part that so often gets glossed over) and the institutionalized racism that not only justified the atrocities of colonialism, but still permeate society today. What a powerful, vivid story you've written!\n\nIt was also really, *really* hard to read. I almost gave up a few times, but all the praise in the comments made me keep going. I don't regret it at all, and the grammar got much better, but there's still a lot of work you can do to help shore up the drier parts of the story.\n\nAlso apologies for formatting; I'm on mobile, etc. \n\n---\n\n\n>>> Lecture Hall 47 had the luxury of being at the end of the building meaning that it was, by far, the largest lecture hall in the complex which something that Professor Ed had, in his mind, earned.\n\nYour commas are super inconsistent, and to top it off, the sentences are quite long. A lot of these sentences, even if they aren't technically run-ons, can benefit significantly from being broken up. Smaller sentences are fine, too. They help keep things interesting by varying the tempo and hammering points home. \n\nThis particular sentence is a run-on with two independent clauses (full sentences with a subject and verb). \n\n> Lecture Hall 47 had the luxury of being at the end of the building.\n\n> It was, by far, the largest lecture hall in the complex.\n\nThere's a \"meaning that\" joining the two sentences together. Generally speaking, when you do that, you need some form of punctuation separating the two sentences. While\n\n> It was, by far, the largest lecture hall in the complex.\n\nis a complete sentence, \n\n> meaning that it was, by far, the largest lecture hall in the complex\n\nis not. So, you should use a comma to separate the two.\n\n> Lecture Hall 47 had the luxury of being at the end of the building, meaning that it was, by far, the largest lecture hall in the complex. \n\nYou already have a long sentence in that, so the next little bit can be separated into its own sentence. Plus, the focus shifts from the lecture hall itself to what Prof. Ed thinks of it. That alone makes it worthy of being its own sentence. \n\n> Lecture Hall 47 had the luxury of being at the end of the building, meaning that it was, by far, the largest lecture hall in the complex. It was something that Professor Ed, in his mind, had earned.\n\nI also moved the \"had\" around. I just think it sounds better there lol\n\n---\n\n>>> It‚Äôs not that his people or any other was incapable of producing slate and chalk, but nobody else clung to such archaic traditions with quite as much vigour as humanity. \n\nWas should be were. The subject of the sentence is \"his people\", which is plural. \n\n---\n\n>>> Veterans of his class, and those who survived years one and two deserved to be referred to as such, knew that it gave professor Ed projectiles with which to discipline the stupid or the unruly.\n\n> and those who survived years one and two deserved to be referred to as such\n\ndoesn't really fit into the sentence. It's just sorta injected into an already complete sentence. There's two ways to do this: the dash or the parenthesis. They both read differently. Someone actually educated in this can probably tell you when to use one or the other, but I think you can use either here. (Important to note that the dash is different from the hyphen. It's longer and doesn't have a key on the keyboard. I use two hyphens as a shorthand.)\n\nAlso, this little interjection is too long. It makes the sentence confusing. Maybe \"and the survivors of years one and two deserved to be referred to as such\"? Or maybe even \"and the survivors deserved to be referred to as such\"? \n\n> Veterans of his class (and the survivors of years one and two deserved to be referred to as such) knew that it gave professor Ed projectiles with which to discipline the stupid or the unruly.\n\nOr\n\n> Veterans of his class -- and the survivors of years one and two deserved to be referred to as such -- knew that it gave professor Ed projectiles with which to discipline the stupid or the unruly.\n\n---\n\n>>>It also helped him single out those who were meticulous enough to copy what was written and not simply rely on recorded, digitized lectures and the holographic slides which was a bonus, but one the Professor could have lived without.\n\nSuper super long sentence. I'd find a way to either condense this or split it in two. Probably condense, because it's a single, cohesive idea. \n\n---\n\n>>> Professor Ed‚Äôs exterior mandibles twitched in excitement, it was the first semester of a new year and the first real day of classes were always the best. \n\nYou have three complete sentences here. The first two are joined by a comma (that's called a comma splice), and the last is joined by an \"and\" and is missing a comma. \n\n> Professor Ed‚Äôs exterior mandibles twitched in excitement.  \n\n> It was the first semester of a new year. \n \n> The first real day of classes were always the best.  \n\nYou have three options to deal with the comma splice:\n1) Add a conjunction like \"for\" or \"because\"\n2) Use a semicolon\n3) Just split it into two sentences\n\nAs for the second, do you remember FANBOYS from middle school English? For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So? These are funny conjunctions because they can join complete sentences but also join other stuff, too. (Like I just did there!) If you use them to join sentences, you need to precede them with a comma.\n\n> Professor Ed‚Äôs exterior mandibles twitched in excitement; it was the first semester of a new year, and the first real day of classes were always the best.\n\n---\n> He didn‚Äôt believe in spending the first day going through the syllabus, this was the best university in the spiral arm if not the galaxy, the idiots could read it themselves. \n\nTriple comma splice! \n\n---\n\n>>> No, he‚Äôd be going straight for the throat, a maneuver he‚Äôd learned from his travels with the, now retired, Grand Admiral decades ago.\n\n\"Now retired\" should either be hyphenated or moved to after \"Grand Admiral\". If you put it before the noun, it becomes an adjective, and because it's two words instead of one, you hyphenate them. If you put it after the noun, it becomes an aside, and you can leave all the punctuation intact for that. \n\n> No, he‚Äôd be going straight for the throat, a maneuver he‚Äôd learned from his travels with the now-retired Grand Admiral decades ago.\n\nOr\n\n> No, he‚Äôd be going straight for the throat, a maneuver he‚Äôd learned from his travels with the Grand Admiral, now retired, decades ago.\n\n---\n\n>>> He breathed the air which still smelled faintly of cleaners and turned to face his beloved green blackboard carefully lining up his chalk.\n\nNeed a comma before \"carefully\". I don't know the reason why, and that's bothering me too. Probably something to do with it being a gerund phrase or something? \n\n---\n\n>>> The fresh pieces, used for writing were carefully slotted into styli to prevent premature breaking while the old ones, used for throwing, were set into four distinct piles one for each manipulator: It would be glorious.\n\nNeed a comma after \"writing\". It's an aside, so there should either be commas before and after it, or no commas at all (if it's important to the meaning of the sentence). \n\nI also personally disagree with the colon towards the end. A colon means that whatever comes afterward will further explain a point you just made. You could argue that \"It would be glorious\" explains why they were set into piles, but I think you'd hammer the point home better if it were its own sentence.\n\n---\n\nI can continue if you'd like, or explain further any of the things I said. Right now, I have to get to sleep so I'm not dying at work tomorrow, haha\n\nGrammar errors aside, I really enjoyed your writing. Just gotta shore that up and you'll be one of the best writers on the sub.",

It was unbelievable that something so evil and gruesome could take place at such a grand scale. Some students cried, others, (most, like myself) were at a loss. It didn't feel real in a way. Like something that happened really far away and very long ago. After the video ended, a older man walked into class. He was a holocaust survivor. He showed us pictures of where he slept, where he ate, and the last place he saw his mom and little sister. He had a picture of his dad too. Broken, frail, and with an expression I find hard to describe with words. I tried hard to stay impassive and just listen, as a boy surrounded by high-school friends and classmates.

I've listed them here. \n\nCOSRX\n* Salicylic Acid - I used this everyday before and it really works since I don't have acnes now and I've took a break from it. ‚ùóÔ∏èCurrently using a different one for daily use since I no longer have breakouts and it's Acne Derm+ Miracle Solution Gel Cleanser. It's really gentle on the skin and I didn't have breakouts while using it. \n\n* AHA BHA Vitamin C Daily Toner - currently using and I tried it because I read somewhere here that it works for them and it's their holy grail. So far, it gives a healthy glow and it's not drying on the skin.\n\n* Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence and Snail 92 All in one cream - These two are the ones that helped restore my skin barrier. I can really vouch for them. I applied the Snail 96 first then Snail 92. I used them every day and night. My skin feels hydrated, smooth and soft.\n\nGood Molecules\n* Niacinamide Serum and Gentle Retinol Cream - only using them at nightime. Perfect combo for me. For the Retinol - only applying it to areas where there will be prone lines due to aging. I'm almost in my 30s, so it's better to prevent it. \n\nI forgot what some of the products I've tried but here are some of what I can remember. \n* COSRX AHA BHA Low pH Balancing Toner\n* COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Toner\n* COSRX Blackheads and Pore Powerful Eraser\n* COSRX Vitamin C 23 \n* COSRX Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser\n* GM Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\nNOTE: Please do know that I have an oily and acne prone skin, cystic acnes are not my bffs and was always struggling with it and whatever may works for me, may or may not work for you. You can try them to see if they works on your skin as well. I've also tried other brands from other countries. \n\nLet me know what worked for you or your holy grail! xx",

    "body": "Little bit about me/my skin: Im 25F and I have sensitive, acne prone, combination skin. My skin is especially sensitive to fragrance, citrus and floral essential oils. Because of this I‚Äôve become a bit of a skincare nerd and an obsessive ingredients list reader. I definitely still have a lot to learn about skincare but I hope this list helps some of you! Especially my fellow sensitive skin skincare addicts.          \n        \nI tried to keep the reviews very short and straight forward, but if you want me to expand on any products let me know!           \n¬†          \n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer 30 SPF - 3/10**                    \n*Pros:* Fragrance free and very moisturizing.        \n*Cons:* Broke me out and burned my eyes\nBest for: dry skin.      \n¬†      \n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser - 0/10**       \n*Pros:* literally nothing.        \n*Cons:* I don‚Äôt like the smell, it broke me out, didn‚Äôt remove my makeup well.         \n¬†\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Drunk Elephant Beste No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 6/10**\n*Pros:* Clean ingredients list.          \n*Cons:* Stripping/drying and expensive.         \n*For who?* Oily skin or those that like to feel squeaky clean.     \n¬†      \n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen 60 SPF (American) - 3/10**            \n*Pros:* Doesn‚Äôt leave a white cast.    \n*Cons:* Greasy, broke me out, stung my eyes.    \n*Bottom Line:* Stick to the European version.     \n¬†      \n5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†**La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen 50+ SPF (European) - 9/10**          \n*Pros:* Doesn‚Äôt leave a white cast, reasonably priced.    \n*Cons:* texture is a little too runny for my liking.    \n*Bonus:* LRP donates to skin cancer research.    \n¬†      \n6.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†**Jordan Samuel Hydrate Facial Serum - 0/10**       \n*Pros:* Couldn‚Äôt try long enough to say.    \n*Cons:* Gave me a bright red burning skin reaction.     \n*Bottom Line:* Looks like they changed their formula (for good reason obvi) so I can‚Äôt speak for the new version.     \n*For who?* Those who want an excuse to cancel dinner plans.    \n¬†      \n7.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†**Mario Badescu Rose Facial Spray - 0/10**    \n*Pros:* Cheap.   \n*Cons:* Mist comes out too strong, I don‚Äôt like the smell, contains fragrance, citronellol, geraniol and colorants.   \n*Bottom Line:* Thank goodness it was a gift, because I won‚Äôt be buying.   \n¬†    \n8.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 5/10**    \n*Pros:* Unscented, affordable.    \n*Cons:* Made my skin itch and left a residue.    \n*Bottom Line:* I won‚Äôt repurchase.   \n¬†    \n9.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†**A313 Vitamin A Pommade - 10/10**   \n*Pros:* My acne reduced, skin texture improved (after two weeks). Thick vasaline texture that locks in the vitamin A.      \n*Cons:* Slight metallic smell     \n*Bottom Line:* Worth the hype! I use 2x a week max, alternating with a salicylic acid oil.    \n¬†   \n10.¬†¬† **Youth to the People Superberry Dream Cleansing Balm - 3/10**    \n*Pros:* Great ingredient list, interesting extracts.     \n*Cons:* Smells like waxy crayons, crumbly texture that doesn‚Äôt melt well into the skin, left a waxy feeling behind.     \n*Bottom Line:* I‚Äôve tried better.    \n¬†      \n11.¬†¬† **Tata Harper Water-Lock Moisturizer - 2/10**  \n*Pros:* I liked her organic Vermont farm story and the light gel cream texture.   \n*Cons:* strong fragrance, contains skin irritants like Alcohol, limonene, citral, citronellol, linalool and orange peel extract.   \n*Bottom Line:* Don‚Äôt use if you have sensitive skin. There is a sunburn warning on the side of the box because it contains AHAs.    \n¬†\n12.¬†¬† ¬†**Saturday Skin Carrot + Niacinamide Moisturizing Cream - 6/10**  \n*Pros:* Hydrating thick gel cream.    \n*Cons:* Smells so strong of silicone.   \n*Bottom Line:* Bought it in Europe, loved it. Bought it in the US, smelled like straight up silicone. Different formula maybe?     \n¬†    \n13.¬†¬† **Glossier Future Dew - 0/10**  \n*Pros:* Cute packaging.   \n*Cons:* Made me look like a greasy pizza, broke me out and don‚Äôt like the smell.   \n¬†  \n14.¬†¬† **Versed Sunday Morning Antioxidant Oil-Serum ‚Äì 1/10**  \n*Pros:* inexpensive.   \n*Cons*: Does nothing. The biphase ends up looking gross and muddled after a while.    \n¬†  \n15.¬†¬† **Murmure Bisou Clarifying Dry Oil ‚Äì 10/10**  \n*Pros:* Cleared my blackheads, sinks into the skin fast.    \n*Cons:* Contains hazelnut oil so be careful if you have an allergy!     \n*Bottom Line*: I use it about 2x a week at night (not on the same day as my retinol). My skin is always less red and bumpy in the AM.    \n¬†   \n16.¬†¬† ¬†**Typology Glycolic Acid 10% - 3/10**   \n*Pros:* Affordable (Typology is like the French version of the Ordinary).    \n*Cons*: Broke me out, 10% glycolic acid is too strong for my skin.    \n¬†    \n17.¬†¬† **Nuxe Huile Prodigieuse Multi-Purpose Dry Oil ‚Äì 9/10**  \n*Pros:* Nice dry oil that soaks in quickly, love the smell (I only use this on my body so the fragrance doesn‚Äôt bother me).   \n*Cons:* Wish it had a dropper or pump to make application less messy.   \n*Bottom Line:* I put this all over my body after my shower and my skin feels baby soft.   \n¬†    \n18.¬†¬† **Innisfree Daily UV Defense Sunscreen 36 SPF ‚Äì 5/10**  \n*Pros:* Good value for money.   \n*Cons:* Broke me out, a little too oily.   \n*Bottom Line:* They have changed the formula since I tried it so I cant speak for the new formulation.     \n¬†    \n19.¬†¬† **La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5+ - 7/10**   \n*Pros:* Super soothing and healing.   \n*Cons:* clogged my pores (avoid if you have acne or milia prone skin).   \n*Bottom Line:* I would buy again for my eyelid dermatitis that I get every winter\nFor who? Dry, irritated skin.         \n20.¬†¬† **SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic Serum - 8/10**    \n*Pros:* Brightened and evened my skin tone.   \n*Cons:* So expensive it hurts! Oxidized at around the 4 month mark. Smells slightly unpleasant.   \n*Bottom Line:* One of the most effective formulas for vitamin c that Ive tried. Keep it away from light and to close the bottle tightly so it doesn‚Äôt oxidize as quickly.    \n¬†     \n21.¬†¬† **Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Ultra-fine Mist ‚Äì 1/10**  \n*Pros:* Cute packaging.   \n*Cons:* Broke me out, overpowering candy fragrance, didn‚Äôt hydrate.    \n¬†    \n22.¬†¬† **Pillow Talk Derm Major Fade Flash Mask ‚Äì 0/10**  \n*Pros:* I can‚Äôt speak to the effectiveness of the product because my skin couldn‚Äôt handle it.    \n*Cons:* Instantly burned my face into a red mess.    \n*Bottom Line:* 15% glycolic acid was too much for my skin. Make sure to always patch test new products.    \n¬†     \n23.¬†¬† **The Outset Nourishing Squalane Daily Moisturizer ‚Äì 7/10**  \n*Pros:* Clean ingredients list, nice light texture.    \n*Cons:* Not hydrating enough for my skin.    \n*Bottom Line:* If you have sensitive skin and like a lightweight moisturizer it might be worth a try.    \n¬†   \n24.¬†¬† **Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy ‚Äì 10/10**   \n*Pros:* Heals, hydrates/seals in moisture.   \n*Cons:* Packaging is kinda ugly.   \n*Bottom Line:* Cult classic for good reason. I‚Äôm team Aquaphor over vasaline every day.   \n¬†     \n25.¬†¬† **Skinfix Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream ‚Äì 10/10**   \n*Pros:* Super hydrating and nourishing. Nice cream gel texture.   \n*Cons:* none.   \n*Bottom Line:* My sensitive skin loves this moisturizer. Even though I have acne prone skin I still prefer their normal triple lipid over their gel version.       \n26.¬†¬† **Saturday Skin Yuzu Vitamin C Sleep Mask ‚Äì 4/10**  \n*Pros:* slightly brightening.   \n*Cons:* Strong smell, contains citrus oils, feels quite sticky.   \n¬†    \n27.¬†¬† ¬†**Youth to the People Superfood Air-Whip Moisture Cream ‚Äì 3/10**   \n*Pros:* nice light airy texture.   \n*Cons:* Has fragrance and limonene. Didn‚Äôt do much.   \n*Bottom Line:* Last time I was at sephora I did notice that the cream is no longer a light green color, so I think they changed the formula.   \n¬†   \n28.¬†¬† ¬†**Caudalie Beauty Elixir Face Mist ‚Äì 0/10**  \n*Pros:* None.   \n*Cons:* Doesn‚Äôt smell great, does nothing, has alcohol, fragrance, rosemary oil, citral, linalool, citronellol‚Ä¶).   \n*Bottom Line:* Outdated product imo.  \n¬†   \n29.¬†¬† ¬†**Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen 40 SPF ‚Äì 5/10**  \n*Pros:* Doesn‚Äôt leave a white cast.   \n*Cons:* Expensive and broke me out.    Feels very silicone heavy. like my skin was suffocating.    \n*Bottom Line:* Sensitive acne prone skin beware.   \n¬†    \n30.¬†¬† ¬†**U beauty The Plasma Lip Compound (Rose) ‚Äì 0/10**   \n*Pros:* Couldn‚Äôt keep it on my lips long enough.   \n*Cons:* Smells so bad like straight up chemicals.   \n*Bottom Line:* So disappointing because it was really expensive.   \n¬†   \n31.¬†¬† ¬†**Youth to the People Polypeptide-121 Future Cream ‚Äì 7/10**   \n*Pros:* Hydrating and plumping.   \n*Cons:* Started to smell a little funny when I got halfway through the jar.   \n    \n32.¬†¬† **Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm ‚Äì 8/10**   \n*Pros:* Nice creamy texture that melts into the skin. Smells delicious and removes makeup well.   \n*Cons:* Leaves a greasy film on my eyes\nBottom Line: One of the few glow recipe products that I actually like.    \n¬†  \n33.¬†¬† **Fresh Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream (Night) ‚Äì 1/10**   \n*Pros:* lovely texture.   \n*Cons:* Smells way too strong, like straight up perfume. Has citral, limonene, lemon peel oil and fragrance.   \n*Bottom Line:* Sensitive skin beware.   \n¬†    \n34.¬†¬† **Typology Niacinamide 12% - 5/10**   \n*Pros:* Inexpensive.   \n*Cons:* 12% niacinamide is too strong for my skin.   \n*Bottom Line:* studies show that your skin reacts best at a 4% concentration. I like to add a little into my moisturizer every so often to dilute it.   \n¬†    \n35.¬†¬† ¬†**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask ‚Äì 3/10**  \n*Pros:* Smells delicious (but has fragrance).       \n*Cons:* Made my lips more dry. I don‚Äôt like having to scoop into a jar.        \n*Bottom Line:* I don‚Äôt understand the hype of this product.    \n¬†     \n36.¬†¬† **Clarins Lip Comfort Oil - 9/10**  \n*Pros:* Not sticky, lasts a while and very shiny.   \n*Cons:* Wish there was more color payoff and kinda pricey (not doir expensive but getting there).    \n*Bottom Line:* My fav lip product to date.",

        "body": "I happen to be a semi-professional perfumer (or at least, I have fragrances available in real, live brick and mortar stores that people buy).  I can't tell you why they do commercials like they do, but I can tell you that even if they were to tell you what a fragrance smelled like, it wouldn't be particularly helpful. \n\nIf you look up \"fragrance notes,\" you can find a list of things that a particular fragrance is supposed to smell like...but they're mostly wrong.\n\nWhy is that?  Is seems pretty straightforward saying that a fragrance smells like violets and oranges and sandalwood, right?  Well...it's not really.  \n\nMost of the ingredients in fragrances are things that people have never smelled on their own.  Some of the most common fragrance ingredients now (in everything from drugstore cheapies to $300/bottle niche fragrances) are aromachemicals.  If it doesn't smell like it was made in the 1920s, chances are it's 60-90% synthetic...and if it does, it's still probably 50% synthetic.  Here are some of the common ones:\n\n* Iso E Super\n* Hedione\n* Coumarin (90%+ of all fragrances made in the last 100 years have this one)\n* Linalool\n* Galaxolide\n* Ambroxan\n* Hydroxycitronellal\n* Calone\n\nEven if they are using naturals, many of the commonly used ones in perfumery are uncommon outside of it, such as\n\n* vetiver\n* oakmoss\n* clary sage (not the same as the sage in your kitchen)\n* benzoin\n* labdanum\n\nSince very few people outside of the fragrance industry have heard of these (much less smelled them on their own), they can't say that Cool Water smells like \"Calone, dihydromyrcenol, Evernyl, coumarin, etc\" instead they have to find things that the fragrance kind of smells like to list in the notes.\n\nHedione becomes jasmine.  Coumarin becomes tonka bean (which most people still haven't smelled). Calone becomes \"aquatic notes.\" \n\nRemember how I mentioned violets and sandalwood?  Natural violet flower absolute oil (kind of like an essential oil...but extracted in a different way) hasn't been produced in large volumes in more than a century because it takes about a million flowers to get 1 kg of it...and then it doesn't even smell much like violets.  Instead, just about every violet flower scented thing you've ever smelled (and your grandma has ever smelled) came from a mixture of synthetic ionones.  This is not a new thing  The violet formula I use is from the 1940s.\n\nSandalwood was heavily overharvested and is very expensive now, so most sandalwood scents come from synthetic aromachemicals like javanol and ebanol and sandalore.  \n\nReally, most of what makes a fragrance smell the way is smells are ingredients that almost no one has ever smelled by themselves and are only a little bit similar to things that people have actually smelled.",

Spearmint, peppermint and wild mint create an unexpected bouquet, its incredible freshness providing a stunning effect.\n\n>*HEART*\n>The heart of the fragrance reveals the seductive power, introduced by citrus fruits. Like a crisp coating of ice, hibernal underlines these contrasts and prolongs the dialogue between icy crispness and sensual breath, giving the fragrance an almost unlimited life. \n\n>*BASE*\n>The woody and distinguished character of vetiver from Haiti is both wet and dry, with fresh and hot nuances. This ambivalence creates a particular sensuality and vibrancy, very attractive on men's skin. Communicating self-confidence and charm, vetiver provides a very intimate comfort. Ginger from Nigeria illuminates the base note and brings a crackling and woody vibrancy.\n\nThat's a description for **Armani Code Sport**. \n\nMy boyfriend wears that cologne. I *know* what it smells like. I smell it all the time! I love that cologne, and I love it on him. \n\nBut if I read/heard that description without knowing which cologne it's referring to, I would never say, *\"Oh, hey, that's totally what my guy wears!\"* It wouldn't even register that I knew it at all. If I can't match a description to a cologne I know intimately, there's really no way a commercial describing a fragrance I've never smelled would impart any useful information to me whatsoever.

That's stupid, because we have strong defenses against being intellectually convinced. \n\nHowever, if you go for *emotions* instead, you can reprogram people like nobody's business.\n\nEdwards Bernays, the nephew of Sigmund Freud in fact, developed the techniques used in \"public relations\" today around the second world war, and they have basically given us our consumption society.\n\nEvery halfway decent commercial will be shooting 100% for your emotions. You see a cologne commercial, you see gorgeous people, you create an emotional response you may not even be aware of, and next time you walk by a shop that sells the stuff you think \"Yeah this stuff, this stuff is good, it makes me feel all manly just thinking about it, I wonder why?\" and boom, they got you. \n\nThis \"intellectual defenses but zero emotional defenses\" thing about humans is a massive problem. It's why total utter shitbags like Donald Trump can actually lead an election for President of the United States - he \"advertises\" to people's base emotions, not to the intellect. The Democrats are uniformly far better and far more right than the Republicans, but their message is often sane and intellect related (you know, what you NEED in government) whereas Republicans go for the base, primal emotions of hate and fear. And thus the Republicans \"do better\". \n\nTL/DR: Ads are 100% aimed at your emotions. Nobody cares about convincing people intellectually since that's not effective.",

Bernays understood, as did Pavlov in his experiments with dogs, that we can make arbitrary associations between two things. So, perfumes, for, example are sold almost entirely based on the qualities they give to a person who wears them (e.g., a cologne for today‚Äôs modern man), rather than on the actual content of the product. \n\nThis ability to make arbitrary associations is also why you've seen companies' names change from things like Ford (named after the inventor) to more abstract concepts like Amazon, Apple, Blackberry, Bonobos, Casper, etc. Colognes are never called Fir Tree or Woodsy--they have names like Excite, Anarchy, etc. (just Googled Axe's fragrances to find those).\n\nThere are people who study what emotions certain sounds evoke, and so you can make a name that has nothing to do with the actual product that evokes certain feelings and connect the feeling and the product. The /i/ (\"ee\") sound for example is thought to be a more feminine sound. Words that start with \"br\" tend to be thought of as strong.\n\nThe other thing is that you are able to tell us what was in the commercial: a man giving certain looks, music that seemed out of place, and a French name. All of that is likely purposeful. We tune out most of the information around us, but you tuned into this. So something that is jarring, out of place, or emotional can grab your attention. If they gave you just pure information about which essential oils the cologne contains you might tune it out.\n\nThe fact that all advertisers do the same thing probably means that it works.",

        "body": "I hate to say it, but advertising for cologne is actually some of the most brilliant advertising out there.  If you are familiar with different colognes you begin to notice a pattern connecting (most) famous styles.  I say it's brilliant because they have to evoke a scent using only a few of your other senses to get the message across.  \n\nA commercial for one of my favourite colognes, even, was directed by Martin Scorcese, and it was fantastic (Bleu de Chanel).  So here's how it works: each cologne has several things associated with it; they have a very specific colour palette, a specific looking bottle, a theme for the commercial, actors wearing very particularly chosen clothes, a setting, and a name.  \n\nSo let me give you an example of an application of this formula.  For Bleu de Chanel, everything in the commercial is very very blue, and nearly every scene is filmed with cool colours.  This implies a very fresh, very slightly soapy cologne.  The bottle is no nonsense, square with a classic Chanel top - this echoes the fact that it is bold, but not overly complex (like a Tom Ford cologne, for example).  The theme of the commercial is lost love, a film star, breaking expectations, being unexpected; this doesn't actually help us much in terms of scent (like a nautical theme would to imply an oceanic scent), rather it builds a little mystique around the product and is just good emotional salesmanship.  The actors are wearing two sets of clothes, all by Chanel, one of formal attire, and one of slightly more casual; this suggests that the cologne can be worn formally or casually (can confirm as an owner).  Oh I nearly forgot, the music - She Said Yeah by the Rolling Stones - implies a bit of a rock'n'roll aesthetic.  And lastly the setting and name.  The setting is rather modern and sparse, making for a modern scent, and finally the name is just \"Bleu\".  That's all. Just a fleeting impression of something cool and fresh, and the brand: Chanel.  \n\n\nYou can apply this to many more parfumerie commercials that I've seen and I will if you'd like me to.  Bleu de Chanel was the first cologne, actually the first ever item that I wanted to buy just because of the commercial, and when I smelled it for the first time, it was exactly within the realm of what I expected from having watched the commercial.",

People who wear those colognes usually want / need to feel fancy.\n\nThe problem is that we don't have smell-o-vision, and their best guess is to show some totally unrelated \"fancy content\", that (as OP pointed out) is awkward as hell. My guess is that it's an industry that can't justify spending huge $$ on TV advertising, knowing that they have much better luck in-store (where you can smell it), and so the commercials that DO make their way on-air are consistently cheaply written / made.",

If you didn't know what Google was (lol), this commercial would tell you NOTHING about what Google does... but it does communicate an experience. Heck, a Google commercial isn't even necessary. Like, the last thing Google needs to do is advertise who they are. They don't need to because they ARE an advertising company.  \n\nBut there is an image they want to uphold. It's nice to remind us that they are still there, still keeping up with technology, still kicking and alive. It's just a friendly reminder - \"hey, we are Google! Yep, still here, still doing cool ass shit\"  \n\nFor colognes and fragrance... well, when you want a cologne or fragrance, there are two primary factors people consider when buying them.  \n\nFirst, there are those who just want something that smells nice. They don't care about anything other than price and the actual smell. They will walk into a Wal-Mart or Target and smell every fragrance and pick the best smelling one that also fits their budget.  \n\nFor these people, those ads are useless. But hey, ads are all about target audience anyways. So the fragrance ads that DO target these people are, idk, Axe commercials. Those actually try to convey their fragrance, but again through a means of lifestyle. I mean, it's damn near impossible to communicate what it actually smells like, but they can communicate an idea that relates to the fragrance.  \n\nThere are entire agencies and research teams who do nothing but figure this stuff out. They know that Texan cowboys prefer certain fragrances, and rich business men prefer another. I myself think they both smell like ass, and I'm just a graphic designer geek. See? Even my preferences are different. And that's the key here.  \n\nSo, for these commercials, the fragrance is based on market research. As long as the company does a good job at creating a fragrance that a certain demographic likes, then the advertising department just has to visually communicate to that demographic. You can expect a fragrance ad that depicts a cowboy lifestyle to sell  a cologne that's musky, where as an ad depicting a business man to sell a cologne with a bold or even sweet smell. It's based on demographical preference.  \n\nThe second type of demographic or ad approach is lifestyle. Some people like a certain celebrity, and that celebrity might put out a fragrance line. The consumers care not so much about *what* it smells like, but more so that 'omg Taylor Swift uses this perfume!'  \n\nI know that these type of ads don't make a whole lot of sense on first sight, but there's a lot of effort and research that goes into good advertisement. Literally, there are careers dedicated to just doing research and knowing how to visually communicate to consumers. The more abstract something is (like perfume/cologne), the more difficult it is, and ad agencies have to rely on other techniques. If they could actually somehow let you smell it through the TV, then I honestly believe that fragrance ads would be WAY different than they are now. But because our delivery medium lacks the ability to communicate the sense of smell, sound and sight is all they can rely on.  \n\nHowever, if you ever flip through a magazine and find an ad for a perfume or cologne, you often find that you can scratch the paper and smell it, or for fancier ones, you can tear out a small sample.  \n\nSo, it's not like these ads are purposely trying to be obscure. They are just relying on what available communication methods they have to work with.",

    "body": "I‚Äôm not crazy. I‚Äôm not fucking insane. This I know. This is a fact. I haven‚Äôt been hallucinating, haven‚Äôt been tripping on acid, there‚Äôs no fucking tumour growing in my brain, I don‚Äôt have any history of mental illness at all. So I did not make this up. This happened. This is real. Remember that.\n\nI can‚Äôt say exactly what made me wake up, if it was the metallic scent in the air, or if it was the warm, sticky feeling of the blood slowly pooling in our bed, but I remember screaming bloody murder once I realised what was going on. My wife, Darla, hardly registered the noise, she just sort of snorted groggily, eyes all dull and glassy. \n\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù she mumbled.\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre bleeding!‚Äù I yelled, ‚ÄúOh my god, oh my god, oh my god.‚Äù\n\nI panicked. I could tell by her condition that it was serious. She‚Äôd lost a lot of blood, and she looked pale and unfocused. All I could think of was the worst case scenarios. Death, still birth, both of the above. Her gaze was far away, like she had problems staying conscious, and I finally snapped into action, lifted her up, and ran frantically to the car.\n\nThe drive to the hospital was hazardous to say the least. I swerved into oncoming traffic several times, breaking more or less every existing traffic law, barely even focusing on the road for most of the drive. It‚Äôs a wonder I didn‚Äôt kill us all. But I couldn‚Äôt stop myself. I couldn‚Äôt imagine my life without her. That‚Äôs all I could think about. *Get to the hospital. Get to the hospital before it‚Äôs too late. Please God, don‚Äôt let her die.*\n\nI didn‚Äôt bother parking the car. I drove it right up to the entrance, left it running in neutral, grabbed Darla, ran inside yelling hysterically for someone to come help me. Help her. I honestly can‚Äôt remember much of what happened next. Someone came along and took her from me, put her down on a bed, rushed away in a hurry. Next thing I know I‚Äôm just standing there, covered in blood, answering all sorts of questions.\n\n‚ÄúShe‚Äôs eight months pregnant!‚Äù I sobbed, ‚ÄúPlease, just save her. Please, please, please.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúCalm down, sir,‚Äù some faceless nurse said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna do everything in our power to save your wife. But you have to calm down. You need to help us help her.‚Äù\n\nI couldn‚Äôt calm down. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs humanly possible. Not when someone you love is in danger. When someone you love is about to die. Not when you can‚Äôt do anything about it. All you have to grab onto is worry, distress, panic, fear, sorrow, sadness, and that‚Äôs the only thing that keeps you sane. I stood there shivering, convulsing, tears flowing, gasping for air, trying to the best of my ability to answer the questions. To help them save her. \n\n‚ÄúThank you, sir,‚Äù the faceless nurse said, ‚ÄúPlease, sit down. I‚Äôll get back to you as soon as we have some news.‚Äù\n\nSit down? *Sit down?!* All I could think about was to scream, lash out, hit something, make the pain on the inside manifest on the outside instead, and they wanted me to *sit down*? I knew it wasn‚Äôt their fault. I knew I had no choice. But still it felt so...pointless. I hate not being in control. Hate feeling useless. Hate having to wait for someone else to fix it.\n\nI slouched down and buried my face in my hands. I couldn‚Äôt believe this was happening. Not to us. Not now. My mind was racing, and it was always the most ridiculous, insignificant notions I got hung up on. Like how I was gonna miss work. I had a major presentation in a couple of days. Important stuff. Or how disappointed my parents would be if I didn‚Äôt become a dad. Or how I dreaded calling Darla‚Äôs parents to tell them the bad news. \n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you just love this place,‚Äù a cheery voice suddenly said.\n\nI raised my head to identify the owner of the voice. I could have sworn I was the only one around, and I couldn‚Äôt recall hearing anyone else walking in. But there he was, sitting right next to me. He was young, maybe in his mid-twenties, long blonde hair, dressed in jeans and a white hoodie. He smiled happily as my tear-filled, bloody visage greeted him with shock and disbelief. He had perfect teeth. I remember this vividly. *Perfect*.\n\n‚ÄúWhat the fuck do you mean?‚Äù I spat angrily. \n\nI wasn‚Äôt really myself, and having some douchebag fucking with me when my wife‚Äôs life was hanging in the balance? I wasn‚Äôt having it.\n\n‚ÄúHospitals, man,‚Äù he chuckled, ‚ÄúThe lovely scent of misery and death. So invigorating.‚Äù\n\nI immediately saw red. I wanted to take a swing at him so badly, but something inside me held me back. I can‚Äôt explain it, but it was like I knew it would be a horrible idea.\n\n‚ÄúShut the fuck up,‚Äù I shouted, ‚ÄúMy wife‚Äôs in there. She‚Äôs fucking dying for all I know.‚Äù\n\nHe threw his head back and laughed heartily.\n\n‚ÄúShe sure is,‚Äù he smiled, ‚ÄúSweet, sweet Darla. Far too young to bleed out in a hospital bed, don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù\n\nI stared at him with wide-eyed shock and anger. How the fuck did he know? Was he here when I brought her in? Why hadn‚Äôt I noticed him before now then?\n\n‚ÄúWh-what?‚Äù was all I could muster, ‚ÄúHow the fuck‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nHe chuckled, ‚ÄúI know everything, Nick. I know that right now Darla‚Äôs dying. She‚Äôs losing too much blood. They can‚Äôt stop it.‚Äù\n\nHe smiled and leaned in close. His eyes sparkled a hypnotizing emerald green, but I couldn‚Äôt focus on anything but the smell. It was a lovely fragrance, sweet flowers and fruits. My wife‚Äôs fragrance.\n\n‚ÄúI give her five minutes,‚Äù he grinned, ‚ÄúThen the doctors will come through that door, and your life will never be whole again.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut the‚Ä¶‚Äù I started, tears filling my eyes again. I couldn‚Äôt help but to believe him. Every fiber of his being radiated truth and sincerity. \n\n‚ÄúAh, the life inside her?‚Äù he pointed to his stomach, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll save it. You‚Äôll be a single parent, grieving widower, destined for a life of hardship and perpetual disappointment. You‚Äôll drink yourself to death eventually. No one will miss you. C‚Äôest la vie.‚Äù\n\nI tore at my hair in despair. His words slithered into my mind, lingering, echoing in there, their hollow, somber meaning burrowing into my consciousness, imprinting on it a hopeless, dreary, unforgiving existence.\n\n‚ÄúN-No,‚Äù I sobbed, ‚ÄúTh-There has to be something, some way‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nHe tapped his nose and grinned widely, ‚ÄúFunny you should say that‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWh-what do you mean?‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúWhat the *fuck* do you mean?!‚Äù\n\nHe smiled and stood up from his seat. He was tall and slim, but at the same time he appeared unnaturally imposing, like he was emanating pure unfiltered strength. It felt like I was cowering beneath him, like I was nothing but an insignificant ant he could stomp out of existence should he so will it.\n\n‚ÄúA life for a life,‚Äù he reached out his right arm, ‚ÄúYour wife‚Äôs life, to be exact.‚Äù\n\nI just stared at the hand. What the fuck did he mean, *a life for a life*? What the fuck was going on here? Who the fuck was this guy?\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs real simple, Nick,‚Äù he bent down and whispered to me, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll save your wife, but in return you‚Äôll have to let me take another life.‚Äù\n\nI was still staring at the hand, my body tense and rigid. It felt wrong on so many levels. Unnatural, unholy, something that should never transgress.\n\n‚ÄúWho?‚Äù I asked, ‚ÄúWho will you take instead?‚Äù\n\nHe grinned, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs always the question, isn‚Äôt it? It‚Äôs not life itself that‚Äôs precious; it‚Äôs the life you‚Äôre familiar with.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúWho?!‚Äù I demanded.\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, Nick my boy,‚Äù he chuckled, ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be someone you know. A perfect stranger, someone you‚Äôve never even met. And it will be like they never existed. Gone. Vanished. No trace of them. It‚Äôs a once-in-a-lifetime deal, Nicky. I‚Äôd take it if I were you.‚Äù\n\nI shivered uncontrollably. There were dark forces at work here, that much I knew. Blasphemous powers. But I didn‚Äôt hesitate. I didn‚Äôt even consider it. How could I? It was my wife, my one true love. I stood up and shook his hand.\n\n‚ÄúAttaboy, Nicky,‚Äù he laughed, ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt regret this. You might even thank me one day.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOne da-‚Äù I started, but was interrupted by a doctor rushing through the door from the E.R. When I turned back to face the man, he was gone. Vanished. What was weirder still, was that it still felt like I was holding his hand, like we were still locked in that grim handshake. \n\n‚ÄúMr. Matthews,‚Äù the doctor took my hand, ‚ÄúGood news. Your wife is doing well. She‚Äôs weak and exhausted, but doing excellent considering the circumstances.‚Äù\n\nI laughed. And cried. A wholesome, wonderful combination of the two. She was alive. She was well. I‚Äôd never been happier in my entire life. But then a thought occurred to me. A dark thought.\n\n‚ÄúAnd the‚Ä¶‚Äù I muttered, ‚ÄúI mean, the‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh, you mean the baby?‚Äù the doctor smiled, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, your son is in perfect health. We had to do an emergency C-section, but he‚Äôs a strong one. You can see them both soon.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSon‚Ä¶‚Äù I whispered, ‚ÄúA son‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôm not crazy. I‚Äôm not insane. This is real. I told you to remember that.\n\nThey were fine. Fine and happy and healthy. The two of them. Mother and son. But I couldn‚Äôt enjoy it. Couldn‚Äôt believe it. My wife didn‚Äôt understand. Why wasn‚Äôt I happy? Why was I acting so strange?\n\nI haven‚Äôt been hallucinating. I haven‚Äôt been tripping on acid. I went with my wife to every doctor‚Äôs appointment, every ultrasound, every physical checkup. I was there every step of the way.\n\nThere‚Äôs no tumour growing in my brain. No fucking history of mental illness.\n\nSo why do they look at me like I‚Äôm mad? Why can‚Äôt they just believe me? I did not make this up. This happened. This is real.\n\nI remember everything so vividly. But now it‚Äôs gone. Vanished. No trace. Like it never existed in the first place.\n\nI remember my wife being pregnant.\n\nPregnant with [twins.](https://www.reddit.com/user/hyperobscura/posts/)",

Currently I just wear 1 spray of CDNIM sprayed on my chest beneath a undershirt+button up.\n\nThe girl in the cubicle next to me has been coughing and gagging a lot, but she was doing that even before I started wearing cologne so I'm not sure if it's the projection or if I just naturally disgust her.\n\nAnother girl may be a fraghead because she always smells like Skittles. I'm not sure if she wears a perfume or if she just squirrels away some Skittles in her pouches. She didn't seem to bothered by my cologne, or at the very least wasn't gagging around me.\n\nThere is a dude at my work that I for sure believe is a fraghead. He always smells like Spaghettios, specifically the ones with hot dogs, so he must be into some niche scents. He complimented me saying I smelled good but not sure if I should trust his judgement.\n\nI guess my question is, how do I know if I am projecting too much. I think 1 spray is fine, but maybe I need something more tame for the office.\n\n\n[UPDATE: The Hot Dog Spaghettio Man](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/s/xxgrahMo3I)  **Jan 6, 2025**\n\nSome people asked me to find out what fragrance my coworker uses. For context see the original post here: [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1htu0u7/how_can_i_tell_if_i_am_suffocating_everyone_in_my/)\n\nI spoke with him today and asked about the cologne he uses. He said he doesn't wear any cologne as they trigger his allergies/asthma. I asked if he used any particular product to get his fragrance. Apparently he uses unscented soap and deodorant since he thinks the scented ones also affect his allergies. I guess he wasn't a fraghead after all or he is just trying to keep his fragrance to himself. \n\nI haven't seen him eating anything remotely Italian at work so I'm thinking he just has a natural scent of sweet tomato paste and boiled hot dog water. It is definitely an acquired fragrance, but I grew up eating Spaghettios so it is a bit nostalgic. He doesn't smell fresh out of the can though. It smells as if the Spaghettios have been sitting out overnight. \n\nOn a separate note, I didn't wear cologne today to test if my projection was causing the issue to my cubicle neighbor as was my concern in the original post. She was gagging away as usual so I am pretty confident it is not my cologne. The Spaghettio man is in the cubicle next to her on the other side so maybe his unique aroma is causing her distress. She may not have developed the same appreciation for the smell of Spaghettios. \n\nSorry for the disappointing update. I was sure he was wearing some sort of fragrance considering how strong it is. I guess some of us are just born lucky.\n\n[UPDATE: Hit Me Baby One More Time](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/s/r5JLR3wOd9)  **Jan 8, 2025**\n\nThere were a few people in the last threads interested in the Skittles fragrance my coworker was wearing, so I am posting this update after asking her. For context see the [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1htu0u7/how_can_i_tell_if_i_am_suffocating_everyone_in_my/) and [First Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1hv2nlg/update_the_hot_dog_spaghettio_man/).\n\nFirst off, a little update on the Spaghettio man. I think talking with me made him switch up his routine, because his aroma has changed a bit. I‚Äôm not sure if he is now wearing cologne or using scented soap. It feels too soon to ask again. His fragrance has shifted to having spicier notes, covering up the dog water scent while still keeping the rancid tomato sauce undertones. There is also a bit of a murky smell like when you let the water drip on your carpet and the black mold starts to form. I am honestly very happy for him and glad he seems to be making an effort with his fragrance, even if it still bears a resemblance to canned pasta.\n\nUnfortunately, my cube neighbor has started working from home for the time being. Our manager didn‚Äôt really go into specifics, but I do hope her gagging has ceased and she is more comfortable now that she is free of his aura. A recent hire has moved into her spot for now. Since we are a small office, not everyone gets a cube and are instead placed at a table in an open layout. He has no notable scent; I made sure of it. I do occasionally hear some very faint moaning coming from his cube, and not the good kind. I think there is some anguished regret in those moans.\n\nMy other coworker is still smelling like she tastes the rainbow every day. I finally built up the courage to ask her about it. She told me she was wearing **Britney Spears Midnight Fantasy**. Must drench herself in the stuff because I can smell her from across the room. She gave me some of her frosted animal crackers. With the sweet scent of Britney Spears and the musty aroma of Spaghettios wafting around me all day, I feel like the office is a distorted fever dream of my childhood.\n\nThis will be my last update. I mainly wanted to let the people who were curious about the Skittles perfume know about it and also tell of my coworker‚Äôs evolved state.\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**kakator**\n\n>What do you think the new coworker is anguished about?\n\n**OOP**\n\n>>I'm not sure honestly. This new guy likes to do theater in his spare time so maybe he is just practicing his lines. I can sometimes hear muffled conversation from his cube but when I peer into it there is no one with him and the noise abruptly stops. I think he just enjoys conversing with himself.\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP's OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**",

    "body": "**MONDAY - 7:00 AM:**\n\nI wake early. The room is filled with a grey smog: I must have been smoking in my sleep again.\n\nMy wife sleeps next to me, oblivious.\n\nI try and look for the cigarette butts. Nowhere to be found.\n\nPeer out the window. Mr. Rallins stands in the front garden, in his tattered old suit, staring back up at me. He sways slightly, old age, I guess, and raises a hand in a half-wave half-salute. I don‚Äôt wave back.\n\n**7:30 AM:**\n\nI make breakfast for the kids, who are already at the dinner table. Always earlier than me - always. I make a joke that their Pops is getting old, huh, that teenagers aren‚Äôt meant to be up before noon.\n\nThey‚Äôre silent.\n\nI don‚Äôt think they get the joke.\n\nI pour cornflakes into two bowls, and then add milk until it nearly reaches the lip, watch how the liquid settles around the irregular shapes of the cereal. Pour them orange juice in two tall thin glasses.\n\nPlace this all on the table, say a half-mumbled grace as I fix myself coffee.\n\nThe kids don‚Äôt drink their juice, nor eat their cereal, just bicker in that way kids can, making stupid facial expressions at eachother, and I‚Äôve got no time for it - really, no time at all - and so I shout at them (which I regret now, honest) and pour the OJ all over their laps and say if you‚Äôre going to act like children-\n\nSorry, I‚Äôm saying, sorry. Too far. I know.\n\n**7:45 AM:**\n\nMy wife‚Äôs adorable. So sleepy! Like a little dormouse. I pick her up and have to - can you believe it - carry her downstairs!\n\n**8:00 AM:**\n\nI walk to work.\n\nIt does not take very long.\n\n**8:30 AM:**\n\nI make small incisions on the soft pad of each of my fingertips so that I wince whenever I hold a pen or press a key on a keyboard.\n\n**9:00 AM:**\n\nRoger comes in to work, we spend the first hour or so going over the cargo. He wears plastic gloves and I use my bare hands, and he says that‚Äôs gross, that‚Äôs weird, and I argue that look, if you‚Äôve got such a problem with it why don‚Äôt you fuckin call head office and whine to them.\n\nThat shuts him up.\n\nWe make our notes, tick all the correct boxes.\n\n**10:00 AM:**\n\nRoger goes upstairs to get us coffee, and someone from Upper Management comes downstairs.\n\nThey knock three times on the door. It‚Äôs them. They‚Äôve come again.\n\nThey run their hands over the cargo that‚Äôs on the table in front of me, take their time, savour the cool surface. Say they would very much like this one, they would like it very much indeed.\n\nI let them have it, mark the required boxes, delete the required files, update what needs to be updated.\n\n**10:30 AM:**\n\nI get a text:\n\nWe are watching. We are waiting. There is something that crawls beneath that we have to liberate and our skin is a cage and our mouths are pretty flowers.\n\nHuh. Wrong number, I guess.\n\n**11:00 AM:**\n\nI watch videos on my phone during my coffee break.\n\nIn the last five minutes, before I head back downstairs, I make small incisions in the palms of my hands and lap at them like deer at a salt lick. It does not escape my attention, trust me, that there have been those from history with these very wounds, in fact maybe the most important man of all, and it gives me some satisfaction to know that he too, the Wise and the Just and the Lamb, felt the same pain whenever he wriggled his fingers.\n\n**11:30 AM:**\n\nI sneeze three times in a row.\n\nOne-Two-Three, can you believe it? Just like that.\n\n**12:00 PM:**\n\nDelia has a few choice words for me: I‚Äôve been slacking, I‚Äôm not paying any attention to my job, I smell a little funny. Blah blah fucking blah. DELIA!\n\nWhat a bitch.\n\nWhaddabitch. Say it with me, all one word: whaddabitch.\n\nYeah, sure, Delia. I smirk, giving her that rare and wry wit I‚Äôm known for, yeah, sure I‚Äôll pay more attention.\n\n(She has no fucking clue what she‚Äôs talking about)\n\n**1:00 PM:**\n\nLunch Break. I have my favourite, meatballs and no sauce. Just five little meat dumplings that I eat by holding them in my mouth  until I begin to salivate and I can feel the spit in the gutters of my mouth, warm and with the fragrance of uncooked flesh and I sit like that with my eyes closed or half-rolled back in my head.\n\nThat is, until, Delia (you guessed it) tells me to move on. To keep working.\n\nShe is a NIGHTMARE!\n\n**1:30 PM:**\n\nA human head remains conscious for about twenty seconds after being decapitated.\n\n**2:00 PM:**\n\nI catch someone from Upper Management watching through a window as I work. I wave back with the limp hand of the cargo: *hello!* The wrist is all stiff, to be expected, but I think they get the joke.\n\n**2:30 PM:**\n\nUpper Management take me into a little room upstairs for a ‚Äòquick chat‚Äô. They‚Äôre all wearing masks - these black cloth sacks over their heads.\n\nI think it‚Äôs a prank, but I go along with it anyway: I skin the whole goat! Or whatever the damn phrase is. You know what I mean.\n\n**2:45 PM:**\n\nI am borrrrred. Bored bored bored.\n\n**3:00 PM**\n\nRoger comes in with a clipboard.\n\nCan I take a donation? He asks.\n\nYeah, Roger, what‚Äôs this for?\n\nHe frowns. You know this, you know exactly what it‚Äôs for.\n\n(I very much don‚Äôt!)\n\nThe fundraiser. For Delia‚Äôs charity, the one she chose, remember?\n\nI blink.\n\nRoger shakes his head.\n\nWhen she died, she said it would mean the world if we all donated a bit. She battled with it all her life, man.\n\nDelia winks at me from the corner, runs her tongue over her teeth.\n\n**3:30 PM:**\n\nAnother cup of coffee.\n\nI‚Äôm some sort of coffee-machine!\n\n**4:00 PM:**\n\nI daydream about flaying the skin of my feet and my wrists, little ribbons, and I imagine them all in a mess on the floor like the curly bits of sawdust or potato peel in the bin. *That* makes me think of my wife, who‚Äôs probably cooking dinner right now, probably working on making sure her handsome-hunk-of-a-husband is going to be well fed.\n\nI think about putting my head in an open doorframe and paying someone good money to slam the door on my head over and over and over and over again. Imagine myself whimpering all bloody and bruised like in those movies you watch, all boohoo and poor me, and then I imagine wetting myself in front of them with my hands up they like they do in cartoons, like *uh-oh! oopsie daisie!*\n\n**4:30 PM:**\n\nI take a piss. Consider going number two, but I‚Äôd prefer to save that for when I get home.\n\n**4:40 PM:**\n\nWhen you think about it, if you‚Äôre kissing someone for twenty whole seconds, that‚Äôs a pretty *damn* long kiss!\n\n**5:00 PM:**\n\nPlease don‚Äôt end work day - *please don‚Äôt end please don‚Äôt end.*\n\nI imagine myself naked and bound to the hand of a giant clock and beneath me is this vast and churning ocean slowly rising and all I can do is hold my breath and pray that there‚Äôs nothing in the water and that I am alone.\n\nI‚Äôm so scared my teeth are chattering.\n\n**5:15 PM:**\n\nAnother wrong number fiasco. A voicemail this time, some low and gravelly voice who‚Äôs obviously having *some* sort of party because there are these high pitched female moans in the background and the voice is saying: what lies beneath the skin longs to get out and the soul is trapped by bone and we do not have to live like this it can all be so much more.\n\n**6:00 PM:**\n\nOn the way home from work I find a dog on the side of the road. I pick it up, and throw it in the boot. It‚Äôs cold, and stiff, and smells, but I‚Äôm attached already. I name him Rocket.\n\nThe kids will LOVE him.\n\n**7:00 PM:**\n\nMr. Rallins is outside my house still, stood on the lawn, swaying, and I shout: hello Mr. Rallins! And he says nothing back. He‚Äôs just swaying and muttering in that broken old voice of his: help me oh god help me please god help me.\n\n**8:00 PM:**\n\nI was wrong.\n\nMy wife has NOT made dinner. She has stood in the same fuckin place since morning. Lazy cow. The kids don‚Äôt react to the dog either, just sit there, staring at eachother.\n\nIt‚Äôs like no one in this family appreciates my hard work!\n\nI take out a stack of plates from the cupboard and throw them one by one at the wall and then collect myself.\n\nSorry.\n\nThat was rash of me. That was, over the top.\n\nI‚Äôm sorry. I should learn better how to control my feelings I should not be so rash and impulsive I am forever grateful for your eternal patience as a family now would someone clean the DAMN MESS UP.\n\n**8:15 PM:**\n\nA neighbour knocks on the door.\n\nHello? What was all that noise about?\n\nI charm the man, explain that my wife is a bit cold (ha-ha!) and that I slipped whilst making dinner.\n\nHe asks to come in.\n\nMr. Rallins is still going on about needing help.\n\nSorry, Sir, you can‚Äôt come in.\n\nMy wife‚Äôs..er..naked.\n\nThe neighbour blinks. Right.\n\nI shrug, and coded in that shrug is anything every man understands instantly: *women, huh?*\n\nRocket lies by the door, all glassy-eyed.\n\n**8:50 PM:**\n\nDinner. Kids don‚Äôt eat, wife doesn‚Äôt seem hungry either.\n\nNo plates to eat it on either - so I eat off the floor and pile the food between my crossed legs.\n\nI watch an old episode of Seinfeld - *man!* that guy sure is funny.\n\nYou‚Äôre right! Shoe stores are weird - ha-ha-ha! Why do they hit the shoe once they‚Äôve put it on? And after they‚Äôve tied it up so damn tight!\n\nFunny, funny guy.\n\n**9:00 PM:**\n\nI pour boiling water on my belly.\n\n**9:15 PM:**\n\nRead a little. Getting into self-help at the moment, I think this year I‚Äôve made my way through about fifty or so.\n\nThis one‚Äôs all about Laws to Power. Things like conceal your intentions! And, number four: always say less than necessary.\n\nI wonder if there‚Äôs one about how to understand women! That would be a hoot.\n\n**9:30 PM:**\n\nMissed a couple spots from dinner and so I crawl around licking it up off the floor.\n\nWaste-not-want-not!\n\n**10:00 PM:**\n\nUpper Management come over, three of them let themselves in. Naked, wearing those black cloth sacks over their heads, their bodies all fleshy and dimpled.\n\nThey paint something on the floor, I don‚Äôt know what though, what am I? A god-damned-symbologist? Ha-ha.\n\nLooks like a funny star.\n\nOne of them strokes my wife and kids, comments on how cold my wife is, how well her skin has kept, and then the woman with them just leans in and tongues her open mouth - wowee! - and that‚Äôs that.\n\nThey light these bundles of herbs and begin chanting things in a language I don‚Äôt understand.\n\nOnce this is done they take me and my wife upstairs, having to carry my wife again (that damned woman!) and do the same procedure.\n\nI tell them I need to sleep, and they seem okay with that, standing naked by my bed, chanting, waving those bundles of herbs around the place smells like some sort of hippy commune.\n\nI‚Äôm half asleep but I can hear them bring someone upstairs, is that Rogers voice? And he‚Äôs whimpering and squealing like a stuck pig and I think they bleed him like one too but I don‚Äôt see it just hear it, a slick sound like scissors through paper and then a wet splashing sound like spilt orange juice and then convulsions and then nothing.\n\nEarly night for me!\n\n**TUESDAY - 7:00 AM:**\n\nI wake early. The room is filled with a grey smog: I must have been smoking in my sleep again.\n\nMy wife sleeps next to me, oblivious.\n\nI try and look for the cigarette butts.

He murdered his family, and that's why at the beginning he keeps saying \"sorry\" and that he took it too far. \nAt 10 a.m. some people from the Upper Management came with cargo. I am suspicious that there is a body because they mentioned the \"cold surface\".\nDelia mentioned X smelled funny, and could it possibly be the odour of dead bodies...?\nLunch break.\nHe is eating five human heads that he killed and chopped off.\nIt's very clear that X hates Delia. X killed her after lunch break because Roger later on announced Delia is dead. It is also possible that X likes Delia because later on we discover that X kissed Delia after chopping off her head.\nRoger mentioned something like \"she fought this her whole life.\" Considering the fact that X might like Delia, could she be raped by X...?\nWe know that X knows that what happens after work when he gets home because he doesn't want work to end in 5:00 p.m.\nRocket is dead. He was cold when X found him.\nWe know that X is delusional because he still imagines himself as a good husband and they are still a happy family AFTER HE KILLED THEM.\nMr. Rallins undiscovered that X is a murderer during work considering the fact that after work when X saw him he kept saying \"help\".\nAt 8:15 a neighbor and Mr. Rallins came to X's house. Mr. Rallins probably told the other man what was going on and he wanted to confirm it.\n\nDinner time.\n\nWhat did they eat?\nSimple.\nThe neighbor and Mr. Rallins.\nWaste-not-want-not!\n\nThe ritual.\nThe cult.\nThe Upper Management.\n\nThe Upper.\nHell is next to Heaven.\nHeaven is in the sky.\nSky.\nUp.\n\"The skin is our cage\"\nDemons.\nThey are demons.\n\n\nEvery ritual needs a sacrifice.\nRoger.\nThey burnt him.\nIt's not a cigarette.",

Photo on right is me 2023 (52).\n\nI‚Äôve always been into skincare but got more serious over the last 12-18 months. \n\nBack in 2017, I was doing Botox every 3-4 months but still struggled with acne despite using recommended non-comedogenic products. I was using tretinoin irregularly, but was religious with spf30, and used aha/bha masks every once in a while.\n\n2022, I had a lower blepharoplasty, and also started using tretinoin more consistently. I also got much pickier with the products I used, using an acne comedogenic ingredient checker, and eliminated any product that potentially could be problematic. I‚Äôve kept up with the Botox, but also added PRP microneedling and IPL this year (gone 3x so far).\n\nHere‚Äôs my current routine:\nAM\n-wash with just water or use a super gentle cleanser like Avene Xeracalm Lipid cleanser \n- Skinceuticals Phloretin CF Gel\n- Peach & Lily Glass Skin Serum\n- Avene Retrinal Correcting Serum or Dr Sturm Better B serum\n- Peach & Lily Water Gel moisturizer \n- Eucerin Sun Gel Creme Oil Control Dry Touch SPF50+ (European formula)\n- MD SolarSciences SPF50 BB cr√®me \n\nPM:\n- Curel Makeup Remover Gel or Krave Beauty Makeup Rewind \n- Avene Xeracalm Lipid Cleanser (or something similarly gentle and fragrance free)\n- Neogenesis Recovery \n- Peach & Lily Glass Skin Serum\n( red light therapy 5x a week )\n- Avene Retrinal Correcting Serum or Dr Sturm Better B serum\n- Peach & Lily Water Gel moisturizer \n- Altreno .05% tretinoin\n- Finacea 15% Azelaic Acid\n- Le Mieux Sheer Hydration\n\nEvery week, I‚Äôll skip the tretinoin and AA and use an AHA/BHA mask like the Peach & Lily Reboot, or something similar, like Medik8 Press and Clear and Press and Glow.",

    "body": "**I HAVE ENTIRELY REVISED THIS GUIDE I GOT SOME NEW INTERESTING INFORMATION!!!!**\n\n**(extended workouts for those tryhard femboys (me tbh) are at the bottom (also me)**\n\n**Workouts !**\n\nI have been working out some, which can help with certain areas of the body.  \nMostly the workout regime consists of squats, lunges, and some pushups and crunches.  \nI do it before bed 6 days a week, and ive seen visible improvements.  \nBasically, do what you can! ( I dont always do it, I do forget lol)  \nI tend to do this, but you can cut it down if needed.\n\n* 20 Squats\n* 10-20 pushups, or what your able to do ;3\n* 20 lunges\n* 20 Hip thrusts, im starting to be able to do 25\n\nIf you really want to you can do more. The list below does have some weights, so use what your comfortable with !\n\n* 40 squats, in sets of 20\n* 20 pushups in sets of 10\n* 40 lunges in sets of 10 (or 20)\n* and as many crunches/situps as you can do! (about 20 is good!)\n* 20 Sumo Squats, where you hold 2 dumbells or other weights in front of you, keeping your legs in a wider stance. Do these in sets of 10, and as many as you can while squeezing your butt !\n* Weighted hip thrusts !¬†[Video on hip thrusts!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYT-qCKQwPc)\n\nTry doing that for a month or so, slowly increasing the lunges and squats, which works your thighs and butt muscles, and you should start losing weight!\n\nIncreasing reps on the whole workout will be ideal. you should start seeing improvements pretty quickly, and once you do, you can change your reps to be more personalized and work areas that YOU want to be better.  \nTry doing some romanian dead lifts! It helps train the upper hamstrings and adds some thickness to the back of the upper thighs, which translates to a better supported bootay! (from¬†u/shmol-boi¬†)\n\n**WHAT YOU EAT AND HOW YOU DIET WILL DEPEND ON YOUR BODY TYPE !**  \n**I AM SKINNY AND THIN AND BARELY GAIN WEIGHT. I EAT LOTS OF FATTY FOODS CUS IM TRYING TO GAIN WEIGHT. DONT FOLLOW MY EXAMPLE... Unless you want to :3**\n\nFood wise... limit the fast food you get. stay away from Burger King and Mc donalds and whatnot.  \nStick to better foods, or homemade meals.  \nI tend to buy a frozen pizza, and doctor it up. (Wild Mikes Frozen Pizza is AWESOME)  \nmore lean meats, and veggies are good.\n\nSnacking is fine! Its not something to COMPLETELY avoid!  \nI snack lots... If your looking for something salty, potato chips are okay, but in moderation. something sweet? find something that has no sugar, so made with monk fruit, or other sugar replacement.\n\n(DISCLAIMER: I got yelled at earlier about giving diet/food advice, AND THATS ALL IT IS. ADVICE. I AM NOT A MEDICAL PRACTITIONER. YOU DONT HAVE TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY. I AM A CUTE FEMBOY WHO JUST WANTS TO HWELP THE COMMUNE.)\n\n**(April 18, 2025)**\n\n**SKIN CAREEEEEE**  \nIve started doing more for my skin, mostly because I have some acne, and random bumps...  \nSo! Heres what ive been doing. I recommend taking lukewarm showers or cold showers, less irritating to your skin, and brings less oils out.  \nIn the shower, I use a exfoliating towel. ITS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE GLOVE (for my skin at least)  \nI USED IT ONCE AND IM SMOOTH ALL OVER. It can be used anywhere on the body, and really smooths you out. I LOVE IT :3  \nI pair it with the CeraVe, and so far it works wonders ! Glove and towel links below :3\n\n[CeraVe](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Salicylic-Cleanser-Exfoliating-Fragrance/dp/B08CQ9T6KN/ref=asc_df_B08CQ9T6KN?mcid=275fb1d66f953b278e5df3180e7e5ad3&hvocijid=15419230946321507609-B08CQ9T6KN-&hvexpln=73&tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=721245378154&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=15419230946321507609&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9011031&hvtargid=pla-2281435180778&th=1)[ link](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Salicylic-Cleanser-Exfoliating-Fragrance/dp/B08CQ9T6KN/ref=asc_df_B08CQ9T6KN?mcid=275fb1d66f953b278e5df3180e7e5ad3&hvocijid=15419230946321507609-B08CQ9T6KN-&hvexpln=73&tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=721245378154&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=15419230946321507609&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9011031&hvtargid=pla-2281435180778&th=1)\n\n[Exfoliating TOWEL¬†](https://www.amazon.com/SALUX-Nylon-Japanese-Beauty-Cloth/dp/B000CSDDDG/ref=asc_df_B000CSDDDG?mcid=ac69ab0a1da434339270ebff5894c4ff&hvocijid=7973380994653625822-B000CSDDDG-&hvexpln=73&tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=721245378154&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=7973380994653625822&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9010290&hvtargid=pla-2281435177858&psc=1)\n\n[Exfoliating Glove Link (this is a example, find one that works for you)](https://www.amazon.com/Exfoliating-Bath-Gloves-Shower-Exfoliation/dp/B08F81CCNR?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&smid=A17119QUPKBK8A&gPromoCode=sns_us_en_10_2025Q1&gQT=1&th=1)\n\nYou can use the CeraVe on your face, if ya need it btw.\n\nyour skin needs water. DRINK WATER. DO NOT GET DEHYDRATED. Feels like your lips are dry? DRINK WATER. Going to sleep? DRINK WATER. Waking up? DRINK WATER. About to do somthing funni? DRINK WATER. Car crash? DRINK WATER. Cuddling your bf? DRINK WATER (especially then cus who knows what you will do :3 )  \nYou should be drinking tons of water every day, this will really help your skin. like... ya know what a blender bottle looks like? about 5-8 of those a day. I still fall behind on that, but \\*gulp, gulp gulp\\* I try to keep up, and drink \\*gulp gulp gulp\\* about 4-6 bottles a day.  \nAnother thing that helps, Vitamin D. (both kinds if ykyk)  \nGet outside some, get a little sun ! Its good for your skin, usually.  \nAnyway ! ill update everyone in a couple weeks, after I do this for awhile !\n\n**EXTENDED WORKOUT SECTION**  \nSo, if you REALLY REALLY wanna here are some more workouts to add to the previous stoof.  \nThis is for your upper body, and will help with your waist size, and tummy :3  \nI recommend trying it out with a smaller amount of reps, half of what I do (below)  \nonce you are used to that, increase reps as usual! I saw differences the second day I did this surprisingly although it may be different for other people. dont be discouraged if you dont see¬†**IMMEDIATE**¬†improvements !\n\nIf you dont know what it is , google it ! theres tons of videos on how to do these :3\n\n* Chest muscles\n   * 15 chest presses\n   * 10 chest fly's\n   * 15 overhead chest extensions (lying down)\n   * 20 pushups\n* Arms (biceps/triceps)\n   * 25 bicep curls\n   * 15 leaned bicep curls\n   * 15 wide bicep curls\n   * 10 skull crusherssss\n   * 10 tricep extensions\n   * 10 tricep pulls (lean forward, hold weights against your legs in front of you, ift to hip, keeping your elbows straight back)\n* Shoulders\n   * 10 shoulder presses\n   * 10 arm lifts (lift your arms to the side, only to where your arm is straight out)\n   * 10 Arnold press",

        "body": "Hey there, not interested at all in getting a ‚Äúfemboy body‚Äù or any kind of trained excercise scientist, just watch a lot of bodybuilding content and getting myself in shape.\n\nWorkouts for hypertrophy, e.g. getting bigger (what you want if you‚Äôre looking for big thighs and butt) should be in a smaller rep range, around 5-12 is most recommendations. High reps e.g 20 or 40 reps as mentioned in this routine sre absolutely valid for endurance and strength, and will still somewhat grow the muscle, but they are suboptimal for hypertrophy. Additionally, these 5-12 reps should be closely approaching failure, which means by the end of a set you should only be able to repeat the lift once or twice or not at all and this likely will not happen using simple body weight movements, which means utilising weights to either 1.increase the resistance of the body weight movements or 2. Forsake body weight movements altogether and utilise the weights by themselves.\n\nIf you do low reps workouts close to failure, targeting the muscles you want to see grow, even as little as working out three or four times a week will see you getting absolutely stellar results in the span of 6 months to a year. However, resistance training will not yield great results unless your diet has sufficient protein, and reduction of fat through resistance training has been widely debunked, so the only way to lose fat is to gain a calorie deficit through dieting and cardio excercise.\n\nHowever, any way to get people moving and closer to their fitness goals is good, so if you‚Äôre doing high reps not near failure you are 99% of the way there already, so please don‚Äôt take my comment negatively, I‚Äôm simply trying to spread knowledge I‚Äôve acquired from my hobby\n\nHope this helps anyoneüëç",

        "body": "Okay super simple stuff. Fit femboy here: losing fat or gaining muscle are vastly different. The femboy body tends to be focused on the lower half (quads, hamstrings, especially the glutes) I also recommend losing fat to really get those muscles popping and your core toned.\n\nFor fat loss: being just a little shy of energy each and every day is the key, aka a calorie deficit. There are a bunch of calculators out there to see what you should be aiming for calorie wise. Typically 300-500 of your maintenance but even 200 is good. Also strongly recommend just walking, set a step goal for the day and get yourself outside, even just 30 minutes of walking goes a long way. Consistency is key for any progress though.\n\nFor muscles in those aforementioned areas, it's key to not do an insane amount of reps, find a variant of an exercise or if you have a gym find a weight that you can manage around 10 reps, 8-10 is ideal, let your muscles recover with protein, water and sleep and then 2-4 days later, try and add a rep or if you are at around 15 reps, increase the weight or make the exercise harder, this is called progressive overload.\n\nNow the exercises, there are so many exercises that work, don't limit yourself, fond what works with the basics and branch out over time. A variety of angles and exercises is what makes muscles get stronger. But here are some of my favorite (most are with weights, I'd look into calisthenics if you don't have access to them)\n\nFor lower body: Stiff Legged Deadlifts, Lunges (doing then across the room is a fun exercise and brutal on your quads), the traditional squat, hip thrusts (op is onto something) they are great for isolating the glutes, the split squat, there are like dozens and dozens of squat variants.\n\nFor upper body: pull ups are fantastic for your whole back, dumbell/barbell bench press, curls (recommend seated because of axial fatigue), tricep pull downs and overhead extensions, dips, skullcrushers, lateral raises.\n\nDon't limit yourself to these, explore. My 2 favorite fitness channels are Jeff Nippard and Renaissance Periodization.\n\nGood luck!",

    "body": "Ricky knew I was having trouble putting food on the table, so he called me up to say there‚Äôs some roadkill down the way just past the bridge, no shame in it.\n\n‚ÄúThis is a big boy,‚Äù Ricky said. ‚ÄúEnough meat to really fill up your freezer.\"\n\nIt was just a few days before the start of deer season. The woods were overflowing not just with animals but also pollen, insect noise, ghosts. You never knew what you could find on the side of the road.\n\nI asked Ricky how long he figured the roadkill had been there.\n\n‚ÄúWell,\" he said, \"seeing as I‚Äôm the one hit it, bout ten minutes ago.‚Äù\n\n\"So why not take it yourself?‚Äù I asked.\n\n‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm coming back from the Dice and figured I‚Äôd not test my luck by adding another crime on top of that,‚Äù Ricky said.\n\n‚ÄúThe Dice‚Äù was The Dice Roll, the pub across town by the river, which meant Ricky was out on a drunk again, driving the backroads. A big cadaver in his truck bed might draw some unwanted attention, especially with the Department of Transportation's laws against harvesting roadkill. Shot or run over, it made no difference. This time of year, no matter what kind of cadaver you had in your truck bed, it would land you on the wrong side of the law.\n\n‚ÄúRest of my truck is banged all to hell anyway, this sucker was so big,‚Äù Ricky said. ‚ÄúCracked my whole damn windshield.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou just leave it there in the road for someone to run over?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNah, dragged it off into the bushes as best I could. But you should be able to get out and find it easy enough if you pull over by the big tree. You know the one.‚Äù\n\nI did, sure enough.\n\nI was in my toolshed when Ricky called, near 1 a.m., so my wife and kids were asleep in bed. But I knew the route in and out of the woods that the late-nighters took to avoid the law. It wasn‚Äôt unusual for me to be awake at this hour. Ricky knew I could never sleep much anymore. We were the same like that.\n\n‚ÄúYou tell me what you want to do,‚Äù he said over the phone. ‚ÄúOtherwise, I‚Äôll call somebody else to go pick it up off the road.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI want it.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAlright then. Call if you need anything else. Just make sure you delete me from your call history once we hang up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúRicky, since when am I a fool?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúJust making sure,\" he said. \"You‚Äôve been a good and Godly family man for a while now. Didn‚Äôt know if you‚Äôd forgotten.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI remember everything,‚Äù I told him.\n\n‚Äî\n\nYou wouldn‚Äôt guess how hard it is on the spirit, how deep the fear, to know that if you make one small mistake in your life, one small offense, everything you love can be taken from you.\n\nOn that night Ricky called me about the roadkill he'd hit, I‚Äôd been up late building furniture in my shed. I'd been doing that awhile now to bring in some extra cash. Ricky and I had once been partners, before doing some time together at Livesay Correctional Institution about five years earlier for some bad things I‚Äôd rather not discuss. But the result was that even when folks were begging people to come back to work, they never wanted a felon like me.\n\nFive years, one month, and three days I‚Äôd been on parole, as of that night. Too long, no doubt. But given the multitude of other sins they could‚Äôve gotten me for, I tried taking it as a blessing.\n\nYet I knew I was living with an axe over my head.\n\nSara, my wife, had seen past my shortcomings when I‚Äôd met her at the Methodist church a few months after I‚Äôd gotten out, and we‚Äôd since gone on to build a life together. Our son, Jacob, was four. Our daughter, Abigail, had just turned two. Sara worked all day as a home health aid, and I watched over the kids while trying to find part time work, scavenging whatever meager job I could find.\n\nRicky, my old partner, had taken a different path.\n\nIt was always late at night when he called. We weren‚Äôt supposed to contact one another, on court order.\n\nThat never stopped me from picking up.\n\n‚Äî\n\nThe roadkill was not far.\n\nI got in my truck and kept the headlights off as I eased out of the curved dirt driveway, making sure to wait until I‚Äôd passed by our neighbors‚Äô shacks and had reached the main road before I flipped them on.\n\nThese were wooded roads. They terrified me in ways most people wouldn't understand. My headlamps washed over twisted tree branches and overhanging leaves and sagging power lines. Even the main road was empty this late. Only one other car passed me by as I drove the five miles or so to the crossroads under the bridge, where Ricky had dragged the roadkill into the bushes.\n\nRight away I saw he‚Äôd been sloppy.\n\nPart of his truck‚Äôs grill lay in the road, glinting like river gold in my headlamps. I pulled over and cut the engine.\n\nWhen I stepped out into the night air, the fragrance of the woods confronted me, these earthy damp smells that were more memory than sense. All the nights Ricky and I had hidden things in the woods now layered over one another in my mind as I walked over to pick the chunk of his grill out of the road. We'd hidden so much out here, so close to our homes. It was starting to change me. Or maybe it already had and I was only just noticing.\n\nOnce, a few months earlier, my wife Sara had asked me why I kept the windows rolled up when I drove down these roads on cool spring nights. Wouldn't it be nicer, she'd said, to let the fresh air in?\n\nAnd how could I tell her the truth? Which was, I felt as if ghosts were whispering to me with the windows open. The feel of the wind out here was like fingertips on my neck. Not pressing, exactly. Just grazing. Reminding me of who I was.\n\nThat and the sounds: crickets chirping, faraway trains wailing, the silence that filled the space between the tree branches, like voices talking but you can‚Äôt ever hear what they‚Äôre saying about you.\n\nBending down in the middle of the road now, in the whispering quiet of the night, I lifted the grill chunk of Ricky's truck in my hand.\n\nEven by moonlight I could see the part number on the back.\n\n‚ÄúYou drunk fool,‚Äù I said out loud.\n\nThe chunk must've come off when he'd slammed into the roadkill. He'd been too drunk to see it lying over the lane line of the road. I tossed the debris in my truck bed. Had the police found that on the road, they could‚Äôve traced it right back to the make and model of Ricky‚Äôs truck.\n\nIt took more time to find the roadkill. Ricky had really dragged it deep into the woods. He would do that sometimes when he‚Äôd been drinking. He'd put in more effort than was needed to get a particular job done, as if overcompensating for his drunkenness ‚Äî burying holes too deep, for example, or setting things on fire and waiting too long to assure everything had become ashes before leaving. All while missing simple things like a grill chunk in the road, or worse.\n\nI found the roadkill's cadaver lying where he‚Äôd said, in some bushes deep in the woods.\n\nRicky wasn‚Äôt lying ‚Äî it was a big sucker.\n\nI dragged it out by the legs but had to stop a few times to catch my breath. Before emerging from the woods, I waited a few seconds by the big tree, listening for any oncoming cars, knowing if I was caught here, I could land back in prison for a parole violation.\n\nThe night was quiet, breathing around me.\n\nI felt as if I were being watched by a thousand eyes.\n\nI told myself I was just feeding my family. Doing what I had to do. Risking it for them.\n\nI dragged the roadkill out onto the pavement. Despite how many times I‚Äôd dealt with dead things, I felt bad the way the poor body scraped limp against the road. Even dead, we all should have some dignity. When I managed to squat down and heave the thing up into my truck bed, I covered it with a tarp and tied it down carefully ‚Äî covering it up to relieve my own worries as much as I hoped it gave comfort to it as well, wherever this roadkill's soul had flown off to.\n\nDeer, birds, squirrels, rabbits ‚Äî how many confused animals had died on this curve of the road since it‚Äôd been paved?\n\nMy sins, by any account, were far less than the sins of the automobile and its endless stampede through this wilderness. And as true as I believed that to be, it didn't lessen my guilt.\n\nFor tonight's roadkill, I had purposefully brought other crates and stacks of wood and buckets to situate around the body in my truck bed, to make the covered lump look less obvious. I drove slowly on my way back, weaving down the roads carved through the woods, feeling my breath calming the closer I got to the safety of my dirt driveway.\n\nI was about a mile from home when the blue and red lights of the sheriff‚Äôs deputy flashed behind me.\n\n‚Äî\n\nI've always prided myself on staying calm during traffic stops.\n\nRicky, though, was something else.\n\nBack when we were still partners, I once saw Ricky dance his way out of a DUI checkpoint stop despite us having contraband in our trunk that could‚Äôve sent us to prison for the rest of our lives.\n\nI say he ‚Äúdanced\" and I meant it.\n\nThe deputy had asked Ricky to step out of the car. Then he‚Äôd had him doing the field sobriety walk, one foot in front of the other, Ricky touching a finger to his nose, when out of the blue he'd decided to spin around and do a Michael Jackson moonwalk right in front of the cruiser. Ricky chopped his feet and managed to keep swinging his arms side to side while touching his nose, spinning gracefully back around and then stopping on a dime with his arms outstretched, as if to say, ‚ÄúSee? Ta-da!‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôd witnessed Ricky drink no fewer than ten whiskey-sodas that night.\n\nThe officer was laughing as he let us go.\n\n‚ÄúWhat are you so stressed about?‚Äù Ricky asked me as he drove on, lighting a cigarette and grinning at me. He even leaned out to wave at the deputy as the cruiser drove past us.\n\nI didn‚Äôt say anything.\n\nAll I did was lean forward, open the glove box, and put the loaded pistol I‚Äôd been clutching in my right hand back inside with the fake insurance papers.\n\n‚Äî\n\nBut that's it.\n\nI was calm because I knew what had to be done if things went south.\n\nOn this late night, with the roadkill in my truck-bed, I pulled to the side of the road and let my muscle memory kick in, the red and blue lights of the sheriff deputy's cruiser strobing inside the cabin of my truck.\n\nI had a skill where I could move my body without moving my silhouette. From behind, the deputy who pulled me over would not have seen me remove the handgun from the center console. As he walked up to my truck, he would not have seen me wedge the gun in the crevasse on the right side of my seat. Hidden, yet I could pull it out swiftly, like a cowboy drawing a pistol from a holster. My posture had remained unchanged all the while, my arm moving independently behind the cover of the seats and my own body.\n\nThen I rolled down my window and waited.\n\nThe air of the woods eased into the car, filling my throat, entering me.\n\nWhen he got beside my open window, the deputy stepped one foot up on the side-bar of my truck. ‚ÄúEvening,\" he said. \"Get your license and registration please...‚Äù\n\nI handed him my documents. We chatted back and forth. I was fine. Steady. I didn't flinch. Then he took the documents back to his cruiser and ran my information.\n\nI paused my mind, waiting.\n\nWhen he came back, the deputy said, ‚ÄúThought I saw you driving a little sluggish so just wanted to check. Heard about some commotion going on tonight. You been drinking?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo, sir.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre you doing out this late then?‚Äù\n\n\"Well, I'll tell ya,\" I said, and I laughed in a way that sounded like a real laugh, a nonthreatening laugh, saying now, ‚ÄúGot two young kids in the house and a wife working double shifts. Hard to get much work done during the day, you know?‚Äù\n\nThe deputy's posture relaxed just enough for me to notice.\n\nHe said, ‚ÄúI hear that. My wife‚Äôs expecting our first, matter of fact.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWell, congratulations,\" and because he seemed like he might be a casual talker, I added: ‚ÄúYou work nights normally, or just pulling doubles to get out of the house?‚Äù\n\nHe grinned at that. I got the feeling he hadn't talked about it much, like he didn't have anyone around to tell.\n\n‚ÄúDoubles when I can,\" he said, nodding. \"Good to have the money. Figure it‚Äôll be hard once the baby comes.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBrother, you don‚Äôt even know,‚Äù I said.\n\n‚ÄúThat bad?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúEnjoy the peaceful nights of chasing down bad guys while you have the chance,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúA baby crying all night will make a car chase seem like a day at the lake.‚Äù\n\nHe exhaled out his nose, a soft laugh, and I imagined him as he must've been years earlier, a little boy at church with big dreams, as he handed my license and papers back through the open window.\n\nThen he did something he shouldn't have done.\n\nHe stepped all the way back down in the dirt and glanced at the back of my truck, getting a closer look at what all I had piled up in the bed.\n\nHe was a young guy. A kid, really.\n\nAs he stepped up to look in my truck bed, I touched my fingers to the grip of the handgun to feel it was still there.\n\nThe deputy was leaning over fully now to look in the bed. I could hear him. Touching at things. Moving things. Sniffing around.\n\nI looked straight ahead out the windshield.\n\nMy grip on the handgun tightened.\n\n‚ÄúWell, shoot,\" the deputy said a moment later, reappearing at the window. ‚ÄúI see you've got something in your truck bed under that tarp, huh?\"\n\nI closed my eyes, breathing in the smell of the woods that had surrounded me.\n\n\"But I decided not to check what it was,\" the deputy said, patting his hand on the top of my truck. \"Figure I can guess what's in there, huh? But ain't like deer season ain't more than three days off anyway. No use in bothering you about that.\"\n\nI opened my eyes now, my right hand releasing the grip of the handgun hidden at my side.\n\n\"Well,\" I told him, exhaling, \"I surely do appreciate you for that.\"\n\n\"Hey, we all gotta eat,\" he said. \"And sorry for the hassle. No warning or citation.‚Äù The deputy glanced to the side, then looked back at me. ‚ÄúAnd so you know, I‚Äôve got no plans to report this stop to your parole officer, but when I ran your plate through LEADS, it automatically popped up in my system, which means it‚Äôll appear in your account if your PO checks. Just in case you get a call about being out so late. Shouldn't factor in, but thought it polite to give you notice.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm aware. But hey, appreciate the heads up all the same.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSure. Take care.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhen are you expecting, by the way?‚Äù I said.\n\nI was looking at him through my side view mirror. The deputy had already started walking back to his cruiser. He turned, said, ‚ÄúPardon?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYour baby,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhen‚Äôs the due date?‚Äù\n\nHe put his hands on his hips, as if he'd forgotten. \"They say about three months, give or take.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôll come before you know it.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAlready seems like it‚Äôs happening too fast.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSure, that's all too normal,\" I told him. \"And don‚Äôt beat yourself up, down the road, if you feel guilty about making a mistake. You can‚Äôt protect them from everything. And so you know yourself, you might not sleep well the next few years, because trust me, it can feel like the whole world got a whole lot sharper and more dangerous and evil the moment your kid arrives. It's like a light got shone and you see things in color, and you see how bad things are. For you and for everyone. And you try to fix it all while grabbing all around at what to do. But nothing can be done. Nothing can be perfect. Forgive yourself for your past mistakes. Nothing you can do about that. All you can do is try your best moving forward. Try not to make history repeat itself. For your kid's sake. And most of all, stay safe, son. These are dark woods.‚Äù\n\nThe young deputy stepped back into the road, his arms dangling at his side. His right hand hovered over his gun's holster. He looked like he was about to say something. Like he was about to do something.\n\nThen he said, \"You too,\" and walked back to his cruiser as I drove off.\n\nOnly this time, I left my window down, feeling the ghosts at my neck the whole way home.\n\n‚Äî\n\nMy own father was a good man. As a child, I learned from him how to dress and butcher a deer. The animal is not so different from us, my father said, and I remember the care he took as his knife blade separated the deer‚Äôs muscles from bone, sinew from flesh, his large but gentle hands placing the cuts of meat in organized piles beside him.\n\nI remembered this as I dressed the roadkill in my toolshed that night, after arriving back home from the wooded roads.\n\nMy father stopped talking to me when I was 16 years old. By the time I‚Äôd been incarcerated for the first time, he was dead of a heart attack. He would not have approved of me using the skills he‚Äôd shown me the way I was using them tonight, on this mangled roadkill dragged out of the woods.\n\nBut I was never a good hunter.\n\nUnlike him, I always hesitated.\n\nI would see the animal standing still in the copse of trees, its neck angled downward to drink from a stream, and I could not bring myself to pull the trigger. He saw this as a failure in me, but the truth is I had the strength and discipline never to kill anything that did not deserve it or was not out to hurt me, and in this regard, I did not understand him as much as he did not understand me.\n\nI was not responsible for this roadkill, which I was now carving up in my shed.\n\nI was just making sure the death wasn‚Äôt in vain.\n\nClose to sunrise, as I was finishing up the butchering, my phone vibrated from where I‚Äôd left it on the shelf. I glanced at the screen without touching it, my hands bloody with butchered flesh. It was Ricky calling. I let it go to voicemail. I didn‚Äôt want to hear his voice this close to morning.\n\nSome of the cuts of meat I bagged and put into the freezer. The good cuts I left for the fridge. When my family woke up and saw what I‚Äôd brought them, my wife would smile and tell me I was a good man, and that night, we would have the table set with delicious steaks and mashed potatoes and gravy, like Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner out of the blue.\n\nYou have to count your blessings when you got them or create them. Because it's hard to be a good man these days. They make it so tough to provide. You try your best and it‚Äôs never enough. You got to scavenge what you can.\n\nLike Ricky said, no shame in it.\n\nThe bones, from which I'd pulled loose the flesh, I started simmering in a pot to make a bone broth. The next day I would drain the bones out, including the jaw and the skull, dry them, and then crush the bones into fine powder, which I would dissolve in the streams in the backwoods a few miles away, like I always did.\n\nThe hydrogen in the bones would nourish the soil. The soil would nourish the plants. The plants would yield fruit and life, or so I heard. I read that once from a science book while I'd been in prison. According to the book, the chemicals of life always reform anew, so that no death is final, no ghost beyond salvation.\n\nSeeds emerge from husks, always.\n\nBut some things need to be burned altogether.\n\nAs the bones were still simmering that morning, I went out to the backyard of my own family's shack and started a fire. I waited until the fire was roaring. Then I went back inside and took all the inedible remains of the roadkill and carried them outside.\n\nI placed them into the fire, piece by piece, until they caught.\n\nAll around me, the birds were waking up. It was just about morning now. The first hint of sun touched the leaves of the sugar maple trees beyond my shack. I grabbed a warm can of beer from a bucket by the fire pit and cracked it open. My wife wouldn‚Äôt mind. I had a lot of cooking to do that day, and I‚Äôd earned it. The beer tasted good, like I‚Äôd done something with my night.\n\nStanding by the fire, I waited until the heat had devoured the roadkill‚Äôs T shirt, his jeans and underwear, his shoes and socks. Based on the clothes, I figured he‚Äôd been homeless. There were more and more of them out in the woods these days. They'd been wandering, patting their feet at the ground. Ricky probably hadn‚Äôt even seen him hobbling along the side of the road until he‚Äôd hit him. By the condition of the body, this individual hadn't taken long to die.\n\nI watched as the flames spread over the ribbons of skin I‚Äôd carved off his body, the calloused padding of his feet and toes, and the roadkill‚Äôs mostly bald scalp. Oddly, his cheap wallet took the longest to melt in on itself, whatever cards or papers or pictures inside fusing together, until there was no identity left.\n\nAll my years with Ricky, I never did look inside the wallets. Not once.\n\nIn half an hour or so, when my wife and kids came down for breakfast, I would go inside, pour some coffee, and tell them I hope they had good appetites, because tonight we would dine like the president himself.",

I was homeless but I had people who would've mourned me. People who would've wanted answers on how I died, or held out hope I was still out there somewhere. Not to mention a lot of the homeless population use drugs. I was addicted to heroin at the time of my life on the streets. If someone had ran me down, and eaten me would those drugs in my system gone into those children's bellies? Beyond that a lot of the homeless suffer illnesses like Hep C which could definitely be transferred through the eating of their flesh. I was lucky enough to avoid it but I knew many who did not. It's also one thing to eat a human yourself but to place the meat in front of your unsuspecting wife and children just seems cruel.

I knew she loved perfumes. She had a pretty expensive collection. \n\nWhen I was over at her apartment, I took a picture of her perfumes. She had a lot of samples too so I took pictures of those. \n\nI found a perfume that I thought she would like. She loved her Christmas present. \n\nI told a friend how I got my gf the perfect present. He was in trouble with his wife because he flubbed his gift. He said it was creepy, too much effort for a rebound, and I should never tell her. \n\nI was planning on telling her. I didn‚Äôt think it was creepy. AITA? \n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS** \n\n**puresoftlight** \n\n>This requires some missing context. How long have you been dating? How long have you been visiting her apartment? Do you have a general sense that you have free run of the place, or would she have been surprised to find you alone in the bathroom/bedroom where you snapped the perfume collection? Did you have to open drawers/boxes, or were they out in the open? \n\n**OOP** \n\n>>We‚Äôve been dating six months. I‚Äôve been around her apartment and sleep over like 4-5 nights. She lets me do what I want. \n\n>>I had to open a perfume drawer on her perfume/makeup table for the samples but nothing else. \n\n**~** \n\n**Tuesday_Patience** \n\n>NTA \n\n>If you were only looking at the perfumes/samples, I don't think that's creepy at all. I don't think your girlfriend will be bothered either (but it is a good idea to tell her). \n\n>Now...like everyone else reading this, I need WAY more information about the brand new \"ex\" in front of your girlfriend's \"husband\". You said the breakup was over cheating - her cheating or his? Was she already separated when you guys got together? I am not super familiar with divorce proceedings, but you said you've been together for six months and her divorce was just finalized...so what was the timeline? \n\n>Obviously, none of our beeswax if you don't want to share, but you've got us all interested now! \n\n**OOP** \n\n>>I just wanted to get her a nice present. I knew she already had a lot of perfume. I just needed some inspiration and make sure I wasn‚Äôt getting something she already had.\n\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/jQFHUufxXN)¬† **Dec 31, 2023** \n\nThanks for the feedback. My gf did exactly what I thought she would do and she asked how I got her the perfect Christmas gift. I could smell the perfume on her which made me happy. \n\nI got her Zoologist Bee and Hummingbird. Based on her collection, she liked gourmands (sweets) and florals. She liked complicated scents and had a few niche ones. She didn‚Äôt have any Zoologist scents yet so I also got her a few¬† samples. \n\nA couple of people suggested I shouldn‚Äôt tell her about opening her perfume drawer to look at her samples. But I didn‚Äôt feel right hiding that. So I told her that I took a few pictures of her perfume collection and all her samples so I could get her the perfect present. \n\nShe was quiet for a while. It made a bit nervous that I messed up. But then she hugged me and smothered with kisses. She said I was the perfect boyfriend and she wanted to marry me. I was thrilled since she was a bit reluctant to get in a relationship with me after being burned. \n\nTo be clear, she didn‚Äôt cheat, her husband cheated on her and left her for his coworker. They legally separated and my gf moved into her new apartment. I met her a couple months later. She asked me out the day she met me because she thought I was hot. We went on a date and I told her I wasn‚Äôt a casual relationship guy so she had to be fully in. We started officially dating six months ago and it‚Äôs been a dream. \n\nShe got me an awesome birthday present too. A trip to a country I‚Äôve always wanted to visit. She had been asking me about my vacation days and when I planned to use it. \n\nMy gf said she wanted to plunge into Zoologist but she had a few hangups. Her ex thought she was wasting her money and scolded her about it a lot. He even threw away some of her perfume which makes no sense imo. She thanked me for breaking that and getting her her new signature scent. \n\nShoutout to all the fragrance subreddits for helping me find the perfect perfumes.\n\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP**",

She also had a collection of stuffed toy hedgehogs. Cool, I now know what I can get her, but how to get her ring size? Whilst snuggling hold her hand in mine and compare sizes, ‚Äúlook how your hand can fit in mine‚Äù, take my signet ring off and jokingly drop it over her fingers, then ask to try on hers - it goes as far as the second knuckle on my pinky. Now I know roughly what size to get, time to go shopping. Check out the chain store jeweller, but figure there‚Äôd be thousands of that design, so go looking at independents instead and find something better. It‚Äôs a Claddagh, but it‚Äôs more delicate and the heart is cubic zirconia instead of plain gold and it‚Äôs only slightly more expensive. Go in, check the size on my pinky (which gets a grin from the assistant) and it‚Äôs goes as far as the second knuckle. Happy days.\n\nNow I need a hedgehog. Not the easiest stuffed toy to find, but looking in Knick-knack shops I spot an ornament, which is two baby hedgehogs playing in a teapot, one is reaching up to pass a berry to the other. That‚Äôs cute I thought, that‚Äôll go nicely on her bookshelf. On getting home I check the ornament to make sure I haven‚Äôt damaged it and think ‚Äúthat berry looks about as thick as my pinky..‚Äù a couple of minutes later and, with a bit of blutack, the hedgehog is now passing up a berry *and a ring*. Back in the box it goes and I carefully wrap it so as not to shake the ring loose.\n\nChristmas Day comes, I go around to hers, give her mum a box of chocolates, have a drink with her family, then we go off to her room to swap gifts. She looks a little disappointed at the size of the box as it‚Äôs obviously too big for a ring, but I tell her to be careful opening it, which she does. Initially her reaction upon seeing the picture on the box is ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs cute.‚Äù so I tell her to take it out and see it properly. Her response of ‚ÄúAww that‚Äôs swee..‚Äù gets cut off and turned to shrieks of happiness when she sees the ring.\n\nThe ring still sits in her jewellery box and the hedgehogs are on the bookshelf.\n\nThis shit *isn‚Äôt difficult*.

Just had this sudden realization in the middle of the deepepace trials.\n\nForgive me if anyone else has also realized this but I haven't seen anyone talk about this yet (so far) so I just wanna share my thoughts.\n\nThis memory is called \"Magnum Opus\", which if I'm not mistaken is latin for \"greatest work\" or \"masterpiece\". It's what we usually label something when it is considered a person's best work regardless of what it is.\n\nAt first thought, you would think that this refers to Sylus. That's what usually is with the title of the memories, it relates to the LI and whatever happens in the memories (e.g Zayne's Absolute Zeal, where he absolutely let himself go üëÄ or Rafayel's Your Fragrance, which he goes crazy over the pheromone perfume thing)\n\nBut then in the trailer, Sylus says \"If you were also an art piece, then whoever created you must have loved you dearly.\"\n\nThen it hits me: Sylus is not the Magnum Opus here, YOU ARE. He might've not taken part in your creation (it doesn't matter if this means MC or you, the player), but he considers you as the best. Yes he has Onychinus, the twins, even Mephisto, but you are the Magnum Opus. The most important of all.\n\n\n",

When he's finished braiding he says something like, \"tada, my magnum opus!\" And it's about her hair, but it's not. The MC also gets the impression that he isn't just talking about the braid. \n\nIn a way Sylus did create her. As the fiend he moulded and cherished her, turning her into a dragon like him. As he did she became not only his most precious treasure, but his everything. His magnum opus. She saw him when no one else looked past his horns and tail. She looked past the face he showed the world to see who he was beneath. She loved him with that face, even more so because the horns and tail felt familiar to her for reasons she didn't understand until he was gone. He created her, but she also created him, a dragon that hated the world because he could see the beauty in it but could only admire it from afar. \n\n\nHe became her freedom to choose whatever life she wanted and she became all the beauty, love and companionship that he wanted but couldn't find for over 1600 years. Neither Sylus, nor the MC, would be the people they are (whether or not she remembers how they met) without the other. Sylus particularly will never forget the girl who saw him as a young dragon and loved him when the rest of the world feared him and so locked him away. Whether it's as a dragon or the boss of onychinus, Sylus is misunderstood by everyone around him. He's a green flag masquerading as a red one and the entire world is colour blind, except the MC.",

A headache can be unpleasant or make it hard to concentrate - a migraine can make it feel like you are being stabbed through the eyes by LIGHT, and sounds like a truck going by or somebody eating crunchy food can sound/feel like being next to a jackhammer. Smells - lord, smells. Some people are just naturally more sensitive to smells, but even if you aren't, think about sometime you walked by somebody in a store that smelled like they took a bath in perfume or Axe Body Spray - that's how fragrances can smell to some of us like all the time. \n\nYour foundation and blush probably have fragrance in it - it's probably mild enough not to bother your sister. Clearasil or similar face cleansers are probably the same, but be flexible and use a different bathroom if she objects to them. Most shampoos and conditioners, any scented lotions, and certainly any essential oils - those you should probably box up or toss. On the bright side, most have a pretty long shelf life, so if you're planning on going to college or moving out in the next year or two, they'll probably be fine to sit til then.",

Even Jenluvs reviews and Gotheimisa covered new evidence that fragrance does massive amounts of harm to the skin (pore-clogging, aging).  Going scent-free actually means investing in GOOD skincare, not crap skincare that's overpriced (companies also use fragrance to cover up the bad scent of expired products!).  Now point two, as a migraine sufferer, THIS IS REAL.  They can get bad to the point of dropping out of school, they can kill a career, they can destroy your social life.  Nobody actively chooses to have migraines just to be a pain in the ass.  However, if you want to continue to use your products, use them spaced out in your room.  When you layer on essences you should be waiting about 10 min between each layer.  You can put on sheet masks in your bedroom too.  To me, a migraine sufferer AND a skincare freak, it really sounds like you don't know how to use the products, or what products to use.  In other words: tossing out the scented stuff would be BETTER for your skin as (again) scented products DAMAGE the skin.  You should also probably read some skincare books and blogs prior to investing money again.  If not you'll get ripped off again.",

For background, a well-meaning family member bought me a very high dollar amount Keihl's gift card after I mentioned I wanted to get more serious about skincare. \n\nI did a consult with a very nice gentleman who gave me advice on which products to pick and let me know that I don't need some 12-step routine to have good skin. I just need to find what works. I walked out with quite a few things and was excited to try them.\n\nAlmost every comment on my \"shelfie\" was tbat I wasted money, I wouldn't like the products, they have fragrance so they're awful, it'd make my skin worse, and SEVERAL people saying that I should throw it all away. \n\nNow, this feedback did prompt me to look more into skincare ingredients, what they do, how they work, what should be avoided, etc. And research is always good. But I just spent this very generous gift card, so I wasn't going to let it go to waste.\n\nAlmost a year later, I couldn't be happier with my skin. I learned (thanks to this sub!) that pores are okay and never going to go away, the \"wrinkles\" under my eyes that have been there since I was a teen are perfectly natural, and having occasional breakouts on my period doesn't mean I have \"bad skin\". I also learned that I don't have dry skin like I always thought I did - I just wasn't exfoliating. These are all things I learned lurking on here!\n\nI am very happy with my routine  - it still consists of mostly Keihl's items, some that I repurchased after completing and some new ones. My point is that if I had listened to everyone telling me I'd hate it and decided to give it away or return the items, I probably would have been very disheartened and wouldn't have taken my skincare seriously. I'm very happy that I ignored some users - but a lot can still be learned from some knowledgeable people!\n\nTake the advice on this sub with a grain of salt because it won't all be relevant to you. The people here can sometimes get pretentious, but by far more people are just here to help and offer advice which may or may not work for you!",

    "body": "My trouble started when I realized I was out of razorblades and waxing supplies and my crotch looked like the Amazon rainforest before the mechanization of the logging industry. My date was due to arrive in half an hour. So, I resorted something unconventional. Something, I now realize, was not the best idea.\n\nI‚Äôm going to give a little backstory first. I‚Äôm not ashamed to say I enjoy sex. The widespread belief that a woman should suppress her sex drive because society finds it ‚Äúimproper‚Äù has always disgusted me. Sex is great. Safe sex is wonderful. I respect myself and I respect the men I sleep with. All I ask is that I receive the same respect in return. It‚Äôs just two people making each other happy.\n\nNow, I‚Äôve known this since I was 15. Two decades of positive experiences have only strengthened my feelings on the subject. That said, there are a few personal responsibilities I feel I have, such as keeping current with the shaving trends. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the concept behind shaving myself, to be honest. If you think about it, it‚Äôs actually kind of creepy, but I‚Äôll still admit I enjoy the sensation of hairlessness. I guess it‚Äôs a tradeoff. \n\nI prefer to shave, but I‚Äôve waxed myself a lot, too. I have to be careful, though, because I‚Äôm allergic to some of the waxes on the market. I don‚Äôt know what particular chemical or fragrance it is that causes the irritation, but the itchy rash it produces keeps the downstairs out of business for over a week while it clears up. No one wants to pull off a thong and see that staring them in the face.\n\nSo, back to the other day. I found something in the apartment I thought would work like wax, so I tried it out. It hurt like hell and was an absolute bitch to wash off, but it did the job. My date arrived when he said he would. We hit it off at dinner and we ended up back at my apartment, where we both managed to achieve orgasm despite being so full from our meals that we were like two beached whales slapping against one another. Since we both had to get up early the next morning, we said our goodnights and he went home.\n\nThe itching woke me up before dawn. It started with my armpits, but then moved to my, if I may use the medical terms, box and asshole. I got out of bed and went into the bathroom. The mirror confirmed my assumption: that damn allergic reaction again. Welts were forming in extremely sensitive areas and it looked like I was already getting a bunch of ingrown hairs. I braced myself and doused the affected areas in rubbing alcohol, hoping none of the ingrowns would get infected. I showered and scrubbed, then went back to bed. I still itched.\n\nWhen I got up to shower, the swelling looked pretty nasty and the ingrowns, despite my best efforts, were starting to get whiteheads. I got up and left for work. I sat in my cubicle feeling utterly miserable. The itching was way worse than any of the reactions I‚Äôd had before. When I got up to use the bathroom, I checked the damage.\n\nI almost threw up. A nearly perfect triangle of densely-clustered whiteheads occupied the entire area I‚Äôd waxed. Even worse, and this is going to be gross but there‚Äôs no real way to talk around it, they‚Äôd been popping the whole time I was sitting at my desk. My underwear was soaked. \n\nAfter cleaning myself up as best I could, I talked to my boss and told her I needed to leave early. She said it was no problem, so I left and headed straight to the walk-in clinic.\n\nI lucked out and got seen right away. The doctor raised her eyebrows to the ceiling when she saw the reaction I was having, but quickly reassured me that she sees people who get skin irritation from hair removal all the time. She gave me some kind of ointment to rub on it twice a day and said if it doesn‚Äôt improve in a week, she‚Äôd give me something stronger.\n\nI cancelled the date I had with the nice guy from the other night. I felt pretty bad, but he was understanding. He said was that he had to go on a business trip the next day and would be gone for a week. I told him that I looked forward to his return, assuming a week from then I‚Äôd be in the clear.\n\nSpoiler: I wasn‚Äôt.\n\nI applied the ointment diligently for a few days and most of the whiteheads stopped appearing. The swelling, though, persisted. Same with the itching. My armpits weren‚Äôt particularly bad, but my, well, perineum, and the surrounding area, was a disaster area. It was super swollen and it hurt to walk and use the bathroom.\n\nThe other night, six days after I‚Äôd seen the doctor, the itching turned to flat-out pain. It wasn‚Äôt unbearable, and if it had been, I would‚Äôve gone to the emergency room right away, but it was enough to keep me tossing and turning in bed. The clinic started seeing patients at 6am and I was planning to be the first person there when the doors opened.\n\nAs the night dragged on, I felt steadily-intensifying pressure on the affected area. It got bad. I scratched through my pajamas and felt small pops under my fingernails. When I pulled my hand away, my fingers were wet. I gagged. Off to the shower I went.\n\nBecause I like you guys, I‚Äôm not going to be as graphic as I could be. However, I can assure you this will be extraordinarily unpleasant to read. Before I jumped in the shower, I used my phone to take a quick picture of my perineal area. No, I won‚Äôt share it with you. But my God, I wish I hadn‚Äôt seen it. The small whiteheads in the area had clustered into a few very large ones. They bulged out of the skin almost half an inch and I knew right away that they were the cause of the pressure I was feeling.\n\nI deleted the picture, got in the shower, and squeezed the biggest one as hard as I could. Its contents splattered on the floor of the bathtub like a pasty spitball. I watched as the water washed away the gooey parts. I bent down to look at what remained, screamed at the top of my lungs, threw on my clothes, and drove myself to the hospital.\n\nDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm going to be fine. I got to speak to a lot of specialists, though; lots of smart doctors whose curiosity was obvious. They kept me there for a few hours and cleaned up my crotch and armpits pretty thoroughly. Then I was discharged with a bunch of medications and tasked to share a bit of hard-learned advice. So here it is!\n\nAlways make sure the skin you‚Äôre about to remove hair from is clean. Be mindful of the sharpness of your razor when shaving, and if waxing, do your best to avoid any chemicals you might be sensitive to. Stay away from depilatory products that haven‚Äôt been evaluated by the FDA. This includes, but is not limited to, creams, lasers, and waxes. \n\nFurther, homemade depilatory products are discouraged. That was my mistake. Well, one of two. No one should ever, ever use flypaper for hair removal, especially flypaper that‚Äôs not right out of the box. This is because no matter how clean it looks or how meticulously you picked the flies out of their sticky confines, they may leave pieces behind. In my case, those pieces were eggs.\n\n[More.](http://unsettlingstories.com/index)\n\n[f_](http://facebook.com/unsettlingstories)\n\n[r_](http://www.reddit.com/r/iia)\n\n",

    "body": "I received a peculiar invitation out of the blue by Jeffrey, an old college friend of mine from art school who I hadn‚Äôt heard from in quite a while. He claimed to be on the verge of something incredible related to composition, and begged me to, in his words, ‚Äúbear witness to history being made.‚Äù He gave an address and a time to meet, where he promised the drinks would flow and the food would be exquisite.\n\nJeffrey had been a smart and funny guy, he had always made me laugh with quick-as-a-whip responses and jokes. He was a composer; a piano player in the music program who‚Äôd been the most talented in his class. I‚Äôd followed his success after graduation; he was doing well for himself playing in the Symphony Orchestra and solo concerts as well. At any rate, I hadn‚Äôt heard from him in a while and he had me hooked with the ‚Äúhistory being made‚Äù talk, and free food and drink in the mix made for an easy ‚Äòyes‚Äô.\n\nI walked over to the wealthier part of town where the expensive condos and luxury apartments were and spotted his address. It was a new building; a modern design with large balconies, just a block from the park. I pressed the buzzer for apartment 4B, and after being buzzed in, rode the elevator up and walked down the hall to his apartment. His door was open, and the clamor of clinking glasses and soft conversation was spilling out into the hall.\n\nI took a step inside and smiled at the small cluster of people; five others who I didn‚Äôt recognize. I walked over to a table covered with assorted snacks and a few bottles of top-shelf liquor. I felt a bit awkward knowing nobody there, so I fixed a drink to embolden myself while I admired his chic apartment. Everything was brand new and spotless, and at the far end of the spacious interior, was a grand piano; polished to the point that it shimmered in the light of the afternoon sun.\n\n‚ÄúGlad you could make it, this means a lot to me,‚Äù Jeffrey‚Äôs voice took me by surprise, and I spun around to face him. His appearance took me aback. It was definitely Jeffrey that stood before me, but he looked so different than he had last time I‚Äôd seen him, and stranger than he appeared on the posters outside the convention center. \n\nHis eyes were sunken, his eyelids purple and thin. His pupils were so dilated I‚Äôd believe he was tripping on acid, and he stared with an odd intensity. He looked absolutely insane. \n\n‚ÄúMy pleasure, it‚Äôs been forever,‚Äù I said, taking his extended hand to shake it. His hand felt bony, like that of an elderly man. Had he gotten sick I wondered? Without any notice, Jeffery plucked a champagne flute from the table and tapped a butter knife against the side, ringing out to silence the murmurs of his gathered guests. Jeffrey rotated his head to stare into the eyes of the patrons. He walked in front of the expensive piano and faced us; unbuttoning the bottom button of his blazer in anticipation of sitting at the instrument. He looked manic; eyes bulging as he spoke with an intensity that made me uncomfortable.\n\n‚ÄúErik Satie, Robert Schumann, Bed≈ôich Smetana and Hans Rott all sought it out. A myth, a theory, a legend, and little else but vapors through the past few centuries. An elusive rumor occasionally whispered about after concerts. All of these composers sought out Zimic‚Äôs method. The specific combination of notes that comprise music‚Äôs most elusive and magnificent composition; The God Chord.‚Äù\n\nJeffrey extended his open palms, revealing his bony fingers as he continued.\n\n‚ÄúVienna, 1780. In the outer Vorstadts, a young composer named Valentin Zimic claimed to have awoken from a dream in which he learned there is a melodic tether to God. It was a conduit; an open resonance so beautiful and awe-inspiring that it would open the doorway to heaven itself. Zimic spent his life trying to figure out the specific combination of notes before going mad and vanishing without a trace at the age of 24.‚Äù\n\nJeffrey paused, a disturbingly wide grin taking form as he exposed his teeth.\n\n‚ÄúLadies and gentlemen, I have unlocked the secrets of the sought-after holy grail of composition. I have discovered the God Chord.‚Äù\n\nAfter a few seconds of hushed whispers, people began to clap, and I joined in. This was not what I had anticipated at all, but I was thoroughly intrigued, despite my concern for Jeffrey‚Äôs well-being. I watched in bewilderment as a group of five men and five women entered the room. All were wearing white choir robes and were carrying music stands; clearly professional acquaintances of his. Jeffery handed each of them a single sheet of music, and I could make out the ‚Äòpiece‚Äô on a few of the pages as he did so. On every page was a staff containing one single note.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs begin,‚Äù Jeffery said as he took a seat at the piano. \n\nThree of the singers hummed out a resonant melody that struck a deep awe within me. Their voices loudened, and the others joined in slowly. With every added note, the complexity grew and the melody truly did inspire some deep-rooted feeling of divinity. It was hauntingly beautiful, but once all the voices had joined in, something felt off. \n\nI felt dizzy, my vision swimming before me. I smelled lavender, an overwhelming fragrance that appeared out of nowhere. I rested a hand on the table to secure myself as that chord seemed to shift. The same notes were being sung by the choir, yet the sounds of those notes seemed to change in a way that raised every hair on my body. It warped into a cacophony that tingled my spine from the strange beauty it inspired. Then, Jeffery raised his bony hands in the air and wiggled his fingers in a show of anticipation. The room seemed to be pulsing as if it was breathing. I felt a gnawing terror in the back of my head, but I was entranced by the unearthly sound those trained voices were making. And then Jeffrey pounded the piano‚Äôs keys with precision, holding them there to extend the sound.\n\nThe next moments happened in slow motion. Adrenaline surged throughout my body. I felt a warm dribble under my nose and saw droplets of red on my shoes. When I looked up, The choir stood there, emitting the shifting notes but they were not singing them. They were screaming. Rivulets of blood cascaded down their chins from their eyes and nose. The soundscape was horrific yet perfect at the same time; impossible to describe.\n\nIn the peripheral of my vision, I saw things flailing about. Whip-like appendages and multiple sets of inhuman eyes. Wide, watching orbs, forming in clusters on bodies that were not there before: bodies of wrinkled, grey skin the color of slate, and the texture of coral. The smell of lavender had shifted to a septic stench, one of rot and bodily waste, and then the coppery stink of blood. I looked over to the other guests and screamed louder.\n\nViscera was everywhere. A man and a woman were foraging in the split belly of a man who moaned with pleasure while wiping his bloody hands on his face. Another well-dressed guest in a suit with a graying beard was laughing as he dug into his own eye sockets with his thumbs; spilling the pulpy gore down to stain his facial hair. Jeffrey was still at the piano, but now he was rhythmically bashing his head forward on the top edge. In the red stream that dripped down to the keys and onto the floor were white chips of what appeared to be bone. \n\nI don‚Äôt know how I got out of there. Maybe I was just lucky to be closest to the door. Maybe that severe ear infection I had as a kid was a factor. I stumbled into the hall, vomiting a splash of crimson blood onto the carpet and I slammed open the door and fell into the stairwell before losing consciousness.\n\nI was found by the paramedics who arrived after the calls started coming in. At some point, Jeffrey had leaped off his balcony in a swan dive. Every guest and performer in that apartment had torn themselves to pieces. Yet that music did not stop.\n\nThat unholy chord plays in my mind every moment. Every single day that bizarre tone swirls in my mind like a permanent stain. Sleep offers no escape, my nightmares crawl with horrors from the place that sound brought us to, a place too dark to fathom. Jeffrey was right. That arrangement of tones did open a window to a god. Just not the one we were [hoping to meet](https://www.reddit.com/user/mrmichaelsquid/).",

    "body": "She smiled like a movie star, and my stomach squirmed with revulsion.\n\nAfter a moment, though, the feeling was gone. It left me dazed, and she had to repeat herself. \n\n‚ÄúDid you need anything else, honey?‚Äù she asked. The words dripped off her lips like syrup.\n\n*Did* I need something else? \n\nWhy was I even here in the first place?\n\nMy thoughts were hard to access through the heavy curtain of fog that had begun to enshroud them the moment I‚Äôd driven through the city limits of the small, nothing town. \n\nI had wound up here after taking a wrong turn on a long stretch of road in the Texas backcountry that seemed to be completely barren of anything useful‚Äîmost importantly gas stations.\n\nOh, *that‚Äôs* why I was here. I needed gas. \n\n‚ÄúGas,‚Äù I said blankly. ‚ÄúI need gas.‚Äù\n\nShe smiled that smile again. It reminded of the way the wax celebrity statues at Madame Tussaud‚Äôs smiled.\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôve already got gas, honey,‚Äù she said. \n\n‚ÄúRight,‚Äù I said, and for a fleeting moment a thought cut through the fog in my mind like a high-beam headlight.\n\n*Get out of here. Right. Now.*\n\nBut she flashed that southern belle smile and the thought suddenly vanished.\n\n‚ÄúSay, you don‚Äôt look so good, honey,‚Äù she said. \n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo sir, not at all. You look ‚Äòbout ready to faint.‚Äù\n\nI *did* feel a little unsteady.\n\n‚ÄúNot to worry, though,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI know just what you need. A good, stout meal of some southern home-cooking should set your head on straight.‚Äù\n\nMy leg twitched, and for an absurd moment I envisioned myself breaking into a sprint, slamming through the glass doors and running until my legs couldn‚Äôt carry me anymore.\n\nThe woman‚Äôs periwinkle eyes seemed to grow just a bit around the edges, and I realized that would be rude. \n\n*You can‚Äôt turn down a free dinner, Darren. That‚Äôs just not polite.*\n\nThe voice in my head was my own, but it seemed to have a slight southern twang.\n\n*What a charming accent.*\n\n‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThat would be wonderful.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNow there‚Äôs a sharp fella.‚Äù She winked at me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ‚Äòbout time to close up the shop, anyway. What do you say we knock off early and head to my place My mother would just love to meet you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes, of course,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to meet her too.‚Äù\n\nShe came around the counter and took me by the arm. As she led me outside my head gave a twang of pain. Boy, but it sure was *bright* today.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôll take your car,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt just won‚Äôt do to leave it sitting out at the pumps all summer.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo, of course.‚Äù \n\nI dug into my pockets and handed her my keys. \n\n***\n\nThe next thing I remember I was sitting in her dining room. Arranged on the table was the most splendid feast I‚Äôve ever seen: thick cuts of honeyed ham, wide rashers of bacon still sizzling with grease, creamy mashed potatoes that wafted the most delicious smell of garlic and butter, and so much more. \n\nThe fragrance was overpowering, savory and sweet and saliva-inducing. There was a strange smell underneath it all though‚Äîrotting meat orÔºü‚Äî\n\n‚ÄúHave some ham, dear,‚Äù the woman‚Äôs mother said, proffering a plate piled high with the meat, honey glaze glistening enchantingly in light from the silver candelabra that sat at the center of the table.\n\nThe mother smiled just like her daughter, and although she must have been in her sixties, there was something undeniably magnetic, seductive even, about her.\n\n‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam, thank you.‚Äù\n\nI took the plate and set it down in front of me. It looked so delicious‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt wait to dig in. The first bite was halfway to my mouth when my hand froze.\n\nSome not quite conscious part of my brain caught a note of that hidden scent again, mouthwatering, yet sickening and cloyingly sweet all at once.\n\nMy stomach squirmed, and I felt a sudden urge to vomit.\n\n‚ÄúI think I‚Äôd better go.‚Äù The words slipped out of my mouth without forethought.\n\nI pushed myself up out of my chair, and the daughter laid a coaxing hand on my chest, and then suddenly snapped it back as if she‚Äôd been burned. \n\nThere *was* something burning. It felt like a white-hot wire against my chest. I reached into my shirt and yanked it away, and felt it singe the flash of my hand. I stared dumbly down at the crucifix in my palm‚Äîmy grandmother‚Äôs. \n\nA deeply religious woman, she had had it blessed in Rome and insisted I wear it whenever I traveled so that I might, in her words, be protected.\n\nNow, it was glowing red with heat.\n\n‚ÄúOh honey,‚Äù the daughter said. ‚ÄúThat looks terribly painful. Why don‚Äôt you put it down?‚Äù\n\n*Yes, I should put it down. It‚Äôs burning my hand.*\n\nI looked up at the daughter to see her smiling, but her grin was a little too wide. It reminded of a wolf baring its teeth. Yet her eyes were transfixing.\n\nThey seemed to be growing wider and wider, like bottomless wells. I could feel myself being drawn into them. It was almost too late when I saw her mother creeping around the side of the table with a carving knife.\n\nI gripped the burning crucifix and my arm went rigid like I‚Äôd stuck a fork into a wall outlet. It moved on its own, slamming the crucifix into the old woman‚Äôs forehead. \n\nShe shrieked, a ragged, throaty wail that turned my insides into a bucket of oily worms. Her mouth shrunk back around teeth that seemed impossibly large.\n\nLarge, and oh so very sharp.\n\nI felt a searing pain in my shoulder and I swiveled to see the daughter had sunk her teeth into me. Her jaw was dislocated like a snake‚Äôs. I slammed the crucifix into the top of her head, and her hair burst into flames. \n\nUndaunted, I thrust the crucifix into her skull over and over again, until I felt it crack beneath my blows, and her jaw‚Äôs grip around my shoulder slackened. She stumbled backwards and collapsed into a heap in the corner. \n\nHer skin was dripping off her bones like melted wax, sizzling and smoking as it dropped to the floor. The old woman was already gone, a pile of ashes spilled out of her empty clothes. \n\nWith a final, ear-shattering scream, the daughter exploded into a ball of fire. The ball collapsed in on itself, leaving nothing but a scorch mark behind.\n\nI heard buzzing to my right side, and looked toward the table. Where moments before there had been a feast, were chipped plates piled high with rotting meat, flies buzzing all around.\n\nFeeling half-drunk, I stumbled out of the house. What I saw outside stole away whatever scraps remained of my courage.\n\nTrembling, I bolted to my own car and jammed the key into the ignition. My tires screamed as I hit the throttle and drove.  \n\nI glanced in the rearview mirror only once. The house loomed in the darkness like an evil idol, and all around it were the decaying, rusted remains of hundreds of cars. \n\n[X](http://Reddit.com/r/lifeisstrangemetoo)",

It is mineral oil plus fragrance, and that's it. \n\nIt is NOT a safe lubricant to use:\n- in conjunction with latex (breaks down the latex)\n- inside mucosal tissues like a vag or an anus, as it can cause infections and reactions\n\nIf you like how it behaves on your body skin after showering (locks in fresh moisture,) then have at it. Note that it also clogs up pores (it's not breathable,) so most people find it too harsh for face moisturizing. \n\nHope this helps. ",

    "body": "[I live in a place named Tattletoe, a place full of mystery.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gfygt1/when_the_town_smells_like_cinnamon_you_know/) Where death smells like cinnamon and life smells like nutmeg. Everything here is in perfect symmetry. One portion of fear and one portion of happiness fed to the ideal obedient citizen. Perfectly balanced to ensure that the people who live here will do their work for the greater good. What kind of greater good? That‚Äôs something only the committee members know. It‚Äôs just all a big hoax if you ask me, but let‚Äôs be real here, nobody asks. \n\nIt‚Äôs not simply the fact that they are afraid to die. Of course, nobody believes that they will be the ones being punished. Ignorance can work wonders. And as long as the fear doesn‚Äôt override the happiness, there is no need to change anything. As I said, life here can be pretty perfect. Although it does ask of some degree of discipline to be surrounded by all these wonderful goods, while not being allowed any.\n\nHonestly smelling the wonderful creations of Mrs. Holly each day is probably what made me doubt our ways the most. How can they ask me to be surrounded by the most delicious things in the world but forbid me to have a taste? My mouth starts drooling just thinking about it. Sometimes I even dream about her pain au chocolat made with the richest dark chocolate I‚Äôve ever seen. It straight out smells like pure luck. I haven‚Äôt been able to stop thinking about the lemon bars we made the other day. The way Mrs. Holly slowly spread the zest of those bright yellow lemons over the hot and luscious bars. The lemons come from one of the many lemon trees of Tattletoe. Most of the fruits are being exported to some nearby towns but a few of them are sent to the bakery to be turned into sweet treats. The gardeners here must be very talented, the citrus fruits shine even brighter than the flowers.  No wonder Mrs. Holly wore gloves as she prepared them. Oh and don‚Äôt even get me started on the cupcakes she made! I would die for trying just one of these marvelous goods. \n\nWell, I would *literally* die if I did. \n\n\\--\n\nWith a broken hand I wasn‚Äôt much use to Mrs. Holly. I would mostly just bring her more flour from the shelf or turn on the ovens. Work had gotten awfully boring but I kept coming each morning before sunrise. I would put on my apron and sit on the chair waiting for Mrs. Holly to give me a new task. A lot of times we just chatted and drank tea. I couldn‚Äôt believe my luck. Especially after hearing what kind of jobs some of my neighbor kids were assigned to. \n\nMagnolia Marble started working in the doll store. A place run by an older gentleman who single-handedly creates each and every single doll which in turn is being exported to children all over the world. I don't like going in there much, the place smells like chlorine and the dolls are probably the only products that I never wanted to own or even hold in my hands. They are the creepiest thing I've ever seen and I‚Äôve been around a good portion of bizarre stuff. The resemblance they have with an actual human child is uncanny. You might be wondering what Magnolia has to do in the shop if the dollmaker is the only one in charge of production. Well, she has to go around town and collect items to make the dolls as realistic as possible. One of her jobs is collecting hair or other necessary parts. If she finds some hair in the barber places she is lucky. She only has to pick them from the ground. Unfortunately the hairs often belong to adults and are too thick and splintered for a doll. So often she will knock on doors of parents, mainly the ones with many children. As you might imagine, parents are not often happy with that but if she doesn‚Äôt find enough hair, the dollmaker gets angry with her. Though if you look at it from the bright side, at least Magnolia never gets tempted to take any of the products she‚Äôs surrounded by. \n\nThe dollmaker uses those hairs, sometimes teeth, even nails but only the ones that are gentle and nice, and those are made into something I hope you never encounter in your life.\n\nIf you‚Äôve ever come across a doll that just made the hairs on your back turn, a doll that simply seemed to be radiating pure evil, a doll that made you question your own sense of sanity. Well, chances are it was produced in Tattletoe‚Äôs doll store. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\n‚ÄúDid you hear the news? Mrs. Musters is gonna have her child soon. It might even be born today!‚Äù I said towards Mrs. Holly who was preparing some sort of dough.\n\nThe moment those words left my mouth, Mrs. Holly‚Äôs metal whisk slipped from her hands and loudly hit the ground of the bakery. The batter was splashing everywhere. I quickly got up to pick up the whisk and clean up. Mrs. Holly didn‚Äôt move, for a good moment or two she just kept staring into the distance. She looked both scared and angry at the same time. Then I remembered how she had lost all her children and felt awful mentioning somebody else becoming a mother. This must be especially painful for her. And then she has to be the one who spreads the smell of nutmeg for the newborn. I can only imagine what kind of torture that must be. Thinking about it, I wondered how that tradition with nutmeg arose. I know she tries to overshadow the smell of death when she bakes something with cinnamon but there is no reason for overshadowing the smell of new life, right? It‚Äôs a celebration. \n\nMaybe it‚Äôs part of making the people happy. Nutmeg is in a lot of holiday dishes so maybe that‚Äôs why they like it. \n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I mumbled after cleaning up.\n\n‚ÄúOh?‚Äù Mrs. Holly shook her head like she was coming back to her senses ‚Äúwhy are you apologizing, child‚Äù she laughed. ‚ÄúThose are some wonderful news. A child, how lovely.‚Äù Her words were nice but the way she spoke made it sound incredibly insincere. \n\n‚ÄúHmm, my mum thought it was wonderful as well. She repeatedly set how the Musters‚Äô keep getting gifted. Guess because they already have like a dozen kids‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAnd they‚Äôre planning on having even more. Some people just can‚Äôt seem to get enough, can they?‚Äù Mrs. Holly said in a melodic voice. \n\n‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt think I want any children at all if I‚Äôm honest.‚Äù\n\nShe smiled at me with that sad expression she had when she broke my hand.\n\n‚ÄúYou know what this means though, Deborah? We will need to get baking! Will you be a dear and go down to the market to get us nutmeg? As many seeds as you can get your hands on. Stress that they are needed for the bakery! From the looks of Mrs. Musters she might even be expecting twins. I was thinking of making some gingerbread men, how does that sound?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúSounds nice but it isn‚Äôt Christmas, where will they be exported to?‚Äù I asked.\n\n‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt export them. They are for the fresh parents,‚Äù she responded. \n\nI wasn‚Äôt sure if I could ask but this did sound very strange. I started furrowing my brow. Mrs. Holly caught my gaze and nervously laughed.\n\n‚ÄúI know what you‚Äôre thinking. Our baked goods are not made for the citizens of Tattletoe. There is one small exception though. New parents always receive many baskets full of gifts, good nobody else can get, including something made by me.‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\nI kept my purple apron on as I made my way to the market. Everything on the market was given away for free, those were the goods we were allowed to consume. However, some products were sparer than others and Mrs. Holly stressed how she needed as much nutmeg as possible. Having the apron would give me some more credibility. Everyone knew and respected Mrs. Holly‚Äôs bakery after all. \n\nThe market was particularly well visited that day. Townspeople of Tattletoe were walking from stall to stall, enjoying all the new items that were being presented. The market ranged from fine drinks to delicious food, toys for children, clothes, and anything else you might need.\n\nI didn‚Äôt stop at any of the usual stalls though, I was here on a mission. \n\n‚ÄúNutmeg or cinnamon?‚Äù the spice guy asked as I moved up to his stall. I guess he had noticed my apron.\n\n‚ÄúNutmeg‚Äù I exclaimed.\n\n‚ÄúThank god‚Äù he took a breath and laughed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm all out of cinnamon, people have been misbehaving a lil lately‚Äù he winked at me and handed me a small paper bag with some nutmeg.\n\n‚ÄúUhm, I don‚Äôt think this will be enough,‚Äù I said.\n\n‚ÄúThis is more than enough, girl! Too much nutmeg can make you all woozy goozy and if you have too much‚Ä¶ well then Mrs. Holly will need more cinnamon soon?‚Äù he jokingly said.\n\nI shrugged.\n\n‚ÄúMrs. Holly said I should get as much as possible. Apparently they‚Äôre having twins.‚Äù\n\nThe spice guy shook his head in disbelief as he packed up all the nutmeg he had.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\nMrs. Holly was baking all day. She had stopped the production of any other bread, cookies or cakes. Only gingerbread men were coming out of the oven. The ventiltion system was spreading the fragrance all over Tattletoe. The new Musker offspring was born that afternoon. \n\nMrs. Holly was right. They were twins. \n\nShe packed the gingerbread in a big beautiful basket and asked me to bring it to the Musters. On my way up to their house I met Magnolia and she asked to come along with me. She needed some hair.\n\n\"The Musters usually let me take as much as I want. Makes me feel even worse for those children but gotta do the job, you know?\" Magnolia said with a careless look on her face. Working at the doll store had toughened her up. She used to be my most optimistic friend.\n\n\"Why do you feel bad for the kids?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well, I've been in their home a couple times. Always made me wanna leave right away again. They are some of those folks that collect children for the perks.\"\n\n\"You mean the gifts?\"\n\n\"Uhu. Though I do get it. The stuff you get is so much better than anything they have at the market. Tattletoe‚Äôs way of making parents produce new kids..\" She had gotten a lot more skeptical as well. \n\n\"Ssht, Magnolia\" I whispered. \"don't get us in trouble.\"\n\n\"Come on, Debbie, this is like common knowledge. Nobody really wants to have children here, the ones that do are just heartless or don't know better.\"\n\nI got the idea that the Musters belonged to that first group when their father opened the door for us. His eyes went right to the basket and he pushed his five-year-old son away who was reaching for the gingerbread men. He laughed it off and opened the door wider up so we could walk right inside.\n\n\"Just drop it off on that table, love. Magnolia if you need anything, Joe's losing more teeth lately\"\n\n\"Just hair today, Mr. Musters. We have more than enough teeth at the moment.\" She shot me a disgusted look and walked upstairs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\nIt only took a few days. It hit Mr. Muster first. Nobody spoke of his death but I'm sure it was painful. Mrs. Musters followed him shortly after. I don't think their children were too sad though. From what I saw in their house that day, those kids hadn't seen happiness in a long time. Not with parents as greedy as theirs. I'm not sure if anyone is suspecting Mrs. Holly and her baked goods. I'm not even sure if the committee knows, or maybe they do but don't care. The Musters had made enough children already who would be having grandchildren, making sure the population was increasing.\n\nIt made me see Mrs. Holly in a new light though. This sweet old lady kept surprising me in new ways all the time, but at the same time she is still the most mysterious woman I know. I wondered whether she did it in spite. You could think that she did it because she lost all her children while those people had so many. But I know Mrs. Holly and that wouldn't be her style. She knows that she is tied to this town and she is coping with it in her own little way. Or at least that‚Äôs my interpretation, I wouldn‚Äôt dare to ask.\n\nThey tell us that there are happiness and fear and nothing in-between. In Tattletoe death smells like cinnamon and life smells like nutmeg but now I know that sometimes the fragrances get [mixed.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Likeeyedid/)\n\n[Life of an exporter](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gie844/the_people_in_my_hometown_produce_cursed_goods_im/)\n\n[Mr. V](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gkc3xe/the_head_of_our_town_is_craving_the_smell_of_death/)",

One of my friends (21f) dog passed away and her husband reached out to me to surprise her with a portrait of said dog, and knowing how much the dog meant to her I did it and even did it for free when the husband said he couldn't afford my rates. \n\n(For reference the size portrait he got would have cost $80 but would have been slightly more because he said he needed it in two days)\n\nShe sent me a message saying she loved it and thanked me.\n\nI was going to make perfume last Saturday but found out that the bottle my fragrance oil was in had cracked and I had lost the whole thing which I was pretty sad about. My friend also makes perfumes so I sent her a message asking if I could borrow a few drops of her peppermint fragrance oil (I didn't need a lot and she is on my street). She said not unless I paid her $40 for the bottle even if I was only using a few drops, I was confused because the oil online only costs $25 and I only needed a small amount I just didnt want to wait the 2 weeks delivery. She said she added a 'nuisance fee' because it was her only day off. I thanked her and said don't worry about it.\n\nShe contacted me last night to see if she could get a portrait done of her other dog so it could match the other one. I said this one she had to pay for and that I couldn't do it for free. She got really really mad and I got a message from her husband a few minutes later asking why I was being cheap and that she was still upset about her other dog passing away.\n\nI got called TA when I didn't even offer 'mate rates' but said she would need to pay for it in full\n\nEDIT: to clarify the perfume - you use Fractionated coconut oil (simply put - it doesn't harden depending on temperature, it stays liquid) and three drops of fragrance as it has no scent naturally. I didn't understand why I had to pay nearly twice the cost if the 50ml bottle for three drops. I offered $5 and she declined which she is allowed to do. I was being petty, I agree. But I don't like being used and that's the way it came across\n\nEDIT:portrait I did is on my profile if you wish to see if it's worth the money I usually ask\n\nEDIT: she and her husband have now blocked me and have written a nasty fb post about me, part of me is upset but the trash took itself out.\n\nEDIT - I'm not taking more commissions sorry to everyone who has DM me. I love you guys but rip my phone",

    "body": "I posted this as a comment and some people told me to post it here. This happened to my mom.\n\nMy parents live in a big house with an amazing garden. My mom is an agro engineer and really cares about her plants. When we moved there it was almost a desert and she put a lot of effort to make plants grow beautifully. The house has a direct entrance to the garden on the left part, so there's a wall like 13m tall, then it goes down to 5m and then again up to 8m. 10 years ago my mom talked to the neighbor if there was no problem with them setting a wiring where the wall is 5m tall so my mom could make climbing plants grow. The neighbor was really happy with the idea because a green wall would make the view more appealing and it will also give the two houses more privacy. So she put a 3m tall wiring, some ampelopsis and also two different types of climbing jasmines. The neighbor was delighted that in summer he could enjoy the sweet fragrance of the flowers. Win win for both!\n\nWell the neighbor died and his son sold the house and the new owner built a 3 floors apartment complex there. After some months the new neighbor started complaining with my mom about the climbing plants. He wanted her to cut them off. Remember the wall's height, cutting the green wall off with a 3 floor building next to them meant total privacy invasion. The harassment to get rid of the plants became unbearable.... God protects this man because NOBODY wants to mess with my mom, especially when it comes to her plants.\n\nSo, my mom cut all the plants off, talked to an architect, talked to the municipality to get the permission and built a wall. He was SO pissed and when he confronted my mom, she showed him the permission and told him \"I cut them off like you asked for, now you're not going to have problems with the plants any more\".\n\nOf course, she made the plants grow again and she has her beautiful green wall again. And the neighbor has now a beautiful concrete monster in front of the windows. Then we learned that the building wasn't authorized by the municipality, so an 8m wall doesn't sound that bad after all.\n\nEdit: so everyone understands. My parents' house is between two buildings, something like [this](https://forgotten-ny.com/2016/04/little-house-that-could-kingsbridge-heights/). The 13m wall is the right side of the building in the front, the 8m wall is the right side of the building in the back and the 5m wall is the wall/fence between my parents' and the neighbor's garden. Like in the photo of the link, the house is touching with the building on the right side. On the left side tha garden goes like a flipped L, like [this](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7GQMEYw0VVI/XlUph0co45I/AAAAAAABWpM/IMuatKsLFN8n6C3Q4X2uXy4-53x1t1QWACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/ccasachorizoplano.png). I hope it's easier now üòÖ",

Living Room. Local Time: 12:15 Hours.**\n\n**Thalmin**\n\nDread, fear, panic, and anxiety‚Ä¶ all of these emotions threatened to rush to the surface with the unbridled ferocity of a berserker out of mana.\n\nDread, for the sudden disappearance of a peer in all but name.\n\nFear, for the consequences that will inevitably follow.\n\nPanic, for the abrupt disruption of a straightforward plan.\n\nAnxiety, for the potential of failure, and the ramifications of that failure on those around me; those that I have promised nothing short of a complete victory.\n\nA second was all it took for these thoughts and emotions to surface, and a second more was all that was needed for those very thoughts to take root.\n\nI couldn‚Äôt give them that chance.\n\nIt was just not the Havenbrockian way.\n\nThe proving dens had taught me better than to succumb to the whims of the runt-born heart.\n\nIt taught me the importance of controlling one‚Äôs emotions, and the difference confidence and stoicism made between life and death.\n\nFrom the battlefield, to the banquet table, and the maprooms of the Great Hall; this rule had kept the Havenbrockian house afloat and slicing through the waves of challenges we faced.\n\nThis *situation* was no different.\n\nIn fact, if anything, it called for an adherence to the lessons of the proving dens; as I called upon feelings of anger and frustration to temper the encumbering emotions that threatened to plague me.\n\nUltimately though, all this boiled down to one thing: I couldn‚Äôt fail Thacea or Emma.\n\nNot when the issue at hand was barely an issue at all, if it wasn‚Äôt for the Academy‚Äôs vague threats of draconian punishment.\n\n*Alright.* I began taking a deep, growl-ridden breath.\n\n*Action is the ward to indecision. So* ***act***.\n\n*HUFFFFF HUFFFFF*\n\nI took a deep breath, this time not out of frustration, but practicality.\n\nFor I had one final card to play, a gift of the lupinor heritage that would take over from where my eyes and mana-perception had both failed.\n\n*SNIFF SNIFF SNIFF*\n\nI still had my keen sense of smell to rely on.\n\nThe world around me practically lit up in a dizzying array of scents. This was where noble sensibilities born out of the Nexian reformations clashed with the intrinsic nature of Lupinor heritage.\n\nThe Nexian Reformations claimed that the measure of one‚Äôs civility was determined by the distance one placed between the animal and the person. Etiquette and the social decorum that followed was thusly determined by how far one distances themselves from what the Nexians considered as *animal-like* behaviors.\n\nCivilization was, after all, the testament of the triumph of the mind over the desires of the flesh. And to be civilized meant the adherence to that which delineates the person from the animal: culture.\n\nOur keen sense of smell, our ancestral drive for the hunt based on scent alone, was simply incompatible with this worldview.\n\nBut when the choice was to do or to not, with the latter being arbitrary and the former being innately useful‚Ä¶ then there was no choice to be made at all.\n\nThat was lesson 394 from the proving grounds, courtesy of my uncle.\n\nAnd it would quickly prove to be a valuable lesson for the present.\n\nFor within the scents, I was quickly becoming familiarized to within this domicile: the distinct fragrance of the fresh linens, the nutty earthiness of the venerable furniture, and the‚Ä¶ lizardness of the blue-scaled lizard, there was something *new* here that just did not belong. Something new that was incredibly subtle, strangely so, but that hit me hard the moment I started focusing.\n\nIt was the smell of acrid pungency, one that tickled my nose with what felt like bits and pieces of coarse dust that was invisible to the naked eye.\n\nIt was the undeniable smell of *smoke*, and the distinct sensation of *ash*.\n\nA renewed surge of confidence took over me, as I felt my heart suddenly *pumping* with a renewed vigor. My pupils dilated, and my whole body felt **ready** to surge forward at a moment‚Äôs notice.\n\nI was now, well and truly, on the *hunt*.\n\nKeeping my eyes peeled, and my mana-perception open, I moved swiftly to the source of this foreign smell.\n\nThis led me to a pile of refuse that was the Vunerian‚Äôs secondary *nest*, a mish-mash of soft bed covers, pillows, stuffed caricatures, and other such garbage. I made short work of this, peeling back layer after layer before I was hit with the source of that acrid scent.\n\nIt was a letter.\n\nOr rather, *was* a letter.\n\nOne that had been completely incinerated by the Vunerian‚Äôs breath.\n\nI couldn‚Äôt make heads or tails of it, not without a restoration spell, which was the kind of subject matter that was taught at the Academy and *not* common knowledge.\n\nSo I kept searching for clues.\n\nThis eventually brought me to one of the room‚Äôs cabinets, over on the Vunerian‚Äôs side of the domicile. It was here that I found another burned letter.\n\nThis one, however, was only *partially* burned.\n\n‚ÄúMandatory‚Ä¶ assembly‚Ä¶ announcement‚Ä¶ attendance is‚Ä¶‚Äù I didn‚Äôt need to see the rest of it to confirm what it was.\n\nThere was no doubt about it.\n\nThis was definitely the letter the insipid apprentice blocking the library was talking about.\n\nWhich meant Ilunor must have seen the letter, before purposefully setting it ablaze.\n\nSo I continued searching, once more relying on scent alone to trace the origin of all of this acrid smoke.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt hard to do.\n\nThe blue thing‚Äôs little *demonstration* of nothing but soot-breath at the night of Emma‚Äôs weapons inspection had given me more than enough to work with.\n\nSo with that memory fresh in mind, and the very strong reminders of that particular *scent* still present in the air, I began tracing the room.\n\nHe *must* have been close, if not still in the room itself.\n\nI could *smell* the source getting closer and closer. Each step leading to increasingly intensified *soot-breath*.\n\nThis meant the lizard *must* be here, in spite of my inability to sense the presence of his mana-field.\n\nI couldn‚Äôt say whether or not that was a result of my own inadequacies in mana-field tracking, or the lizard‚Äôs inherent talents in mana-field masking.\n\nPerhaps the truth lay somewhere in the middle.\n\nEither way, the sheer *lack* of *anything* in the mana-streams wasn‚Äôt at all normal. Barring Emma, or a wizard of higher standing like one of the professors, mana-field masking such as this was simply unheard of.\n\nAnd yet here I was, getting closer and closer towards what my nose told me was the source of all of this wanton use of magical fire.\n\nThe scent eventually took me to the second-floor loft of the domicile, one which circled the entire perimeter of the room. It was here that the ashen sensation tickling my nose dissipated, replaced instead with an increasingly *thick* acridity that grew and grew until finally‚Ä¶ I passed it.\n\nI‚Äôd passed the point of maximal intensity without *seeing* anything out of the ordinary.\n\nBacktracking by a good few feet, I began honing in on the *specific* point of maximal intensity, bringing me to a walk-in closet right across from the Vunerian‚Äôs bed. One of the two we‚Äôd split between us.\n\nI began opening up my mana field even *more* now, pushing, pulling, tugging against the latent currents‚Ä¶ and yet‚Ä¶ there was nothing.\n\nNo signs of life.\n\nNot even a *hint* of a soul.\n\nAnd yet, I could *smell* the pungent smoke, all while being unable to actually *smell* the Vunerian *anywhere*.\n\nSo with all of these conflicting senses, with only the lupinor in me *screaming* that we‚Äôd finally found him, I gave in. I put faith in my lupinor heritage, and *SLAMMED* the double-doors to the walk-in-closet open with such force that I could feel the wood *buckling* under the strain.\n\nIt was there that I was *hit* with several things at once.\n\nFirst, my mana-streams were suddenly *inundated* by the overwhelming presence of another soul. This, after increasing my sensitivities to the ebbs and flows of the streams, was as close to sensory overload as was possible.\n\nSecond, my eyes *barely* caught a glimpse of something *blue* zipping across my peripheral vision, having literally entered into existence without so much as a footstep.\n\nAnd third, I suddenly *felt* something *impacting* against my armored belly, eliciting a loud *GONG* that resonated loudly across the room, before the inevitable pained high-pitched screams a lizard quickly followed.\n\n‚ÄúDid you *really* think that would work?‚Äù I shouted with a frustrated growl, before deftly *picking* the small thing up under both of his arms like an incessant pup.\n\nThis of course, resulted in what I could only describe as a rabid-response from the Vunerian who began *thrashing* in place, to little effect.\n\n‚ÄúShut up!‚Äù I *barked* out, causing the Vunerian to finally lose his grip on *something* he had held in his paws up to this point.\n\nIt was a piece of unassuming cloth, what looked to be a *blanket* of all things, that floated to the ground unceremoniously prompting the little thing to reach for it with all of his might.\n\n‚ÄúWhat in the hell‚Äôs wrong with you, Ilunor?!‚Äù I continued, and unlike the Vunerian who clearly had his priorities mixed up, I began pressing the issue of our time-sensitive predicament. ‚ÄúLord Rularia, we have but *minutes* to spare before you and *you* alone risk compromising the integrity of our peer group! Do you understand that?!‚Äù\n\nThat warning, perhaps because of its sheer delivery, was enough to get the Vunerian back to his senses as he finally hung limp in my grip. ‚ÄúPut. Me. Down. Right this *instant*.‚Äù Ilunor seemed to *finally* come to his senses again. His request however, was laden with risk, despite being the most socially acceptable thing to do at this point in time.\n\n‚ÄúAre you going to scamper away again?‚Äù I asked threateningly through a series of growls.\n\n‚ÄúNo.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDo I have your *word*, *Lord* Rularia?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes.‚Äù\n\nWith little way of eye contact, I finally put the blue thing down, who promptly *grabbed* that piece of fabric before using a spell to simply shrink the thing into one of his many pockets.\n\nThe minor lord took a few short seconds to brush himself down, deliberately averting his gaze from my own once again, as something within me could tell that something was off with the Vunerian. So many pieces of this puzzle just didn‚Äôt add up. I didn‚Äôt know where to begin‚Ä¶ but considering the fact that we were pressed for time, I had little in the way of talk before we needed to depart right then and there. ‚ÄúLord Rularia, would you mind telling me just *why* it is you were purposefully hiding from this mandatory engagement?‚Äù I asked simply, biting straight through the fat and into the meat of things.\n\nThe small thing refused to respond, as he only looked away with sullen, almost *resigned* eyes.\n\nIt was an expression I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever recalled seeing from the Vunerian up to this point.\n\n‚ÄúWell?‚Äù I urged. ‚ÄúWhat-‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI need you to make me a promise, Prince Thalmin Havenbrock.‚Äù The small thing finally spoke. And this time, there was no grandstanding or measures of pretense. There was no excessively vitriolic response in an attempt to mask or hide another agenda, what I *knew* was a facade of a front to distract and redirect. There were only the first inklings of a more‚Ä¶ dare I say it‚Ä¶ *earnest* Ilunor. ‚ÄúI am willing to proceed with this *unnecessary* engagement, I am‚Ä¶ *willing* to do so for the sake of our peer group. However, I require reassurances. Prince Thalmin Havenbrock-‚Äù Ilunor paused, taking a moment to actually look me in the eyes with the composure of a true noble. ‚Äú-can you promise me that you are likewise willing to protect the integrity of this peer group? By guaranteeing my safety?‚Äù\n\nThe circumstances surrounding Ilunor‚Äôs hiding suddenly became clear to me, as did a great number of *additional* questions that entered soon after. ‚ÄúIlunor, I can‚Äôt-‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIf you do not, then I shall simply dematerialize once more and lay in hiding until your arbitrary time limit runs its course.‚Äù Ilunor *threatened*.\n\nThe little thing *knew* that time was not on my side.\n\nHe knew that the hand of negotiation was well and truly on *his* side.\n\nThat, or he was *bluffing* about his capabilities.\n\nThis whole situation reeked of duplicitous undertones.\n\nAnd whilst part of me knew I could potentially use violence to press the matter forward, I had a feeling like that wouldn‚Äôt work out well right now, not if his capabilities were well and truly able to circumvent my efforts.\n\n‚ÄúWell-?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúFine.‚Äù I admitted with a low, dulcet growl. ‚ÄúBut only for the duration of this meeting.‚Äù I continued, making sure to set clearly defined boundaries to this otherwise vague agreement. ‚ÄúAnd then, you must explain *everything* to me, and to the rest of the group.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI can only agree to explain that which *necessitates* explaining.‚Äù Ilunor interjected, as I felt a low *buzzing* in my pocket from my timepiece.\n\nIt was time to go.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôll dictate those terms when we cross that bridge, now let‚Äôs go.‚Äù\n\n=====\n\n**The Transgracian Academy for the Magical Arts, En Route to The Grand Assembly Hall. Local Time: 12:44 Hours.**\n\n**Emma Booker**\n\nThe past hour was a confusing mix of genuinely engaging conversations with Thacea, internal housekeeping with the EVI, and a constant sense of FOMO from having let Thalmin tackle the discount kobold alone.\n\nI was practically at the edge of my seat when the pair finally decided to arrive in the nick of time, averting some highly unnecessary Academy-grade drama by just under a minute, as the doors closed behind them with a resounding *CLUNK*.\n\nAs the pair finally sat down, I perked my brow up to see Ilunor wrapping himself in what I could only describe as a blanket.\n\nWith the room now sealed off from the outside world, there was a marked improvement in the overall acoustics, which served to enhance the whispers of intrigue and gossip amongst the chatty ranks that made up the student body.\n\nThe EVI was quick to pick up on them, relaying them to me just like it did right from the very first day.\n\n*‚ÄúCompletely unnecessary. I was already making headway towards the town as is!‚Äù*\n\n*‚ÄúWhat is this all about? The dragon? Hmmph, where I come from, dragons are a dime a dozen!‚Äù*\n\n*‚ÄúI heard this is about the explosion earlier this morning. Something about a magical cataclysm.‚Äù*\n\n*‚ÄúWell aren‚Äôt we lucky to be the year group that ushers in local cataclysm?‚Äù*\n\n*‚ÄúShh! It looks like they‚Äôre starting!‚Äù*\n\nThe start to this *emergency assembly* began in the most fittingly Nexian way possible.\n\nIt started with music.\n\nThe curtains blocking the stage were slowly unfurled, revealing a full on ensemble of musicians who began playing what I could only describe as a sudden and forceful tune to gain the crowd‚Äôs attention, before stopping as abruptly as they‚Äôd started.\n\nIt was only when the whispers had died down that the music began in earnest. This time, proceeding more traditionally, starting with a slow bowing of string instruments, followed up by a series of heart-thumping drums, before finally finishing off with a resonant *clang* of what sounded like cymbals.\n\nA second pair of curtains behind the musical ensemble opened soon after, revealing a stage dominated by a large podium. Behind it, was a long uninterrupted table, covered by an equally long cloth, with tapestries and ceremonial shields decorated with ornate crests of wildly different designs; the colors of each crest popping out against the white backdrop that was the tablecloth.\n\nFamiliar faces populated the stage, with Professors Vanavan, Chiska, Belnor, Articord, and more that I vaguely recalled from orientation standing next to their respective seats.\n\nThis packed roster however was interrupted by a single, lonely seat. A seat that looked all the more empty and out of place by the sheer turnout of those on stage, not to mention the ‚Äòpacked‚Äô crowd within the audience.\n\n**ALERT: LOCALIZED SURGE OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED, 400% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**\n\nAnother mana radiation alert preempted the arrival of the final element to complete this lineup. As a certain white-robed dean teleported in on a series of ethereal clouds that swirled up in the air above the stage to form a whole person. The wisps of white quickly materializing into a physical form with arms far outstretched to his sides, hovering slowly onto the ground with a rushing breeze. The whole thing prompted me to question just how far this T-posing elf needed to go to assert his dominance. Since my experiences with teleportation magic so far had shown that *clouds* and other theatrics weren‚Äôt a necessary prerequisite to teleportation magic.\n\n‚ÄúStudents, esteemed and respected peers of this great place of learning, I have called upon the Expectant Oath of the Guardian to humbly and respectfully interrupt the proceedings of this grace period for the purposes of preemptively addressing certain *unexpected* developments of which many of you may already be aware of.‚Äù The man made an effort to make eye contact with the crowd, but for a *split* second, he seemed to do what only Thacea, and to a limited extent Thalmin, was capable of doing up to this point. He made eye contact with me through my opaque lenses, in what felt like the most effortless move imaginable, before promptly moving on. ‚ÄúFor those of you who may be unaware, allow me to elaborate. During the third and fourth hours prior to the morning‚Äôs dawn, the town of Elaseer was struck by a series of unprovoked and cowardly attacks by the hands of an as-of-yet indeterminable party.‚Äù\n\nA series of whispers threatened to erupt within the audience again, but was promptly shot down by the musicians still on stage, playing a series of sharp tunes that caused them to stop in their tracks.\n\nThe dean continued on without missing a single beat.\n\n‚ÄúThese attacks resulted in the damage and subsequent *partial* destruction of an Academy-affiliated life-archive and transportium holding facility; bringing the Academy‚Äôs full involvement in what would otherwise be an Elaseer-exclusive incident. The sudden and unexpected arrival of an amethyst dragon during the course of these attacks is known to us, and what‚Äôs more, the reports of unexplained beastly howls preceding the attack, is likewise known to us.‚Äù The dean paused, his compassionate yet calculating eyes taking stock of the reactions of the crowd, more specifically, at the students sitting in the front row. ‚ÄúThose of you within the crowd who may fancy themselves ever-the-analytical sort may already understand the scope of this attack, and the parties that could potentially be involved. Nevertheless, this matter is one that none of you, let alone *first-years*, should concern yourself about. The Academy and its investigative bodies are already in the process of pursuing these culprits. And rest assured, with the aid of the Academy, Elaseer will quickly find and bring the parties involved to justice.‚Äù\n\n*Heh. Playing those werebeast‚Äôs noises to scare off those civvies in the area certainly helps with your narrative spin, doesn‚Äôt it, dean?*\n\nI shouldn‚Äôt have been surprised. In fact, that was probably why I wasn‚Äôt necessarily *nervous* about this whole assembly in the first place. Implicating *me* of all people would‚Äôve been an embarrassing nightmare for the Academy. What‚Äôs more, there were just so many ways they could‚Äôve spun this, that my involvement would‚Äôve actually been the lesser of obvious reasons for this whole debacle.\n\nIronically, fact would‚Äôve been stranger and less acceptable than *fiction* in this situation.\n\n‚ÄúThe reason why I am explaining this to all of you here today is simple. The Academy is nothing if not transparent about its proceedings and the proceedings of its immediate surroundings to those within the ranks of its peerage.‚Äù The man spoke with a warm, comforting smile. One that I would‚Äôve trusted if not for knowing the truth behind the lies. ‚ÄúWe are a center of learning, a place of wisdom. To convey and to disseminate information is within our core, and as such, our intent is to enlighten. This is especially true in regards to events that will invariably and directly affect the course of our Academic calendar.‚Äù The man paused for effect, taking a moment to once more meet everyone‚Äôs gaze, before exhaling dramatically to cement the severity of the inevitable announcement. ‚ÄúThe Academy has always prioritized the welfare of its peers above all other concerns. The uncertainties we face in light of recent events is yet another test to our commitment to this cause. As such, in accordance with the Expectant Oath of the Guardian, I deem it necessary to invoke the powers of Oversight in order to *postpone* the scheduled activities previously slated for the fourth and fifth days of this five-day grace period.‚Äù\n\nMore voices started to emerge within the crowd, but similar to what happened before, they were shot down by a series of sharp harmonic trills courtesy of the on-stage musicians.\n\n‚ÄúThese activities include the fourth day‚Äôs scheduled hours for learning-materials procurement from Elaseer, and the fifth day‚Äôs much-anticipated House Choosing Ceremony. Both activities will be tentatively rescheduled forward towards the end of the next week. Thus, next week‚Äôs classes shall begin without the formation of first-year houses.‚Äù\n\nThe dean promptly gestured towards an exhausted-looking Chiska, who stood up from her seat on wobbly, bandaged legs. ‚ÄúMy department shall be posting updates on these two activities, on the Grand Community Board, as well as announcement letters to be sent to each of your dorms when the time comes.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThank you, Professor.‚Äù The dean nodded respectfully, before quickly shifting gears.\n\n‚ÄúNow, to address another matter that most of you are certainly unaware of, except for a *few* of you more adventurous proactive souls.‚Äù The dean preempted, before pulling out a piece of paper right out of thin air.\n\n**ALERT: LOCALIZED SURGE OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED, 300% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**\n\n‚ÄúAs all of you are aware, the Transgracian Academy for the Magical Arts has been host to *The Library* from the very inception of our founding. Indeed, we pride ourselves in being the single, longest, uninterrupted host to the compendium of all that ever was and all that ever will be. This is in no small part a direct result from our *discipline* in maintaining and respecting the unspoken codes of conduct when accessing its services. It is this ceaseless adherence to our vows of mutual respect that has allowed us to maintain open access to the library throughout the untold eons. These vows, however, have seen their first violation in living memory. A violation committed at the hands of one of our own peers.‚Äù\n\nThe dean paused, as if *waiting* for some sort of response, almost daring anyone from the audience to whisper or mutter out something.\n\nThe crowd remained silent all throughout, as if they all collectively realized the severity of the situation.\n\n‚ÄúStarting tomorrow, in place of the House Choosing Ceremonies, there shall be an investigative council that shall call upon those within reasonable suspicion of this vile, malicious action. Those of you in suspect, shall be called upon as a group, or individually. You are free to roam the grounds, or remain in your dorms, for we *will* know where you are when the time comes.‚Äù The man announced ominously, which seemed to shake the whole room to its core.\n\nHeads began turning in every possible direction as a result of this, as I noticed Thacea and Thalmin‚Äôs expressions shifting to that of a renewed sense of concern.\n\nIlunor, however, seemed to watch on not in boredom, nor even in anxious concern like everyone else‚Ä¶ but instead, in what I could only describe as a look of a deer in headlights.\n\n‚ÄúAre there any questions?‚Äù The dean suddenly added, which was surprisingly, answered by a lone reptilian hand belonging to one of the students in the front row. ‚ÄúYes, Lord Qiv Ratom, the floor is yours.‚Äù\n\nQiv stood up, patting down his uniform as he stood tall and with a practiced posture before speaking. ‚ÄúThank you, Professor Atalan Rur Astur. I have but one question to bring forth to your attention.‚Äù The man cleared throat before continuing. ‚ÄúDoes all of this mean that the library is currently off limits pending investigation?‚Äù\n\nThe Dean‚Äôs face maintained its warm, friendly complexion, as he took a few seconds to ponder Qiv‚Äôs question. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù He replied simply. ‚ÄúThe library will be off limits for the duration of this investigation.‚Äù\n\nQiv took a deep bow at the end of that answer, then promptly spoke before retaking his seat. ‚ÄúThank you, Professor Atalan Rur Astur. I defer the floor back to its rightful master.‚Äù\n\nWhilst growing concerns and anxieties over the potential lockdown of the library began rearing its ugly head inside of my mind, a thought suddenly emerged that was the potential answer to this whole unexpected development.\n\nI raised my hand, much to Thacea‚Äôs shock, and to Thalmin‚Äôs interest, as the Dean narrowed his eyes my way, and nodded.\n\n‚ÄúYes, Cadet Emma Booker, the floor is yours.‚Äù He spoke in that same, reassuring tone of voice that I knew was full of crap.\n\nI turned to Qiv for a second, deciding to take a page out of his book of decorum, by standing up and then going through the motions. ‚ÄúThank you, Professor Atalan Rur Astur.‚Äù I paused, bowing slightly. ‚ÄúI just have one question. Would you be allowed in if you had a library card?‚Äù\n\n‚Ä¶..‚Ä¶..‚Ä¶..\n\nThe dean couldn‚Äôt help but chuckle at that question. It was a warm chuckle, a patronizing chuckle, hiding within it a certain level of condescension. The man actually took the time to pause, before causing another spike in mana radiation-\n\n**ALERT: LOCALIZED SURGE OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED, 300% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**\n\n\\-in order to materialize his own library card out of thin air as if to demonstrate his next point. ‚ÄúYou mean something like this?‚Äù He paused for effect, twirling the small metal card in his hands for good measure, allowing me a chance at getting a good look at his card. Strangely, whilst most details were similar to my own, it was the actual color and *material* that seemed different. The Dean‚Äôs being a pearlescent whitish gold, as opposed to my card‚Äôs traditional yellow-gold.\n\n‚ÄúIf you indeed possess a grand artifact such as this, then I do not see any issue in allowing you, or any one else who possesses such a gift, access to the library at this time. This *card* demonstrates the integrity of one‚Äôs character. It serves as a mark of honor, and a symbol of virtue. It shows that you have been vetted, scrutinized, and probed by one of the wisest, oldest beings in all of existence, comparable only to His Eternal Majesty in its wisdom and judgment. It is highly unlikely then, that the holders of this artifact would be in any way responsible for acts in encroachment and in violation of the library‚Äôs sanctity. I hope this answer has been sufficient, Cadet Emma Booker, despite it clearly being inapplicable to your case. It is however commendable that you broach such curiosities whilst being outside of the circle of the privileged few who can actually utilize it.‚Äù He paused for effect, causing a slow but gradual uproar of chuckling within the crowd, which eventually evolved into all out laughter.\n\nIt was at this point that I knew I had a unique opportunity in my hands.\n\nAn opportunity to kill so many birds with one stone.\n\nI had the attention of the entire room.\n\nI‚Äôd just been dealt a verbal smackdown that I had the perfect counter for.\n\nAnd what‚Äôs more, I had the unique opportunity now of setting the record straight in the eyes of all of those present.\n\nIt was time to play ball and demonstrate a bit of humanity‚Äôs soft power here and now.\n\nWith a look of genuine curiosity from the likes of Thacea, who clearly understood what was going through my head, and Thalmin who seemed overly excited for what was to come, I unclasped one of my pockets.\n\nFeeling the cold hard metal of the small rectangular plate, I clasped it between my middle and index fingers, before pulling it out in a single flourish.\n\nNot a second later, I felt the entire room going completely silent. The laughter, chuckling, and dismissive rants all but stopped in a matter of seconds.\n\nThe silence was deafening, so much so that I could make out a few gasps of shock from far away in the distance.\n\nThere was no response from anyone, not especially from the dean himself who now stared blankly at the card, focusing on the helmeted portrait that without a doubt confirmed its owner.\n\nEarthrealm was here.\n\nAnd Earthrealm meant business.\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/yd3cu3/wearing_power_armor_to_a_magic_school_1/) | [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/162vw4a/wearing_power_armor_to_a_magic_school_44/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/16f5img/wearing_power_armor_to_a_magic_school_46/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Author‚Äôs Note: Hey everyone! We're starting to get into something interesting with this chapter that's for sure haha.

Now, they have no legitimate reason to doubt her word regarding all of her actions, or the validity of her evidence.  The formerly suspect lack of mana flows in the recordings is direct evidence of their validity when a realm with no prior knowledge of magic makes a recording.\n\n‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\n\nPlaying fast and loose with the rules can put you on a slippery slope, can't it Illunor?\n\nWell played, Thalmin!

Also, the Dean just guaranteed passage to the Library for Emma at least, so that's the crystal calibration knowledge more or less in the bag, hopefully.\n\nNice to have a couple days breather to get sorted out before classes.

    "body": "There was a post today about what white people smell like, thankfully now-deleted. I was shocked  that this was posted, that people objecting were being downvoted, and that so many people were playing along with their race-based scent observations. I would rather see this entire sub shut down than spreading garbage like this.\n\nI can‚Äôt believe we are seriously discussing the idea that DIFFERENT RACES OF PEOPLE SMELL DIFFERENT. It is dangerous racist eugenics garbage with a terrible history, and it‚Äôs an idea that absolutely should not be accepted or normalized. \n\nIn these situations I really wish people were more educated on the history of what they‚Äôre saying, so I wanted to make a post providing some apparently much-needed context:\n\n1. American slaveowners consistently claimed that enslaved Africans had a different scent; that they brought the scent of Africa over with them and were inherently biologically different. This idea was used to help other & dehumanize Africans & justify slavery.\n\n2. European Christians from the Middle Ages through the 20th century claimed that Jewish people smelled bad. The popular ideas were that the smell came from Jewish people murdering Christians & being covered in their blood, or was a curse from God. This idea was used to help other & dehumanize Jewish people & justify pogroms (‚Äúpogroms‚Äù are violent ethnic cleansing massacres against Jewish people & were common in European history, for context.)\n\n3. European (later American) colonizers claimed that Native Americans smelled different. This idea was used to other & dehumanize Native Americans & justify the conquest of their indigenous land & the genocide of native peoples.\n\n4. In the British Empire, colonists claimed people from India smelled bad. This idea was used to other & dehumanize Indians and justify colonialism. This also led to a harmful stereotype that persists to this day. How many desi girls have cried real tears even now in 2025 because people bully them, say they smell like curry etc?\n\nI could go on & on! There are so many examples and they are NEVER GOOD. And if you‚Äôre interested, here‚Äôs a real academic article with like 57 citations: \n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14780038.2016.1202008#d1e155\n\nWhat‚Äôs complicated here is that different cultural groups can tend towards different smells; the beauty products that are marketed towards them can have some common fragrance notes/ingredients, or they might favor particular ingredients or cuisines. For instance, orange blossom will always remind me of visiting Morocco because it was such a popular fragrance note there, and plumeria makes me think of Hawaii. Consistently consuming specific cuisine/ingredients eating different cuisines can also temporarily change your body chemistry. Vegans allegedly smell different etc. But that is very different from the ‚Äúoh it doesn‚Äôt work with my skin‚Äù claims which imply a true biological difference.\n\nIf you have noticed trends with scent preferences & race, it is caused by enculturation (acquiring the traits of one‚Äôs own culture group ‚Äî essentially, getting used to what is normal for the people around you) and possibly also diet. \n\nI PROMISE YOU that if you took people from all different races, fed them the same diet for a week & had them use the same soap & shampoo, they would not smell different based on their fucking race. Stick a blindfold on the person with the best nose on earth & they would not be able to categorize those people based on race. Spray them all with Glossier You & it will not smell ‚Äúmore suited‚Äù on white people. That is not how biology works. \n\nFor anyone who has been saying ‚Äú[insert scent] smells better on [insert race]‚Äù I am begging you to do some learning & think this through. Don‚Äôt go around saying shit like this. \n\nIt may seem cute to be like ‚Äútee hee white people smell like Another 13‚Äù but please consider what comes next: people are going to immediately be like ‚Äúoh what do XYZ race people smell like?‚Äù and start stereotyping. And if the idea ‚Äúwhite people smell like [whatever]‚Äù gets popularized, characterizing people who don‚Äôt smell that way as dirty and inferior is the next step, with a thousand years of history & examples to back that up.",

It wasn't a discussion about \"race\" to me and it behooves Americans to make the distinction between race and ethnicity/culture imo.\n\n\"People always smelling like xyz because of the biology of their race\" was just not the thrust of the conversation at all imo. If anything this hypothesis was repeatedly rejected. Throughout the entire comment section ppl were concurring that yes, there was a correlation between scent and ethnicity, and was likely a function of multiple factors including lifestyle - the point you're trying to make was everywhere in the other post's comments. Any allusions to it being biological may have originated in the salience of ethnic differences in dermatological function; for many participants it's common knowledge that different ethnicities have different skincare needs. You're allowed to entertain the possibility that it extends to the often poorly understood term \"skin chemistry\" as it relates to perfume - we are here to learn from each other.\n\nEdit: and yes I saw the potential for bad-faith hijacking and there were some comments that used the discussion to indulge in these stereotypes, so yes ppl who are upset by certain comments/potential for negativity are valid. I deleted the ones I saw but maybe there are more - fyi I didnt see any reports for them cmon guys",

I wish more people knew that humans are genetically more similar to each other across different races than they are within the same race. \n\n\"Scientists have investigated the DNA of thousands of people from around the world trying to find a genetic underpinning for racial or ethnic differences. They have found that human DNA is 99.9% similar, whether we are from Europe, Asia, the Americas, or Africa. In fact, there is more genetic diversity within a single racial/ethnic group than between two or more groups \\[[5](https://humgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40246-020-00284-2#ref-CR5)\\]. Two individuals in Africa can be more genetically dissimilar from each other than either one might be relative to an individual in Europe or Asia. To think that our racial or ethnic identities could be based upon a mere 0.1% of our genome and not our lived experience does not stand to reason, especially given that the small differences that do exist in our DNA are present to help us adapt to local environmental conditions.\n\nSmall existing genetic differences helped us adapt to local environmental conditions across the continents since the migration out of Africa \\[[5](https://humgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40246-020-00284-2#ref-CR5)\\].

    "body": "Edit - Well damn. EPS and revenue beat but guidance is king these days. Holding onto the calls at this point in case a miracle happens but counting the full 8k as a loss. Only down 1.7k on shares so far but if it does the same thing it has done the last 3 quarters, it will rebound to new highs so not too worried. Congratulations to all the Bears and better luck next time to all the Bulls with me.\n\nI believe BBWI is going to crush earnings based on 5 months of store stalking and no one is talking about it. Literally not one mention about earnings on wallstreetbets. TLDR at the end.\n\n**Background:**\n\nI have been on paternity leave for a little over 5 months now. I live 20 minutes away from 3 different malls and thought I walking around them for an hour or two every day would be a great way to kill some time while also letting my newborn see new things. Around the same time I watched a video on how a Chinese coffee shop got outed for fake financials by people literally watching the store and counting the number of people buying things. That gave me the idea to track how many people were in stores and how many shopping bags I saw around the mall from each store indicating a purchase. Obviously there is a major difference between dozens of people watching stores vs just little old me but the data I gathered has been spot on for earning beats on what I considered to be outliers. The stores that have surprised me with their high volume are Gap, Abercrombie & Fitch, Urban Outfitters, Sephora, and of course Bath and Body Works.\n\n**Method:**\n\nAll in all I have 124 days worth of data so far. I usually only visit one mall a day but sometimes two. Any day of the week and usually between 12pm and 5pm. I try and park at different entrances so I don‚Äôt get biased in my counting of bags because I park right next to one store or another. I go to three different malls each catering to a different economic class. Pretty much lower, middle, and high income. I do 2 passes, about and hour apart, of each store I am tracking. I count the number of customers in the store. While I walk around, I also count the number of bags I see from each store. This is a bit harder to trust though as people with multiple bags usually condense into one. So stores with small bags (looking at you Sephora) are underrepresented. I would occasionally go into BBWI and count the items in people carts too but only did this a handful of times.\n\n**Data:**\n\nThe average number of people I have seen at BBWI is 9.82 on weekdays and 23.68 on weekends. This crushes the average from all the stores I tracked which was 2.98 on weekdays and 8.2 on weekends. The only store with a higher average was Sephora which was 10.36 and 25.25 respectfully. All three malls had similar numbers with the higher income mall being slightly higher but not enough to note. I think this was due to young girls traveling in packs of 3 or 4 which I didn‚Äôt see at the other two malls.\n\nThe average number of bags (aka purchases) for BBWI was 4.1 on weekdays and 11.67 on weekends. Which again crushes the average of just 1.45 and 3.11.\n\nFor some context here are pictures of the check out line Saturday 30 minutes apart. Wanted to hide people because I think it is rude for a random stranger to snap pictures of people and post them online. There are currently multiple tellers checking out customers with 5 more people in line.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j7utbegx6d4d1.png?width=1485&format=png&auto=webp&s=66905e26bba9ebd5134ef3e817efaaf26b45b8cc\n\n30 minutes later and still 5 people in line\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dbjon4ep6d4d1.png?width=1493&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce85d8724ee99cd47b3e79a3b0bbaa7112b79bc\n\n**Other Things to Note**\n\n**Male Skin Care** \\- Something I didn‚Äôt track, but surprised me, was the number of males in the store alone or with another guy (this goes for Sephora as well). Doing a bit of research on the topic of men's skin care shows a 6.2% year over year growth and a 389% increase in TikTok videos on the subject in the last year. I think it is actually going to be higher based on what I am seeing at the stores and Gen Z starting to come into their own money. That generation has pushed the needle on male beauty standards much more towards the feminine astatic (think Timothee, Lil Nas X, Brady Potter, Jungkook) and with that comes skincare. This is a huge expanding market that is just getting tapped into and based on what I am seeing in person they are capturing the market well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cnqrxy5s6d4d1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b67bd389c4be5640f80f193f0e128ce3ba71d4e1\n\n**Dupe Culture** \\- This has been on the rise over the last year but it is starting to snowball now. Gen Z and Millennials are finally starting to push back on the, ‚Äúbuy the brand not the product‚Äù mentality. This was evident with E.L.F.s recent earning report and will be echoed in BBWI. Their house products have been praised for matching much more expensive fragrances. Paulreactss is one of the most popular fragrance TikTokers with 1.5 million subscribers and he has videos identifying BBWI scents that dupe much more expensive variations. Seriously just google Bath and Body Works dupes and you will see tons of people gushing about what BBWI has to offer and people saying they bought tons of their new product line that came out in the end of Q1.\n\n**Subreddit** \\- The Bath and Body Works subreddit has 86k subscribers. Just yesterday there is a post from an associate saying they are flooded with orders from their summer sales and people are buying literally entire lots of items. [https://www.reddit.com/r/bathandbodyworks/comments/1d6t0dr/from\\_an\\_associate\\_to\\_customers\\_we\\_love\\_you\\_but/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bathandbodyworks/comments/1d6t0dr/from_an_associate_to_customers_we_love_you_but/)\n\nNotable quotes from the thread:  \n\"It‚Äôs just been the second day of SAS and already we‚Äôve gotten over 100+ BOPIS orders placed\"  \n\"...and bringing in 2 or more baskets of items is just not only exhausting but also unfair to the other customers who would‚Äôve wanted to get certain products but now can‚Äôt because someone else decided to buy all 10 sprays that were JUST put out...\"  \n\"Yep I felt so bad for my friends because everytime they went on break or even took a second to look away from the bopis, the number would go back to 99+\"\n\n**TLDR** \\- I have been to a Bath and Body Works over 250 times in the last 5 months to count the number of customers in the store. It has crushed my expectations. This coupled with male skin care rising and dupe brands like E.L.F. crushing earnings leads me to believe BBWI is going to kill earnings.\n\nPosition - 20k in stock and 8k in various calls expiring this week and next week.",

    "body": "So I, like probably many people in this sub, am a voracious watcher of Binging with Babish.  The channel‚Äôs well edited and a hell of a lot of fun.  The other week he made a video on Pineapple Fried Rice from the anime ‚ÄúShokugeki no Soma‚Äù, link [here](https://youtu.be/WRA3a7c4Qt4).\n\nI know some people use his video for educational reasons, so I just wanted to discuss some errors in his fried rice technique.  I‚Äôm really not trying to be a dick here ‚Äì I just think that sometimes seeing how *not* to do something can be equally if not more illuminating than seeing how *to* do something. Because of that, I wanna avoid nitpicking and focus more on fundamental flaws I saw.\n\nAgain, mediocre fried rice recipes online are ubiquitous and certainly not limited to this video. The purpose isn‚Äôt to pick on Babish (Andrew? Let‚Äôs call him Babish), but rather on how to improve *your* fried rice.\n\n**Mistake #1: Getting the oil smoking hot.**\n\n*Location:* [2:12 in the video](https://youtu.be/WRA3a7c4Qt4?t=2m12s)\n\n*Why you don‚Äôt wanna do this:* Babish repeats an old myth about stir-frying, that ‚Äúthe key to wok cooking is high heat, that‚Äôs why they have those jet engine stoves‚Äù.  It‚Äôs not, and that‚Äôs not why restaurants have those stoves ‚Äì like in all cuisines, heat control in Chinese cuisine is fundamental and you don‚Äôt wanna be rolling at full blast all the time. \n\nHeat up some oil til it‚Äôs smoking and scorching hot?  As soon as your aromatics hit the oil they‚Äôll scorch and burn! I think Babish instinctively realized this, which is why he added the aromatics after the egg.\n\n*What you wanna do instead:* You don‚Äôt get the oil scorching hot ‚Äì you get the *wok* scorching hot.  I know it seem unintuitive, stay with me.  The basic process is as follows:\n\n* Put a dry, clean wok over maximum flame for about 30-120 seconds (depending on range strength). For reference, if you got one of those cool little temperature guns, you‚Äôre looking for the surface to be roughly ~240C (470F).  If you don‚Äôt, your hand should be a bit uncomfortable if placing inside the wok hovering over the bottom ‚Äì something akin to steak searing temperature.\n\n* Shut off the heat -or- take the wok off the flame.  This is done because if you added oil to the hot wok on the flame it would start to smoke.\n\n* Add in the oil and swirl it around (still off the heat).  If done correctly you won‚Äôt need so much oil.  Anywhere the oil swirl to will give you the non-stick surface you want.\n\n* Add in your initial ingredients, and concurrently switch the heat to what you want.  You could also turn the flame on right before or right after adding in the first ingredients. \n\nWhy do you do this? There‚Äôs nothing mystical going on here. It‚Äôll preheat the wok, sure, but it‚Äôs primarily because the high heat helps the oil bind to the wok to create a non-stick surface.   \n\n**Mistake #2: Crowding the Wok**\n\n*Location:* [2:52 in the video](https://youtu.be/WRA3a7c4Qt4?t=2m52s)\n\n*Why you don‚Äôt wanna do this:* Crowding the wok is a sin that should be familiar to you if you‚Äôre experienced with deep-frying. Add to much stuff? You lower the temperature. At worst, this can lead to your ingredients beginning to sweat and releasing moisture, muffing up the whole enterprise.  Babish seems to avoid this (he is a good cook after all) by simply‚Ä¶ not really frying the rice (more on that in the next point).\n\n*What you wanna do instead:*  Be more judicious with how much you‚Äôre putting in your wok! This seems to be a common thing I see from some English-language sources ‚Äì I think because people view stir-fry as a ‚Äòmain‚Äô to feed a family with, it just doesn‚Äôt lend a good ‚Äòfeel‚Äô for what a more reasonable-portioned dish looks like (Chinese meals usually consist of a handful of different dishes). He‚Äôs using this insane-looking mountain of rice in the video ‚Äì he doesn‚Äôt mention the exact quantity he used, but I‚Äôd guess we use half that amount (~400g) while also having a larger wok. \n\nAnd speaking of which, larger woks are convenient as all hell for that very reason.  I understand that if you‚Äôre not doing a lot of Chinese cooking you might not want a massive 16‚Äù wok lying around your kitchen‚Ä¶ but if you‚Äôre trying for a more ambitiously-portioned stir-fry it‚Äôs *almost* a must.  If you wanted to do the same quantity he was going for in the wok that he was using, you‚Äôd have to split the recipe in half and do two batches.  And ain‚Äôt nobody got time for that.\n\n**Mistake #3: Not actually frying the rice**\n\n*Location:* [3:07 in the video](https://youtu.be/WRA3a7c4Qt4?t=3m07s)\n\n*Why not to do this:* In the video, Babish instructs to ‚Äúcook the rice until you‚Äôre just heating it through ‚Ä¶ [add in the seasonings] ‚Ä¶ and continue to stir over high heat until everyone‚Äôs gotten to know eachother‚Äù.  That‚Äôs not really frying rice, that‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ mixing rice with stuff.  Take a good look at [3:25 in the video](https://youtu.be/WRA3a7c4Qt4?t=3m25s): the rice is wet, sticky, and mushy.  Compare that to [this fried rice](https://i.imgur.com/uWoU8QF.jpg) ‚Äì the grains are nice and separate, giving you that classic fried rice texture (that pic‚Äôs 6000x4000 so you should be able to zoom in on the grains).\n\nAgain, this seems to be a common mistake.  After neglecting to properly fry the rice, many people seem to throw their hands up in their air and think ‚ÄòI‚Äôll never be able to fry rice without a restaurant stove‚Äô! Nothing could be further from the truth - with the right technique, you can even fry rice on an electric range. \n\n*What to do instead:* Your primary goal when executing a fried rice is to nail the texture. All else is secondary. We like adding the rice in right after the egg (some people save the egg for later, more on that in a second) ‚Äì this gives your rice enough time to fry without too many confounding variables.\nYour goal is to get the rice dry and loose with the grains separated.  This‚Äôll take a couple minutes. It‚Äôll be ready once the rice is able to *flow* off your spatula. Because this is a little difficult to describe, forgive me for [linking to part of a video we made illustrating the method](https://youtu.be/QsHLgZhkKyc?t=5m11s).\n\n**Something that a few other commenters were calling Babish out on that I don‚Äôt believe is a mistake:**\n\nThe only critiques the video received in the /r/videos reddit thread were related to his adding the egg in the first step of the stir-fry. Some commenters insisted that this would, well, overcook the egg.  And certainly, if you were making scrambled eggs and fried them with the same heat/the length of time required to fry rice‚Ä¶ that wouldn‚Äôt make a very good scrambled egg.\n\nBut we‚Äôre not making scrambled eggs.  We‚Äôre making fried rice.  Adding the egg first gives you sort of that ‚Äòosmanthus flower‚Äô kind of effect that‚Äôs used at times in Cantonese cooking.  [This is a fun video in Chinese of a chef showing a guy how to make Osmanthus Flower Scallops](https://youtu.be/EUy5m-bZ_eo?t=7m1s) ‚Äì check out 8:05‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs an egg that many people would consider ‚Äòovercooked‚Äô.  But it‚Äôs an awesome dish with a great texture.\n\nThank about it this way: take some beef slices and give em a super brief flash fry in oil ‚Äì it‚Äôll be rare.  Cook it a bit longer and you have beef that‚Äôs perfectly done.  Keep on cooking it for *even longer* and they‚Äôll eventually release moisture and get super crispy.  That last technique sounds off, but it‚Äôs step one to a Sichuan Mapo Tofu!  The point is that there‚Äôs not one ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô level of ‚Äòdoneness‚Äô, only different techniques that suit different dishes.  \n\nNow, that said, some people prefer to maintain the freshness and the fragrance of the egg.  That‚Äôs totally cool too.  Some other egg-adding methods for fried rice:\n\n1. Pouring the egg over the rice near the end of cooking.  Not recommended unless you have a powerful stove as it has the potential to muff up that hard-fought rice texture.\n\n2. Frying the eggs separately and adding them in at the end.  Easy and solid choice.\n\n3. Scooching the rice up the sides of the wok and making a little ‚Äòring‚Äô in the center for the egg to fry in, then mixing them together.  Totally cool, requires a round-bottomed wok.\n\nAgain, we also fry the egg at first.  While people can tend to be very vocal about their method of choice, it really is personal preference.\n\nAs such, there‚Äôs some other random nit-picky notes (seasoning choices, frying veg together with the rice or separate, etc) I‚Äôd have with that fried rice, but there‚Äôs no need to get too deep into the weeds.\n\n**Cutting Babish a little bit of a break:**\n\nTo do what he does requires casting a *very* large net.  He‚Äôs made videos on everything from this, to an old-school strudel from scratch, to uh‚Ä¶ Homer Simpson‚Äôs Moon Waffles.  You can see the obvious influences Kenji, Alton Brown, and other awesome resources have on his cooking.  To be one dude putting out excellent videos *every week* of the insane variety he pushes himself to execute is‚Ä¶ nuts.  It‚Äôs obvious that he needs to stand on the shoulders of giants, and that‚Äôs a *good* thing. \n\nThere‚Äôs good resources out there on Chinese/Asian cooking, but if you‚Äôre not already familiar with cooking the cuisines they can be difficult to parse.  Popularity of Asian food in the Anglosphere has *far* outpaced the diffusion of cooking knowledge.  Put simply, there‚Äôs a lot of bullshit floating around.\n\n**TL;DR:** Don‚Äôt heat up your oil, don‚Äôt crowd your wok, make sure to fry the rice until the grains are loose and separate, there‚Äôs tons of different ways to add egg, and the videos are still cool.",

Then egg, breaking it aoart quickly, then the greens. Usually its something like Taiwan pechay or something, I reckon any leafy green can work well here. Once it has reduced, add rice. And pat them down. Then you add the liquids, like soy sauce, oyster sauce, maybe another drizzle of oil. Then you're also on point that you need to fry the rice. When we do it in our country, we usually wait till the volume of the rice goes down a fair bit (makes sense since rice has a lot of water, so by frying it you're reducing volume).

A perfect mix of vanilla, citrus, and some mysterious scent that probably comes from the gods themselves. End of the day, after cooking, working, running errands? Still smells like a luxurious spa. I don‚Äôt get it!\n\nMeanwhile, I step outside for five minutes, and I come back smelling like sweat, pollution, and regret. I use body wash, deodorant, even that expensive cologne she got me, and within an hour, I smell like a tired potato.\n\nBut her? She could roll around in a pile of garlic, wrestle a wet dog, and run a marathon, and she‚Äôd still smell like a fresh bouquet in a five-star hotel. I‚Äôve sniffed her sweaters when she‚Äôs not around (don‚Äôt judge me), and even her clothes that have been sitting in the laundry smell better than me freshly showered.\n\nI‚Äôm convinced she‚Äôs hiding something‚Äîmaybe she has a secret stash of enchanted perfumes, or perhaps she struck a deal with a fragrance deity at birth. Whatever it is, it‚Äôs unfair, and I demand answers. But until then, I‚Äôll just sit here, smelling like disappointment and wondering why I even try.",

    "body": "Today i have a confession to make: i'm a little bit of a minmaxer. And honestly, i think that's a pretty desirable trait in a DM. The minmaxer knows the rules, and exploits them to maximum efficiency.\n\n\"But wait, what does that have to do with spell use in society?\" - someone, probably.\n\nWell, the thing is that humans are absolutely all about minmaxing. There's a rule in the universe that reads \"gas expands when hot\", and suddenly we have steam engines (or something like that, i'm a political scientist not an engineer). A rule says 1+1 = 2, and suddenly we have calculus, computers and all kinds of digital stuff that runs on math. Sound is energy? Let's convert that shit into electricity, run it through a wire and turn it back into sound on the other side.\n\nBruh. Science is just minmaxing the laws of nature. Humanity in real life is just a big bunch of munchkins, and it should be no different in your setting.\n\nAnd *that* is why minmaxing magic usage is something societies as a whole would do, specially with some notable spells. Today i will go in depth on how and why each of these notable mentions has a huge impact on a fantasy society.\n\nWe'll go from lowest level to highest, keeping in mind that the lower level a spell the more common it should be to find someone who has it, so often a level 2-3 spell will have more impact than a level 9 spell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Mending (cantrip)**.\n\nRepair anything in one minute. Your axe lost its edge? Tore your shirt? Just have someone Mend it.\n\nSomeone out there is crying \"but wait! Not every village has a wizard!\" and while that is true, keep in mind any High Elf knows a cantrip, as can any Variant Human.\n\nA single \"mender\" could replace a lot of the work a smith, woodworker or seamstress does, freeing their time to only work on making new things rather than repair old ones.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Prestidigitation (cantrip)**.\n\nClean anything in six seconds. Committed axe murders until the axe got blunt, and now there's blood everywhere? Dog shit on your pillow out of spite? Someone walked all over the living room with muddy boots? Just Prestidigitate it away.\n\nThis may look like a small thing, but its actually huge when you apply it to laundry. Before washing machines were a thing housewives had to spend several hours a week washing them manually, and with Prestidigitation you can just hire someone to get it done in a few minutes.\n\nA single \"magic cleaner\" can attend to several dozen homes, if not hundreds, thus freeing several hours of the time of dozens of women.\n\nFun fact: there's an interesting theory that says feminism only existed because of laundry machines and similar devices. Women found themselves having more free time, which they used to read and socialize. Educated women with more contacts made for easy organization of political movements, and the fact men were now able to do \"the women's work\" by pushing a button meant men were less opposed to losing their housewives' labor. Having specialized menders and magic cleaners could cause a comparable revolution in a fantasy setting, and help explain why women have a similar standing to men even in combat occupations such as adventuring.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Healing in general (1st-2nd level).**\n\nThis one is fairly obvious. A commoner has 4 hit points, that means just about any spell is a full heal to the average person. That means most cuts, stab wounds, etc. can be solved by the resident cleric. Even broken bones that would leave you in bed for months can be solved in a matter of seconds as soon as the holy man arrives.\n\nBut that's nothing compared to the ability to cure diseases. While the only spell that can cure diseases is Lesser Restoration, which is second level, a paladin can do it much more easily with just a Lay on Hands. This means if one or two people catch a disease it can just be eradicated with a touch.\n\nHowever doing that comes with a cost. If everyone is instantly expunged of illness, the populace does not build up their immune systems. Regular disease becomes less common, sure, but whenever it is reintroduced (by, say, immigrants or contact with less civilized humanoids) it can spread like wildfire, afflicting people so fast that no amount of healers will have the magic juice to deal with it.\n\nDiseases become rare, plagues become common.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Continual Flame (2nd).**\n\nOk, this one is a topic i love and could easily be its own post.\n\nThere's an article called \"Why the Falling Cost of Light Matters\", which goes in detail about how man went from chopping wood for fire, to using animal fat for candles, then other oils, whale oil, kerosene, then finally incandescent light bulbs, and more recently LED lights. Each of these leaps is orders of grandeur more efficient than the previous one, to the point that the cost of light today is about 500,000 times cheaper than it was for for a caveman. And until the early 1900s the only way mankind knew of making light was to set things on fire.\n\nContinual Flame on the other hand allows you to turn 50gp worth of rubies and a 2nd level spell slot into a torch that burns forever. In a society that spends 60 hours of labor to be able to generate 140 minutes of light, this is a huge game changer.\n\nThis single spell, which i am 99% sure was just created as an excuse for why the dungeon is lit despite going for centuries without maintenance, allows you to have things like public lighting. Even if you only add a new \"torchpost\" every other week or month sooner or later you'll be left with a neatly lit city, specially if the city has had thousands of years in which to gather the rubies and light them up.\n\nAnd because the demand of rubies becomes so important, consider how governments would react. Lighting the streets is a public service, if its strategically relevant to make the city safer at night, would that not warrant some restrictions on ruby sales? Perhaps even banning the use of rubies in jewelry?\n\nTrivia: John D. Rockefeller, the richest man in history, gained his wealth selling kerosene. Kerosene at the time was used to light lamps. Gasoline was invented much later, when Rockefeller tasked a bunch of scientists to come up with a use for some byproducts of the kerosene production. This illustrates how much money is to be had in the lighting industry, and you could even have your own Rockefeller ruby baron in your game. I shall call him... Dohn J. Stonebreaker. Perfect name for a mining entrepreneur.\n\nWhether the ruby trade ends up a monopoly under the direct supervision of the king or a free market, do keep in mind that Continual Flame is by far the most efficient way of creating light.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Gentle Repose (2nd).**\n\nCast it on a corpse, and it stays preserved for 10 days.\n\nThis has many potential uses, from preserving foodstuffs (hey, some rare meats are expensive enough to warrant it) to keeping the bodies of old rulers preserved. Even if a ruler died of old age and cannot be resurrected, the body could be kept \"fresh\" out of respect/ceremony. Besides, it keeps the corpse from becoming undead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Skywrite (2nd).**\n\nOk, this one is mostly a gag. While the spell *can* be used by officials to make official announcements to the populace, such as new laws or important news, i like to just use it for spam. I mean, its a ritual spell that writes a message on the sky; what else would people use it for?\n\nImagine you show up in a city, and there's half a dozen clouds reading \"buy at X, we have what you need\", \"get your farming supplies over at Joe's store\" or \"vote Y for the city council\".\n\nThe possibilities are endless, and there's no way the players can expect it. Just keep in mind that by RAW the spell can only do words, meaning no images. No Patrick, \"8===D\" is not a word.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Zone of Truth (2nd).**\n\nThis one is too obvious. Put all suspects of a crime into a ZoT, wait a couple minutes to make sure they fail the save, then ask each one if he did it. Sure its not a perfect system, things like the Ring of Mind Shielding still exist, but it's got a better chance of getting the right guy than most medieval justice systems. And probably more than a few contemporary ones. All while taking only a fraction of the time.\n\nMore importantly, with all the average crimes being handled instantly, the guards and investigators have more time to properly investigate the more unusual crimes that might actually involve a Thought Shield, Ring of Mind Shielding or a level 17 Mastermind.\n\nThere is a human rights argument against messing with people's minds in any way, which is why this may not be practiced in every kingdom. But there are definitely some more lawful societies that would use ZoT on just about every crime.\n\nWhy swear to speak the truth and nothing but the truth when you can just stand in a zone of truth?\n\nAnother interesting use for ZoT is oaths. When someone is appointed into an office, gets to a high rank in the military or a guild, just put them in a ZoT while they make their oath to stand for the organization's values and yadda yadda. Of course they can be corrupted later on, but at least you make sure they're honest when they are sworn in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sending (3rd).**\n\nSending is busted in so many ways.\n\nThe more \"vanilla\" use of it is to just communicate over long distances. We all know that information is important, and that sometimes getting information [a whole day ahead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothschild_family#The_Napoleonic_Wars) can lead to a 40% return on a massive two-year investment. Being able to know of invasions, monsters, disasters, etc. without waiting days or weeks for a courier can be vital for the survival of a nation. Another notable example is [that one dude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Marathon#Marathon_run) who ran super fast for a while to be the first to tell his side of a recent event.\n\nBut the real broken thing here is... Sending can Send to any creature, on any plane; the only restriction being \"with which you are familiar\". In D&D dead people just get sent to one of the afterlife planes, meaning that talking to your dead grandfather would be as simple as Sending to him. Settling inheritance disputes was never easier!\n\nBefore moving on to the next point let me ask you something: Is a cleric familiar with his god? Is a warlock familiar with his patron?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Speak With Dead (3rd).**\n\nMuch like Sending, this lets you easily settle disputes. Is the senate/council arguing over a controversial topic? Just ask the beloved hero or ruler from 200 years ago what he thinks on the subject. As long his skeleton still has a jaw (or if he has been kept in Gentle Repose), he can answer.\n\nThis can also be used to ask people who killed them, except murderers also know this. Plan on killing someone? Accidentally killed someone? Make sure to inutilize the jaw. Its either that, being so stealthy the victim can't identify you, or being caught.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Note on spell availability.**\n\nOh boy. No world-altering 4th level spells for some reason, and suddenly we're playing with the big boys now.\n\nSpells up to 3rd level are what I'd consider \"somewhat accessible\", and can be arranged for a fee even for regular citizens. For instance the vanilla Priest statblock (MM348) is a 5th level cleric, and the standard vanilla Druid (MM346) a 4th level druid.\n\nSpells of 5th level onward will be considered something only the top 1% is able to afford, or large organizations such as guilds, temples or government.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dream (5th).**\n\nI was originally going to put Dream along with Sending and Telepathy as \"long range communication\", but decided against it due to each of them having unique uses.\n\nAnd when it comes to Dream, it has the unique ability of allowing you to put your 8 hours of sleep to good use. A tutor could hire someone to cast Dream on him, thus allowing him to teach his student for 8 hours at any distance. This is a way you could even access hermits that live in the middle of nowhere or in secluded monasteries. Very wealthy families or rulers would be willing to pay a good amount of money to make sure their heirs get that extra bit of education.\n\nIts like online classes, but while you sleep!\n\nAnother interesting use is for cheating. Know a princess or queen you like? She likes you back? Her dad put 400 trained soldiers between you? No problemo! Just find a 9th level Bard, Warlock or Wizard, but who am i kidding, of course it'll be a bard. And that bard is probably you. Now you have 8 hours to do whatever you want, and no physical evidence will be left.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Raise Dead (5th).**\n\nFew things matter more in life than death. And the ability to resurrect people has a huge impact on society. The impact is so huge that this topic needs topics of its own.\n\nFirst, diamond monopoly. Remember what i said about how Continual Flame would lead to controlled ruby sales due to its strategic value? This is the same principle, but a hundred times stronger. Resurrection is a huge strategic resource. It makes assassinations harder, can be used to bring back your officials or highest level soldiers over and over during a war, etc. This means more authoritarian regimes would do everything within their power to control the supply and stock of diamonds. Which in turn means if anyone wants to have someone resurrected, even in times of peace, they'll need to call in a favor, do a quest, grease some hands...\n\nSecond, resurrection insurance. People hate risks. That's why insurance is such a huge industry, taking up about 15% of the US GDP. People insure their cars, houses... even their lives. Resurrection just means \"life insurance\" is taken more literally. This makes even more sense when you consider how expensive resurrection is: nobody can afford it in one go, but if you pay a little every month or year you can save up enough to have it done when the need arises.\n\nThis is generally incompatible with the idea of a State-run monopoly over diamonds, but that just means different countries within a setting can take different approaches.\n\nTo make things easier, i even used some microeconomics to make a sheet in my [personal random generators](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SW4jW72lnn-lQZ3laaL4FZfDo2QzKj7bj3af783GWEw/edit?usp=sharing) to calculate the price of such a service. Just head to the \"Insurance\" tab and fill in the information relative to your setting.\n\nWith actual life insurance resurrection can cost as little as 5gp a year for humans or 8sp a year for elves, making resurrection way more affordable than it looks.\n\nAlso, do you know why pirates wore a single gold earring? It was so that if your body washes up on the shore whoever finds it can use the money to arrange a proper burial. Sure there's a risk of the finder taking it and walking away, but the pirates did it anyway. With resurrection in play, might as well just wear a diamond earring instead and hope the finder is nice enough to bring you back.\n\nI got so carried away with the whole insurance thing i almost forgot: the possibility of resurrection also changes how murders are committed.\n\nIf you want someone dead but resurrection exists, you have to remove the vital organs. Decapitation would be far more common. Sure resurrection is still possible, but it requires higher level spells or Reincarnate, which has... quirks.\n\nAs a result it should be very obvious when someone was killed by accident or an overreaction, and when someone was specifically out to kill the victim.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Scrying (5th).**\n\nThis one is somewhat obvious, in that everyone and their mother knows it helps finding people. But who needs finding? Well, that would be those who are hiding.\n\nThe main use i see for this spell, by far, is locating escaped criminals. Just collect a sample of hair or blood when arresting someone (or shipping them to hard labor which is way smarter), and if they escape you'll be almost guaranteed to successfully scry on them.\n\nA similar concept to this is seen in the Dragon Age series. If you're a mage the paladins keep a sample of your blood in something called a phylactery, and that can be used to track you down. There's even a quest or two about mages trying to destroy their phylacteries before escaping.\n\nSimilarly, if you plan a jailbreak it would be highly beneficial to destroy the blood/hair sample first. As a matter of fact i can even see a thieves guild hiring a low level party to take out the sample while the professional infiltrators get the prisoner out. Keep in mind both events must be done at the same time, otherwise the guards will just collect a new sample or would have already taken it to the wizard.\n\nBut guards aren't the only ones with resources. A loan shark could keep blood samples of his debtors, a mobster can keep one of those who owe him favors, etc. And the blood is ceremoniously returned only when the debt is fully paid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Teleportation Circle (5th), Transport Via Plants (6th).**\n\nIn other words, long range teleportation. This is such a huge thing that it is hard to properly explain how important it is.\n\nTeleportation Circle creates a 10ft. circle, and everyone has one round to get in and appear on the target location. Assuming 30ft. movement that means you can get 192 people through, which is a lot of potential merchants going across any distance. Or 672 people dashing.\n\nMath note: A 30ft radius square around a 10ft. diameter square, minus the 4 original squares. Or \\[(6\\*2+2)\\^2\\]-4 squares of 5ft. each. Hence 192 people.\n\nGetting hundreds of merchants, workers, soldiers, etc. across any distance is nothing to scoff at. In fact, it could help explain why PHB item prices are so standardized: [Arbitrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage) is so easy and cheap that price differences across multiple markets become negligible. Unless of course countries start setting up tax collectors outside of the permanent teleportation circles in order to charge tariffs.\n\nTransport Via Plants does something very similar but it requires 5ft of movement to go through, which means less people can be teleported. On the other hand it doesn't burn 50gp and can take you to any tree the druid is familiar with, making it nearly impossible for tax collectors to be waiting on the other side. Unfortunately druids tend to be a lot less willing to aid smugglers, so your best bet might be a bard using spells that don't belong to his list.\n\nWith these methods of long range teleportation not only does trade get easier, but it also becomes possible to colonize or inhabit far away places. For instance if someone finds a gold mine in the antarctic you could set up a mine and bring food and other supplies via teleportation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Major Image (6th level slot).**\n\nMajor Image is a 3rd level spell that creates an illusion over a 20ft cube, complete with image, sound, smell and temperature. When cast with a 6th level slot or higher, it lasts indefinitely.\n\nThat my friends, is a huge spell. Why get the world's best painter to decorate the ceiling of your cathedral when you can just get an illusion made in six seconds?\n\nThe uses for decorating large buildings is already good, but remember: we're not restricted to sight.\n\nCast this on a room and it'll always be cool and smell nice. Inns would love that, as would anyone who always sleeps or works in the same room. Desert cities have never been so chill.\n\nYou can even use an illusion to make the front of your shop seem flashier, while hollering on loop to bring customers in.\n\nThe only limit to this spell is your imagination, though I'm pretty sure it was originally made just to hide secret passages.\n\nTrivia: the ki-rin (VGM163) can cast Major Image as a 6th level spell, at will. It's probably meant to give them fabulous lairs yet all it takes is someone doing the holy horsey a big favor, and it could enchant the whole city in a few hours. Shiniest city on the planet, always at a nice temperature and with a fragrance of lilac, gooseberries or whatever you want.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Simulacrum (7th).**\n\nSpend 12 hours and 1500gp worth of ruby dust, and get a clone of yourself. Notably, each caster can only have one simulacrum, regardless of who the person he cloned is.\n\nHow this changes the world? By allowing the rich and powerful to be in two places at once. Kings now have a perfect impersonator who thinks just like them. A wealthy banker can run two branches of his company. Etc.\n\nThis makes life much easier, but also competes with Continual Flame over resources.\n\nIt also gives \"go fuck yourself\" a whole new meaning, making the sentence a valid Suggestion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Clone (8th).**\n\nIf there's one spell i despise, its Clone.\n\nWizard-only preemptive resurrection. Touch spell, costs 1.000gp worth of diamonds each time, takes 120 days to come into effect, and creates a copy of the creature that the soul occupies if the original dies. Oh, and **the copy can be made younger**.\n\nWhy is it so despicable? Because it makes people effectively immortal. Accidents and assassinations just get you sent to the clone, and old age can be forever delayed because you keep going back to younger versions of yourself. Being a touch spell means the wizard can cast it on anyone he wants.\n\nIn other words: high level wizards, and only wizards, get to make anyone immortal.\n\nThat means wizards will inevitably rule any world in which this spell exists.\n\nThink about it. Rulers want to live forever. Wizards can make you live forever. Wizards want other stuff, which you must give them if you want to continue being Cloned. Rulers who refuse this deal eventually die, rulers who accept stick around forever. Natural selection makes it so that eventually the only rulers left are those who sold their soul to wizards. Figuratively, i hope.\n\nThe fact that there are only a handful of wizards out there who are high enough level to cast the spell means its easier for them organize and/or form a cartel or union (cartels/unions are easier to maintain the fewer suppliers are involved).\n\nThis leads to a dystopian scenario where mages rule, kings are authoritarian pawns and nobody else has a say in anything. Honestly it would make for a fun campaign in and of itself, but unless that's specifically what you're going for it'll just derail everything else.\n\nOh, and Clone also means any and all liches are absolute idiots. Liches are people who turned themselves into undead abominations in order to gain eternal life at the cost of having to feed on souls. They're all able to cast 9th level wizard spells, so why not just cast an 8th level one and keep undeath away? Saves you the trouble of going after souls, and you keep the ability to enjoy food or a day in the sun.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Demiplane (8th).**\n\nYour own 30ft. room of nothingness. Perfect place for storage and a DM's nightmare given how once players have access to it they'll just start looting furniture and such. Oh the horror.\n\nBut alas, infinite storage is not the reason this is a broken spell. No sir.\n\nRemember: you can access someone else's demiplane. That means a caster in city 1 can put things into a demiplane, and a caster in city 2 can pull them out of any surface.\n\nBut wait, there's more! There's nothing anywhere saying you can't have two doors to the same demiplane open at once. Now you're effectively opening a portal between two places, which stays open for a whole hour.\n\nBut wait, there's even more! Anyone from any plane can open a door to your neat little demiplane. Now we can get multiple casters from multiple planes connecting all of those places, for one hour. Sure this is a very expensive thing to do since you're having to coordinate multiple high level individuals in different planes, but the payoff is just as high. We're talking about potential integration between the most varied markets imaginable, few things in the multiverse are more valuable or profitable. Its a do-it-yourself Sigil.\n\nOne little plot hook i like about demiplanes is abandoned/inactive ones. Old wizard/warlock died, and nobody knows how to access his demiplanes. Because he's at least level 15 you just *know* there's some good stuff in there, but nobody can get to it. Now the players have to find a journal, diary, stored memory or any other way of knowing enough about the demiplane to access it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**True Polymorph (9th).**\n\nTrue Polymorph. The spell that can turn any race into any other race, or object. And vice-versa. You can go full fairy godmother and turn mice into horses. For a spell that can change anything about one's body it would not be an unusual ruling to say it can change one's sex. At the very least it can turn a man into a chair, and the chair into a woman (or vice-versa of course).\n\nBut honestly, that's just the tip of the True Polymorph iceberg. Just read this more carefully:\n\n\\> You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into a nonmagical object, *or the object into a creature*\n\nThis means you can turn a rock or twig into a human. A fully functional human with, as far as the rules go, a soul. **You can create life**.\n\nBut wait, there's more! Nothing there says you have to turn the target into a *known* creature on an *existing* creature. The narcissist bard wants to create a whole race of people who look like him? True Polymorph. A player wants to play a weird ass homebrew race and you have no idea how it would fit into the setting? True Polymorph. Wizard needs a way to quickly populate a kingdom and doesn't want to wait decades for the subjects to grow up? True Polymorph. Warlock must provide his patron 100 souls in order to free his own? True Polymorph. The sorcerer wants to do something cool? Fuck that guy, sorcerers don't get any of the fun high level spells; True Poly is available to literally every arcane caster but the sorcerer.\n\nNote: what good is Twinned Spell if all the high level twinnable spells have been specifically made unavailable to sorcerers?\n\nDo keep in mind however that this brings a whole new discussion on human rights. Does a table have rights? Does it have rights after being turned into a living thing? If it had an owner, is it now a slave? Your country will need so many new laws, just to deal with this one spell.\n\nPeople often say that high level wizards are deities for all intents and purposes. This is the utmost proof of that. Clerics don't get to create life out of thin air, wizards do. The cleric worships a deity, the wizard *is* the deity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion.**\n\nIntelligent creatures not only can game the system, but it is entirely in character for them to do so. I'll even argue that if humanoids don't use magic to improve their lives when it's available, you're pushing the suspension of disbelief.\n\nWith this post i hope to have helped you make more complex and realistic societies, as well as provide a few interesting and unusual plot hooks\n\nLastly, as much as i hate comment begging i must admit i am eager to see what spells other players think can completely change the world. Because at the end of the day we all know that extra d6 damage is not what causes empires to rise and fall, its the utility spells that make the best stories.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Added spell level to all spells, and would like to thank u/kaul_field for helping with finishing touches and being overall a great mod.",

        "body": "The only thing upon which I would expand is how this manifests politico-economically (I realise you made reference to this). Capitalism is one route, (Totalitarian) Government monopoly another, but it could get far less familiar. Perhaps magic meant that culture developed in a very different way, with very different values. \n\nIn prehistoric communities, different individuals discovered different spells. The one who became skilled in fire making discovered Create Flame, the child who always looked for berries when they were gathering with their mother discovered Goodberry, the guy determined to make friends with the wolf pup he found discovered how to Speak with Animals. This horizontal progress meant culture developed with interdependencies. Then maybe marriages would occur between these communities, to share skills. \n\nMaybe everyone came to be trained in basic magic and those with a greater affinity for it were trained further. If prestidigitation, mending and mould earth (sorry, I‚Äôm an Aussie, I can‚Äôt bring myself to spell it ‚Äòmold‚Äô) are spells everyone has, their time is freed up significantly. What do they spend it doing? Meaningful cultural practices? Individual leisure? The answer to this question would be dependent on the values which had proliferated alongside the unique context. \n\nProfessions would probably look completely different, because the cultural needs, desires and means are different. Why would extravagant, coloured silks ever develop if there were no authorities looking for a way to distinguish themselves? So what does a tailor do? And how much of their time is spent on that work? Or does everyone do their own tailoring? Or is it done together by particular people as a niche cultural practice? Or does magic mean that it doesn‚Äôt take great expertise and the job is shuffled on a cycle, along with other jobs required by the community? If a community had always shunned magic, it would be far less advanced; they might be considered by the wider world to be savages, incapable of egalitarianism and depending on backwards power structures.

You have no idea how long I've wanted to bore someone with me talking about how D&D magic would apply to a real-world situation. This post scratches a huge itch; its awesome to see another person who enjoys this like I do. I got to the part where you made an excel sheet and grinned, because I literally made an excel sheet of my own for exactly the topic you're posting about, but from a different angle.\n\nWhen thinking about all the same things you lay out here, I realized that ALL of the things I was considering had a very specific limiting factor: just how prevalent **is** magic? How many people can use it? Is it prevalent enough that just popping down to your local wizarding dry cleaner is a things that's possible, or is being a wizard something that's rare enough to be completely absent in many communities? This would *drastically* alter how magic works in the world. So I decided to try and figure that part out.\n\nTo do so I had to make some assumptions. Those assumptions were that an \"average\" person would have an ability score of 10 in any given ability, that those ability scores [varied like a bell curve](https://www.highiqpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/bell-curve.png) for IQ, and that if you wanted to be a class (wizard, bard, etc), you had to meet the pre-requisites listed in RAW for multi-classing.\n\nI assumed that the standard deviations for a population would look like this for a population of 1 million:\n\n|Deviations Above Mean:|1|2|3|4|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Ability Score:**|*10-11.5*|*11.5-13*|*13-14.5*|*14.5-16*|\n|**Number of People within this range:**|*499,000*|*158,000*|*22,000*|*1000*|\n\nOk, so right off the bat we can see something interesting: *most people can't be adventurers*. Take a look at any class in the Handbook: all classes require a **minimum** ability score of 13 in at least one ability to multi-class. That means that only 22,000 people out of a million (2.2%) can even be talented enough to have a formal class.\n\nSo where does this leave us? Well, there's 6 ability scores total. Since we know that 2.2% of all people can even have a class to begin with, we can calculate roughly how many people would have the prerequisite ability score for any given class by simply dividing: 2.2% / 6 = 0.367%. Meaning in a population of 1 million, less than 4000 people would be able to make a career out of wizarding (or any other given class). For classes like a fighter, you can use EITHER Dexterity or Strength, which doubles your chances to almost 0.75%\n\nOk, now let's check our math against a real-world example to see if this even makes sense. What percent of the US is active military? [Between half a percent and 1%, depending on the decade](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/demographics-us-military):\n\n>The United States ended the draft for military service in 1973, transitioning to the all-volunteer force that exists today. At that time, the active component of the military, excluding the coast guard, comprised¬†1.9 million men and women, or about 1 percent of the population. Now, there are about 1.3 million active-duty personnel, or less than one-half of 1 percent of the U.S. population.\n\nGiven that I calculated \\~0.75% being fighters, that's actually not bad. It could be said that this lines up relatively well!\n\nSo if we assume this calculator is roughly accurate, we can say that around 0.37% of all people can be wizards, and a maximum 1.1% of the population is capable of casting any spells (Assuming all people with a Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma over 13 can cast). Which means in a population of 1 million, just 11,000 people can cast *any* spells. This does not account for spell level; in order to figure out how many people are capable of casting spells at any given level, I'll be [assuming that the number of gamers that make it to any given tier of play](https://411mania.com/games/dd-campaign-stop-stats-level-ten-dd-beyond/) is representative. Data below, with an additional column that relates tiers of play to percent of a (random) college's population by \"tier\" (Undergrad (1), Master's (2), PhD (3), Professor (4)) just to show this is acceptably close to a real-world example:\n\n|Tier of Play|Max Spell Slot Level (Wizard)|D&D|College|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1 (Lvl 1-4)|2|62.8%|76.8%|\n|2 (Lvl 5-10)|5|26.9%|10.1%|\n|3 (11-16)|8|4.9%|7.5%|\n|4 (17-20)|9|5.4%|5.6%|\n\nSince wizards don't get a 5th level slot until level 9, more than 2/3's of all casters would be unable to cast 5th level slots. I say more than 2/3's because you'd be well into the end of tier 2 before you got it (I'll go with 75% cannot cast 5th level and above just for a round number). So in a population of 1 million, you have less than 4000 wizards (assuming all people with aptitude become wizards) and 1/4 of that is about 900 maximum that are capable of 5th level spells. I assume \\~50% enrollment in my world (meaning 450 people are *actually* wizards), but we can assume 100%.\n\nSo you have 3100 lower-level wizards and 900 wizards that can cast 5th level spells per million people. Wizards specialize into schools, so it's not ridiculous to say that you'd end up with something like 100 Conjurers, 100 Abjurers, so on and so forth.\n\nThere is ONE work-around to this that I know of, RAW: *Magic Initiate. Ritual Caster* exists, but you still need an Int or Wis of 13, which means most people are still barred from it. However, *Magic Initiate* is available to anyone that can use a feat. So hypothetically, you can have commoner artisans that know 2 cantrips and a once-a-day use of a 1st level spell.\n\nHaving said all of this, the numbers you use will obviously depend on your campaign and how YOU define how magic is distributed. For my numbers and my campaign, a well-educated region of 1 million people would have maybe 30-50 people capable of wizard spells like *teleport*, making their services very in-demand. Conjurers would likely be on a rotation of casting *teleportation circle* for a year to make one permanent, and that would represent an investment for them.",

        "body": "This is the main reason I considered how common magic is in my world. Essentially I've rebooted my universe 3 times, and in the latest version: Wielders of magic are very rare.\n\nMagic was originally only wielded by Dragons. Dragons used it to sparingly, and for the sake of survival. They knew they had the power to destroy the world, and were careful in how they used it.\n\nSo when Elves discovered magic Dragons immediately set out to confront them in a bloody war, knowing very well that, in time, the gift of magic would be misused by the lesser races. The war ended, dragons barely \"won\" and elves were left crippled in numbers. Barely any survived. Magic was, however taught to the humanoids by a rogue dragon. For a reason unrelated to this topic.\n\nWizards: Must possess incredible mental capacity, willpower or near buddha level of calm to wield spells effectively. Those that don't meet the cut don't go beyond casting 3rd level. \n\nDruids: Innately connected to the Nature around them, and an art only practiced in a specific nation. It was a gift from the Fey, and can only be given by the Fey.\n\nSorcerers: Very rare, rarer than Wizards. Unlike wizards they have an instinctive understanding of magic. Wizards walk on eggshells when they cast magic, knowing full well that one wrong incantation could mean disaster. Sorcerers enjoy a more biological usage of arcabe powers, and circumvent these limitations.\n\nClerics: Also known as \"Avatars\" by folk. They, too, are rare and are eidolons of individual Gods. Avatars are given a purpose and task, with the divine power to see them through. \n\nPaladins: Make use of metaphysical concepts of limitations and promises, first discovered by Devils, who themselves use this technique to make contracts.\n\nWarlocks: Receipients of the metaphysical concept of Promises and oaths. Power overwhelming! At the mercy if another's hand...\n\nThere is only real one nation in the entire world with a large focus on magic. They are atheistic and science oriented. If my PCs ever visit that place I'm going to make it Magic City(TM), an Arcane Disney land unlike anywhere else.\n\nGreat Post, BTW :)",

Liches are people who turned themselves into undead abominations in order to gain eternal life at the cost of having to feed on souls. They're all able to cast 9th level wizard spells, so why not just cast an 8th level one and keep undeath away? Saves you the trouble of going after souls, and you keep the ability to enjoy food or a day in the sun.\n\nThis bothered me for the longest time until I had an epiphany a few days ago: Liches weren't 15th level casters when they became liches.\n\nThink about it. Like you said, no one who could cast Clone would become a lich, so they were wizards who didn't make it to a high enough level in their lifespan and had to settle for lichdom. And of course, what do they do with their new unlife? Keep practicing wizardry. Even if Clone doesn't work for you anymore, there is still all of the other reality breaking stuff a wizard could do.\n\nSo when you fight Alfredek the Eternal, he's a 20th level Wizard because he spent the last few thousand years studying magic, but before he became a lich he was just Alfred the octogenarian who could cast *Bigby's Hand* once per long rest and realized he wouldn't make it to *Clone* in time so he was going to have to dial up Orcus and ask for the lich-juice recipe.",

You could only have six such portals open at once, but they were always open (unless you closed them), were large enough to move a cart through, and where the portal opened up in the casino could be moved, too. The DM had intended for us to start doing all sorts of quests to gain the favor of the various deities, so he could steer the plot where he wanted.\n\nMe and my buddy, who had created a pair of rogues which grew up orphaned and hated the various governments, decided we were going to revolutionize the country by creating a mystic marketplace and interconnected trading empire. We started designing which cities we would open the original portals to, how to design the casino to best facilitate trade while prioritizing safety, how to utilize the newfound money to benefit the poor... the DM had no idea what to do with us and ended up canceling the campaign.\n\nIt's a shame, 'cause I was really interested in what we could do with that campaign.",

Depending on whether or not people can learn second level rituals without class levels ... that spell fundamentally alters the food economy. It means cattle can be slaughtered at distance from population centers. It means high-protein diets are no longer the provenance of the rich and the necessary feasting when you slaughter a bull can turn into regular meals. \n\nI mitigate some of these effects at the worldbuilding level by limiting the amount of magical knowledge in society. I have a table in my head (and a spreadsheet) of *exactly* how many people can cast any given spell of 4th level or higher on the continent. That number, in a population of 50 million, is usually fewer than 1,000. \n\nYou're absolutely right: the worldbreaking stuff is in the cantrips and 1st and 2nd level spells.\n\nI also have seven pages of house rules just on spells, because of this crap. Here are a few. \n\n*Friends* is the cantrip of choice for people engaged in security under conditions where they would rather not get into an actual fight, like court, or brothels, or casinos, or alchemical shops full of explosives and glass jars. Powerful people who have to maintain a social presence in places where violence would be damaging employ a ‚Äúsiren‚Äù ‚Äì someone who can cast this spell and understands how to manipulate people with it, without provoking unnecessary hostility after the fact.   \n\nThe *Shape Water* cantrip is extremely powerful underwater, more so for those who are trained in its nuances. It can create a five-foot-square block of ice, which has a lifting capacity in salt water of about 6,000 pounds and 180 hit points. It can create immediate three-quarters cover, and can be used to build makeshift barricades that will last an hour, as long as the ice is anchored to the ground. The spell can be used to extend the range of a crossbow bolt underwater by 8 feet with a turn of preparation and 17 feet with two turns, by creating a tunnel in the water. It can also be used to spray concealment in 125-cubic-foot increments.\n\n*Purify Food and Drink* is commonly used as a ritual to preserve fish and game from the field. Without ice, it is the only way to transport fresh fish safely across distances, from the coast inland. A quarant will regularly work in town and city markets where fresh food is sold, casting the spell every hour or so. Customers will place their fish and poultry and other fresh edibles in large baskets in the vestal bay ‚Äì a circular sanctified rack 10 feet across and six feet high, with space for 50 baskets. The quarant typically charges a sovereign a casting, divided up among those with a basket to treat. Half the quarant‚Äôs revenue is given to the city or the church ‚Äì the rest is the quarant‚Äôs pay.",

Soon, these businesses build into an industry. There are not enough casters available yet to industrialize higher level spells than those, but soon...\n\nAn effect of natural selection comes into place: A lot of people loose their jobs due to this new \"magical revolution\" such as regular doctors who are pushed off the maret by magical healing or artisans who do not have enough work to hold themselves up now that Mending is on the market. On the other hand, magic users gain a growing and stable place on the market, which results in greater and greater numbers of individuals with potential to work different kinds of magic in upcoming generations.\n\nSince there are more and more of these individuals, the market of magic grow and grows, becming available for more and more people, and involving higher and higher level spells.\n\nAnd than, after a time, the whole thing will start to colapse on itself. It is a multidiemnsonal question to ask when, but eventually, gems will start to run out, and with them overused magic as well. Priced spellcomponents would go for double triple or in some cases even ten times of their normal price.

BUt it can easily be nerfed with the ruling, that (since every clone is somewhat imperfect) there is a stacking chance of faliure to clone a clone based on the generation it is from.\n\n**True Polymorph:** It has no priced components, and it can turn a creature into any kind of object that is no larger than it is. \"Anyone wans some cowsized diamonds for their spells in this needing time?\"",

    "body": "Recently I've seen a large influx of posts from people commenting that stopping all their products or missing out on their routine for a few days drastically improved their skin. With so many people reporting this, I figured making a trouble-shooting post about it for quick reference might really help! Maybe we can link to this post so these questions don't go unanswered while still prioritizing more rare or complex questions asked here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's LOOOTS of reasons why your skin may have improved with some down time, so here's some things to consider if (specifically) nothing has changed except discontinuing your routine! :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- You may have been cleansing too often. Maybe your cleanser is actually a good choice for your skin, but using it twice a day is more than your skin needs. Try skipping out on the morning cleanse and aim for once a day at night time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Your cleanser may be straight up too harsh. There's a lot of factors that can play into this, but if your skin feels tight, dry, 'squeaky clean', or uncomfortable after cleansing, it might be time to ditch that product. If you're looking for a more gentle or less drying cleansing method, consider the double cleanse! Start off with a non-fragrant oil to break everything down, and then go in with a gentle, fragrance free cleanser to whisk all that away. There's tons of posts on this sub addressing this method and providing product recs if you're interested.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- You're using micellar water and not washing it off. I realize micellar waters are marketed as cleansers that don't require water, but leaving surfactants on your skin can cause dryness and irritation. If you're going to use a micellar water, it should be part of a two step cleanse - It's not an excuse to skip out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- You're using makeup wipes. Cue the SCA police! /s. But seriously, same thing as micellar water - wipes are often irritating, tug and pull at the skin, and are fragrant. If you're going to use one, again, make it part of a two step cleansing process.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- User error. This is an interesting one, but definitely a point to be considered. Actives are all the rage these days (and for a good reason), but it's really easy to get carried away. If these were in your routine, consider cutting down how often you  use them. If your skin is looking better with some down time, maybe it's because it's recovering from over-exfoliating or persistent exposure to (what is normally good) actives. This also applies to manual scrubs and cleansing tools! Another thing to consider is how actives play a role with other products and when and where they should be used in your routine. For example: Using a retinoid when your skin is still wet can enhance irritation, and using an occlusive (like vaseline) over a retinoid can increase penetration and lead to increased irritation. Consider a method called buffering, and search this sub for how to specifically use certain actives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Your routine contains irritating or sensitizing ingredients. OOOOH boy. This is a long one, particularly because there's just so \\*many\\* things that can do this. But a good place to start evaluating ingredients is by checking for the following: Fragrance/parfum, alcohol, essential oils, fragrant plant oils, weird plant extracts (things like berries and flowers and shit),    methylchloroisothiazolinone (an irritating preservative), sodium lauryl sulfate, lanolin (which you can develop an allergy to), and dyes (particularly red dyes). Your product may also be formulated at an unsuitable pH. Checking for these things can get really overwhelming, but that's okay! Websites like Skincarisma and Cosdna break down individual product ingredients pretty well and can give you a good baseline when looking at a product. NOTE: Alcohol is not a bad ingredient!! But when you are specifically having problems, it's worth cutting out. NOTE: Fragrance is a no, regardless of whether you have a visible reaction to it or not. You can develop a fragrance allergy at any time. Fragrance has no place in skincare.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- You aren't wearing sunscreen. Yes, yes. We're vampires here at SCA. But seriously, using actives in a routine without sunscreen can really contribute to a multitude of problems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- It's a you thing. This one sucks, but it's just the reality. Sometimes certain ingredients are generally well tolerated, but your skin alone reacts negatively to them. This is the case for me and coconut, jojoba, and rosehip oil, for example. Generally great ingredients, but they're just not for me. :( If you suspect a particular ingredient allergy/sensitivity, the only real way to verify this is to patch test. Everyone is different, and while studies can tell us what's generally not a good idea for our skin (fragrance, for example), a large part of skincare is trial and error.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- EDIT: You're using natural products, or you're DIYing something you shouldn't be. Sigh.. This one is sure to cause controversy, but hear me out. Natural is NOT better. Poison ivy is natural, but that doesn't make rubbing it on your face a good idea! The thing with 'natural' products is that many of them contain extracts (this kind of goes back to the sensitizing ingredient point). Plant extracts are not pure, single compounds (like glycerin, for example). These extracts consist of a conglomeration of different chemical compounds, and while a few of those parts may be good for your skin, a lot of those parts may not be. This is the advantage of having 'synthetic' products - you reduce the potential of having a reaction because there's fewer chemical compounds to interact with. The same applies to DIY skincare - just because you can eat it doesn't mean you should put it on your face. Also worth noting is that concentration of ingredients is vital when DIYing. Formulating is a complex science, but if you're set on making your own products (with substantiated science and actual commercial ingredients, I highly reccomend /r/DIYbeauty ). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Your skincare expired. CHECK EXPIRATION DATES PEOPLE!! I believe you can use  [http://www.checkfresh.com/](http://www.checkfresh.com/)  with a batch code to verify a product is still in a usable condition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf and when you decide to reintroduce your routine, I highly suggest going slow. One product at a time with patch testing (as hard as it is..). I personally think it's ideal to figure out your moisturizer game \\*first\\*, then your cleanser, and \\*then\\* your sunscreen. All in that order. Everything after that is supplemental anyway, and should be added in slowly once your baseline routine is established.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope these considerations and resources help! These are just a few reasons that come to mind, but please feel free to comment anything else to add down below. :)",

He had undergone the neural template application and the memory implants and the mnemonic training like the rest of the Most Highs of the Fleet and the crews of the ships and even the lowliest maintenance worker.\n\nDuring the rest of the trip, almost six months, he had felt... well... weird.\n\nHis joints had ached. His uniforms had fit poorly and had to be retailored. He was hungrier all the time to the point where he had asked the ship's doctor to check him for some kind of parasite.\n\nHe had always been a large Lanaktallan. Larger than his peers, calmer in many ways. He was renown for his analytical skills and pattern recognition as well as his devotion to the Great Herd.\n\nNow he was much taller than the others. A full head above them.\n\nHis crew would not admit it, but his presence calmed them. Made them feel more able to complete their tasks, more confident.\n\nThe headaches had ceased when the others continued.\n\nHe wasn't sure why he had suffered the problem. The ship's doctor said that perhaps so long in hyperspace he may have been effected by the energies. He wasn't the only one. The entire Task Force had been drawn from the Hulmouta System, crewed exclusively by the Executors of that system.\n\nAccording to the ship's doctor, many in the Task Force, especially those in important and leadership positions were showing the same symptoms.\n\nMro'odaDa'ay had thought about having his fleet drop out of hyperspace, but instead had kept on with the mission to destroy TerraSol and put these primates in their place.\n\nThe Executor Fleet was meant to be the final hammer blow to crack open the primate's defenses and allow the combined fleet to ensure the end of the TerraSol System.\n\nWhen the ships of his Task Force, which had a nine digit number that looked oddly like a rough spelling of the nu'utooroo fruit on the planet he had grown up, dropped from hyperspace to outside the orbit of the furthest planet but inside the Oort Cloud, he had immediately ordered his Task Force to cease movement.\n\nHis crew did not argue even as he stared at the Task Force number for his fleet.\n\nIt was odd. He had started to notice months ago that some things with absolutely no relationship to a second object sometimes reminded him or vaguely appeared like that second object. The patterning of the Most High Navigator of his vessel, for instant, reminded him of smiling Gupti Squeaklings. He didn't know why, but every time he saw the Most High Navigator he was reminded of the neo-sapient infants.\n\nIt was odd.\n\n\"Scanner, what is the status of the Corporate Fleet?\" Mru'udaDa'ay asked, sitting in his command cradle.\n\nThe Most High Scanner Technician looked up from his instruments. \"They appear to be completely destroyed, Most High.\"\n\n\"Harumph,\" Mru'udaDa'ay answered, examining his own screens. \"The Military Fleet?\"\n\n\"50% and dropping. The Terra planetary batteries are still engaging them at point blank range,\" the tech said.\n\n\"What is the firing time for each cannon of a planetary siege battery? In minutes is fine,\" Mru'uDa'ay asked.\n\nThe scanner tech hummed to himself and looked up. \"Twelve shots a minute,\" the tech said. \"I checked twice. Even the siege guns on the ninth planet, which is currently still breaking apart, are firing at least ten shots a minute.\"\n\nThat made Mru'udaDa'ay curl his tendrils in surprise. Most planetary batteries could only fire once every ten or fifteen minutes.\n\n\"What about their nCv Cannon Batteries?\" Mru'udaDa'ay asked.\n\n\"Fifteen to twenty a minute. Almost as if they weren't firing such massive shells,\" the scanner tech said.\n\n\"Sir, course?\" His Most High Navigator asked.\n\nMru'udaDa'ay shook his head. \"No. Keep engines at full stop. Drop the battle-screens, particle and debris shields only. Take our guns offline.\"\n\n\"May I ask why, Most High?\" the gunner officer asked.\n\nMru'udaDa'ay stared at his screen. \"This is an unwinnable fight, and I will not cost the Great Herd talented and able bodied individuals such as those who make up my crews,\" he said.\n\n\"What will you do?\" the Navigator asked.\n\n\"We will wait. Perhaps I am wrong. Perhaps a ship will land a lucky shot and disable a shield. Perhaps Terra itself will suddenly break up,\" Mru'udaDa'ay said.\n\n\"And perhaps nupti birds will burst from my anal cavity and sing us all a song,\" A'arkretak, Grand Most High of the Ground Forces said. He turned and looked at Mru'udaDa'ay. \"Fighting the Terrans on the ground would be like a cud expecting not to be chewed when it is put in the mouth. Primates excel at ground combat and these primates have known nothing but war their entire existence.\"\n\n\"I concur,\" Kleka'atak, Grand Most High of Aerospace Fighters stated. \"We have taken horrendous casualties already and the only planet that appears to have broken up is one that barely qualifies as a planetary body.\"\n\n\"And it still fights on,\" A'arkretak noted. \"Any other species would have stopped fighting.\"\n\nThe lights blinked for a moment.\n\n\"Inform Engineering that we may have electrical issues,\" Mru'udaDa'ay stated.\n\n\"Or it's the Terran Electronic Warfare having found and boarded us,\" Kleka'atak said. His mother had named him after the sound the nupti birds made in the evening.\n\n\"GIVE THAT MAN A CIGAR!\" roared out over the speakers. A Terran female's voice. \"Well well well. This is interesting. Why aren't you moving in with the others?\"\n\n\"The fight is lost. We would retreat if we could, but that option is unavialable,\" Mru'udaDa'ay stated, signaling at his bridge crew to remain calm. \"However, unlike my people, I do believe yours say: surrender *or* be destroyed.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes we do,\" the voice said. The holotank flickered and a Terran appeared. She was entirely made out of light with streaming lines of code running through her. \"Give the orders to the other ships to continue standing down and I won't rip this ship apart around you.\"\n\n\"Coms. You heard her. Pass on my instructions. Remain in position, all offensive systems offline,\" Mru'udaDa'ay ordered.\n\nThe Communications Most High nodded and signaled. When he got the responses he looked up. \"All ships acknowledge, Grand Most High.\"\n\n\"You are one of the Terran Confederacy's Digital Sentiences,\" A'arkretak stated.\n\n\"Yes. Very astute,\" the DS said. \"I am Oort Singer-98832, Colonel, Terran Defense Force.\"\n\n\"The way your code flows to approximate human clothing to replicate modesty is strange but pleasing to the eye,\" Kleka'atak stated.\n\n\"It's what?\" Singer asked.\n\n\"Your gloves, the edges look like the edges of stellipa plants, who's fragrance is pleasing,\" the Most High Gunnery Officer said. \"Your outfit is aesthetically pleasing.\"\n\n\"Shit,\" Oort said. She held out a blot of code. \"Does this remind any of you anything?\"\n\nEach crew member looked at Mru'udaDa'ay, who nodded, cocking his head and looking at the blot.\n\nThe answered varied, a few argued and moved to see it from another member of the bridge crew's position and either agreed or argued it looked like something else.\n\n\"All right, I'm calling in reinforcements to help me out. Do you surrender?\" Oort asked.\n\n\"Do I have your oath to treat my men with the respect and dignity my people would not afford you?\" Mru'udaDa'ay asked.\n\nShe sighed. \"Yes. Keep your drives, tactical systems, weapons, and battlescreens offline. I'll mark you as surrendered.\"\n\nMru'udaDa'ay nodded as his bridge crew made sounds and postures of relief. \"Your oath is appreciated. I do not wish to throw my men's lives away.\"\n\nOort stared for a long moment. \"You know, a lot of you in this fleet are bigger than most Lanaktallan. Any reason?\"\n\n\"Our world is high gravity, almost a third again the gravity of your world. Perhaps that is it?\" A'arkretak said.\n\n\"Huh. Another data point. Man, I hate weird stuff and you bio-people are weird. All right, hold tight, we'll sit out the fight out here,\" Oort said.\n\n\"You do not think my people will prevail?\" one of the crew asked.\n\nOort shook her head. \"No. Striking Terra has never worked.\"\n\nThere was silence on the bridge.\n\n\"May we bring up our scanners?\" Mru'udaDa'ay asked.\n\n\"Sure. We've got a good seat, we might as well watch,\" Oort said. She summoned up a chair with the wave of her hand. \"Your other ships are boarded. Odd, all of you are bigger than normal. I wonder why.\"\n\nMru'udaDa'ay just made a non-commital motion and watched as the screen came on.\n\nIt was regrettable, what was happening. He would have stopped the others if he could.\n\nBut he could not.\n\nHe could only watch and feel sadness as the Military Fleet made the same mistakes as the Corporate Fleet, followed by the Executor Fleet making the same mistakes.\n\nThere was just something strange.\n\nAbout it all.\n\nHe knew, right then, that the attacks on the other systems were doomed to fail also.\n\nHe didn't know how.\n\nHe just knew.\n\nIt was strange.\n\n\\[[first](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/f94rak/oc_pthok_eats_an_ice_cream_cone/)\\] \\[[prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/id412x/first_contact_285_total_war_terrasol/)\\] \\[[next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/idse54/first_contact_286_total_war_terrasol/)\\]",

In minutes is fine,\" Mru'uDa'ay asked.  \n>  \n>The scanner tech hummed to himself and looked up. \"Twelve shots a minute,\" the tech said. \"I checked twice.\n\nI‚Äôd check too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Even the siege guns on the ninth planet, which is currently still breaking apart, are firing at least ten shots a minute.\"\n\n‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need no steenkin‚Äô planet!‚Äù\n\nLooks like the Lanaktallans decided to end the debate about whether Pluto is a planet once and for all ‚Ä¶\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>That made Mru'udaDa'ay curl his tendrils in surprise. Most planetary batteries could only fire once every ten or fifteen minutes.\n\n*Lanaktallan* batteries. Terrans do things differently.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"What about their nCv Cannon Batteries?\" Mru'udaDa'ay asked.  \n>  \n>\"Fifteen to twenty a minute. Almost as if they weren't firing such massive shells,\" the scanner tech said.\n\nHah. Probably using Alcubierre shenanigans.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Mru'udaDa'ay shook his head. \"No. Keep engines at full stop. Drop the battle-screens, particle and debris shields only. Take our guns offline.\"  \n>  \n>\"May I ask why, Most High?\" the gunner officer asked.  \n>  \n>Mru'udaDa'ay stared at his screen. \"This is an unwinnable fight, and I will not cost the Great Herd talented and able bodied individuals such as those who make up my crews,\" he said.\n\nTranslation: ‚ÄúHahaha NOPE. Screw that. We will die.‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"We will wait. Perhaps I am wrong. Perhaps a ship will land a lucky shot and disable a shield. Perhaps Terra itself will suddenly break up,\" Mru'udaDa'ay said.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe that for a second, but I‚Äôm not going into that hellhole.‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"And perhaps nupti birds will burst from my anal cavity and sing us all a song,\" A'arkretak, Grand Most High of the Ground Forces said.\n\n‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs gonna happen.‚Äù Also, I think this is the first time I‚Äôve ever seen a Lanaktallan use a sense of humour.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He turned and looked at Mru'udaDa'ay. \"Fighting the Terrans on the ground would be like a cud expecting not to be chewed when it is put in the mouth. Primates excel at ground combat and these primates have known nothing but war their entire existence.\"\n\nTranslation: ‚ÄúI know what will happen if I put my men down there. Fuck that.‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"I concur,\" Kleka'atak, Grand Most High of Aerospace Fighters stated. \"We have taken horrendous casualties already and the only planet that appears to have broken up is one that barely qualifies as a planetary body.\"\n\nTen thousand Pluto apologists spontaneously become psykers on the spot ‚Ä¶\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"And it still fights on,\" A'arkretak noted. \"Any other species would have stopped fighting.\"\n\nI like the casual way they‚Äôre discussing this. ‚ÄúThese primates are so insane that they win because they don‚Äôt know they should be losing.‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The lights blinked for a moment.  \n>  \n>\"Inform Engineering that we may have electrical issues,\" Mru'udaDa'ay stated.  \n>  \n>\"Or it's the Terran Electronic Warfare having found and boarded us,\" Kleka'atak said. His mother had named him after the sound the nupti birds made in the evening.\n\nWow, these guys are definitely on the ball today.\n\n(Continued)",

I have noticed a few points that could point to this:\n\n* The timeframes possibly match. These lanks, while already closer to the Stallions/Matrons than your average lank, started changing around six months ago. Humanity was reset fairly recently in the story too. The time shenanigans around Hesstla could account for any inconsistencies\n* What is happening to the two races definitely  has similarities. Humanity's neural pathways were reset to a pre-glassing state (i.e. before we started tweaking things to protect our allies); the new Lanaktallan psychic abilities and pattern recognition are likely throwbacks as well. This could be the same effect, manifested in a different way - these lanaktallans have been reset to their pre-self gentling state\n* This is a reach, but proximity. All the lanks in this taskforce are from the same planet/system, if their location in hyperspace was physically close (or close in some other way) to the where squids reached back in time they could have been caught in the effect \n* Messing with time leads to worse outcomes. The squids reached back to reset the humans, could they have accidentally brought back the stallion/matrons? The leadership castes of the race that beat them in the precursor war?",

Yes, you can squeeze it yourself or pay more for fresh squeezed, but there are still going to be people who would rather just buy a jug of it already made at the cheapest price they can.\n\nedit: it seems like most of the people who responded aren't concerned about changing the process itself, necessarily, just that companies are up-front and honest about it. I think that makes perfect sense - I don't really buy orange juice, so I hadn't thought about the fact that they're not exactly explaining all this on the back of the bottle.\n\nHonestly I think it would work out best for them in the long run if they stopped pretending the oranges go straight from the orchard to your mouth, and were clear about what treatments and processes they used.\n\nsecond edit: people seem to think I don't understand any other possible way to get orange juice, which isn't the case. I know you can buy oranges and juice them. I'm saying that it seems like people enjoy the convenience of going to the store and buying a big jug of juice without having to do the work, but some were complaining about the process involved in getting that juice to them. I'm saying that it's not like companies can just *not* remove the oxygen and go \"oh sorry guys, didn't realize you wanted it fresh.\" If people want ready-made juice in the refrigerator aisle all across ohio and wisconsin and colorado at low prices, they'll have to accept that there's going to be some industrial process involved. That being said, it's not unreasonable to want companies to tell you when they're doing things like that (it may be an unrealistic expectation, but not an unreasonable one).\n\nthird edit: For all the people addressing me directly about my OJ habits - dunno if I mentioned this, but I don't even drink orange juice. If I wanted to, I would just eat a goddamn orange because that's pretty much all it is anyway.\n\n^(fourth edit: dunno if I deserve it, but thanks for the gold =)^)",

Also, all food in US and Canada is highly regulated, so you need to do millions of dollars of testing before you can get any new additive certified as safe to eat. It's EXTREMELY difficult for additives to avoid being on the label.\n\nNow, by definition, all foods are dead and dying things. North Americans like consistency in their products. Remember that OJ that was sweet in the summer and sour in winter, they don't make that anymore. Foods differ from region to region and season to season. So, if a company wants to ship dead and dying products with consistent quality, all days of the year, to millions of people across the land, at a reasonable price, they need to do a lot more than have a guy hand-squeeze a fruit in front of your eyes before you drink it. They do the best they can to keep it natural and consistent and affordable. Want freshly squeezed? Wait until the fair is in town and pay $6 for a glass that may taste different from last year.\n\n^* Edit: for grammar. Thanks /u/Anachronym",

Because of the citric acid. Why was there citric acid? To kill the botulism. Why was there botulism? Because harvesters routinely picked up dirt (which contained the botulism) instead of tomato plants are crops are not perfectly symmetrical. Why were the tomato farms using harvesters instead of labor? Because they were fighting Cesar Chavez.",

I knew she loved perfumes. She had a pretty expensive collection.\n\nWhen I was over at her apartment, I took a picture of her perfumes. She had a lot of samples too so I took pictures of those.\n\nI found a perfume that I thought she would like. She loved her Christmas present.\n\nI told a friend how I got my gf the perfect present. He was in trouble with his wife because he flubbed his gift. He said it was creepy, too much effort for a rebound, and I should never tell her.\n\nI was planning on telling her. I didn‚Äôt think it was creepy. AITA?\n\n____\n*Consensus: NTA. The word genius was used 2 times.*\n____\n\n># Notable Comments:\n\n- \n\nNTA and your friend is a tool. You didn't break into her apartment and read her journal to find out her deepest wish from 2nd grade was to own some Tom Ford Lost Cherry. You took a picture of her perfume collection to refer back to so that you knew what scent notes she was drawn to and you didn't purchase something she already had. That isn't invasive, it's a good way to get a good gift. [Bac7](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/18txk0b/aita_for_snooping_through_my_gfs_stuff_for_her/kfhze1g/)\n\n- \n\nThis is bothering me because in my mind, taking pictures of her things is weird and creepy. But for some reason, writing them down and taking notes on what she has isn't creepy. Same result, just easier. I think what's throwing me off is that the actual act of taking pictures of someones stuff is typically taboo. I know my wife and son have taken a look at my collectables to pick out a gift for me before, so I'm going to go with NTA. [NoticeImaginary](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/18txk0b/aita_for_snooping_through_my_gfs_stuff_for_her/kfh269g/)\n\n____\n>#[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/18valt6/update_aita_for_snooping_through_my_gfs_stuff_for/) \n*December 31, 2023, 2 days later*\n\nThanks for the feedback. My gf did exactly what I thought she would do and she asked how I got her the perfect Christmas gift. I could smell the perfume on her which made me happy.\n\nI got her Zoologist Bee and Hummingbird. Based on her collection, she liked gourmands (sweets) and florals. She liked complicated scents and had a few niche ones. She didn‚Äôt have any Zoologist scents yet so I also got her a few samples.\n\nA couple of people suggested I shouldn‚Äôt tell her about opening her perfume drawer to look at her samples. But I didn‚Äôt feel right hiding that. So I told her that I took a few pictures of her perfume collection and all her samples so I could get her the perfect present.\n\nShe was quiet for a while. It made a bit nervous that I messed up. But then she hugged me and smothered with kisses. She said I was the perfect boyfriend and she wanted to marry me. I was thrilled since she was a bit reluctant to get in a relationship with me after being burned.\n\nTo be clear, she didn‚Äôt cheat, her husband cheated on her and left her for his coworker. They legally separated and my gf moved into her new apartment. I met her a couple months later. She asked me out the day she met me because she thought I was hot. We went on a date and I told her I wasn‚Äôt a casual relationship guy so she had to be fully in. We started officially dating six months ago and it‚Äôs been a dream.\n\nShe got me an awesome birthday present too. A trip to a country I‚Äôve always wanted to visit. She had been asking me about my vacation days and when I planned to use it.\n\nMy gf said she wanted to plunge into Zoologist but she had a few hangups. Her ex thought she was wasting her money and scolded her about it a lot. He even threw away some of her perfume which makes no sense imo. She thanked me for breaking that and getting her her new signature scent.\n\nShoutout to all the fragrance subreddits for helping me find the perfect perfumes.\n\n____\n\n*I'm not the original poster.*",

Nakita ko tong lotion na 'to ng Luxe Organix na naka B1T1 for Php 405, kaya naisipan kong subukan. 2 variant yung binili ko, itong Retinol + Gluta, tsaka yung Niacinamide + Arbutin. \n\nTLDR:\n\nMay microfoaming, malakas ang fragrance, heavier skin feel kumpara sa ibang serum lotions sa Market, mali-mali ang IL, mislabeled dahil imbes na retinol, Retinyl Palmitate ang laman base sa IL. \n\nUnahin muna nating tingnan ang packaging. Sa unang tingin, di nalalayo material sa packaging ng mga serum lotion ng Vaseline. Tho, yung sa Vaseline, rounded yung tabas ng seal ng tube sa both sides, samantalang itong sa LO ay pointed. \n\nSa itsura naman mismo ng laman, off-white na medyo madilaw yung kulay ng lotion. Medyo clumpy din yung itsura pagkalabas nito sa tube, at madali ding mag-break yung emulsion upon skin contact. Malakas yung fragrance nya na dominated ng floral notes. Unang naisip ko nga nung naamoy ko e amoy poon, dahil sa sobrang floral. \n\nMedyo matagal ipahid sa balat, kumpara sa ibang serum lotion na nasubukan ko na. Naka-observe din ako ng microfoaming during application nitong lotion. Ang microfoaming ito yung nagkakaroon ng puti-puting streaks sa balat habang pinapahid ang isang product, kadalasan mga emulsion gaya ng lotion at creams. Ang microfoaming ay dulot ng pagkaka-trap ng air sa product habang ipinapahid sa balat. Kung ikukumpara ko ito sa ibang serum lotion na nagamit ko na (Vaseline Gluta-Hya Serum Burst Lotion, Smoochkins Nia-Arbutin Nano White Serum Lotion), ito yung pinaka heavy ang skin feel. Hindi ko masyadong na-feel yung pagka serum lotion. And lastly naka-experience din ako ng pamumula at pantal sa braso ko after ko gamitin itong lotion na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list. \n\nWater (Aqua), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Myristate, Fragrance, C15-19 Alkane, Stearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Triethanolamine, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Glutathione, Polysorbate 20, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ceramide NP, Mannitol, Pentylene Glycol, CI19140, Phosphatidylcholine, Retinyl Palmitate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Chloride, Polyglyceryl-10,  Citric Acid, Tocopherol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nHindi na talaga nawala ang mga errors sa IL ng mga local products. Di yata talaga uso ipa-check man lang sa regulatory personnel ang IL na ilalagay sa final layout ng packaging bago ang ipa-mass printing. Para sa product na ito, hindi Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol ang tamang INCI name, kung hindi Cetearyl Alcohol. Next, Polyglyceryl-10, what? Incomplete yung ingredient name. Ang daming Polyglyceryl-10 esters na nag eexist, wag nyo na kami paghulain. (Side Note: Ang Polyglyceryl-10 esters ay kadalasang ginagamit as non-ionic emulsifier sa cosmetics.). \n\nPangalawa kong napansin, CI19140. Ang CI19140 ay isang dye na kilala din bilang Tartrazine Yellow or FD&C Yellow #5. Ito yung nagbigay ng medyo madilaw na kulay sa lotion na ito. Konektado ito sa kasunod kong punto. \n\nIkatlo, bakit Retinyl Palmitate ang nakalista dito sa IL? Kaya nyo ba nilagyan ng Yellow #5 ang lotion na ito para magmukhang may retinol, kasi nakakapagdulot ng paninilaw sa mga product ang retinol kapag ihinalo ito? Ngayon, ano ba ang problema kung retinyl palmitate ang nakalagay, imbes na retinol? Ito kasi yun: maliban sa obvious na mislabelling sa product na ito, mas mababa ang potency ng retinyl palmitate kaysa sa retinol. Sa buong retinoid family, ang mga retinyl esters kagaya ng retinyl palmitate ang may pinakamababang potency, dahil kailangan pa nito ng isang extra conversion step (retinyl palmitate -> retinol). Tandaan, ang mga retinoids, kailangang ma-convert into retinoic acid para ma-activate ang retinoic acid receptors natin sa balat at makuha ang benefits. \n\nRetinyl esters -> Retinol -> Retinaldehyde -> Retinoic Acid\n\nKada conversion step, bumababa ang potency ng isang retinoid, kaya sa kaso ng retinyl palmitate, na isang retinyl ester, eto ang may pinakamababang potency. \n\nMay peptides din pala itong lotion na ito: Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9 at Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11.\n\nAng acetyl tetrapeptide-9 ay isang signaling peptide na nagbibigay ng message sa fibroblasts sa ating dermis na magproduce ng collagen (specifically Collagen Type 1) at proteoglycans, na mahalaga para mapanatili ang structure at mapanatiling tight (hindi sagging) ang balat natin.  Nakakatulong din itong mabawasan ang appearance ng fine lines sa mukha, dahil na rin sa stimulation ng collagen at proteoglycan production. \n\nKung ang dermis ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, ang epidermis naman ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-11. Kagaya ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, signaling peptide din ito na nagbibigay ng mensahe sa epidermis na mag-synthesize o magproduce ng Syndecan-1 at Collagen XVII. Kapag mataas ang dalawang ito sa balat, nag-iimprove ang elasticity ng balat. \n\nKaramihan ng mga nabanggit na benepisyo ng dalawang peptides na ito ay base pa lamang sa mga in-vitro studies na naisagawa na. Wala pang gaanong in-vivo clinical studies na lumabas kaya medyo skeptical pa din ako sa mga peptides na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo lastly sa product claims. \n\n* Retinol + Gluta\n\n* Whitening Serum Lotion\n\n* Lightening\n\n* Firming\n\n* Hydrating\n\n* 24 hr Supple Smooth\n\n* 3X Peptide Youth Repair + Hyaluronic Bright + Ceramide Glow\n\nUnang claim pa lang, sablay na. Wala namang retinol tong lotion na 'to. Pinaglololoko ako nitong LO e. \n\nSa claim na lightening at whitening, medyo duda ako. Mukhang glutathione lang ang pwedeng masabi ng brand na ito na skin lightening ingredient. Pero duda ako sa efficacy ng glutathione na makapagpa lighten ng skin topically. Maraming limitations yung mga published studies tungkol sa efficacy ng topically applied gluta, gaya ng mababang bilang ng participants sa studies at sobrang iksi na study period. \n\nSa claim na firming, mukhang inilagay ito gawa nung mga peptides. Sa hydrating claim, meron namang hydrating ingredients (glycerin, hyaluronic acid derivatives, olive oil, Plukenetia Volubilis oil, tsaka Ceramide NP). Same din dun sa mga sumunod na claims, dahil sa presence ng mga nabanggit na ingredients. \n\n\nFinal words:\n\nHindi ako masaya sa nabili kong lotion na 'to. Hindi kasing lightweight at fast absorbing nung iba kong nasubukan na serum lotions. Amoy poon yung fragrance. May microfoaming during application. Nagkapantal ako sa braso. Mali-mali ang IL. Pero yung pinaka disappointing sa lotion na 'to e yung claim na may retinol daw, pero retinyl palmitate lang ang nasa ingredient list. May paglalagay pa ng yellow dye para magmukhang may retinol. Napakalaking red flag para sa akin ang pagmi-mislabel ng product.\n\nAyun lang. Salamat sa pagbabasa. At laging maging mapanuri sa mga binibili at balak nating gamitin na products. \n\n",

Yellow dye appears to have been added to the lotion to give the appearance of fully evolved retinol being an ingredient as retinol usually makes creams look yellow.\n* The peptides used claim to target fine lines and elasticity, but only proven by in-vitro studies (i.e. in controlled lab environments) vs. in-vivo (i.e. on living organisms)\n\nThank you for this in-depth review, skincare\\_chemist19!

    "body": "My mom and I went Prom dress shopping yesterday, and I found a red dress I felt super confident in. It was figure-hugging, and strapless with a slit on the right leg side. My mother kept saying things like, \"You should try a couple sizes up.\" and \"maybe we could find one that doesn't hug your stomach so tightly?\". I loved that dress so much, but I tried some others on to make her happy and potentially see where she was coming from. I ended up purchasing the red dress I liked. After leaving the dress shop, my mom sent me off on my own to look for shoes to go with my dress. While I shopped, she bought some toiletries and car accessories from a nearby fragrance store. I found some shoes at a different location today, so I took my dress out of the bag to try it on with the shoes. To my dismay, the dress did not look or fit the same way the dress in the store did when I bought it. I looked at the tags, and it was not the same dress. My mother must have switched it out at some point. I told her I am not wearing that dress to Prom, and she needs to find my dress or I will not even go. She keeps telling me it is such a fun experience and to just wear the dress and it will be fine, but I don't even have a date, so what is the point if I don't have a fitting dress? AIO?\n\nTo clarify: The dress did not show cleavage, nor was it too short in any way. It went all the way to the floor, and the slit was right above my knee. The dress is not returnable 24 hours after it is purchased. Since it is strapless, it now does not stay up properly. She keeps telling me to get over it and just add straps to it, but my confidence is completely gone.\n\nEdit: This post is getting a lot of feedback, and it is greatly appreciated. I will most likely not be able to get to every comment, but I will do my best. I would like to thank everyone for the great advice I have been given, and I will update you if the situation improves.

To lie is to breathe for her, so I do my best to ignore her cries. I make my way to door; I ready myself to inform the others we summoned the monster, much to my great disappointment.\n\nIt's at this point Immunda's voice rises from the floor, sounding feeble and elderly at first but growing more vigorous as he speaks. \"I was... mistaken...\"\n\nTurning to him, I notice Immunda's hand clasping the sanguine amber still. No one had taken it from him during the shock of the successful summoning, I realize.\n\nThe Amber glows as he draws power from it. He rises to his feet, \"The whore should have killed me... now I will bind her,‚Äù he takes a deep agitated breath, ‚Äúbut first to burn you priests to ashes,\" he points his cursed trinket towards me.\n\nI flipped my Bible open and hold my rosary beads before me. I read from Psalm 23.\n\nImmunda laughs at me and he screams, \"Haborym Fire!\"\n\nI sense the heat of his dark illusion approach me, the flames lick at my brow, but I continue to pray, advancing forward, my faith that God‚Äôs protection will ward off this dark ether. \"Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.\" I spot Immunda's face, shocked as I exit the fire before him, his spell having little to no effect. \"You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.\" the cross adoring my rosary beads is hot enough it now burns through my glove to my palm. I must cool it soon, these gloves can only resist so much, but I have a plan to address this situation.\n\n\"What?\" Immunda shouts as he stares baffled at the amber in his fist, \"How could you be unscathed?\"\n\nI push the crucifix into his forehead as the cross brands his brow it cools.\n\nImmunda screams in pain.\n\nI pray over his cries of anguish, \"Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.\"\n\nImmunda now loses consciousness, I follow him down, cradling his head with the opened Bible to prevent him from striking the stone floor. I do this while holding the cross to his head still. I see the brand left on his head by my cross as I remove it and I stand, brushing ash from my vestments and robes. \"Amen.\"\n\nFather Hammond is the first to speak. \"Bloody Hell Father Thomas... I thought you were done for.\"\n\nI glance to Father Hammond, \"Remember to place your safety in God's grace and he will lead you through any tribulation.\"\n\nFather Charpentier speaks, in English, for once, \"I would expect no less from Father Thomas.\"\n\nI turn to the demoness who is staring at me in shock. \"Now, to see if the Church can pry any information from this...\" I eye her up and down, \"... succubus.\"\n\nShe pulls her knees to her chest and I swear I hear her whimper.\n\nI sit drinking an orange herbal tea in one of the interrogation rooms. The Bishop sits with me, and Father Hammond, Father Charpentier. An outgoing nun named Fatima Ghazzawi, has also joined us in the room. She was a convert from Islam and a wonderful and caring young woman. \"Most excellent tea, Sister.\"\n\nShe smiles, \"Thank you, Father Thomas.\"\n\nI glimpse across the divide separating me from the succubus on the other side, a one-way mirror between the two of us.\n\nShe has her hands bound by silver chains attached to a table bolted to the floor in the center of the room. She begins to panic, appearing frightened and looking lost.\n\nFather Hammond speaks first, \"This seems cruel... if this girl was once human she must have been suffering whilst in Hell.  She surely was coerced into giving her spirit over to the darkness.\" I could always say Father Hammond is a compassionate soul. However, it was this quality of his that always made me fear he lacked the stomach for some exorcisms.\n\nI keep looking at the Succubus, sipping my tea, \"Father Hammond, a pact with the devil must be a matter of free will.  Under duress or otherwise unable to think one cannot lose their soul. While a demon may torture someone, they cannot take their soul using torture alone. The torture of others, perhaps, but even then to give your soul over in such a situation is still an affront to God.\" I place my tea down on the table before me. \"Do not pity her.\"\n\nSister Fatima looks to Father Hammond, \"A blasphemer is a blasphemer. It takes faith to fight the darkness.\" she looks to the woman before us. \"Faith to fight our own demons.\"\n\nI nod to Sister Fatima as I hold her hand to reassure her. \"That's right Sister.\"\n\nBishop Ricci now interjects, \"Who shall be the first to pry her?\"\n\nI stand, ‚ÄúI will interrogate her first.‚Äù\n\nBishop Ricci hands me a document, ‚ÄúThis is the information we need to know.‚Äù\n\nThe document has the following questions printed on it:\n\n1. When is the invasion planned?\n2. How large are Hell‚Äôs forces?\n3. Who leads the armies of Hell? The generals, etc.\n4. Why are more people being possessed?\n\nI nod to Bishop Ricci while the others wish me luck, and I enter the room with Sister Fatima in tow.\n\nSister Fatima lights incense is a thurible and swings it, dispersing the incense through the room.\n\nThe Succubus glances at Sister Fatima with a convincing gaze, \"Please... sweetie... you gotta help me.\"\n\nI chime in, \"I am Father Edward Thomas\" I sit opposite her, ensuring to draw her attention.\n\nThe Succubus turns from Sister Fatima, a confusion comes over her face as she stares at me. \"Oh, what the fuck. They're making you people priests?\"\n\nI ignore her remarks, looking over at my phone. ‚ÄúYou claim to be Sara Baker, of Boston, Massachusetts, yes?‚Äù\n\nThe succubus nods, ‚ÄúWhat of it?‚Äù\n\nWith a stern gaze I glance to her, ‚ÄúSara Baker, when were you born?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMarch fifteenth, nineteen sixty-one,‚Äù she gives me an unnerved stare. ‚ÄúWhy am I answering you?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe incense fills the room and weakens your demonic aura making it easier for me to compel answers from you,‚Äù I say this as I look up her information via the Church‚Äôs database on my smartphone. These databases link to multiple sources which they should not. The Church ensures it has access to such things.\n\nShe glares at me, her wings folding behind her. ‚ÄúSo what, is this a date?‚Äù she scoffs, ‚ÄúThen again I‚Äôm not your type.‚Äù\n\nI peek at my smartphone, \"Husband David Miller... Son, Jason Miller. Yes?\"\n\nHer face softens. \"How the fuck did you know?\"\n\n\"Interesting that you kept your maiden name.\" I continue, \"You were a student at Harvard University on a full scholarship for Molecular Biology.\" I say reading the information provided by the database.\n\nShe strains against the chains. \"Why do you know all these things about me?\"\n\nI continue to read what I had found. \"The highest marks in the program, one of the most promising students, pregnant at 19, married to David Miller, an excellent catch. A rising star in Harvard's legal program, son to a wealthy billionaire.\"\n\nShe struggles still against the chains with renewed vigor, \"Stop it!\"\n\nI observe the chains, they're still holding, I go back to reading, \"They found you dead, on your birthday, March fifteenth, nineteen eighty-two of alcohol poisoning.\"\n\nThe Succubus now calms her struggling and rests in front of me. Her eyes are wide, tears welling up.\n\n\"The day you died, that was the day they sealed your dark pact, wasn't it?\" I inquire.\n\nHer voice cracks, \"You don't understand...\"\n\n\"You traded your soul for a wonderful life, it seems. A handsome husband, a beautiful child, a sharp mind?\" I tuck my phone away. \"It only lasted for so long, now didn't it? The pact for your soul came with its own consequences.\"\n\nThe Succubus shuts her eyes tight, \"I didn't realize the real price...\"\n\n\"But you gave up your soul, regardless,\"\n\n\"They tricked me.\" the Succubus whispers. \"He said he was an angel.\"\n\n\"A Fallen Angel, but even so one cannot trick you into selling your soul, one must be upfront with the terms, you must agree, knowing your soul will be theirs.\" I fix her with another stern gaze, \"Yet you are not human, not any longer. You‚Äôre a demon, so explain how that came to be.\"\n\nShe gives me a serious stare now, her eyes still pleading, crying for help.\n\n\"What was the pact? Explain.\" I pry.\n\nShe closes her eyes as she heaves a sigh, \"I was thirteen.\" her eyes opened and rose to meet mine, doe eyes glistening while she adjusted her arms to present her cleavage. \"I was... just a girl...\"\n\nWaving my hand, unphased, I confess \"You'll find that your seduction won't work on me, Succubus.\"\n\nUnder her breath, I‚Äôm certain I heard the word ‚ÄúFaggot‚Äù escape her lips. She leans back, no longer trying to entice me, ‚ÄúHe promised me beauty and charisma for my soul,‚Äù her eyes narrow at me, ‚ÄúI was always intelligent.‚Äù\n\nI pick up on something odd about her explanation, \"Your will is not your own, yet the owner of your soul doesn't require you to call him 'Master'?\"\n\nShe looks to Fatima with pleading eyes.\n\nI snap my fingers before her, ‚ÄúFocus please.‚Äù\n\nThe succubus scowls, \"My Master isn't the one who *I* sold my soul to.\"\n\n\"How did that come to be?\" I query further.\n\n\"The one who bargained for my soul sold me to my current Master,\" she admits.\n\n\"Demons barter with souls of the damned?\" I'm not surprised to hear this.\n\nShe nods, ‚ÄúAll the Fallen do. We‚Äôre like currency. The transmuted ones, like myself, are the most valuable.‚Äù she tosses her hair back as a shampoo model would, still trying to entice. Her form is exemplary. ‚ÄúI fetched a high price, as you can tell.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhom were you sold to?‚Äù I ask, unimpressed by her display.\n\n‚ÄúMy Master Asmodai,‚Äù she answers, her eyes seem to glow brighter as she says his name.\n\n‚ÄúThe Lord of Wrath.‚Äù I sigh, looking to the one-way glass. ‚ÄúThat explains Immunda's issue in summoning. He was attempting to summon Asmodai himself, yet instead, we get the one who leeches off of his power, like a lamprey.‚Äù\n\nThe succubus looks away insulted, \"If my Master came you'd all be very dead men.\"\n\n‚ÄúOh? What is it you believe your master would do to us?‚Äù I query.\n\nA glint of joy enters her eyes. \"He would swoop down on his mighty dragon, brandish his havoc blade, and swing into you. Wave after wave of you holier than thou kiddie fucking pricks would come at him as he keeps killing you.\" she takes a ragged breath exciting herself. \"He'd tear into you all, no matter how many of you there were.\"\n\n\"How can you be so certain?\" I pry further.\n\n\"I've seen him destroy the forces in his own army when they dared to disobey him.\" she brags, her breath now more labored.\n\nI inspect Sister Fatima to see her blushing. I motion to her to step out of the room.\n\nSister Fatima blushes and vacates the room, leaving me alone with the Succubus.\n\n\"His own forces? I'm sure there are not that many... we could have much more, yes?\" so far I've found her bragging to be informative.\n\nThe succubus bites her lower lip now, her wings hugging herself and caressing her shoulders, \"hmm hmm...\" she snickers, \"My Master commands seventy-two legions of demons, ten thousand strong each. He commands them, they obey, or he destroys them by hand. He is powerful, so powerful, My Master...\" she trails off in a slight fit of suppressed moans.\n\nI finish jotting down the information, looking to her with a disinterested view.\n\nHer green emerald eyes now try to entrap me glistening with an enticing display of verdant hues.\n\nI match her gaze, unphased.\n\nThe succubus now drops her facade and glares at the one-way mirror. \"I see why you picked this one to do the talking.\"\n\n‚ÄúWhat are your instructions?‚Äù I ask as I notice the incense smell is fading and now being replaced by a scent not unlike lavender. I assume this is her personal pheromone. It smells rather offensive.\n\nShe looks at me while leaning back in her chair, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt understand them. Be happy about that. If I did, I could not disobey them. Something about finding ‚ÄòThe Gate‚Äô, and I do not know where that is.‚Äù she fixes a grave stare at me, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me if you know.‚Äù\n\nI shrug, ‚ÄúI know not where it is.‚Äù I jot down the information, ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ you're tasked with opening the gateway to Hell. How did you know you would be here?‚Äù\n\nShe shakes her head, ‚ÄúAn announcement went out to every demon in Hell, that whoever gets summoned had to find the gate and open it. If they summoned my Master, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd all be knee deep in shit right now.‚Äù\n\nI stand, the scent she is emitting has grown far too offensive, ‚ÄúThank you for your time, if you‚Äôll excuse me.‚Äù I leave the room and head back to the others.\n\nFather Hammond gives me an odd eye as I enter the viewing room.\n\nI turn toward Sister Fatima who has continued to swing her thurible in the room, masking the succubus‚Äôs fragrance.\n\nBishop Ricci nods ‚ÄúGood work‚Ä¶ So, they knew the summoning was happening. We need to exercise caution of any looking to bring a demon into this world as they will attempt to open a gateway. That explains why she attacked her summoner as soon as she could.‚Äù\n\nFather Hammond adjusts his vestments with a renewed purpose, \"I have a few questions for her myself, things we must have answered..\" Father Hammond makes his way to the door.\n\nI suggest, \"Sister, why don't you aid Father Hammond. Make sure the incense is strong.\" I hand her an earpiece as she passes me.\n\nAs Father Hammond exits the room, Sister Fatima affixes the device to her ear.\n\nI watch as they both walk into the room and the door locks behind them. I press a button on the small AV system on the table. \"Sister, please nod twice if you hear me.\"\n\nSister Fatima nods but her face is already flush despite her swinging the thurible faster.\n\n\"Do not allow the succubus to touch him. And if your resolve slips, you can leave the room, just nod if you understand.\"\n\nSister Fatima nods as she stands behind the Succubus.\n\n\"Sara Baker.\" Father Hammond starts, \"let's start with a few questions, yes? No reason to make this painful.\"\n\nSister Fatima continues to swing the thurible next to her.\n\nThe Succubus shifts and fidgets in her seat. \"Can you get rid of that incense?\"\n\nSister Fatima speaks, \"No, it counteracts your musk.\"\n\nThe Succubus looks Fatima over from head to toe. \"What the Hell is someone like you doing being a nun anyway, sweetness?\"\n\nAs I suspected, the succubus can only seduce someone if it attracts them to her. Sister Fatima‚Äôs peculiarity renders her more vulnerable, while my peculiarity protects me.\n\nFather Hammond clears his throat, ‚ÄúAre you treated well‚Ä¶ where you are?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Hell.‚Äù the Succubus answers, sarcastically.\n\nConcerned that the Succubus may compromise her, I appraise Sister Fatima‚Äôs condition. Praying for Sister Fatima I make sure I keep my eye on her.  My faith in her resolve is strong, and I pray for Father Hammond‚Äôs as well.\n\n\"Can you let me out of here? Please? I escaped Hell already, and it's like you guys are trying to make it seem like Hell here on Earth. The incense is burning my eyes and I want to go outside, just once, it's been so long. I want to see the sun. It‚Äôs been decades. Please? Father?\"\n\nFather Hammond appears nervous, \"First we need to have you answer our questions.\"\n\nThe Succubus now looks hurt, \"Could you... at the least tell me what year it is?\"\n\nFather Hammond nods, smiling, \"It's the year of our Lord 2018.\"\n\nThe Succubus's face falls, \"you... you mean like... 2118? or... or 2218?\"\n\nFather Hammond shakes his head, \"No my dear.\"\n\nHer lip quivers, \"no... No no!\" she now cries, tears streaming down her face. \"You cannot tell me that was only thirty-six years!\" she sobs. \"Only thirty-six... it seemed... like decades on decades!!\" She bawls now, gasping and sobbing in a rather ugly fashion.\n\nI see Sister Fatima place her hand to her mouth, her own eyes welling up.\n\nThe Succubus reaches out toward Father Hammond as he offers her his hand.\n\nI shout into Sister Fatima's earpiece, \"Do not let her touch him, Fatima! It's a ruse! Get out of there, the both of you!\"\n\nThe instant I say this Sister Fatima reacts, dropping the thurible, and grabbing Father Hammonds hands.\n\nI unlock the door and Sister Fatima rushes them both to the door.\n\nThe succubus‚Äôs voice raises in volume, a low growl emanating from her.  Steam rising from her face as her tears evaporate into the air.\n\nI stand up ready, yet, I am not at all prepared for what I witness next.\n\nThe Succubus slams her hand against the table, which breaks off the bolts on the floor from the initial impact, \"No! NO! It can't be! It can't! Belial, that sick fuck Mammon! That bitch Esmeralda! Every one of them! I wasn't there for only thirty years! I couldn't have! They‚Äôve tortured me for centuries!\" she screams, dragging her fingernails across the table, scoring it with her claw-like nails, her wings flapping and her tail lashing about in a fit of rage. \"You bastards! You lying fucks! I was in there longer! You can't tell me every year there was only a few months! You can't!\" She slams her fists down onto the table, cracking it in half, and breaking her chains. Her eyes now glow green as I realize the error we‚Äôve made. A dark power is swirling around her, amplified by her anger, fueled by her rage. She was hiding this power somehow, and now it was more than clear. Immunda *had* summoned a powerful demon.\n\nI dash into the hallway trying to find the best way to warn them of the succubus‚Äôs true power, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a berserker!‚Äù\n\nFather Hammond stumbles into the hallway looking distressed.\n\nThe Succubus bursts through the doorway, grabbing hold of Sister Fatima as she does so with an unholy strength.  Her glowing eyes now seem to cast a green aura around her, a foul stench fills the halls, and she screams with ungodly power so loud and piercing it shatters the glass in the adjoining room.\n\nI sense a heat pulsing off her body as she rushes past me, hurling me against the wall and her free hand grabs Bishop Ricci. A burst of wind forces Father Hammond and I to the floor as she flies down the hallway.\n\nI get to my feet along with Father Hammond. Soon Father Charpentier joins us as we rush toward the stairs. I glance to the cells, seeing Immunda still inside, on the way past it I grab the sanguine amber, putting it into my pocket as we make our way out of the prison level. I consider that this bauble must be the key to sealing the Succubus back into Hell. At the landing the staircase, we come to find Bishop Ricci‚Äôs body.\n\nBishop Ricci looks battered and broken on the top of the stairs, Father Hammond rushes to his aide as Father Charpentier cries out for someone to call an ambulance.\n\nI rush out into the office near the steps, dread washing over me. I do not see Sister Fatima or the Succubus. She‚Äôs escaped. My worst fears have come to fruition.\n\nFather Hammond curses, ‚ÄúShe wasn‚Äôt a woman Father Thomas‚Ä¶ you were right‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs far more horrible than we thought.  She almost convinced me otherwise.‚Äù\n\nFather Charpentier frowns to both of us, ‚ÄúQue Dieu pardonne notre Hubris.‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/aaverm/i_am_a_priest_at_the_vatican_we_are_going_to/)",

    "body": "I spend a lot of time on this sub, and the tips that I‚Äôve found here which have had the biggest impact on my skin are honestly SO simple and beginner-level. I‚Äôm talking newbie stuff that I probably could have figured out on my own- and yet somehow totally didn‚Äôt in my 27 years of professionally owning a face.\n\nI wanted to share a list of the best ones that come to mind, and invite anyone else to share their most substantial, yet totally newbie-level things they‚Äôve learned here  too.\n\nSo without further ado, here are the single most significant ‚Äúsuper-beginner‚Äù things I‚Äôve learned on this sub that have made the biggest impact on my skincare.\n\n\n\n‚Äî‚Äî\n\n1. BLOTTING\n\nThis is so ‚Äústupid-obvious‚Äù and yet I literally never thought about doing it. \n\nI have oily skin, and throughout the day, I would notice the valley between my nose and cheeks getting shiny, but I‚Äôd just sigh and do nothing about it. ‚ÄúAh well.‚Äù I‚Äôd say.\n\nGirl. Use a paper towel! Gently tap the area! BOOM! Excess oil soaked up. Shine gone. Makeup and skincare completely safe. And your skin isn‚Äôt rubbed dry or deprived of natural moisture. Genius. Yet so, SO, basic. \n\nBrown paper towels in public bathrooms are honestly my favorite for this too, which couldn‚Äôt get easier. Nothing to buy or pack. \n\nSince doing this 1-2 times a day when I notice it, I no longer get pimples in the middle of my cheeks. Honestly I feel like a total idiot for never considering this technique, but here I am! So yeah, blotting.\n\n\n\n‚Äî‚Äî\n\n\n2. CHANGE YOUR PILLOWCASE\n\nAnother obvious thing that I really should have known, (and to be fair, I did, I‚Äôm just lazy and gross I guess) is to change your dang pillowcases! \n\nI‚Äôve started to do this once a week, but I‚Äôve seen others on here do it even daily. \n\nThink about all the nasty stuff from your hair, mouth, scalp, nose, sweat, bacteria, etc. All being smooshed against your skin for hours each night. Imagine spending your whole routines all day to pamper your skin, and then rubbing your face directly in a dirty gym shirt for eight hours. Plus you‚Äôre giving off heat and moisture, so just picture all the bacteria living it up in the sauna that is your old pillowcase fibers.\n\nI‚Äôm super grossed out to admit that I legitimately wouldn‚Äôt change my pillowcases for months sometimes. \n\n(Sorry, mom.)\n\nBut now I know better, and I am thankful this sub helped me realize.\n\n\n\n‚Äî‚Äî\n\n\n3. OILY SKIN NEEDS SKINCARE TOO\n\nI legitimately used to be absolutely terrified of leaving anything on my face that wasn‚Äôt immediately cleansed off. I thought EVERYTHING would cause acne, because in my head, I‚Äôd think: ‚ÄúOh I have oily skin. I would not dream of adding even MORE stuff on top. I‚Äôd get so many pimples.‚Äù\n\nI hated the idea of moisturizer- it was ass backwards to me. I thought I needed less hydration, not more. I also thought I would explode into full blown pizza face if I put sunscreen on. \n\nObviously now I know these are all totally not true. \n\nOily skin needs moisture, and in fact, moisturizers can help skin become less oily over time as your skin feels less need to over-produce. And everyone needs sunscreen. \n\nBut the biggest takeaway is just: skincare products aren‚Äôt grease!!!! Don‚Äôt be phobic just because you have this incorrect worry that your skin must be bone dry or else be in danger of breaking out. \n\nObviously some products could give you reactions like this. But skincare in general can be trusted. It‚Äôs meant to make your skin look better, and become healthier.\n\n\n\n‚Äî‚Äî\n\n\n4. SUNSCREEN IS SHINY\n\nYou‚Äôre probably always going to need powder or a BB cream. Maybe people with dry skin can get away with walking out the door immediately after applying sunscreen, but it‚Äôs honestly not a big deal to be shiny  (and in fact probably means good things like you‚Äôre wearing enough!).\n\nDon‚Äôt waste hundreds on a dozen different sunscreens to find a holy grail that has it ‚Äúall‚Äù, I.e. no fragrance, no white cast, dries well, non-greasy, tinted perfect shade, moisturizing, affordable, available in your country, free of ingredient/brand scandal, impervious to pilling, primes well under makeup, etc, etc, etc.\n\n‚ÄúThe best sunscreen is the one you‚Äôll use.‚Äù is the best mantra I‚Äôve found on this sub. It‚Äôs so true.\n\nJust find one that you don‚Äôt hate, slather it on each morning, and then do your best to cover up the extra shine. Preferably without accidentally rubbing the sunscreen off with whatever powder or cream you end up tapping on top. \n\n\n\n‚Äî‚Äî\n\n\n5. ALL PORES HAVE SEBUM\n\nDon‚Äôt get obsessed with squeezing all your pores. White-ish sebum is supposed to be there. \n\nPimples aren‚Äôt caused by that- pimples are caused by BLOCKED sebum. \n\nIf you get addicted or obsessive with removing the sebum that your pores naturally have (and should keep!!) you‚Äôre going to wind up with ginormous pores and an overproduction of sebum that your face will create in order to combat your new bad habit.\n\nSebum is fine. Sebum is good. Leave it alone.\n\n\n\n‚Äî‚Äî\n\n\n6. SKINCARE EXPIRES \n\nDuh. Literally so duh. Did I think my lotions were immortal? \n\nEspecially if your stuff has natural ingredients. Mold is a thing. Active ingredients lose their juice. Water gets into bottles if you leave it under your shower head. \n\nThrow that sh^% away. \n\n\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n\n\nSo there we go! \n\n\nThose are the biggest newbie-level things I‚Äôve learned here. I‚Äôm always reading new stuff on this sub, and I am very happy to be a part of this community. \n\n\nTell me your own!",

You get your moisturizer, sunscreen, and tinted make up coverage all in one go. I use neutrogena radiant tinted moisturizer with spf 30, and it may be one of my favorite things ever.",

I've found a few products that make a major difference with my skin (and don't break the bank.... well after breaking the bank in the beginning, lol). My skin only seems to get oily when I'm cooking certain things now and standing over the stove. \n\nI love the clean and clear oil absorbing sheets for when this happens. I love that I can rub them across my face and won't make my makeup budge. These are sort of rubbery-ish and  absorb so much more oil than the others. \n\nThe only \"obvious\" thing I would add to the list you made is... ROUTINE MATTERS! At least the basics. Wash and moisturize 2x a day even if someone doesn't do anything else.",

She replaces Charlize Theron, who has been the face for 20 years.\n\n\nhttps://www.vogue.com/article/rihanna-jadore-interview\n\n\nExcerpt:\n\n\nThe J‚Äôadore scent has long been special to Ri and the entire Fenty family, starting with her mother, Monica. ‚ÄúMy mother worked in a perfume shop,‚Äù she tells Vogue exclusively. ‚ÄúShe used to always bring home the J‚Äôadore testers when they were almost empty, so there was always a bottle in the house.

    "body": "Note: Something different from this sub's usual fare, this was originally posted in r/UnresolvedMysteries by a now deleted user, and true to form is still inconclusive (honestly, I'm not sure we'll ever get a completely satisfying solution). I'll lay out the original mystery as posted, plus later posts with potential answers. This is a long one, but as far as I can tell hasn't been posted here before!\n\n#  [Which mystery industry is the largest buyer of glitter?](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/a8hrk0/which_mystery_industry_is_the_largest_buyer_of/) - 4 years ago\n\nIt appears that there's a lot of glitter being purchased by someone who would prefer to keep the public in the dark about glitter's presence in their products. From [today's NYT all about glitter](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/style/glitter-factory.html):\n\nWhen I asked Ms. Dyer if she could tell me which industry served as Glitterex‚Äôs biggest market, her answer was instant: ‚ÄúNo, I absolutely know that I can‚Äôt.‚Äù\n\nI was taken aback. ‚ÄúBut you know what it is?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh, God, yes,‚Äù she said, and laughed. ‚ÄúAnd you would never guess it. Let‚Äôs just leave it at that.‚Äù I asked if she could tell me why she couldn‚Äôt tell me. ‚ÄúBecause they don‚Äôt want anyone to know that it‚Äôs glitter.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIf I looked at it, I wouldn‚Äôt know it was glitter?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo, not really.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWould I be able to see the glitter?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôd be able to see something. But it‚Äôs ‚Äî yeah, I can‚Äôt.‚Äù\n\nI asked if she would tell me off the record. She would not. I asked if she would tell me off the record after this piece was published. She would not. I told her I couldn‚Äôt die without knowing. She guided me to the automotive grade pigments.\n\nGlitter is a lot of places where it's obvious. Nail polish, stripper's clubs, football helmets, etc. Where might it be that is less obvious and can afford to buy a ton of it? Guesses I heard since reading the article are\n\n* toothpaste\n* money\n\nGuesses I've brainstormed on my own with nothing to go on:\n\n* the military (Deep pockets, buys lots of vehicles and paint and lights and god knows what)\n* construction materials (concrete sidewalks often glitter)\n* the funeral industry (not sure what, but that industry is full of cheap tricks they want to keep secret and I wouldn't put glitter past them)\n* cheap jewelry (would explain the cheapness)\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n**A few of the top comments**\n\n[From raydoctor](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/a8hrk0/comment/eccl63h/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n> Microtaggants.  \n>  \n>Multilayered 'microglitter' added to all commercial explosives.  \n>  \n>Simple to batch trace, on site, AFTER the detonation, using only a microscope.  \n>  \n>Use dynamite for illegal purposes, and leave evidence as clear as a fingerprint.  \n>  \n>Law enforcement probably doesn't want this fact circulating.\n\n[`Taggants`](https://www.microtracesolutions.com/solutions/implement-independently/microtaggant-identification-particles)\n\n[From Mark48torpedo](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/a8hrk0/comment/ecc2azy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n> I'm pretty sure it's actually stealth coatings (i.e. paint) for stealth fighters like the F-22 and F-35, which are now being produced in relatively large quantities for the US military. Here's the reasoning:  \n>  \n>Radar absorbent materials, such as those used on stealth aircraft, typically consist of a mixture of finely ground metals (i.e. glitter!) and polymer. To absorb radio waves without reflecting it, you need something that is fairly conductive and will interact strongly with radio waves (i.e. metals), but it can't be TOO conductive (e.g. solid metal plates) because they'll simply reflect the radio waves without absorbing it. Finely ground metals mixed with polymer are exactly what you want.  \n>  \n>Stealth fighters, namely the F-35, are currently being produced in fairly large quantities in the USA, and require large quantities of radar absorbent coatings. These coatings will be quite thick and contain a large fraction of metal, which will consume huge amounts of glitter compared to most applications, which use only a tiny amount of glitter. For example, in the article they state that \"The minimum order size Glitterex will accept is ten pounds, enough to supply sparkle to half a million bottles of nail polish by Mr. Shetty‚Äôs estimation.\"  \n>  \n>Finally... after the reporter asked the question, the woman guided the reporter along to the automotive grade pigments. Unlike most types of glitter, automotive grade pigments are simply small flakes of metal such as aluminum, and do not contain any plastic. This is EXACTLY what the type of material they would want to use in radar absorbent coatings.\n\n[From yazzledore](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/a8hrk0/comment/eccpro9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n>Here's an article that all but confirms it's Crest toothpaste: [https://www.dentalbuzz.com/2014/03/04/crest-imbeds-plastic-in-our-gums/](https://www.dentalbuzz.com/2014/03/04/crest-imbeds-plastic-in-our-gums/)  \n>  \n>The article says people got mad about the specific plastic they were using around the time this was published (2014) and they were looking for a suitable alternative. Wonder when those huge glitter orders started coming in?  \n>  \n>The math seems to add up too, though can only get rough estimates. I took the number of units sold of Colgate (80.7 mil) and the ratio of their sales to Crest in 2018 (256/177) as well as the amount of toothpaste per tube (170 g) to estimate that crest makes 4.4\\*107 lbs of toothpaste per year. Assuming .01% of toothpaste is glitter (look at it, this seems like a low estimate) they're buying \\~4.4 thousand lbs of glitter per year. Didn't see a number in the article for the volume of biggest sales, but since their minimum is 10lbs this seems reasonable for the highest amount perhaps, given that I think the estimate of how much of toothpaste is glitter was low (could go up to .1%, and then they're buying over 40,000 lbs). I do believe that was just US sales too, so still could be much higher (couldn't find numbers for international sales).\n\n# THEORIES FROM OTHER POSTS\n\n **I think I figured out the mystery glitter industry, guys.** [by  u/Throwaway99999999923](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/abmqrt/i_think_i_figured_out_the_mystery_glitter/)  3 years ago\n\nThis is a theory relating to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/a8hrk0/which_mystery_industry_is_the_largest_buyer_of/).\n\nI think it‚Äôs the cookware industry. Specifically, non-stick pan coatings.\n\nLook closely and and you‚Äôll see all the pan coatings sparkle. White ceramic pans, black pans, gray pans... they all have little sparklies mixed in.\n\nIt makes the coatings look like metal and/or diamonds/sapphires/rock and other hard substances.\n\nEdit: was shopping for a new pan and one brand hinted that theirs was made with diamonds. I thought to myself ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no way all those shiny flecks on this $20 pan are diamonds!‚Äù Then I remembered this post and looked closely at all the pans in the aisle.\n\nEdit2: took some pics. The white-coating sparkles aren‚Äôt showing up well for my camera but the black ones can be seen pretty decently.\n\n[black non-stick pan](https://imgur.com/gallery/Jbi07Kl) (pardon the scratches!)\n\n[white ceramic non-stick](https://imgur.com/gallery/2FVOONW)\n\n**(RESOLVED)** **Who buys glitter?** [By a deleted account](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/dtf1x9/resolved_who_buys_glitter/) 3 years ago\n\nIt's boat paint. Thanks to the public radio podcast Endless Thread for getting interested and sicking an entire production team on the question. What they found isn't exactly a smoking glitter gun, but it's a well-informed surmise backed up with evidence that Glitterex wouldn't deny when given the chance.\n\nWhile I'm slightly disappointed it's not McNuggets or super secret Space Force tech, I'm still thrilled to know the answer, however mundane. I hope there are other business mysteries out there that this sub can take a look it. It's good for the public to have a better understanding of how industries operate, and it gives us all a break from grisly murders.\n\nThanks to everyone who commented and helped make the thread popular. It was great fun.\n\n[https://www.wbur.org/endlessthread/2019/11/08/the-great-glitter-mystery](https://www.wbur.org/endlessthread/2019/11/08/the-great-glitter-mystery)\n\n  **The industry that buys the most glitter (theory)**[By whoopingwillow](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/aop378/the_industry_that_buys_the_most_glitter_theory/) 3 years ago\n\nAbout a month ago an article was posted from the New York Times talking about glitter. In the article the companies are very secretive about who they sell to, and there is an odd exchange about the largest buyer of glitter.\n\n>( I've cut the exchange from the article above for brevitiy)\n\nI think it is the food & beverage industry. In the NYT [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/style/glitter-factory.html) the CEO, Mr. Shetty says \"Confidentiality is a top-down requirement from clients.\" Go to Glitterex's site and you won't find a single mention of food or edible glitter. End of the line I guess? Hell no. There is another major glitter company, one that is alluded to in the NYT article, one that is even more secretive than Glitterex. That company is Meadowbrook.\n\nGo to Meadowbrook's site and look through their types of glitter and listed applications. They list 9 major applications for glitter. Cosmetic, adhesive, fashion, greeting card, floral, fiberglass, craft, printing, and aerosol. Under Color Cards they list the different types of glitter. Polyester, Cosmetic, Biodegradable, Crystalina, Alpha, Micronic Jewels, Polyester Pearls, Electric Jewels, and Plastic. Odd that they sell biodegradable glitter but they don't list food or drink as an application...\n\nNow go to the page for [biodegradable glitter](https://meadowbrookglitter.com/biodegradable-glitter/). Interestingly, this is the only Color Card page of the 9 that specifically lists the names and phone numbers for sales inquiries. It even has East and West coast representatives listed. So if you were a food & beverage company you wouldn't have to fill in the order card on the site, you could call or email the sales managers which strikes me as a more discrete option.\n\nAnother point, Revlon Inc is cited as one of the corporations Glitterex sells to when the CEO mentions their clients include some of the largest multinational corporations in the world. Revlon is number 795 on the Fortune 500. They don't even rank in the actual 500 of the Fortune 500! However there are 4 beverage companies, 5 food consumer product companies, 7 food production companies, and 20 food & drug store companies on the Fortune 500.\n\nOne final point is their location. Businesses like being close to the businesses that buy their products. It makes much more financial sense to buy your products from a company that is located nearby since it reduces shipping costs. New Jersey lists 7 Key Industries on their website, one of those is the Food industry. Pinnacle Foods, Unilever, Nestle, and 128 firms that specialize in flavor, fragrance, and ingredient manufacturing all have major operations in New Jersey. To quote NJ's [site](https://www.choosenj.com/key-industries/food) \"10 of the top 10 flavor and fragrance companies worldwide have a presence in New Jersey. The concentration of jobs and wages in the flavor and fragrance industry in New Jersey is 3 times the national average.\"\n\nSo to summarize:\n\n1. We know the buying industry doesn't want any public connection to glitter\n2. Glitterex & Meadowbrook, the two largest producers of glitter, don't list Food & Beverage as an application of glitter on their site, despite that being a publicly known application. ([FDA Article mentioning use of edible and non-edible glitters](https://www.fda.gov/food/ingredientspackaginglabeling/foodadditivesingredients/ucm481466.htm))\n3. Biodegradable glitter is the only type of glitter that offers the buyer a direct contact, implying either a need for discretion or that biodegradable glitter sales are such high volume that they warrant a human touch.\n4. The two top producers of glitter are located in New Jersey, which is a hub for food production and specifically for flavor, fragrance, and ingredient manufacturing.\n\ntldr; your food looks shiny because it has shiny glitter on it. I wonder how many times I've eaten glitter and assumed it was a spice?\n\nEDIT: I totally agree with the people posting that cosmetics, toothpaste, and car paints have glitter shame. I just think it's the food connection that they really want to hide. I don't think the companies would be so secretive about glitter in cosmetics and car paints since they're supposed to be shiny and glittery. (Shout out to [u/buttrito](https://www.reddit.com/u/buttrito/) for pointing out there are $1200 lotions that claim to contain \"diamond nanoparticles.\" I am sure that consumers would lose their minds if they found out their diamond nanoparticles are glitter. (Assuming you haven't already lost your mind while buying lotion for $1200...)\n\nEdit2: Whoa, this blew up way more than I ever expected! Thanks everyone! I love reading the discussions that are popping up in the thread. I do want to clarify a point, I don't think food companies are covertly making entire cakes out of graffiti. I don't think a major producer would break the laws and FDA regulations that flagrantly. I imagine they use the glitter for legal reasons, like to draw out the color of certain foods, or to enhance the sparkle of a drink. Possibly as a medium to apply flavors or fragrances as well. Glitter is disturbingly hard to remove after all! I think it's the fear of bad PR that causes the secrecy. Some people have pointed out biodegradable != edible, and that's a damn good point. Another good point is that it'd show up in ingredient lists, the best defense to that I can think of would be that it falls under \"artificial flavors\" if it's being used in association with flavor application, but that's stretching to say the least.\n\n  **Why I disagree with the current theories surrounding the glitter mystery, and an alternative perspective.**  [By partylikeits420](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/gz7up9/why_i_disagree_with_the_current_theories/) 2 years ago\n\nLong post warning.\n\nFirstly, you have to listen to the (admittedly vague) clues given by Glitterex.\n\n>You wouldn't know it's glitter if you looked at it.  \n>  \n>They don't want anyone to know that it's glitter.  \n>  \n>The colour sold the most, by far, is silver.  \n>  \n>‚ÄúWould I be able to see the glitter?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôd be able to see something. But it‚Äôs ‚Äî yeah, I can‚Äôt.‚Äù\n\nOk so secondly, the current theories.\n\nBoat paint. It's evident from a mile away that it contains glitter. I had one of my first cars sprayed with a similar paint. It was literally called glitter flake paint, it's no secret that it contained glitter, and this was over a decade ago.\n\nToothpaste/cosmetics/food. Again it's obvious that the products are glittery. Also, in the UK at least, the manufacturers would be compelled to disclose the ingredients (especially in food) so it wouldn't be a mystery for long.\n\nExplosive taggants, which seems to be the favourite. Explosive taggants have to use *something* so who would hiding the fact that this something is glitter benefit? Even in a ridiculous hypothetical situation where someone would want to remove the taggant to protect themselves, it's not as if glitter is any different to shredded baking foil. Any idea to this theory can be applied to baking foil, therefore the secrecy argument doesn't hold water. There's no need to protect one method at all costs when another method is equally effective.\n\nSomething else I don't buy is that Glitterex are maintaining secrecy so their competitors don't realise, allowing them to capitalise on, effectively, a monopolistic economy.\n\nWhile their competitors may not know, their buyer certainly does. Businesses exist to profit. Competition decreases costs of supply, therefore increasing profit for the mystery buyer. If this was the case then the buyer would go to Glitterex's competitors themselves for supply quotations, ergo, mystery solved.\n\nWhat I think..\n\nI want to offer an alternative perspective.\n\nTo paraphrase a comment I've made before on this sub:\n\nI'm not sure why but I always remember a story told to me by my grandfather when I was younger. I could bring it back up in conversation for more details if required.\n\nHe was the financial director of a major steel manufacturer. They had a varied product portfolio but their specialist product was chicken wire of all thicknesses. Basically what is used to make shopping trollies/fencing/concrete reinforcing etc.\n\nNaturally the orders placed by these industries were huge, but none were their largest buyer. The largest buyer used the steel in such a way that you would never know it was chicken wire.\n\nThe shoe manufacturing industry. The wire was cut into slices which were then shaped into eyelets for laces.\n\nAside from the secrecy aspect, a lot of parallels seem apparent to me. You wouldn't know the product, it doesn't look like you'd imagine it to.\n\nBecause of this it made me think about the manufacturing process of glitter. I would assume it being made in large sheets before being shredded. My guess is that this mystery buyer is buying the glitter before the shredding process. Huge quantities, wouldn't know if we saw it, we'd see something but it wouldn't appear glittery (I'd guess sheets of glitter reflect light differently to shredded glitter), silver being the primary selling colour.\n\nMY theory is that it's being sold in sheets and used for its reflective properties(especially because silver is the largest seller). Possibly used in telescopes, cameras etc.\n\nThe only real theory I have in regard to the secrecy aspect is that it's insisted upon by the buyer. Glitterex, or any sensible business for that matter, would do anything to appease their most profitable customer. I believe that the buyer demands secrecy because the use of glitter (sheets) would appear extremely low tech in an extremely high tech industry, so are happy to pay a slight premium for supply.\n\nThink of it like this...\n\n>\"hey everyone, this is our brand new, technologically ground-breaking camera. Its light refraction creates the clearest images on the market today\"  \n>  \n>\"that's amazing how did you do that???\"  \n>  \n>\"actually mate it's just glitter\"  \n>  \n>\"Hmmmmm\"\n\nHope I've offered a different perspective and even if I'm wildly wrong it would be interesting to hear peoples thoughts.\n\nEdit to include a link\n\n[www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/style/glitter-factory.amp.html](http://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/style/glitter-factory.amp.html)\n\n[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18742142](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18742142)\n\nEdit to hopefully debunk a couple more common theories.\n\nRoad marking paint. The reflective qualities seen in this product actually come from glass particles, similar to the silver stripes on hi vis construction clothing.\n\nConcrete. I work in the construction industry and can comprehensively tell you it won't be this. If I order a wagon full of ready mix concrete or the lads mix a small batch by hand the final product looks exactly the same. The ingredients are cement, grit sand/mixed ballast and water. If the glitter was added to one of the ingredients you'd see it before mixing, but you don't. Also, the reason rougher grade sand is used for concrete is because it allows the mix to \"grip\" together more effectively. Smooth plastic particles would only weaken the final product.  \n\n**The Glitter Mystery Again** [By aimless\\_renegade](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/peq420/the_glitter_mystery_again/) 10 months ago\n\n(This post keeps getting rejected, so I'm on an older account now. Third time's a charm, hopefully?)\n\nFirst of all, I don't want to say that I've \"solved\" it. The Endless Thread podcast claimed they did as well, but I don't buy their explanation for a second. I don't have confirmation that this is the answer, but I have found an awful lot of compelling evidence for this being the answer. Not only that, but this is the answer that best fits all the major clues given in the original article.\n\n(I've cut out a summary of the original article for brevity)\n\nSo, we've got some major hints here that narrow things down quite a bit. They are:\n\n1. It isn't something you'd necessarily think was glitter, or had glitter in it.\n2. It's something people might be upset to learn contained glitter.\n\nThese are really important clues, because they sort of narrow down all the major guesses. Automotive or boat paints? They obviously have glitter in them, and no one would care if they did. Cosmetics and beauty? I'm a 35-year-old woman and I know that the makeup community already knows and doesn't care about this - they'd rather see synthetic glitter anyway, considering the issues around mining mica. Aerospace? They might use it, but not in quantities that would even come CLOSE to matching the volume of consumer products sold every day. Same for the military. Plus, I'm an Army veteran and while I certainly haven't seen everything that's going on in the Department of Defense, but if we used the most glitter in the US I certainly would have seen some. I never even saw it as something available to order.\n\nThe only thing that truly fits here is something you'd commonly use or buy, and most likely something you put in or on your body. On your body is pretty much out, because we know Glitterex supplies cosmetic pigments. It's mentioned in the original article that they sell to Revlon, and I also found a Facebook post from the local radio station whose \"fun fact\" for the day was that Glitterex sells to cosmetic companies. I can't post this here due to the rule against Facebook links, but a search for \"Cranford Radio Glitterex\" will pull it up if you want to see for yourself. Cosmetics are pretty much ruled out as far as I'm concerned.\n\nHowever, I think cosmetics are DEFINITELY related to the real \"biggest client\". And, as we unravel the mystery, it will be very important that Glitterex is open about their production of cosmetic pigments, so keep that in mind.\n\nThat leaves us with something you put into your body. I began to investigate the wide world of food, cosmetic, and drug dyes.\n\n**Food, Cosmetic, and Drug Dyes**\n\nThere are actually a few different types of food dyes. In fact, not all of them can really be called \"dye\". In the world of FD\\&amp;C coloring, the term \"dye\" only refers to a water-soluble chemical that transfers color. On the other hand, a \"lake\" is a colorant that is made of a suspension of pigment, usually in some type of oil. Lakes are very interesting substances, as they're made of dyes that are attached to some kind of substrate, often aluminum oxide.\n\nRemember the article's difficult-to-understand explanation of how Glitterex makes their glitter? Here it is:\n\n‚ÄúThis polyester film‚Äù he began, picking up a strip of clear material, about five inches wide, ‚Äúpeople might know as mylar. It‚Äôs the same polymer as used in a water bottle, so F.D.A.-approved. If you cut this you‚Äôd get a clear glitter.‚Äù The bulk of Glitterex glitter is made from plastic, though some varieties come from other sources, like aluminum. Clear glitter looks like tiny pieces of a dead jellyfish. ‚ÄúThen,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwe go into the next iteration of a substrate, where the clear film is metalized.‚Äù He picked up a shining silver strip of material. ‚ÄúPotato chips bags start with the same polyester film; it‚Äôs metalized with aluminum.‚Äù  \nMetalization, he explained, is the process by which aluminum is deposited on both sides of the film. This made sense in theory, but how could aluminum go from being not on the film to being on the film without at least some Scotch tape? ‚ÄúThey evaporate aluminum and deposit it on it,‚Äù said Mr. Shetty. This made sense in theory, but how could aluminum be evaporated? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very, very thin layer. They put it in a vacuum chamber, then evaporate the aluminum,‚Äù said Mr. Shetty. ‚ÄúWith heat,‚Äù his son added. ‚ÄúWhat are they evaporating out of it?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúAluminum,‚Äù said Mr. Shetty.\n\nOn the FDA's website, they explain how lakes for food and drug use are made:\n\n\\&gt;Color additives are classified as straight colors, lakes, and mixtures. Straight colors are color additives that have not been mixed or chemically reacted with any other substance (for example, FD\\&amp;C Blue No. 1 or Blue 1). Lakes are formed by chemically reacting straight colors with precipitants and substrata (for example, Blue 1 Lake). Lakes for food use must be made from certified batches of straight colors. (One exception is carmine, which is a lake made from cochineal extract.) Lakes for food use are made with aluminum cation as the precipitant and aluminum hydroxide as the substratum. Mixtures are color additives formed by mixing one color additive with one or more other color additives or non-colored diluents, without a chemical reaction (for example, food inks used to mark confectionery).\n\nNow, I know enough about chemistry to understand that they're talking about different types of aluminum here. But there are enough things in common with the ingredients and the process to assume that Glitterex absolutely has at least the *capability* to manufacture FD\\&amp;C colorants, particularly lakes.\n\nBut who are they making them for, and why is it such a secret?\n\n**Synthetic Food Colorants**\n\nMy next step was finding out what major consumer products contain these dyes. At first, this seemed insanely overwhelming. After all, nearly every item on the grocery store shelves contains some type of dye.\n\nI began investigating major coloring and flavor companies for more information. I am a disabled vet, but prior to becoming disabled I was studying for my masters degree in forensic accounting, so I got pretty good at hunting down weird documents on the internet. Most of what I found indicated that food manufacturers are really moving away from synthetic dyes, like the kind that Glitterex would be producing. Glitterex received a PPP loan during the Coronavirus pandemic and was classified as a [synthetic dye and pigment manufacturer](https://www.federalpay.org/paycheck-protection-program/industries/synthetic-dye-and-pigment-manufacturing?page=1). Demand for synthetic pigments in food is very low, with companies overwhelmingly switching to \"natural colors\".\n\nFurthermore, despite how ubiquitous dyes like Red 40 Lake are, they don't fit both of the important clues given. You wouldn't want to know that Red 40 Lake contains glitter, so that fits. But you can't look at a consumer product that contains it and see \"something\". It could be a specialty pigment, but what specialty food dye would order such quantities as to be the company's largest client? With cosmetics ruled out and food looking increasingly unlikely, I needed more clues, so I began poking around some industry websites.\n\n**Clues About The Company**\n\nWith this information about FD\\&amp;C dyes in mind, I began to look for financial information on Glitterex. They aren't a public company, but there are websites that aggregate information on nonpublic companies for research purposes. Not all of the data is 100% reliable, but it can give you a nice overview as to what the company is all about and what they do.\n\nAnd this is where I found some *extremely* interesting information.\n\nOne [website](https://incfact.com/company/glitterex-cranford-nj/) aggregated a very fascinating list of Glitterex's competitors, which they prefaced with the quote: *A competitive analysis shows these companies are in the same general field as Glitterex, even though they may not compete head-to-head.*\n\nWhat are these companies in the \"same general field\" as Glitterex? You've probably heard of a lot of them. They include Cardium Therapeutics, Dupont, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Dow Chemical, Proctor and Gamble, Abbott Laboratories, and Bayer.\n\nThere's also a list of \"local competitors\" - companies that are also headquartered in New Jersey who are apparently in the \"same general field\" as Glitterex. These companies are Merck, Teva Pharmaceuticals, Zoetis (phamaceutical company), Evonik (a paint company), and Formosa Plastics.\n\nThat's an awful lot of major pharmaceutical companies.\n\nIn fact, Glitterex is listed as biotech company on several industry-specific sites if you look around a bit. They don't advertise it, but they definitely seem to have some major ties to the pharmaceutical world.\n\nThe next clue was found in a 2017 [report](http://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/Polyurethanes.pdf) about polyurethane safety in cosmetic products. On pages 10 and 11, we have this exchange:\n\nDR. EISENMANN: I don't know if you caught the other one, that poly -- the ingredient with the most uses, Polyeurethane-11, it's only used as coating on glitter.  \nDR. HILL: Right.  \nDR. EISENMANN: That's it. I've got that confirmed by the supplier of the ingredient and the manufacturers of the glitter.  \nDR. MARKS: That has the most uses?  \nDR. EISENMANN: Yes. DR. MARKS: Polyurethane 11?  \nDR. EISENMANN: Yes. And that it's only used --  \nDR. MARKS: How many?  \nDR. HILL: As a costing \\[coating?\\] on --  \nDR. EISENMANN: -- as a coating on glitter.  \nDR. HILL: -- glitter that's there in --  \nDR. MARKS: How many uses? I didn't have that? I didn't -- if it has the most uses, it must have more than 30 because so for I have a Polyurethane 14 with 33 uses.  \nDR. EISENMANN: I mean, it's all different uses of glitter, but, yes.\n\nAnd, in the endnotes of the report, it's confirmed that the manufacturer of this polyurethane-11 is, in fact, Glitterex. They also call it WSR coating. This was the key to figuring out what exactly was going on here.\n\nRemember how important it is that Glitterex manufactures this cosmetic glitter, how they openly say that they supply lots of it? It makes sense, because they *do* manufacture a lot of it. It *is* their largest product. But it's not cosmetic companies who are their biggest client.\n\nCosmetic colorings and coatings are used in one other, major, way. Check out the [bottom of this page](https://www.koelcolours.com/products/pharmaceuticals/inorganic-colours-for-food.php) belonging to a similar manufacturer of pigments for the two big uses of these colorants.\n\n**Polyurethane and Colorings in Medicine**\n\nIf you Google WSR coating, you'll find a lot of paints and industrial items that use it. You'll also find plenty of information on the use of WSR coating in pharmacology. Like, a LOT. It's used to color-code medications, discourage abuse, and control the rate of the medication's release.\n\nMost of these coatings are made and sold by Dupont and Dow Chemical - both listed as Glitterex's top competitors. Both companies say that they have the capability to produce pigmented and shimmering versions of this coating. Merck (another listed competitor) even offers a pearlized coating for tablets and capsules. If you needed a shimmer pigment for such a coating, why wouldn't you want to purchase from a company that's familiar with the materials you'll be using in the coating? If they had experience in making WSR coatings, you might just contract them to create certain capsules or coatings for your medication.\n\nGlitterex said that this client is their biggest, which made everyone latch onto big things like space travel and boat paint. But medicine production is a far bigger industry than any of those. Millions and millions of pills of every kind are produced every day in America. It's bigger than the cosmetic and personal care industry, which uses the exact same pigments and binders - and Glitterex is open about supplying these. Maybe a little *too* open. In fact, I found a 2002 blurb from an industry journal, NutraCos, that openly states the company sells pigments [mainly to cosmetic manufacturers](https://pdfslide.net/documents/duponts-white-pigments-mineral-products-renamed-titanium-technologies.html). In the chemical world, it seems like that's what Glitterex is known for making.\n\nGlitterex, again, is very open about the majority of its glitter being used for cosmetic applications - and in a way it's true. They do manufacture mainly cosmetic glitter - but it seems that many of the same pigments, coatings, and plastic binders used in cosmetics are also the ones used in medicines. It's also located in New Jersey, where a huge number of pharmaceutical companies also operate.\n\nSo what is Glitterex's biggest client?\n\n**It's the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry.**\n\nCan I confirm this for sure? No, I can't. I don't know for absolute sure that this is the answer, but I do know it's the one that best fits what we know. Circling back to the original mystery and the two big hints we had, this one fits.\n\nFirst, *they don't want you to know it's glitter*. Of course this fits. Nobody wants to hear that they're ingesting something inorganic, especially these days. But if you pay attention to the timing of the original article and interview, it's even more obvious. You may remember that in 2018 the \"most hated man in America\" was Martin \"Pharma Bro\" Shrkeli. The pharmaceutical industry was facing an absolutely *massive* level of distrust from the American public. If any industry wouldn't want you to know they were using glitter, it'd be them.\n\nSecond, *you would be able to see something, but not to tell that it's glitter.* And indeed, every single tablet in my medicine cabinet is coated in a shiny film. Some of them are a lot shinier than I realized when I looked more closely. EDIT: Removed the reference to Vyvanse. See note in update.\n\nGlitterex is definitely not the top manufacturer of pharmaceutical coatings - that's Dow and Dupont for sure. But the pharmaceutical industry is so large and so lucrative that it makes perfect sense that their largest client would be a pharmaceutical manufacturer. With the size of the pharma industry being what it is, it would follow that they probably order these coatings from a lot of different suppliers. Even if Glitterex is far from their top supplier, they could still very easily be Glitterex's top client.\n\nI still don't know if Glitterex is making a specialty coating for a certain medication or company, or if they're simply another supplier of general pharmaceutical coatings. I also am not sure if they manufacture pharmaceutical pigments FOR coatings or if they produce the coating itself.\n\nHowever, I am pretty confident that the mystery industry who doesn't want us to know they're using glitter is the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nThanks for reading and I'd love to hear your thoughts as well!\n\nUPDATE: Since this post is still receiving a lot of traffic, I did want to let folks know that I received some messages from people in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry confirming they do use Glitterex products. I was informed that it is also used as an abrasive to sanitize equipment used in manufacturing medicines.\n\nRe: the Vyvanse reference: a LOT of people got REALLY hung up on me mentioning my Vyvanse was shiny. To clarify: I didn‚Äôt mean Vyvanse was sparkly, I meant it was glossy. Which it is - you can Google photos and see that yes, it is very glossy.\n\nI did not find, or even attempt to find, specific medications that might utilize Glitterex products. I used Vyvanse merely as an example of the glossy coating that appears on most capsules of medicines. Could it perhaps, in some medications, be made with the clear glitter mentioned in the article? Maybe. It was quite literally just an example I threw out there. Since I got SO many comments from people informing me Vyvanse doesn‚Äôt have glitter in it so my entire theory is wrong, I have removed that reference. It seemed like it was just confusing people.\n\nLastly, to the commenter who claimed this example was ‚Äúadding to the stigma of ADHD meds‚Äù: that was a very unfair comment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Remember, I'm not any of the original posters.\\*\\* Which theory do you think is most plausible?",

What is it?\n\nNo. It‚Äôs something you don‚Äôt want to explain to me, something hidden under the barbs and wires of asian mother-daughter relationships.\n\nAnd sure, you have your reasons, but I‚Äôm mad. My skin is cracking and my cheeks are dehydrated, the six dollars that I used literally in the trash.\n\nBecause it might just be a container with substance inside, but it‚Äôs so much more than that.\n\nIt‚Äôs confidence to roam the hallways, the gentle eye bag massage over the crustiness of the morning.\n\nI‚Äôm buying a new one whether you like it or not.\n\nFrom,\nA salty daughter.\n\nEdit/Update: thank you for all the love!

Bought him a car while she had to purchase her own.. They were  cosigners on the note so when she became pregnant with our first grandchild (not married) they kicked her out of the house, along with her 5 year old son, in an attempt to force her to abort..'there's not enough room here, they said, oh, and we're taking your car as punishment, even though you've made every single payment and have 3 months left on the note.' \nThey sold the car. We took her, her son, and my son in, until they could get on their feet.\n\nWe love our 2 year old grandbaby Lucy. She is the light of our lives and couldn't imagine not having her around!\n\nWe watch Lucy and the new baby and her older brother all the time-- Because we WANT to. We even sold our 2 year old home, PAID MONEY to get out of it at closing - all because we wanted to move closer to where they finally bought a house, just to be closer and available to them. Ironically, her parents live 5 minutes away and hardly see them.\n\nBecause I work nights, I'm usually asleep parts off the morning so when she needed help in the morning for a few hours, she could only get her mom to go over if she paid her.  I'm not saying that's a bad thing. I know her mom works too and she deserves compensation if she desires it. I'm just highlighting the difference of our attitudes towards our grandchildren.\n\nI'm sorry your rant turned into my rant but if this is the first time you're mom is starting to display this behavior there may be more subtle or not so subtle sights in the future. I'm so sorry. üòû\n\nFYI.. Daughter in law is beautiful blend of Filipino and Black. She is absolutely exotic looking and sick a good mother.",

    "body": "So today is April 1st and thus misleading information surrounding games is inevitable. That's the reason behind this post - so that we can have a laugh while not spamming subreddit page with dozens of low effort posts.  \n  \nObviously sometimes it is hard to distinguish real info from fake (remember Blood Dragon) so I hope nobody (including mods) will blame you if you post info that seems viable in separate thread.  \n  \nAnyway let me start with something (I'll also try to add to the main post things other people post in here).  \n  \n1. War Thunder navy battles - it is both a joke and a real game mode that will one day be fully introduced with battleships, destroyers and such (like in World of Warships)  \nhttp://warthunder.com/en/news/3666-development-sailing-fleet-in-war-thunder-en  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkkpbUA5XBA  \n  \n2. In Path of Exile devs revealed new improvements to trade mechanics.  \nhttps://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/1638061/  \n  \n3. VR now became more realistic than ever with Google Plastic Cardboard  \nhttps://www.google.com/get/cardboard/plastic/  \n  \n4. ARMA III gets its own fragrance Eau De_Combat  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R7q2XsGIgs  \n  \n5. Warframe new voice packs  \nhttps://warframe.com/lotus-packs/  \n  \n6. World of Warships now became THE naval warfare simulator (bathtub map)  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S66AbSZV_No  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyNRO5v5Rsg  \nAlso Wargaming will release a new game: World of Wartrains  \nhttps://twitter.com/wargamingjapan/status/715563393994727426/photo/1  \nAnd World of Tanks now happens... IN SPACE!  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yiGzopQiSU  \n  \n7. League of Draven  \nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/skins/draven-day-2016  \n  \n8. Hearthstone will get it's own MMO  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nV0twbU3IhA  \n  \n9. Warhorse Studios managed to put their realistic medieval RPG Kingdom Come Deliverance on SNES  \nhttps://twitter.com/WarhorseStudios/status/715813666659115014  \n  \n10. Witcher 3 paid DLC includes improved Roach (PRE-ORDER NOW!)  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoL1NRh8JOI  \n  \n11. And a lot more (see comments)",

A very simplified example would be that you take ten \"Common\" skins, all from different skin collections, and use them with a Trade Up Contract. Those ten \"Common\" skins are now turned into one \"Rare\" skin from one of the ten collections. This is obviously oversimplified due to there being several levels of rarity, multiple collections and multiple skins in each level of rarity in each collection, but hopefully you get the idea.\n\nCertainly many of you have also heard of knives in CS:GO. They are extremely rare and can be very valuable. Prices can and often do go up to the thousands. All knives in the game are considered to be Exceedingly Rare items. One level of rarity below them are \"red\" skins, or what are called Covert. These Covert skins cannot be traded up into Exceedingly Rare skins. However, in his video McSkillet claims that with a new update the possibility of doing just so has come.\n\nThis would normally not be a big deal at all, and it would mostly be contained to the CS:GO community and even then just considered a funny joke, but the thing is that people bought it. The [prices](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/AUG%20%7C%20Chameleon%20%28Factory%20New%29) of [certain](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/MAC-10%20%7C%20Neon%20Rider%20%28Field-Tested%29) Covert [skins](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/Galil%20AR%20%7C%20Chatterbox%20%28Battle-Scarred%29) spiked immensely, sometimes by over a 100%. Looking at the sale history on the Steam Marketplace, people were buying and selling these, admittedly cheap Covert skins with ridiculous prices because if you were actually able to trade them up to knives, you would make huge profit.",

to you. But because they need more of an  explanation, I wanted to list them separately.\n\n\\- [Fenty Skin](https://www.instagram.com/fentyskin/) & [Fenty Beauty](https://www.instagram.com/fentybeauty/?hl=nl), As pointed out by u/Heytherestairs, is mostly owned by LVMH. And while it's an INCREDIBLY [big deal](https://www.npr.org/2019/05/12/722519647/rihanna-disrupts-luxury-fashion-world-joining-lvmh-with-fenty-brand?t=1591626870290) that Rihanna signed with them, it [seems](https://lisaalamode.com/2017/09/13/fenty-beauty-really-black-owned-makeup-brand-know-receipts/) that Rihanna is only listed as the founder of the brand and its name, but not as the CEO. Wether that's problematic or not is another conversation. But the question here is, how much of the brand does she truly own and how much of that money actually comes her way? If anyone has done more research on this, please share it! For now Fenty Skin & Beauty will stay listed here. This is not a boycott, just a disclaimer.\n\n\\- **SheaMoisture** is listed here because they have been bought by Unilever. More about Unilever's practices [here](https://newint.org/features/web-exclusive/2017/04/13/inside-unilever-sustainability-myth). Thank you u/addanchorpoint & u/elianna7 for pointing it out.\n\n\\- **Carol's Daughter** is listed here because they are owned by L'oreal. More information about why L'oreal doesn't deserve our support [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EuroSkincare/comments/gwctl0/please_let_support_our_sister_subreddit_rbeauty/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). Thank you for pointing it out u/falloutficus\n\n*if you believe any of these brands should be on one of the above lists instead of here, please state so why so we can discuss it. This is an open conversation, I'm just trying to listen to the community here and adjust where needed. If there are any other brands that need a disclaimer, please let me know.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LINKS**\n\nI just saw u/itscaitlin had posted a very helpful list under the 'Black Lives Matter' post, which you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/gvyjwg/black_lives_matter/fssm2kh?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n\n[This Into The Gloss article](https://intothegloss.com/2020/06/black-beauty-brands/) features a lot of great brands that aren't listed here! *recommended by* u/radgreek\n\nu/Wakandalady posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EuroSkincare/comments/gwctl0/please_let_support_our_sister_subreddit_rbeauty/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) about why you shouldn't support L'oreal and any of its daughter-brands.

I don't wear a lot of makeup on the daily, actually lipstick is my main staple but after YEARS of mixing random colors in my bathroom to get an okay-ish subtle nude I did a bunch of research and found NOTHING about nude makeup for woc. \n\nWhen Mented got into the game it changed SO MUCH FOR ME. \n\nLook, no shade if that's what you like. But Glossier and brands like that might show WOC in their ads now a days but their products ARE NOT formulated or conceptualized with melanin in mind at all. \n\nTo get the same \"no makeup\" or sultry yet sophisticated look for work, school, everyday takes an entirely different approach when your skin is darker than almond milk LOL. \n\nBrands have been pitching us green and purple lipsticks longer than theyve been creating products that work for every day use on black, brown, and asian women. \n\nTheres nothing wrong with colorful makeup but the advertisements that primarily show darker skinned women in party makeup implies something. We work in corporate settings too! We deserve makeup that works with any setting.\n\nI've just ordered their eyeshadow palette. (Again I never wore a lot of eyeshadow in the past because I'm not a pink/green eye kinda girl and neutrals would not show up on my skin, or they'd turn my eyelids gray. Yuck.)",

    "body": "*Update: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SO MANY LINK SHARESü•π‚ù§Ô∏èCrossed 300 reshares! And SOOO many upvotes tooü•∫ maybe I should create some more guides‚ò∫Ô∏èLet me know what you want me to :)*\n\nI'm a Femboy here so...some of this may be extreme but you can look into the particular heading :) I've been shaving my body from last 4-5 years. I'll mention what I follow.\n\nIn my opinion, nothing makes a man more sexy, hot and attractive than him sporting an all natural bushüå≥üòä! \n\nBut since hygiene may be compromised at times, I feel this can help a lot of the jocks, studs, hunks, dads and men in general on this sub-reddit :'P! And since many of you might feel shy regarding this, I thought of sharing my insights, experience and the way I go for shaving the pubes üòä:-\n\n(Do all this with **warm water.** Cold water would tighten your pores and won't give the comfortable finish)\n\n**Starting with a trimmer** with a clip-on to avoid any skin coming between the trimmer, **set it on around 3-4 scale and cut all long and thick hair possible!** This will help in a faster shave later and may not clog your razor blade! ü™í\n\n**For dicky üçÜ:** Get yourself **slightly erected (semi)**! The reason, so that you can get a tighter skin to work on the base of your manhood which will lead to easier and quicker shaving :)! Work your way up near the pubic region first by foaming with shaving cream/gel and lathering üßºüòÑ then slowly reach up the shaft and go along the grain. Once you're finished doing this, rinse the area thoroughly!\n\n---------------------------------\n\n**For balls üçí:** You don't necessarily need to be hard or semi. But you have to make sure that you lather and foam much better and gently! And absolutely **NO USE OF ELECTRIC TRIMMER!** This would be your worst choice and no matter how much clippers you use, your skin on your balls can 90% be snipped between them! Always prefer shaving or at max, using a scissor to gently trim the hair. Then **take smaller segments of the skin on your testicles and gently stretch it and then run the razor to make that area smooth** ü™íüòÑand then finish off the remaining! And be very gently and calm! My advice would be to go for a **warm shower** rather than a cold one so that your balls are relaxed, loose and hang instead of a tight skin! \n\nKeep rinsing and applying the cream again and again as you will have to see how much is left üòÑ! Apply an aftershave once you're done with this to prevent any infections in the area :)\n\n---------------------------------\n\n**LEGS ü¶µüèª -** \nFirstly, trim your hair using a electric body trimmer for a faster and easier shaving process. Rinse the hair and apply the shaving gel and create lather. Let it sit on for 30s to make the skin soft and hydrated. **DO NOT go against the grain on your thighs** ! I have done this in the past and it gives so much bumps and itchyness. Follow your natural hair growth and shave in that. Below the knees, you can go against the grain by just sliding the razor from up to down at first then down to up. \n\n---------------------------------\n\n**BUTTOCKS üçë -** \nI don't like to use a trimmer to cut any excess hair as the skin over there might get agitated and create bumps later. Shaving procedure remains the same. The way I do it is I **stand in front of mirror and then shave by my instinct and then twist to see if everything's clear** (sounds funny lol because it isü•≤üòÇ).\n\n                               ---------------------------------\n\n**NEAR THE HOLE üç©-**\nVery sensitive area and you have to go much slowly and not overdo or repeat the strokes. **For this, I usually do this after I finish my shower, I lie on my back and then spread my legs (like missionary position) and get a clear look of the centre and then watch in the mirror as I shave**. Again, a bit hard to do but works well after some practice :)\n\n                               ---------------------------------\n\n**CHEST AND BELLYü§∞üèª -**\nUse a trimmer on dry skin and trim all your hair well and good till the base. I sometimes prefer this as it gets the job done of smoothening. But if opting for shaving, the process remains the same. But *you may get an itch or redness for 2-3 days after you shave* against the grain. **DON'T** itch it a lot or else it will worsen the skin.\n\n\n**Always moisturize after shaving** the avoid itching, rashes and irritation due to dry skin after!\n\n---------------------------------\n\n**Incase you're someone who fancy a beautiful pubic shape**, you can first **set your trimmer to a 4-5 scale and then trim off all the longer bush and then remove the clip-ons and trim it from the base to your desires shape** :) this *needs to be done prior to shaving the area hence, on a dry skin!* Then repeat the procedure for shaving until you end up with the clean, neat and well shaped pubic artwork üòÑü™¥!\n\n----------------------------------\n\n**Optional pro-tip** : Your feet are as cute as your body :'D so make sure you prep the toes, nails and soles well. The same moisturiser works! But if you want the **skin to remain soft and supple, grab an ice cube üßä and slowly rub it before sleeping to increase circulation and make them pink and soft naturally! The same can be done for your face if you're suffering from acne!** *It works wonders for real* ü¶∂üèªüßèüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\n                             ---------------------------------        \n\n**Clean/change your bedsheet that particular day** as your bedsheet may have dirt or bacteria which might irritate or cause skin to get infected due to open pores after shaving.\n\n                             ---------------------------------\n\n**GOT A CUT WHILE SHAVINGü•∫üò±!?!**\nNo need to panic at all :) We've all been there! I've cut myself a few times and it's mostly either because I wasn't lathered and relaxed the skin enough or it was an area where I am not able to see clearly hence, my instincts go wrong :/ In such a case, **immediately stop shaving that area and just sit or have that area rinsed in cold shower. If you're bleeding, keep washing with cold water until bleeding stops. Finish your shower and gently apply an antiseptic in a cotton ball (ouchüò£but it's going to save youüòÑ)! And throw that particular blade and get a new one!** After that, make sure atleast for a day not to irritate or rub the area by anything! Small cuts heal in a day )\n\n                              ---------------------------------\n\nGet yourself nice and cleansed in the shower but my recommendation would be **not use any bodywash or soap the same day** as these consists of chemicals which may cause irritation to the shaved area. So, I just **use a loofah sponge** and gently, under the warm shower, start swirling it around in circulation motion all over my body. This is called **exfoliation and is important to avoid bumpyness and dry dead skin left on the body** :) it *really* works!\n\n                              ---------------------------------\n\nAfter the shower, **use a moisturizer with less fragrance and no parabens** preferably (I use **Calosoft and Hymos lotion** as suggested by my dermat). Drop **2-3 drops of Tea Tree Essential Oil** in your moisturiser to avoid any acne/buttne on your skin :) (this can be optional as tea tree oil might be strong for some skin)\n\n                              ---------------------------------\n\nHope this helps to you all‚ù§Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è Any suggestions or questions from other people are most welcome in the comments :'D!",

This was just a nice post to share some frustrations many of us have had during our time on this sub.\n\n2. Please consult a professional before making serious changes to things like your diet, birth controls, supplements, etc. That kind of stuff deserves professional opinions, not just a subreddit.\n\n3. Your skin DOES NOT define you. It is okay to age. It is okay to have wrinkles and acne and rosacea and everything in between. But don‚Äôt make yourself miserable by spending every hour of your life on this sub looking for answers. We are all unique and so is your skin. You will not find every answer in this sub and that‚Äôs okay. Put your happiness and mental health above your skincare routine ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n(Also big thanks to the Admins for letting this post blossom though there‚Äôs been quite a bit of slander lol)\n\nORIGINAL POST:\n\nCeraVe is overhyped, waiting 20-30 min between products does nothing, & physical exfoliants (that‚Äôs right, St Ives) can be extremely beneficial  ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø \n\nWhat are yours?\n\nEdit: I‚Äôll also add that I‚Äôd choose foods I love over my skin. While I do agree that shitty foods contribute to shitty skin, I refuse to cut out my sacred cheese enchiladas just because dairy may or may not cause acne. I refuse to let my skin hold me back from eating the food I enjoy.\n\nAnother edit: here‚Äôs another one, I also think fragrance isn‚Äôt that bad. Ponds has fragrance & has been so kind to my skin.",

The stupidity, hypocrisy, and counter-productive actions that occur in SCA is no joke.\n\nAdditionally, those who apparently don't have as much money as others feel the need to attack those who \"show-off\" their extensive collection of skincare which is so aggravating since its just further proof of YMMV, they don't have it all to flaunt it, they have it all because what they tried did not work. So honestly fuck off.\n\nGive skincare advice. It's sad to see all the questions left unanswered on the daily thread, yet multiple people are so quick to attack and downvote those who have an extensive collection of skincare. WASTING time, and defeating the purpose of the sub.",

No one EVER stops by our house. There is absolutely no one for him to impress at home. \n\nFor those of you who wear cologne, is this normal? Back when I was younger, I only wore it when I went out with friends. Cologne is expensive, I don't see the point of wasting it like this.\n\nI've been critical of him spraying it WAY too heavily recently, so I'm trying to avoid coming across as critical about this too. I just don't get it.\n\nSincerely, \n\nOld & Uncool\n\nEdit: Thanks for all of the insight.

This one is absolutely beautiful, too, and I just love the different effects and outfits so much. I currently have number 1 and 4 as my phone's background. I'm always enchanted by these wonderful pictures. \n\nThe photographer once shared the following words: \n\"I adore her. To be honest she is one of my top top favorite people that l've ever shot. She was lovely. She was just a darling to work with and very smart. I know it's one of her favorite photoshoots.\nAs a matter of fact, that photo shoot l'd done for her became the best-selling merchandising of any female artist in history. Which means a lot. We shot her two best selling fragrance campaigns, Vanity Fair covers, single covers and so many magazines.\"\n\nWhat is/are your favorites?",

But almost every young girl gets a britney fragrance at least gifted once. \n\nShe has been robbed of so much money under that conservatorship it's insane. WHERE IS THE MONEY. Even her lawyer brought it up in her suit against her family etc. The missing fragrance funds. \n\nEven if she had the worst deal In history. How can she have been personally paid 117 million for her Vegas residency. Sold over 1.5 billion bottles of perfume. And yet only has a net worth of 30 million. What's gone on is disgusting. \n\nI'm not someone who usually cares about rich people's money.

    "body": "So for those of you interested in Chinese cooking, we figured it might be helpful to list out the common ingredients used in a Chinese pantry.  I know that this turned into a bit into a novella ‚Äì I seem to have just nailed that awkward middle ground in between ‚Äòtoo much ink spilled to be a reddit post‚Äô and ‚Äònot quite as comprehensive enough to be a reference‚Äô.  There‚Äôs a bit of a TL;DR at the end, and if you want there‚Äôs a six and a half minute [video to go with this](https://youtu.be/hdVIMD50wuw).\n\nI‚Äôve split these up into a few different categories.  In each category I‚Äôm going *roughly* in the order of how commonplace the ingredient is in Chinese cooking.  We 80% of the time cook either Cantonese or Sichuanese food, so we‚Äôve got that bias‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm **sure** that I might be blanking on some ingredients.  If you‚Äôre familiar with Chinese cooking and have something to add, lemme know and we can add it in.\n\n######Basic Seasonings\n\n(1) **Salt**. Pantry Essential, of course.  Basic table salt (iodized salt) is used in most recipes.  Sichuan is pretty famous for salt production, if you‚Äôre obsessive you could search for ‚ÄòSichuan salt‚Äô, which‚Äôs also a powder and has *slightly* less salinity than table salt.  \n\n(2) **Sugar**.  Pantry essential, of course.  Basic granulated white sugar here.\n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* Experienced cooks‚Äôll know that sugar often has a place in savory dishes, and in Chinese cuisine it‚Äôs especially commonplace.  Whether it‚Äôs Sichuan Dan Dan noodles, Dim Sum Siu Mai, or even often a simple stir-fried veg, a touch of sugar is almost as commonplace as salt.  \n\n(3) **Cornstarch (ÁîüÁ≤â)**.  Pantry Essential. Now, while I always list out ‚Äòcornstarch‚Äô in these recipes, this ingredient ‚Äì *shengfen* in Mandarin ‚Äì commonly refers to two ingredients: cornstarch and potato starch.  They are, in essence, almost exactly the same thing, though some cooks‚Äôll swear that cornstarch makes for a crispier coating when deep frying stuff.\n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* Cornstarch, just like in Western cooking, is basically always first mixed with a touch of water to make a slurry in order to prevent clumping.  You can use that to thicken sauces, just like you would a pan sauce ‚Äì these sorts of cornstarch thickened sauces are called *qian* (Ëä°).  Further, in Chinese cooking cornstarch is a basic ingredient in marinades ‚Äì the cornstarch‚Äôll coat the meat and, when cooked, the gelatin from the starch‚Äôll create a barrier to prevent moisture from leaking.  Lastly, cornstarch can be used to create a sort of super crispy crust when deep-frying.\n\n(4) **Rock Sugar (ÂÜ∞Á≥ñ)**.  Rock sugar‚Äôs crystalized sugar ‚Äì usually, the stuff we get here in China is ‚Äòmulti-crystallized rock sugar‚Äô (which has a jagged sort of appearance) as opposed to the ‚Äòmono-crystallized rock sugar‚Äô that‚Äôs common in the West.  The two can be used interchangeably.\n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* Rock sugar has a touch milder taste than granulated sugar, and is often used in soups and braises.  When making *tangse* - a sort of quick ‚Äòcaramel‚Äô made by melting sugar in hot oil that‚Äôs a base for a lot of braises, e.g. hongshaorou (red-braised pork) ‚Äì some cooks swear that using pounded rock sugar makes for a better effect (we‚Äôve converted to using granulated sugar for *tangse*, as it‚Äôs quicker, easier, and we don‚Äôt notice a difference in taste).\n\n*Recommended subs:* If you‚Äôre obsessive, you could opt for raw sugar or a natural cane sugar‚Ä¶ but in general granulated sugar‚Äôs completely fine.     \n\n(5) **MSG (Âë≥Á≤æ) -or- Chicken Bouillon Powder (È∏°Á≤â).**  The absolute bane of the ‚Äònatural, healthy cooking‚Äô crowd, a lot of ink‚Äôs been shed on the so-called health effects of MSG.  We even had one dude over on YouTube lambaste us for using MSG as it apparently caused ‚Äòpenile shrinking‚Äô lol. For what it‚Äôs worth, the actual scientific literature is basically as fuckin inconclusive as it gets.  Chicken bouillon powder usually contains MSG, and is used to a similar effect.  In China, the former is more commonly used in restaurants while the latter is more common in home kitchens.\n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* So while the pendulum seems to have swung the other way on MSG, with people embracing its umami-enhancing qualities, we sorta feel like in some circles it‚Äôs perhaps gone *too* far in the other direction.  I don‚Äôt think MSG‚Äôs best used, say, mixed in with salt and put in literally anything and everything.  MSG has two primary uses: first, a sprinkle to help bring out the natural umami in glutamate-rich ingredients ‚Äì it can really amp up dishes that use, say, dried seafood or mushrooms. Second, it balances spicy food really, really well.  The Sichuan *hongyou* chili oil flavor profile (i.e. dishes like koushuiji ‚Äòmouth watering chicken‚Äô or Dan Dan noodles) just wouldn‚Äôt be the same without a teaspoon of MSG.\n\n*Recommended subs:* As stated above, unless it specifically states otherwise, chicken bouillon powder usually contains MSG. Unfortunately, we don‚Äôt really know how much, as they don‚Äôt exactly advertise that fact.  When using bouillon powder instead of MSG, be aware that you‚Äôll also be adding more salinity to your dish as well.\n\n---\n\n######Sauces:\n\nWhen meandering into a Chinese or Asian supermarket, the first thing many people notice are like the mountain of different sauces.  Asian cuisines are the masters of fermentation - about 90% of those sauces are different ingredients fermented in different and interesting ways.\n\n(1) **Light soy sauce (ÁîüÊäΩ).** Pantry essential.  Light soy sauce is the standard soy sauce ‚Äì fermented for 100 days ‚Äì and what a recipe writer‚Äôs referring to if they forgetfully write just ‚Äòsoy sauce‚Äô.  It has more salinity than the dark soy sauce below.\n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* I guess the question is more ‚Äòhow isn‚Äôt soy sauce used‚Äô?  It‚Äôs in marinades, it‚Äôs in sauces, it‚Äôs used for seasoning.  \n\n*What to look for when buying:* Some brands are saltier than others ‚Äì you want a soy sauce with a nice umami undertone.  Take a half teaspoon of your soy sauce and taste it‚Ä¶ if it‚Äôs making your lips pucker, you‚Äôll want a nicer soy sauce.  A brand that we kinda like that‚Äôs available seems to be available abroad is called ‚Äòyipinxian‚Äô (‰∏ÄÂìÅÈ≤ú).  If you don‚Äôt have a nice soy sauce, don‚Äôt worry, don‚Äôt let it be a barrier to cooking! Just keep your salinity in mind and maybe go lighter on the salt.\n\n*Recommended Subs:* So while I believe Chinese light soy sauce isn‚Äôt really available at your standard Western supermarket, the Japanese brand ‚ÄòKikkoman‚Äô is.  Japanese soy sauce‚Äôs aged for longer and is somewhere between Chinese light and Chinese dark soy sauce.  Kikkoman‚Äôd be good enough for government work ‚Äì the longer ferment gives it more umami than some of the lesser quality light soy sauces, though it‚Äôll also impart a darker color to the dish.  The taste would be fine, just know that the final color may not be exactly what you might be expecting.\n\n(2) **Dark Soy Sauce (ËÄÅÊäΩ).** So this isn‚Äôt exactly the second most common sauce, but I figured that it‚Äôd make sense to keep the soy sauces together.  Dark soy sauce‚Äôs made with caramel added and aged for 3-6 months longer, which gives it a darker color and a slightly deeper flavor.\n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* Perhaps surprisingly, mostly for color.  Dark soy sauce is usually used in conjunction with light soy sauce, and is what makes [this Cantonese-style fried noodle]( https://static7.orstatic.com/userphoto/photo/6/5DJ/0128DY86E557692EB9A548px.jpg) more attractive than, say, [this one](http://jp3.r0tt.com/l_cbdd5b40-65ed-11e1-b1db-bd31a8200003.jpg). It‚Äôs also a bit better than light soy sauce when used as a dipping sauce.\n\n*Recommended Subs:* As stated above, Japanese soy sauce is somewhere in between Chinese light and Chinese dark soy sauce.  If there‚Äôs a recipe that uses both, just using all Japanese soy sauce might be a decent route to take.\n\n(3) **Liaojiu (ÊñôÈÖí) a.k.a. Shaoxing Wine (ÁªçÂÖ¥ÈÖí).** Pantry Essential. Both Liaojiu and Shaoxing wine are actually different grades of Huangjiu, a classic sort of Chinese rice wine.  Liaojiu‚Äôs the dirt cheap cooking grade, often has some salt added, and aggressively breaks the ol‚Äô rule in Western cooking that you should only cook with stuff you drink‚Ä¶ that said, unless you‚Äôre working with a recipe that uses this ingredient as the dominant flavor of the dish (e.g. Huadiao Chicken) liaojiu works perfectly well.  Shaoxing is a higher grade of Huangjiu that can be used for drinking or cooking.\n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* Like light soy sauce, liaojiu is used‚Ä¶ extensively.  It forms a critical component of the standard marinade together with salt, sugar, cornstarch, and soy sauce.  While for Western marinades it‚Äôs best not to use alcohol as the lengthy marinade time required for thick cuts of meat‚Äôll actually paradoxically make the meat tougher, for the quicker Chinese marinades (15-30 minutes) the alcohol‚Äôll make the proteins denature and get more tender.  In addition, a splash of liaojiu on your spatula and around the sides of the wok is an extremely common step in many stir-frys. \n\n*What to look for when buying:* Again, for most purposes a cheap-o sort of liaojiu is completely fine.  Be aware that a lot of the stuff abroad that‚Äôs called ‚ÄòShaoxing wine‚Äô is actually just liaojiu ‚Äì you can tell by (1) the salt content and (2) the fact that they‚Äôll often have the Chinese characters for liaojiu, ‚ÄòÊñôÈÖí‚Äô, obviously written on the bottle.  If you want to make sure that you‚Äôre getting a higher grade one, check for something that says it‚Äôs ‚Äòhuadiao‚Äô (Ëä±Èõï, or sometimes written ‚Äòhua tiao‚Äô). Unlike Shaoxing (which‚Äôs a term sorta thrown around nowadays, especially abroad), Huadiao specifically refers to a higher grade of Huangjiu.\n\n*Recommended Subs:* The go-to sub for liaojiu that you‚Äôll find online is ‚Äòa dry sherry‚Äô.  I know that many people swear by it, and I‚Äôm not gunna argue with them‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve just never tried it myself!  I think liaojiu‚Äôs something that you got a bit more flexibility with than many realize ‚Äì especially because for most recipes you‚Äôre just using a little bit.  I used white wine once when I was back in the States and it was fine.  Mirin‚Äôs kinda similar but‚Äôs super sweet ‚Äì but given how sugar‚Äôs used as a seasoning in many dishes, using that and dialing back the sugar should be ok. Chinese rice wine‚Äôs (Á±≥ÈÖí, *mijiu*) isn‚Äôt the same but can often be used in the same way, so sake would also likely do the trick.   \n\n(4) **Toasted sesame oil (È∫ªÊ≤π).**  Pantry Essential.  Ok, I know this isn‚Äôt exactly a ‚Äòsauce‚Äô, but categorizing stuff is hard lol. Toasted sesame oil‚Äôs sesame oil made, from, well, toasted sesame seeds.\n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* Toasted sesame oil‚Äôs **not** a frying oil, it‚Äôs for finishing ‚Äì it add a nice little nutty taste to the dish.  Some people say that heating it up‚Äôll cause it to have a ‚Äòburnt‚Äô taste, and some‚Äôll say that it‚Äôll just lose it‚Äôs flavor‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt experimented mostly because I don‚Äôt feel like pissing money away.  Sometimes you‚Äôll see people use it in marinades, which we used to do as well until we watched a chef explain that using a standard cooking oil would have the same effect (which‚Äôs pretty obvious in hindsight).\n\n(5) **Dark Chinese Vinegar (ÈôàÈÜã -or- È¶ôÈÜã).** Pantry Essential.  Dark Chinese vinegar‚Äôs aged, and sort of like the Chinese equivalent of Balsamic.  There‚Äôs actually two types of Dark Chinese aged vinegar - *chencu* (‚Äòmature vinegar‚Äô) which‚Äôs from the Northwest Province of Shanxi and made with wheat and shorgum, and *xiangcu* (‚Äòfragrant vinegar‚Äô a.k.a. Chinkiang vinegar) which‚Äôs from the city of Zhenjiang in Jiangsu province and made with sticky rice.  The flavor‚Äôs a bit different, and we usually call for *chencu*, but using them interchangeably is usually ok. \n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* Dark vinegar is extensively used in Northern Chinese cuisine, and also forms a critical component in the sauces of many dishes in Sichuanese food.  It makes a great dipping sauce, and some people in the Northwest‚Äôll even toss it in their soups.\n\n*Recommended Subs:* This one‚Äôs hard, as both *chencu* and *xiangcu* have pretty unique tastes.  Balsamic would be the obvious choice, but again‚Ä¶ it has its own complexities.  IIRC America‚Äôs Test Kitchen once used a mix of equal parts balsamic, rice vinegar, and water to sub for *xiangcu*‚Ä¶ so maybe something like that‚Äôd be plausible.  You could also perhaps just use balsamic ‚Äì it‚Äôd undeniably be different, but especially if a dish is using just small amounts I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be bad.\n\n(6) **White Chinese Vinegar (ÁôΩÈÜã).**  White Chinese vinegar‚Äôs made from rice, and‚Äôs a bit less astringent than Western white vinegar.  Note that there‚Äôs a ton of varieties of rice vinegar‚Ä¶ some that can get quite delicate, but the bog-standard white rice vinegar would likely be the most common.\n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* White Chinese vinegar‚Äôs used basically how you‚Äôd expect.  It is one possible option to form a sweet-and-sour flavor profile, and an interesting application is that it can be used to prep the skin of Cantonese Siu Yuk (crispy roast pork belly).\n\n*Recommended subs:* While some rice vinegars could get real difficult to sub, this stuff‚Äôs more or less interchangeable with Western white vinegar. Just be careful with it ‚Äì if you‚Äôre feeling paranoid, one possible option might be to slightly water it down. \n\n(7) **Oyster Sauce (ËöùÊ≤π)**. Pantry Essential. The old story of the creation of oyster sauce was that a shopkeep was boiling some oysters, forgot about them, and found them boiled down into a paste.  While that‚Äôs almost certainly apocryphal, the traditional way of making oyster sauce *is* slowly simmering away oysters til it forms a thick sauce. Of course, if manufacturing it that way makes the price of the sauce pretty astronomical ‚Äì nowadays, it‚Äôs usually made from oyster extracts, sugar, and thickened with a cornstarch slurry.\n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* Oyster sauce is an important ingredient in a lot of Cantonese dishes, adding sweetness and umami. The flavor of oyster sauce seems to go real well with beef ‚Äì when cooking beef, it‚Äôs a common addition to marinades.  While it‚Äôs originally from Guangdong, it‚Äôs since spread throughout the country and you can find it pretty much anywhere.\n\n*What to look for when buying:* One of the most common brands for Chinese products abroad is Lee Kum Kee. In general, Lee Kum Kee‚Äôs a solid enough brand for Cantonese products ‚Äì they got their start selling oyster sauce, and hey, they‚Äôre a great option.  Just be wary of their stuff that‚Äôs from other Chinese cuisines ‚Äì e.g. I don‚Äôt like their Guilin chili sauce, and their Sichuan doubanjiang is‚Ä¶ pretty bad.            \n\n(8) **Stock Concentrate (È∏°Ê±Å).** Pantry Essential, at least for us.  Those of you familiar with better-than-bouillon and similar products are familiar with stock concentrate.  Yes, *of course* a homemade stock is best, but stock concentrate is generally tastier than powder or boxed stock.  Generally, the chicken flavored ones work, but are much less tasty than the scallop or abalone varieties.  Some of the latter ones can have a bit of a pronounced seafood flavor ‚Äì for general purpose it‚Äôs best if you can find a more neutral one, but many dishes can handle a touch of seafood flavor as well.  \n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* You wouldn‚Äôt want it for, say, a soup ‚Äì in my personal opinion, the reason it‚Äôs easier to get away with using stock concentrate in Chinese cuisine is that the flavor‚Äôs often already being built up from strong, umami-rich ingredients like soy sauce.  We generally use roughly 1 tsp of concentrate per ¬Ω to ¬æ cup of water to make ‚Äòstock‚Äô.\n\n*Recommended Subs:* If subbing in a Western stock concentrate, for best results make sure that it has a relatively neutral chicken flavor (some brands are more heavily seasoned) and also not a roasted stock.  \n\n(9) **Sichuan Pixian Doubanjiang (ÈÉ´ÂéøË±ÜÁì£ÈÖ±)**.  Pantry Essential if cooking Sichuan food. A.k.a. Chili bean paste. Sichuan Doubanjiang‚Äôs made from fermenting broad beans, chilis, and other ingredients. \n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* Sichuan Pixian Doubanjiang is a super common addition to the Sichuanese mala ‚Äònumbing spicy‚Äô flavor profile, and is an important ingredient in your Mapo Tofu. In addition to its fermented undertone, it imparts and absolutely brilliant red color.  It‚Äôs a unique ingredient, there‚Äôs really no possible subs for this guy. \n\n*What to look for when buying:* There seems to be some mixups when buying Sichuan Pixian Doubanjiang, as ‚ÄúDoubanjiang‚Äù is really a *category* of different fermented bean pastes.  I‚Äôd venture that this Sichuan version is the most common, followed by a plain Northern version that‚Äôs also called ‚ÄúHuangdoujiang‚Äù (yellow soybean paste), and another called ‚ÄúDajiang‚Äù (which‚Äôs similar to the Korean Doenjang). If you went on Amazon and search ‚Äúdoubanjiang‚Äù, 95% of what you‚Äôd find are the spicy Sichuan varieties.  To be certain you‚Äôre getting the right one however, (1) make sure it‚Äôs an obvious red color and (2) look for something that says it‚Äôs ‚ÄúPixian Doubanjiang‚Äù, which specifically refers to this chili bean paste.\n\n(10) **Other fermented sauces.**  In the interest of everyone‚Äôs time, I‚Äôm gunna consolidate the mountain of other different fermented sauces here.  How common each one is depends where you are in China.  As stated above, *Huangdoujiang* (ÈªÑË±ÜÈÖ±) is made from fermented soy beans and is common in Northeastern and Hakka cooking.  *Hoisin* (Êµ∑È≤úÈÖ±) is Cantonese, made from fermented soy beans and spices, and is primarily used for dipping.  *Tianmianjiang* (ÁîúÈù¢ÈÖ±) is a Northern sauce made from (interestingly) fermented steamed buns, and is the base for the sauce that‚Äôs used in Peking Duck. *Mianchi* (Èù¢Ë±â) is a sauce made from fermented and aged soybeans, is almost identical to Japanese red miso if made using traditional methods, and is one of the basic components to Char Siu sauce. *Chuhou Paste* (Êü±ÂÄôÈÖ±) is similar to Hoisin in that it‚Äôs a Cantonese sauce made with fermented soy beans and seasonings ‚Äì different in that the seasonings include sesame paste and aged tangerine peel.  It‚Äôs used in certain meat braises and stews. *Shoudouchi* (Ê∞¥Ë±ÜË±â) are a sort of ‚Äòquick fermented‚Äô soybean that can be made at home and is common in Hunan and Guizhou cuisines.\n\n(11) **Sesame Paste (ËäùÈ∫ªÈÖ±).** Made from pounded toasted sesame seeds.  Look for a natural one with some visible oil at the top of the jar.\n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* Commonly used in sauces ‚Äì e.g. Sichuan cuisine uses it in the sauce for Dan Dan noodles, and it‚Äôs also common to see it in sauces for cold vegetable dishes.\n\n*Recommended subs:* Tahini is basically the same thing only made with olive oil.  If you‚Äôre desperate and working with a dish where sesame paste isn‚Äôt the primary flavor, you could even play around with peanut butter.\n\n(12) **Fermented Bean Curd (ËÖê‰π≥).** One of among a potpourri of Asian ingredients some Americans seem to love to film themselves gagging on, fermented bean curd comes in red (called ‚Äònanru‚Äô, Âçó‰π≥) and white varieties.  The red version gets its color from the addition of red yeast rice (fermented rice).\n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* There‚Äôs a few classic dishes, such as nanru peanuts, that use fermented bean curd as a base.  It‚Äôs sometimes used in doughs, such as ‚Äòguobie‚Äô, the crispy fried cracker that goes into street food-style Jianbing.  It‚Äôs also a common addition to Char Siu sauce.\n\n(13) **Laoganma Chili Sauce (ËÄÅÂπ≤Â¶à).** If this was a list of ‚Äòmost common ingredients used by college students in China‚Äô, it might be near the top of the list.  Laoganma‚Äôs really a line of sauces, has two that are particularly popular: (1) spicy chili crisp and (2) chili oil with black bean.\n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* Laoganma enthusiasts seem to put it in‚Ä¶ almost anything.  A buddy of mine from Yunnan in university used to even mix it in with his white rice.  Of the two popular varieties, the spicy chili crisp is more of a condiment while the chili oil with black bean‚Äôs more of an ingredient.  You can potentially use Laoganma‚Äôs chili oil with black bean in any sort of dish that would use (1) chilis and (2) one of those fermented sauces from #9.  It‚Äôs really convenient to have for random weeknight stir-fries: garlic + ginger + laoganma with a splash of liaojiu and soy sauce works with‚Ä¶ a lot of stuff.   \n\n---\n\n######Aromatics:\n\nThese are almost all self-explanatory, as these are almost all aromatics that‚Äôre also used in Western cooking.  I‚Äôll be a bit less long-winded here, promise.  \n\n(1) **Garlic.**. Pantry essential, as it is in Western cooking. \n\n*How it‚Äôs used*: So garlic, along with the next two ingredients (ginger and green onion), make up the three most common aromatics in Chinese cooking.  They‚Äôre used together in different ways, usually one of: just garlic, just ginger, garlic and ginger, ginger and green onion, garlic plus ginger and green onion\n\n(2) **Ginger (Âßú).** Pantry essential.\n\n(3.) **Green onion, white part only (Ëë±).**  Pantry essential.\n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* When using green onion as an aromatic, it‚Äôs most common to use only the white part of the green onion ‚Äì that two to four inch section at the bottom.\n\n(4) **Leek (Â§ßËë±).** Much more common in Northern China than the south.\n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* Julienned, and either used as an aromatic (to the similar effect of the white-part-of-the-green-onion) or served raw as a vegetable in dishes like Northern Zhajiangmian and Peking Duck.\n\n*Recommended Subs:* Even though it‚Äôs used in Western cooking as well, it seems not every supermarket‚Äôll carry leek ‚Äì and sometimes when they do, it can be expensive.  The white part of the green onion can be a suitable sub if using leek as an aromatic.\n\n(5) **Shallot (Âπ≤Ëë±).** Much more common in Southern China than the north.\n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* Ginger and shallot sometimes appear together as a variant of the ginger and green onion combination.\n\n(6) **White onion (Ê¥ãËë±).**  Not used as often as it is in Western cooking ‚Äì if you translated the Chinese  for onion (Ê¥ãËë±) character by character it‚Äôd literally be ‚ÄòÊ¥ã = imported; Ëë± = green onion‚Äô.  Still, it‚Äôs around, and used quite a bit.\n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* Scallion and white onion are often fried together to make ‚Äòscallion oil‚Äô, which is a classic ingredient in Huaiyang and Cantonese cuisine. You can often find them in fried noodles, and in Cantonese cuisine they tend to use it with beef.  In the Northwest, you can find them raw in ‚Äòsalads‚Äô (i.e. cold vegetable dishes).\n\n(7) **Chinese Celery (ËäπËèú).** Chinese celery‚Äôs a standard vegetable in Chinese cooking, but it‚Äôs also used as an aromatic‚Ä¶ most famously in Chaoshan (Teochew) cuisine.  It‚Äôs got less water content and a bit more of a pungent and flavorful taste than Western celery.  \n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* Chinese celery and deep fried garlic are a classic combination in Teochew cooking.  Again, this guy (like, say, *jiucai* - Chinese chives) is used a bit more often as a ‚Äòstrong‚Äô vegetable to have in stir-fry.\n\n*Recommended Subs:* You could use Western celery in a pinch, but be advised that the water contend of Western celery has the potential to muff things up when stir frying.  If you have a weak stove and wanna play it safe, first toast the Western celery in a dry wok/pan to remove some of its moisture.  \n\n---\n\n######Spices:\n\n(1) **White pepper powder (ÁôΩËÉ°Ê§íÁ≤â).** Pantry Essential. I‚Äôm sure most of you‚Äôve used white pepper before ‚Äì it‚Äôs got a bit sharper of a taste than black pepper, which is around but less common in Chinese cooking.\n\n(2) **Sichuan Peppercorn (Ëä±Ê§í).** Pantry Essential. An absolutely imperative ingredient to have around if cooking Sichuan food, Sichuan peppercorn has a real unique flavor ‚Äì you might know about its mouth numbing qualities, but it‚Äôs got this real nice floral taste as well.  You‚Äôll find Sichuan peppercorn in both ‚Äòred‚Äô and ‚Äògreen‚Äô varieties‚Ä¶ the green peppercorn‚Äôs actually from a different plant, with a stronger taste and the floral qualities dialed up to 11.  Usually, you‚Äôll be using the red variety.\n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* Sichuan peppercorn is used in a number of different flavor profiles in Sichuanese cooking, some of which leave your mouth crazy tingly. Sichuan peppercorn‚Äôs not ‚Äòspicy‚Äô per se but rather *balances* heat really well ‚Äì sometimes, you don‚Äôt wanna impart a tingling sensation but rather only use a touch to balance out your chilis.  A spoonful of Sichuan peppercorn‚Äôs also a nice addition to poaching liquid or braises (e.g. Northwestern ‚Äòbig plate of chicken‚Äô or some versions of Red Braised Pork) ‚Äì when used in that fashion, it‚Äôll only lend its floral qualities.  \n\nWhen stir-frying, use Sichuan peppercorns in one of two ways: either fry it with the oil and remove, or toast the whole peppercorns and grind into a powder (or you could just fry the peppercorns and leave em in, many home cooks in China do so).  Just don‚Äôt use Sichuan peppercorn powder ‚Äì the ingredient really doesn‚Äôt seem to hold up well in its powdered form.\n\n*What to watch out for when buying:*  Unfortunately, it seems as though many of the exported Sichuan peppercorns aren‚Äôt the best of quality.  You can obviously still use sub-par peppercorns, just don‚Äôt be disappointed if they don‚Äôt exactly give you the desire effect in the numbing flavor profiles!  If you‚Äôre wondering if your peppercorns are nice enough, take two peppercorns and chew on them ‚Äì they should have an obvious tingling effect.  If not, it might be a decent idea to buy some Sichuan peppercorns online from online spice shops‚Ä¶ I chatted a few months back with /u/suzhousteve, who works for (owns?) a company called ‚ÄúSpice Trekkers‚Äù ‚Äì I obviously can‚Äôt vouch for their quality, but the dude was quite knowledgeable and talked a bit about the pains of sourcing good ones.\n\n*Recommended Subs:* There are no recommended subs.  Recipes need to stop suggesting black pepper as a sub ‚Äì they‚Äôre totally 1000% not the same thing.  Subbing Sichuan peppercorn with black pepper because they‚Äôre both peppercorns would be like subbing bitter melon with watermelon just because they‚Äôre both melons.            \n\n(3) **Chinese five spice (‰∫îÈ¶ôÁ≤â).** Pantry Essential. So perhaps confusingly, there‚Äôs not ‚Äòone‚Äô five spice ‚Äì different brands have different blends, and some of them use more than five spices!  A common mix is cinnamon, clove, star anise, Sichuan peppercorn, and fennel seed.  Other additions are licorice root, white pepper, shanzha (hawthorn berry), shajiang (sand ginger a.k.a. kencur or Cutcherry powder), cardamom seed, or ginger powder.  \n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* Five spice goes great with meat, pork in particular. Just FYI, it‚Äôs not really an ingredient to toss in stir-fry‚Ä¶ but rather for steamed and particularly roasted dishes. \n\n(4) **Braising spices.** So again, in the interest of everyone‚Äôs time I‚Äôll consolidate these into one item.  Besides these, spices are most commonly used in Chinese cooking when poaching or braising ‚Äì the most common being cinnamon (Ê°ÇÁöÆ), clove (‰∏ÅÈ¶ô), fennel seed (Â∞èËå¥È¶ô), Sichuan peppercorn, star anise (ÂÖ´Ëßí), dried bay leaf (È¶ôÂè∂), and black cardamom (ËçâÊûú).  From there, depending on the recipe, a potentially absurd back catalogue of spices can sometimes be called for: nutmeg, cumin seed, dried galangal, shanzha (hawthorn berry), baizhi, cardamom seed, liqourice root, luohanguo‚Ä¶ you get the idea.  Sometimes these‚Äôre even all used together!\n\n*Recommended subs:* If you encounter a recipe that has a mind boggling list of spices (e.g. Roujiamo, the ‚ÄòChinese Hamburger‚Äô), we‚Äôll say this: it‚Äôs safe to opt for only using the ones from that list ‚Äúcommon braising spices‚Äù above.  I know I‚Äôm kinda skirting with heresy here, but in my personal opinion there starts to reach a point of diminishing returns when it comes to spices‚Ä¶ and honestly, I think some of those dishes include a mountain of spices mostly due to their supposed health benefits.  We‚Äôll always write our recipes to include all of the spices used for the sake of being accurate and unbiased, but don‚Äôt drive yourself crazy trying to hunt down that dried hawthorn berry only to add one or two to a braise.\n\n(5) **Shajiang (Ê≤ôÂßú).** A.k.a. Sand ginger powder, Kencur, or Cutcherry powder.  I know this one can be a tough one to source, you should be able to find it on Amazon under the name ‚Äòcutcherry powder‚Äô or the Malaysian name ‚Äòkencur‚Äô.  It‚Äôs a pretty unique taste, a bit like a peppery ginger.\n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* This ingredient‚Äôs most commonly used in Cantonese cuisine.  Dishes that use it are salt-baked chicken (*yanjuji*), the terribly translated ‚Äòsalt-and-pepper‚Äô flavor profile (e.g. salt and pepper shrimp), and is an important ingredient in Char Siu sauce.\n\n---\n\n**Chilis and Chili Sauces:**\n\nNote that Scoville units here are just a shorthand. Is Scoville unscientific?  Sure, but it still can give you a decent idea of the heat level if you‚Äôre working with an unfamiliar pepper. \n\nBefore we get started, allow me to be upfront with something that I‚Äôm still unclear on: the mystery of the Tien Tsin chili pepper.  English language sources‚Äôll insist that *that*, the Tien Tsin chili, is *the* chili pepper that‚Äôs used in Sichuanese and Hunanese cuisine.  Tien Tsin is, of course, the city of ‚ÄúTianjin‚Äù in pinyin‚Ä¶ which ain‚Äôt exactly an area that‚Äôs known for it‚Äôs love of spicy food.\n\nFrom what I can tell, it seems the Tien Tsin chili, called ‚ÄòTianying‚Äô in Mandarin, was a variety of Cayenne introduced from Japan to Tianjin in the late 1970s.  People then started producing it there *specifically for export*.  Who knew?\n\nNote that according to everything I‚Äôve read, Tien Tsin chilis are quite hot, hotter even than Heaven Facing Chilis.  I‚Äôm sure the flavor‚Äôd work, but it‚Äôs just something to keep in mind.\n\nSo we‚Äôll talk a bit about chili varieties, but in the end‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd consider some sort of variety of fresh mild chilis and dried hot chilis ‚Äòpantry essentials‚Äô. All of the chilis we‚Äôre talking about here are from the Capsicum annuum cultivar ‚Äì chilis are one of those quintessentially local ingredients, get creative!     \n\n(1) **Red and Green Mild Paprika Chilis (Á∫¢Ëæ£Ê§í/ÈùíËæ£Ê§í).** ~150 SVU.\n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* Fresh. Very common in Cantonese cuisine when you wanna add a bit of chili flavor but without the heat.  Also used for color and garnish.\n\n*Recommmended subs:* Anaheims are spicier but are a reasonable sub.  Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really common to have a ‚Äòred mild chili‚Äô abroad, so if you‚Äôre using the red for color, it seems that red bell pepper might be the only possible route.\n \n(2) **Cayenne Pepper (ÁâõËßíÊ§í/Ëæ£Ê§íÂπ≤).** In the video I stupidly forgot to talk about this.  In areas of China that aren‚Äôt named ‚ÄúSichuan‚Äù, it‚Äôs probably the most common dried chili pepper.\n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* Dried.\n\n(3) **Erjingtiao (‰∫åËçÜÊù°).**  Can‚Äôt find the SVU, I‚Äôd reckon ~20-30,000 SVU looking at comparables.  \n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* Fresh, dried, and pickled.  Erjingtiao‚Äôs valued due to its fragrance and brilliant red color.\n\n*Recommended subs:* We‚Äôd recommend something of a similar cultivar and heat level ‚Äì Dried Cayenne and Chili de Arbol should work fine for most dishes.  For something like Sichuan chili oil where you‚Äôd really want that red color, you might wanna think about playing with a combination of one of those subs and a bit of Hungarian Sweet Paprika or something.  It seems as though pickled erjingtiao are pretty rare abroad, so for that you might want some sort of combination of Western-style red pickled peppers and pickled chaotianjiao.\n\n(4) **Chaotianjiao (ÊúùÂ§©Ê§í), ‚ÄúHeaven Facing Pepper‚Äù** SVU ~50,000. \n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* Fresh, dried, and pickled.  Dried Chaotianjiao‚Äôs used in Sichuan cuisine when you really wanna amp up the heat, and fresh Chaotianjiao are used quite a bit in Hunan cooking.\n\n*Recommended subs:* Seems like those Tien Tsin chilis‚Äôd be perfect, or if you don‚Äôt mind something slightly hotter you could also go for Thai Bird‚Äôs Eye.\n\n(5) **Chili Oil (Ëæ£Ê§íÊ≤π/Á∫¢Ê≤π).** Ok, so there‚Äôs two types of chili oil ‚Äì the sort that‚Äôs used as a condiment that has little flakes in it, and the sort that‚Äôs used as an ingredient in Sichuanese cooking (*hongyou*, a.k.a. ‚Äòred oil‚Äô).  \n\n*Considerations when buying:* In general, store-bought chili oil ‚Äì especially the Sichuanese ‚Äòred oil‚Äô type ‚Äì isn‚Äôt very good store bought.  That said, for the condiment-like chili oil, Laoganma‚Äôs ‚ÄòChili Crisps in Oil‚Äô can be used.\n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* The Sichuanese ‚Äòred oil‚Äô is the basis of a flavor profile in Sichuanese cooking that includes Dan Dan noodles and Koushuiji (‚ÄòMouth watering chicken‚Äô).  The condiment sort can be, well, used as a condiment.  Use as a dipping sauce, toss in noodle soups, whatever.\n\n(6) **Chili Garlic Sauce (ËíúËìâËæ£Ê§íÈÖ±).**  This‚Äôs really one of those ingredients that‚Äôs really more of a ‚Äòcategory‚Äô than an ingredient.  The most famous ones, off the top of my head, are ‚ÄúZijin Chili Garlic Sauce‚Äù from the Guangdong province and ‚ÄúGuilin Chili Garlic Sauce‚Äù from the Guangxi province.  \n\n*How it‚Äôs used:*  In Cantonese cuisine, Chili Garlic sauce is used mostly for dipping.  In Guangxi, theirs is either for dipping or for mixing in with some cold dishes.\n\n---\n\n######Dried Ingredients:\n\n(1) **Dried Shiitake Mushrooms (ÂÜ¨Ëèá)**. Pantry essential.  Why are dried mushrooms awesome? Well, like tinned tomatoes, usually it‚Äôs only the very best quality mushrooms ‚Äì picked at the height of the season ‚Äì that‚Äôre dried.  Drying also seems to increase the umami of ingredients ‚Äì the science of which I‚Äôm not too sure of.  The shiitake variety is most common in Guangdong.\n\n*How it‚Äôs used:*  Reconstitute the dried mushroom in either hot, boiled water for three hours or for eight hours/overnight in room temperature water.  The leftover water‚Äôs basically like concentrated umami juice ‚Äì use that just like you would stock.\n\n(2) **Dried Shrimp (ËôæÁ±≥).**  Pantry essential. Common throughout coastal China.\n\n*How it‚Äôs used:* Reconstitute in the same fashion with the dried mushrooms, and save that soaking liquid!  Another thing you can do with them is toss em in a blender and blitz for ‚Äòshrimp powder‚Äô.\n\n(3) **Other dried seafood.** There‚Äôs a mind boggling diverse array of different dried seafood ‚Äì most common likely being dried scallop (used in the same way as dried shrimp) and dried flounder (should be grilled over your stove before using, can also be blitzed into powder).  But there‚Äôs a ton more ‚Äì dried octopus, squid, oyster, abalone, sea cucumber‚Ä¶ and also basically any fish you could think of.\n\n(4) **Preserved/Pickled Vegetables.** Again, another whole category of ingredients, but I‚Äôm starting to run out of breath here.  A few would would be dongcai (dried and fermented cabbage), chongcai (dried and fermented turnip), meicai (dried and fermented mustard greens), yacai (similar to meicai, but with seasoning), and zhacai (dried and fermented mustard green stem).\n\n**TL;DR:** \n\n*Essential Chinese Basics:* Salt, Sugar, Cornstarch\n\n*Essential Chinese Sauces:* Light Soy Sauce, Dark Soy Sauce, Liaojiu (Shaoxing Wine), Dark Chinese Vinegar (either Shanxi or Chinkiang is ok), Oyster Sauce,  Stock Concentrate (unless you‚Äôre making your own), Sichuan Pixian Doubanjiang.\n\n*Essential Chinese Aromatics:* Garlic, Ginger, Green Onion\n\n*Essential Chinese Spices:* White pepper, Five Spice, Sichuan Peppercorn\n\n*Essential Chilis:* Some sort of fresh mild chilis, some sort of dried spicy chilis from the Capsicum annuum cultivar\n\n*Essential Dried Ingredients:* Dried mushrooms, dried shrimp or scallops\n",

Unlike the servants working in the Sun or Sky Palace, whose uniforms were predominantly blue - the color of the king - she was donning predominantly green. As was the case for all the others working in the Star Palace. Not only was this symbolic of the fact that they directly served Her Highness; having the entire staff in the color of the princess also showed the changed power dynamic. Ever since she had been given complete authority over Hohmiy's foreign affairs three cycles ago, her word could overturn even that of His and Her Majesty when it came to this topic.\n\nThe estate housing the servants was located on the back side of the palace. It was separate from the main building, but connected via a broad, canopied pathway. Said canopy was laced with a multitude of small, down-facing lights that currently illuminated the otherwise dark route. Despite the early hour, Mhita was by far not the only one up. As soon as the head maid stepped through the servant's entrance, she was immediately greeted by the familiar noises of the servants' daily business that the noble inhabitants of the palace never got to hear.\n\nAfter getting the report from the night shift, Mhita dismissed them before giving the morning shift their individual tasks. The first one of course was cleaning the palace. A delicate job since it needed to be done thoroughly so as to not embarrass Her Highness in front of her guests, quickly so they were done by the time everyone got up, and lastly quietly to not wake anyone up. The latter meant they couldn't use vacuum cleaners or robots since those made too much noise. That was not to say they didn't have those too, they had, they just couldn't be used during the morning duties. And because of that, despite being head maid, Mhita herself participated in this task as well.\n\nJoining the group that was tasked with the east wing, she started to dust off the countless pieces of foreign art that decorated the hallways. Among them were paintings, sculptures, and statues from various otherworldly cultures which their planet had acquired, most of them being gifts from other members of the alliance. As she passed a certain door, she halted for a moment. It was the door that led to Lady Nadine's chamber. Mhita couldn't help but wonder: if the alien noblewoman could truly hear them breathe *through the door*, was there even a point in trying to be quiet? Then again there was a difference between hearing something when it is quiet, and waking up from something.\n\nShe sighed as she kept looking at the door. Eight days had passed since she had seen it open the last time. Normally, caring for Her Highness's guests was just another task, one of her many duties, nothing more. But with Nadine, things had grown to be... different. Since the first day, the young noblewoman had acted in a way that was completely different from what one would expect. In fact, until she learned contrary, Mhita was convinced she was a commoner. Since her arrival, she had treated the servants with respect, always asked and never ordered, struck conversations with them, and even went through the trouble of learning all their names. Therefore, ever since the situation had become what it was, she had wanted to help her, not because was ordered to or because it was expected of her, but because she by now actually found herself caring for her. But she didn't know how.\n\nAfter the cleaning was done, a quick glance at the clock told Mhita that there was only about one inva left until the princess would wake up, so it was due time for her next task.\n\nStepping into the office area, she linked her datapad to the central network and took a look at the messages that had come in during the night. As always, they mostly consisted of companies requesting certain resources or products to be added to existing trade agreements. Ever since Lady Kykla had arrived, most of the requests were about the topic of titanium and that Her Highness should try to make a new deal regarding the metal. With a sigh, Mhita quickly skimmed over everything before sorting the messages so that Princess Silgvani would first see those that actually had some form of relevance.\n\nShe encountered Her Highness on her way out, greeted her with a bow and informed her that today, Riykan would be the ones tasked with her direct attendance. Her next destination was the kitchen but before that, she took a short detour to Vassahr‚Äôs office to see if he needed help with something. While the palace‚Äôs steward hadn‚Äôt put up any requests on the digital board, it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to quickly ask him in person, just to make sure.\n\nUnder Kahbbut‚Äôs direction, the kitchen staff hurriedly prepared the food for the palace‚Äôs employees, while the head chef himself was busy with the meals meant for the princess and her guests. Today, the schedule was completely reserved for the trade negotiations, meaning he had to make both Tystire and Human meals. Grabbing what was meant for her, Mhita entered the adjacent break room to have a quick firstmeal. While she ate, she took advantage of the moment of quietness to make some estimations about the planning for the following days.\n\nToday was the eighth day since the ambassador‚Äôs arrival, and the sixth day of the negotiations. Under normal circumstances, she would predict the talks to continue for at least three more days, better assume five just to be sure. But considering the difficulties they expected this time, Her Highness, Mhita, and Vassahr had decided to plan for fifteen days. Meaning by now, nine were left. They had already prepared everything for that timespan plus four days of buffer, safe for some ingredients that couldn‚Äôt be stored that long. Should it seem like things would take longer than that, they would need to rely on her Highness to make that call. Stuff acquirable on Hohmiy was no problem, but not everything was. At the current time of the cycle, it would take a fast ship a bit over a day to reach the hyperlane entrance. There was a total of three other planets where they could purchase the stuff they might need and that had the according treaties in place. However, one of them was the Tystrie‚Äôs homeworld itself. A quick glance at her datapad proved her memory correct, they were too far away from their entry point to be an option. Depending on which of the others they‚Äôd choose the jump itself would take about one more day. Assuming the relays worked, they could then send a message to the planet.\n\nShe again glanced at her datapad to look up the other planets‚Äô estimated positions. Depending on their choice, the cargo ship would either need five or eight days to reach the hyperlane. Eight was too long, the Krsnelv‚Äôs planet was therefore out of the picture as well. Five it was, one more for the jump back, and since the transport vessel was slower, two days to reach Hohmiy. Typing the numbers in the calculator gave her a total of ten days. And if they didn‚Äôt want to do everything on the last day, the call for a new shipment had to come in three days if needed. It would probably be for the best to remind Her Highness of that.\n\nA heavy, salty smell pulled her out of her thoughts. By now, she was able to recognize the fragrance as roasted meat, meaning Kabbut was now preparing the meal for Lady Nadine. When she had seen the blood-smeared interior of the shuttle, Mhita couldn‚Äôt understand how someone would deliberately eat something that gave off such a bad odor. The cooked meat, however, she had to admit, smelled at least‚Ä¶ peculiar.\n\nShe stood up and walked to the kitchen. Another maid, Ghundiy, was loading Nadine‚Äôs firstmeal onto a tray when Doctor Githaiy entered.\n\n\"Doctor,\" Mhita greeted her with a quick bow. \"Here to accompany Ghundiy, I presume?\"\n\n\"Of course. I still need to examine whether the change in diet had some notable effects on her.\"\n\nA short pause followed.\n\n\"You think she‚Äôll open today?\"\n\nThe doctor‚Äôs gaze fell.\n\n\"Probably not. But I‚Äôll keep trying.\"\n\nShe nodded, not knowing what else to say.\n\nAs they left, Mhita went over the next tasks.\n\n\"Okay, Liyxa and Onrol, you two take care of the meals for Her Highness and the ambassador. While they eat, I‚Äôll refill the drinks in the conference room. Nakiy‚Ä¶ ah, is still busy. Okay, then you take care of the laundry, Essa. Forget the report for now, I‚Äôll do that myself later.\"\n\nShe sighed.\n\n\"First Ones, we should have asked for more than just two additional servants.\"\n\n\"I can take care of the drinks if you want.\"\n\nSurprised by the new voice, Mhita turned around. In front of her, holding a water canteen and wearing a blue uniform rather than a green one, was one of the maids that had been called in from the Sun Palace. For some reason, she seemed a bit nervous.\n\n\"Kaiyla, right? Why are you here? Weren‚Äôt you supposed to attend Lady Kykla?\"\n\n\"I am. She has sent me on an errand.\"\n\nMhita crossed her arms.\n\n\"Then I‚Äôd say you should probably do that.\"\n\n\"She is busy talking to Her Highness right now, I have more than enough time to give you a hand.\"\n\nShe turned to the door, but Mhita stopped her.\n\n\"I don‚Äôt know if that is how things are done in the Sun Palace, but here, we take the tasks given to us seriously.\"\n\nKaiyla scoffed at that.\n\n\"Too bad the same can‚Äôt be said about respecting your seniors.\"\n\n\"You might be older than me, but in case you‚Äôve forgotten, I‚Äôm still the head maid!\"\n\n\"A meaningless title given to a meaningless plebian. I have you know that I carry the blood of clan Ressla, who ruled one of the largest kingdoms before the unification wars and played a decisive role in it.\"\n\nMhitas expression hardened. It was true that her being head maid was unusual. Even among servants, the head of staff was usually someone who was of noble birth at least in some way but didn‚Äôt have any real chances of succession. But that didn‚Äôt mean that she didn‚Äôt have a response to that.\n\n\"Yes, and who also birthed the infamous Duchess Mirla. What, you thought I wouldn‚Äôt look up the people who get sent here? Your family lost their title before you were even born, you are just as much a commoner as I am.\"\n\nThe entire kitchen had fallen silent while the two of them stared at each other. But the tension between them suddenly broke when Kaiyla took a step back and defensively raised her arms.\n\n\"Sheesh, no need to get so agitated.\"\n\nShe turned her back to them and placed the canteen back on the counter.\n\n\"I saw you were tight on time and thought you might appreciate some help. Was just an offer, you don‚Äôt have to take it.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLater that day, Silgvani was sitting at the desk in her bedroom. Staring blankly, she had spaced out a little while rubbing her forehead.\n\n*\"SIS!\"* her brother‚Äôs voice shouted out of the datapad, pulling her back into reality. Right now was a scheduled pause in today‚Äôs talks, which she had decided to use to call her brother. Once he got transferred to Viyrminar, which was on the literal other side of the planet, calls like this would become difficult.\n\n\"I‚Äôm sorry. What were you saying?\"\n\n*\"Is everything alright?\"*\n\nConcern coming from her brother, the things she was allowed to witness.\n\n\"Yes, don‚Äôt worry. Just a little headache.\"\n\n*\"Is Nadine there today?\"*\n\n\"Sorry, no.\"\n\n*\"Come ooon! Is she* that *busy?\"*\n\n\"That‚Äôs not it, she‚Ä¶\"\n\nThe princess took a deep breath.\n\n\"‚Ä¶ever since she came back, she has locked herself in her room and lets nobody in.\"\n\n*\"Huh? Why?\"*\n\n\"She is scared. After what happened to you, she‚Äôs afraid it‚Äôll happen again.\"\n\n*\"‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs bullshit!\"*\n\nSilgvani blinked.\n\n\"That is‚Ä¶ what?\"\n\n*\"Her word. Whatever, just let me talk to her,\"* he insisted.\n\n\"We‚Äôve been trying that for eight days,\" she answered with a sigh. \"She doesn‚Äôt even answer the door.\"\n\n*\"Have you tried the window?\"*\n\n\"‚Ä¶window?\"\n\n*\"Yes, her window that's facing the garden, it‚Äôs always open. That‚Äôs how I usually get in.\"*\n\n\"Of course you do,\" she said sarcastically.\n\n*\"Oh, shut up. You wanna help her or not?\"*\n\n\"‚Ä¶\"\n\nSince when was her brother so assertive?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm actually doing this,‚Äù Silgvani murmured while shaking her head. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm in the garden. What now?\"\n\n*\"Go along the wall. Don‚Äôt use the path, you have to walk on the grass. Make slow, long steps, and make sure not to step on dry leaves. Once you are past the orange liysca bush, hold your breath. Mess up any of those and she‚Äôll hear you coming. I‚Äôll mute the call till you‚Äôre there.\"*\n\n\"I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm actually doing this,\" she repeated quietly.\n\nAvoiding the leaves wasn‚Äôt too difficult. However, the distance between the bush and the window wasn‚Äôt small. But for what could be the first time in her life, Silgvani was thankful for her tall body, as her long legs allowed her to bridge the distance just before she ran out of air.\n\n\"Hey,\" she panted as she reached her destination. Immediately, Nadine‚Äôs head snapped in her direction. Not even a tigg later she was sitting on the opposite side of the room, her back pressing against the wall.\n\n\"Relax, I won‚Äôt hurt you,\" she tried to calm her down. However, her joke didn‚Äôt seem to get appreciated.\n\n\"You know what might happen,\" she answered with a tired-sounding voice.\n\n\"Yes, it may happen that I molt a bit early. I‚Äôm close, remember?\"\n\nThe small alien closed her eyes and took a deep breath.\n\n\"Please leave.\"\n\n\"I will,\" Silgvani affirmed with a nod. She then reached into the room and leaned her datapad against the wall under the window so the video call was visible. \"But he won‚Äôt.\"\n\nAs soon as she stepped away from the opening, she could hear some shuffling in the room.\n\n\"K-Kiyrtin? Kiyrtin! Oh my god, how are you?! I‚Äôm so sorry! Are you alright?!\"\n\n*\"No, I‚Äôm not!\"* her brother's voice answered. *\"I‚Äôm bored! I wanted to speak with you all the time, why didn‚Äôt you let anyone in?!\"*\n\n\"B-but‚Ä¶ what happened to you-\"\n\n*\"Was an accident! And it only happened because I clung to you for multiple invas! Yet you act as if we‚Äôll fall over dead just because you touch us once!\"*\n\n\"I-it can still happen again. My strength is also-\"\n\n*\"Well, then I guess you just have to be careful! I mean, be honest, how many people did you touch since you got here?\"*\n\n\"Um‚Ä¶well, there was that one time with Liyzo-\"\n\n*\"And did anything happen to him?\"*\n\n\"I‚Ä¶ think not?\"\n\n*\"See? First Ones, when did I become the voice of reason?!\"*\n\nSilgvani scowled a bit at her brother‚Äôs harsh tone. Then again, maybe that helped? In any case, she had to go back now, so she decided to leave the two alone.\n\nThe sun had set and the ambassador had left the palace when Silgvani heard a knock on her door. It was Mhita, the Star Palace‚Äôs head maid, who seemed‚Ä¶ happy, for some reason.\n\n\"Did something good happen?\"\n\n\"Indeed, Your Highness,\" she answered and gave her a datapad. Said datapad had a video call on it, showing the face of a certain alien.\n\n\"I must thank you. Also, I am sorry for the last week.\"\n\n\"It‚Äôs fine,\" Silgvani assured her, not asking what a \"week\" was. \"The important thing is that you‚Äôre coming out again. Well, somewhat.\"\n\nThis time, the small alien actually chuckled a bit.\n\n\"I‚Ä¶ just don‚Äôt want to risk it. But I agree that this can‚Äôt go on. Therefore, I would like to ask for a few things, some of which might get pricey.\"\n\n\"Money is not an issue,\" Silgvani insisted, gesturing for Mhita to take notes. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"First, I would like to resume and double my language lessons.\"\n\n\"‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ okay.\" A bit of a slow start, but she said there would be multiple things, so whatever.\n\n\"Secondly, once I can write, I want someone who can teach me your programming language.\"\n\nWith that one, Nadine had lost her, so Silgvani simply nodded along.\n\n\"Lastly, I need to speak to the dressmaker ASAP.\"\n\n\"‚Ä¶sure, why not.\" What by the First Ones was she planning now?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/rmacpo/the_princess_and_the_human_ch_1/)\n\n[Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/xpon4u/the_princess_and_the_human_ch_31/)\n\n[Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/yea98g/the_princess_and_the_human_ch_33/)",

It's been of immeasurable help. \n\n**NOTE 2** Thank you to the kind stranger who gave my last post gold, and brought more attention to my plight.\n\n**NOTE 3** Never forget what I went through. Never.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most blinding, ethereal light I had experienced in my life emitted from the inside of the suitcase. I don‚Äôt know what else I expected. A dead body, a massive amount of blood, my father‚Äôs corpse. I don‚Äôt know what, but the light shone brighter than anything I had ever experienced. \n\nI was knocked off of my feet, flat on my ass, but luckily this time I was able to avoid my head making friends with the cement tiles, and maintained consciousness. My eyes adjusted. I looked around, I was still on the terrace, but my mother and my Christopher were not. I scrambled to my feet, my palms were bruised from bracing myself from the fall, and I wiped the flecks of blood, that started to pool on the heel of my hand, on my pants. \n\nI looked over to where the creature was standing and he was still there. He was still shaped like Christopher, and his lip was still burst. He raised his hand and made the ‚Äúcome here‚Äù gesture with his finger. Beckoning me. \n\nI ran in the opposite direction, around the corner and back through the door into the condominium. \n\n‚ÄúCHRISTOPHER! MUM! WHERE ARE YOU?!‚Äù I was frantic. Had this been the payment that the creature was seeking? Was he going to take everything that I loved in the world just for money? My mother‚Äôs laugh and Christopher‚Äôs smile was worth more than any amount of money could buy; if they were gone, I could see no reason to live, no reason to continue. A swan dive off of the terrace onto the hot albeit comforting sidewalk 40+ stories below, would have been the choice I would have opted for. \n\nWhy the fuck did one woman need so much space. That was the only thought that echoed in my mind as I ran through hallway upon hallway screaming for both of them. I ran into my mother‚Äôs room, and up the stairs behind her bed to the second floor area, that had it‚Äôs own balcony. Maybe I had passed out and she had run to where it was considered to be safe. \n\nWe had done drills when she first moved in of where she would go if someone broke in and tried to kill her or hold her ransom, and the second floor balcony in her bedroom was always considered the furthest from the main entrance. But nothing, she wasn‚Äôt there. I couldn‚Äôt find her anywhere. \n\nChristopher and I had stayed at the condo while our bedroom was being refinished, so he was intimately acquainted with the place. I ran from bedroom to bedroom screaming like a mad man, almost begging him to emerge. But nothing. \n\nI started to run out of breath, snot and flem pouring from my nose and mouth respectively. Fuck why did I smoke so much. \n\n‚ÄúCHRISTOPHER!!!!!!!!‚Äù With the last ounce of strength that I had I screamed. I bellowed. I begged. But nothing, just sheer unadulterated silence. \n\nI refused to give up. I ran out the main entrance and down the hallway. I pounded on Mrs. Thompson-Fitch‚Äôs door, screaming for her. Maybe in a mad dash, Christopher and my mother had run there.\n\nNothing, no answer, no response. The old bitch was a terrible person, dripping with jewels and attitude, but I begged and prayed that she would answer her door. I kept pounding, but I never got the response I was so desperately seeking. \n\nMy mind raced to alternatives. The Fire Alarm! If I couldn‚Äôt find my family, I would throw the whole fucking building in a panic! I raced to where the elevator was and pulled the alarm. Dead silence. $15,000 a month in condo fees and the fucking alarm wasn‚Äôt working! This was bullshit. I hit the elevator button but it refused to light up. I was running out of options, and fast. \n\nI decided that even though my smoker‚Äôs lungs had failed me while I was running through the apartment, my best bet was to run down the stairs and have one of the valets call the cops. I had tried my hardest to avoid involving the police, since evidently my own family was the source of this newfound misery. I bolted for the stairwell door and grabbed the handle.\n\nTouching the handle seared my hand. Badly. ‚ÄúFUCK!‚Äù I screamed and looked at my palm, the scrapes from bracing myself from the fall on the terrace were virtually cauterized. No more bleeding, but my hand was badly burned.\n\nI took my shirt off and wrapped it around my other hand, hoping that this would allow me to turn the knob. I reached for the handle again, less hot but still burning. It refused to turn. The creature was refusing to let me leave. I sat on the ground, I didn‚Äôt know what other options I had, I had to face him. \n\nI picked myself up after a minute or two and headed back into my mother‚Äôs place. As I entered the condo, I realized that not only were Christopher and my mother missing, but so was everyone else. None of the staff were there, no one was.\n\n‚ÄúSylvie! Astrid!‚Äù I screamed, but no one answered. I realized that I was truly alone. No one was there. I walked back through the maze of corridors and came up to the wall of windows. I walked  outside, to the edge of the terrace. I thought about jumping and wanted to ensure that if I did throw myself off, I wouldn‚Äôt land on someone‚Äôs balcony. I refused to live in a world without Christopher or my mother. As much of a momma's boy that that made me sound like, losing the two people that I loved the most in the world was too much to handle.\n\nI placed my hands on the railing and leaned over. The building was a highrise in Toronto and I should have seen thousands of cars and people going about their regular lives, unaware of the insane happenings transpiring above them. But there was nothing. \n\nIf MY eyes could bulge out of my head they certainly would at that point. There were no other people. No one. I looked into the glass facades of the buildings that surrounded me, and there was no one. There were living rooms with empty sofas, beds that were unmade with no one occupying them, and parking lots that were completely empty. There was no one. What kind of limitless power did this thing have? Could I even kill myself? I had no one left in the world that cared about me. \n There was nothing but the desolation of an empty soul to confront. I refused to go on. It had been less than two days and my life had been ripped away from me. If you live in a warzone, you cling to your home, your pictures, your loved ones, your affectations. You cling to a cause. I had no causes left. \n\nI propped myself up onto the ledge and sat on the balustrade that ran the entire length of the terrace; my feet dangled over. I kicked off one of shoes to make sure that it would fall, and it tumbled effortlessly to the ground. I had lost my mind and had no way of regaining it. If this thing could strip away everything I loved just by opening a suitcase, what was worth fighting for? \n\n*‚ÄúYou may want to take a look inside the suitcase before you decide to do that.‚Äù* \n\nIt was Christopher‚Äôs voice. I knew it was the creature, but hearing that voice made me turn around. I hoped beyond all possibility and all reality that when I turned around my man would be standing there. I slowly turned my head, and there he was, 20 feet behind me. The creature, covered in the black, oozing blood. \n\nI stared at him over my shoulder, my feet still hanging off the terrace. \n\n‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù I said in a tone just above a whisper, there was no strength left to scream. \n\nThe creature advanced towards me and said in that beautiful voice: *‚ÄúWe want to settle your debts. We brought you back before, and if you think that this can be evened out by simply jumping, you‚Äôre far less intelligent than the degrees we allowed you to have would insinuate.‚Äù*\n\nI chuckled almost silently. ‚ÄòAllowed me to have.‚Äô He was right. Everything I had earned and everything that I had accomplished, and even everything I had failed at was simply at the behest of this creature and his kind. \n\n**Me**: What are you? How can you do this? Are you a devil?\n\nThe creature quietly chuckled and advanced even closer to me. I wasn‚Äôt filled with dread anymore, just an overwhelming sense of resignation. \n\nThe Creature spoke.\n\n*‚ÄúWe are what you humans refer to as fate. We are the hand that guides. We are the power that makes it be. Your world and our's overlap one another, like water on a pane of glass. You see right through us, and when the time is right, just when the time is right, we even out the score.‚Äù*\n\n*‚ÄùWe are charged by the universe with the ultimate responsibility of ensuring that an equality is struck. That no one, man, woman, beast, is endowed with the ability to achieve more than they are capable of. When you a see father rip off a door to save his child from a burning vehicle, we have allowed that to occur. And in the same vein, when an infant dies from cancer, we are the ones that take that life. When you walk across that stage, holding that Nobel Prize, we are the ones that have allowed your research to succeed. And in the same vein, when a nuclear missile strikes a city and wipes thousands off the face of the Earth in a blink of an eye, we are the force that allows the trigger to activate.‚Äù*\n\nI had so many questions. I swung around and sat facing the condo, feet now hanging safely over the terrace floor. ‚ÄúWho is we?‚Äù \n\nThe creature smiled Chris‚Äôs smile, but without the lips that I so longed to feel again. \n\n*‚ÄúThere are many of us, however we operate as one. We do not see the need for division, since efficiency is our tool of choice. We tend to appear in a pleasing form, your father to your mother, your Cristopher to you, Dr. Meagan to your Christopher. Our only tell is that when we leave our world and enter yours, our intentions are laid bare.‚Äù*\n\nI was on the verge of understanding. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean your intentions are laid bare? Is it the smell?‚Äù \n\nThe creature continued,\n\n*‚ÄúYes, it is the smell. What you smell is not rotting flesh, though it may appear as such when tested by your human science. We have no need for flesh, but the stench of rotting possibilities. The smell of overwhelming poverty that your parents should have been subjected to, the acrid odour of a life wasted consuming drugs, and the overpowering fragrance of every failure you had ever encounter and undertaken. Christopher Smells your death, you smell your wasted life, your mother smells poverty, the woman at the Hotel (I presumed he was referring to the clerk) smells the stench of an affair she wished she never had, Anthony smells the stench of a hit and run that was never reported.‚Äù* \n\nThe small child in the Tim Hortons wasn‚Äôt repelled by the creature‚Äôs smell, because she was too young to know the stench of failure, the pungent scent of unfair advantage. She instead focused on his grotesque lip. It was making sense. \n\n‚ÄúThen why does your lip bleed?‚Äù It was the only thing about the creature‚Äôs physical appearance that remained a mystery. \n\n*‚ÄúBecause we pay a price too. Nothing in existence goes unchecked, and until we remove the imbalances that we are charged to rectify, until we collect all debts, until we ensure payment of all dues, we suffer the consequences of inequality as well. We rot and fester until the ledger is made balanced. Until a fine, delicate, even measure is struck.‚Äù*\n\n‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt your write like us?‚Äù I had to know. \n *‚ÄúWe do not write. We manipulate the fabric of your world to generate the notes and the messages that we send. It allows us to remind you of the unevenness, of the urge to rectify, without having to visit you. Everyone owes a debt, not only you.‚Äù*\n\nI couldn‚Äôt help but lock eyes with him through this entire period. He was explaining himself, and apparently all I needed to do was ask. A physicists worst nightmare is not asking a question when it is required, and I had confronted that fear head on. \n\n\"But you or your kind, or whatever the right phrase would be made the deal with my father, you made the deal with Christopher for my life. How can you claim to be some great force that brings equality when you yourselves brought about the unbalance in the first place!\" This was the first time that I spoke to the creature with anger. \n\n*\"Never over estimate  your worth. Even if you are tempted by fate. Never take a deal without understanding that you do not deserve an advtange, and not just you. Everyone\"* The creature rattled this off as if he had been asked it many times before.\n\n‚ÄúSo, how do I even the balance? How do I equate the ledger?‚Äù I asked, no longer filled with fear but an all consuming need to bring finality to this situation. \n\n*‚ÄúEverything you have must be ours. Everything you own must be given back.‚Äù* The creature said, in Christopher‚Äôs calm, soothing voice.\n\n‚ÄúDo I die?‚Äù I asked in an almost childlike fashion. \n\n*‚ÄúDo you wish to even the score?‚Äù* The creature asked. \n\n‚ÄúDo you often ask?‚Äù I retorted. \n\n*‚ÄúDo you wish to pay your debts, do you wish to even the score?‚Äù* The creature asked again, almost in an a monotonous tone this time. He could feel the finality of his mission approaching, and the balance in this situation being restored. \n\n‚ÄúYes.‚Äù I had no choice, this was the only answer I could give. If he could empty a city by opening a suitcase, what was left for me? \n\n*‚ÄúFollow me,‚Äù* the creature commanded. \n\nI dismounted the balustrade and walked 5 feet behind the creature. We turned the corner, and there, still shining with the light of a thousand sun‚Äôs was the suitcase. He pointed at it, and nodded his head. \n\nAs I approached the suitcase, I realized that the light was bearable. My eyes no longer hurt, and the light consumed me, instead of simply blinding me. I looked deep inside. It was like looking at a television, a display of sorts. I could see countless other debts, both collected and outstanding.\n\nJoseph P. Kennedy (JFK's father), billions over night, daughter died in tragic plane accident at 27. A woman who resembled Mrs. Thompson-Fitch, endless wealth won in a divorce, even though she was unfaithful, cancer by 65. Terminal. A bumbling fool of a man who looked like a young version of my father watching a stock ticker bring him closer to unimaginable wealth. Anthony, crying in a car after mowing down a 9 year old while on vacation in Italy. And a million others. \n\n‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù I asked, absolutely fascinated and mortified\n\n*‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what allows us to even the score. You give yourself to us by entering it, and we remove the debt.‚Äù* He calmly said. \n\n‚ÄúI have to get into it?‚Äù There was no longer strength left to be surprised, or to be distraught. If I had to give my life, give everything that I love and everything that I hold dear in order for this debt to be removed, for the world to reach a balance, and for my Christopher to go about living his life, even without me, it was what needed to happen. I would no longer have peace in my life. I would no longer have my life, if I failed to comply.\n\nI set one foot inside and fell through. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCigarettes and old paper. That was the only thing that I smelled. My vision was blurry but slowly cleared. I was sitting at my desk, in my office at the University. I looked around and everything seemed... Well everything seemed normal. \n\nI shot out of my chair and backed up against the wall. I felt my face, my arms, my legs, my dick, everything. I touched myself everywhere I could. Was that it? All I needed to do was step foot inside of a suitcase and this debt was evened out? Or maybe I had died and this was what the other side of existence felt like. \n\nI ran out of my office and towards the exit of the building. I bolted outside and could feel the hot July sun beating down on my face. I looked at my watch and saw that it was 11:30am July 31, 2014.\n\nI kept running as fast as I could, losing my breath but still pushing myself. I had to see my family, I had to see my mum, I had to see my Christopher. \n\nI darted to my car, and hit the auto-open button. The *beep beep* that it made when the automatic starter unlocked the locks stopped me. The creature. The last few days. It couldn‚Äôt have been a dream. This is insane. What the hell happened to my life. \n\nI entered the car and took a deep breath. No smell, no stench. Maybe all of the years of doing drugs did in fact catch up to me, and this was a delayed delusion. The German-Accented Siri type assistant that accepted voice commands in the car actived. \n\n‚ÄúHello Dr. Blochbauer, the weather today is 28 degree, your estimated time of travel is thirty minutes‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúCALL CHRISTOPHER!!!!!!‚Äù I screamed at her. \n\n‚ÄúCalling Mother,‚Äù she recited back. \n\nTypical, I thought. At lleast the inaccuracy of that interaction made me believe that this was reality. If I was dreaming, the damn thing would have worked perfectly. \n\nThe phone was ringing, and Sylvie‚Äôs comforting voice answered. \n\n‚ÄúHello Dr. Blochbauer, your mother is reading on the terrace, would you like to speak with her?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄòReading‚Äô this early? oh well, who cares, she was there! She was alive! She wa...\n\nMy mind stopped. Everything froze. I slammed on the brakes. Luckily no one was behind me or I could have caused a serious accident. \n\n‚ÄúSylvie what did you call me?‚Äù I asked. \n\n‚ÄúDr. Blochbauer...I‚Äôm sorry, would you prefer Peter.‚Äù She innocently responded. \n\nMy wedding ring was gone. \n\n‚ÄúSylvie, Where‚Äôs Christopher?‚Äù I was starting to hyperventilate. I didn‚Äôt know what was happening. Why was she calling me by my maiden name, where was my RING!? \n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm Sorry Dr. Blochbauer, I don‚Äôt know who Christopher is.‚Äù......I stared blankly at the windshield, what was going on? What price did I pay. \n\n‚ÄúDr. Blochbauer.....Dr. Blochbauer....Peter? Are you there?‚Äù Sylvie repeated the question, but I still didn‚Äôt answer. I hung up the phone by clicking the button on the steering wheel and floored the accelerator. 204 km per hour appeared on the digital readout as I tore down the highway to the house that we shared. \n\nI finally slowed down at Yonge street and exited the highway. The light was red at the end of the ramp, and I hit the voice activated assistant button again. \n\n‚ÄúCALL CHRISTOPHER!‚Äù I screamed at her. \n\n‚ÄúCalling mother‚Äù She replied in her sterile, German tone. I hung up the call. \n\nI held down the home button on my iphone and the famous di-dit of Siri sounded, ‚ÄúCALL CHRISTOPHER‚Äù I said. \n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see Christopher in your address book, should I look for locations by that name?‚Äù Was the only thing she said. The light turned green. \n\nI tore through the streets of Toronto, laws be damned, and turned onto my street. I had to swerve to miss the 12 year old blonde on her bicycle. As my house drew nearer, I could see that the Garage door was opening. CHRISTOPHER MUST BE HOME!!!! This relieved me. \n\nI made a hard right turn into the driveway and froze. \n\nThere in the middle of my garage was the suitcase. Tattered, worn, but no smell. I didn‚Äôt smell the creature. Nothing. \n\nI ran into the house. It was different. The decor was the same, but the pictures on the wall featured me and my friends doing things that I did not remember at all. Me with Sonya at a fashion show. Myself with Bing running the Boston Maraton, Sumentha and I having lunch in Paris. But that was it, no pictures of Christopher and I. NOTHING. \n\nI started to pant. To gasp. I was losing my mind. NO NO NO NO NO, not again, please not again, I didn‚Äôt want to go through this again, I thought it was finished. \n\nI ran into the garage and the suitcase was gone. I ran back into the house, unbelievably hoping to see the creature to ask what was going on. But nothing. I ran up to the bedroom that we had shared, only my clothing was in the closet. Nothing of Christopher‚Äôs was there. Christopher wasn‚Äôt there. Christopher hadn't been there. Ever.\n\nWhere both our degrees hung, only hung my string of degrees, set in the middle instead of at the top of the wall. No room for his. \n\nI ran into the living room, and pulled what should have been our wedding album off the shelf. Instead of the cream coloured leather front, it was red plastic. The Seychelles, The potential adoption, the trips to Venice, the Love, the fucking Love! What did I do!?\n\nI flipped open the album. Again, just pictures of me and my friends, pictures of me and men I didn‚Äôt recognize. Pictures of me kissing the occasional man and more pictures of my friends. Nothing of Christopher. \n\nI flipped to the last page, only one word. I Dropped the album and collapsed, weeping on the ground. \n\nKoLLEcted \n\n",

I feel so many similarities between this and my life in a creepy way.\n\nI, in some way, believe that there is some kind of \"fate\" and that \"luck\" and good timing are part of the mystery.  I've done some terrible things in my past, I've also spent a lot of time and work trying my best to right those wrongs.  But perhaps all debts must be paid.  \n\nI, after feeling like I had finally found redemption to my miserable past had met a girl unlike anyone in the world.  We had this instant attraction, and from the moment of meeting her I have spent the last 2 years with her by my side.  Last night I just spent the first night in 2 years without her.  She left me, or rather moved out.  She says she still wants to be in this relationship, but there's a part of me that takes this story and can see how it applies to my life right now.\n\nI don't have any boogie men stalking me and whatnot, but I have had a miserable series in my life up until about 3 years ago.  A year later a meet the woman of my dreams and now it's vanishing.  Maybe I'm too emotional right now, but I feel almost as though I'm losing her because I have screwed up too many times and don't deserve something so wonderful and perfect.  Perhaps my debt has been KoLLEcted.  That's heartbreaking.",

And wasn't supposed to happen until after dad and mom had died.\n\nPeter wasted his life, died prematurely. And Chris made a deal (in lieu of the currently dead peter) for peters life. And since peter already died, dads debt has been paid, or more accurately, remortgaged. \n\nThe second debt though is peters I believe. Chris made that clear when he said the following : ‚ÄúYou were meant to die, you had selfishly wasted your life, but the creature intervened. Your father‚Äôs debt was not meant to be collected until after both your parents died, but you beat them to the punch. You died before your mother, and the creature refused to accept this, I imagine, so by brining you back, you yourself mortgaged your own life Peter, not me.\"\n\nSo dads debt is paid, and peter owes a debt, a debt for his life and all the enjoyment that it has brought him. And so fate takes the only thing equal in his life. His one and true love Chris. Fate went back to that houseparty where they met, and made it so that Chris walked by Peter instead of helping him up. Chris very probably committed suicide not long after. \n\nAs for the other debts mentioned, like Anthony's. They don't directly deal with fate. It will all work out the same in the end, all debts will be paid, But without literally stalking them around in the flesh. Fate will still stalk them though, just as it stalks every last one of us. Making certain everything is even. That all debts are paid.",
