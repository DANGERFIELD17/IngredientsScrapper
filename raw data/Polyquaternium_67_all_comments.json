    "body": "I have been a long time devoted user of the Round Lab Mugwort Calming Cleanser, and would consider it my HG. I can't even remember how many tubes of it I've gone through. Recently I've noticed that it's started going up in price (last time I bought it I had to pay $26 CAD), and it's become increasingly hard to justify that price for a cleanser. So when I saw this Bring Green Artemisia pH Balancing Foam at my local kbeauty shop for $13.99 CAD I had to try it!\n\n\nSkin type: combination, dehydrated, acne and clog prone\n\n\nRound Lab Ingredients:\n\nWater, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Butylene Glycol, Coco-Betaine, Betaine, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Artemisia Vulgaris Extract, Aspartic Acid, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl Glycol, Polyquaternium-67, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Malt Extract, 1,2- Hexanediol, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Allantoin, Madecassoside, Panthenol, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid\n\n\nBring Green Ingredients:\n\nGlycerin, Purified Water, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Lauryl Betaine, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Artemisia Capillaris Extract (8,000ppm), Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Malt Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Lavender Oil, Citrus Nobilis (Mandarin Orange) Peel Oil, Rosemary Leaf Oil, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Orange Peel Oil, Polyquaternium-39, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder (800ppm), Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Ethylhexylglycerin, Linalool, Limonene \n\n\nBoth cleansers claim to be pH balanced at 5.5 and gentle on the skin. That I will say is true, I never had irritation using the Round Lab, and in the 4 times I've used the Bring Green I didn't either. They both leave my skin feeing properly cleansed without being stripped or dry. \n\n\nTexture wise I prefer the Round Lab. It has a slightly thicker texture which foams up to a nice rich foam. However at times it can take a little extra effort to rinse away. The Bring Green does foam up just as well, but it isn't as rich of a foam. It contains very tiny visible bits of mugwort, but they're so small you don't feel them. It also rinses away much cleaner and faster. \n\n\nIn terms of scent the Round Lab doesn't really have one, it smells very faintly of mugwort. The Bring Green however has a light citrus scent due to the essential oils, but it isn't overpowering and doesn't linger once rinsed. \n\n\nOverall I think I might end up switching to the Bring Green. Although the user experience might not be as pleasant as when using the Round Lab, for almost half the price it's definitely worth keeping in my routine.",

    "body": "A quick review right before I shower HAHAHA.\n\nInfo:\nI have combination skin leaning towards oily. My skin is acne and clog prone and I do have some KP on my bottom cheeks/jaws. My skin is also a sensitive and moody chicken if anyoneâs wondering so Iâm super picky about the products I use. \n\n\nRoutine:\n\nAM: Splash with water -> Vanicream daily facial moisturiser -> some sunscreen sample lol\nPM: Dokdo cleanser -> vanicream daily facial moisturiser\n\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Coco-Betaine, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Potassium Benzoate, Sodium Chloride, Polyquaternium-67, Potassium Cocoate, Citric Acid, Fructooligosaccharides, Saccharide Hydrolysate, Disodium EDTA, Pullulan, 1,2-Hexanediol, Allantoin, Panthenol, Sea Water, Sodium Acetate, Butylene Glycol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Caprylic/âCapric Triglycerides, Beta-Glucan, Phosphatidylcholine, Hyaluronic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceramide NP, Glycine, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Glutamic Acid, Serine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lysine, Alanine, Arginine, Threonine, Proline\n\n\nThis cleanser had a very creamy and sticky texture. It foams a little when you rub your hands together with water. As the whole line is targeted towards sensitive skin, it is a very gentle cleanser.\n\n\nThoughts:\n\nOkay I actually didnât really expect much from this product when I first used it. It was a huge impulse buy and I actually regretted buying it. Prior to using this cleanser, I was using the Rovectin Conditioning Cleanser and letâs just say that it was one big roller coaster haha. I switched over to this cleanser in hopes to save my skin and also because it was just collecting dust on my desk lol.\n\nThe texture is sooooo fun to play with. Even though itâs creamy, itâs also rather sticky. Itâs nothing like the other cleansers Iâve tried before. It doesnât foam up too much so my skin doesnât feel stripped.\n\nWhile it doesnât have any added fragrances, it does have a smell. Personally to me it smells like someone threw up in it, but some people say it smells herbal like or plastic like or mineral like. Yeah lots of different smells LOL. I thought I had bought a fake so I went and bought another cleanser (travel version) from the official store and it smells the same so rip ;-;. \n\nItâs a no nonsense kind of cleanser, does what it needs to do and does it well. It doesnât remove makeup that well because itâs quite gentle, so you might need a first cleanser for that. For sunscreen it depends, but Iâve heard some people just cleanse their face twice with the cleanser just to be safe. \n\nCompared to the previous cleanser I used, this one was so nice to use. It made me feel so excited to shower LOL. I didnât get any reactions from this and in fact, some of my CCs and pimples actually went down when I started using this. \n\nIs this HG? I guess it is. Iâm genuinely hesitant to call something a HG because Iâm scared that my skin will go no u on me. But I guess at this moment? It is close to being one. I bought mine off of SHOPEE and it cost about SGD$18-$20+ with discount. I think the original price is about $30? I might actually repurchase this once Iâm done HAHAHA.  9/10\n\nRoundlab is also well known for their Dokdo toner and Iâm really tempted to try it LOL. But I have my pyunkangyul essence toner coming in soon for me to try so ummmm one day one day. My friend actually bought it and said that itâs such a good toner.",

    "body": "Ive been searching for a replacement for a good cleanser for my dry-dehydrated-sensitive skin. I thought I found my HG cleanser this year with the B Lab Matcha Cleanser which left my skin clean but soft. I fell in love just from trying a free sample from Stylevana. Unfortunately B Lab changed the formula and packaging for this cleanser. I bought the new version and hated it. It was dry and stripping like the Senka whip cleanser. \n\nSo I went through some suggestions from this sub and made a list. I was browsing a local shop today and saw the Round Lab Dokko cleanser for $11 for 150 ml and bought it. Beauty of Josean Green Plum cleanser was also on my to try list but it was $12 for 100 ml so I went with the Round Lab just cuz of the better price per ml.\n\nOverall rating: 4/5\n\nScent: mild soapy scent. Nothing offensive. Barely noticeable. \n\nI latered a dollop in my hands with water then washed my face and rinsed with water. It doesnt really foam up. It cleaned off my skincare, Etude eyebrow pencil, Lilybyred blush, Romand water tint, and Stila eyeliner well.\n\nMy skin didnt fee taut/tight. The cleanser didnt leave a weird filmy layer either. It was just my skin but clean. Its light but I wouldnât call it hydrating â probably because of my dry skin. Best of all, no irritation. \n\n It didnt feel as soft as the og B Lab matcha cleanser though.

BoJ left my skin hydrated actually. While Skin1004 is a cream foam cleanser. It is a basic foam cleanser but made my skin smoother and fresh.

    "body": "**Personal Info:**\n\nI live in nothern europe, so currently cold, windy and dry Climate. My Skintype is sahara desert dry, prone to closed comedones plus some light hormonal acne. Sadly im also super prone to hyperpigmentation. My main Goals are barrier health, hydration, acne & Hyperpigmentation management and getting rid of the damn stubborn CC\\`s... I also follow a kinda skincycling routine wich includes a non AB Retinal product.\n\nIn **Bold** will be the product name + how long i have been using it\n\nin *italic* will be the ingredients i liked\n\n\n\n**Axis-Y Sunday morning cleanser: (using for a month now)** *green tea extract, centella extract, allatonin*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Coco-Betaine, Butylene Glycol, Potassium Cocoate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Benzoate, Polyquaternium-67, Xylitylglucoside, Citric Acid, Anhydroxylitol, Propanediol, Xylitol, Betula Platyphylla Japonica Juice, Glucose, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Disodium EDTA, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Agrimonia Eupatoria Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Dipropylene Glycol, Allantoin, Perilla Frutescens Leaf Extract, Saponaria Officinalis Extract, Sodium Acetate, Pentylene Glycol, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Kigelia Africana Fruit Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Natto Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxycinnamic Acid, Rutin\n\nTexture:\n\na balmy texture, foams up to a dense and soft foam\n\nExpirience:\n\nI picked this up because I wanted to change from my old clenaser to something that felt like it had a bit more cleansing power, yet was not stripping. As far as i can tell it seems to accomplish that. It foams up nicely, cleans well and doesent seem to strip my Skin. After washing it off it feels almost as if there is a slight layer on my Skin, but i dont mind it/ think that it contributes to the non stripping?\n\n(4/5)\n\n**Cosrx Propolis Toner: (about a month 1/2 of use)** *propolis, honey extract, panthenol*\n\nIngredients:\n\nPropolis Extract, Honey Extract, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Cassia Obtusifolia Seed Extract, Panthenol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride\n\nTexture:\n\na waterlike texture, thats just a bit thicker\n\nExpirience:\n\nTo be honest im not overly impressed... its a nice hydrating toner for sure but i didnt notice anything outstanding that would have me choose it again. But it gets a pluspoint for being reasonably priced so i migth pick it up again to reach free shipping...\n\n(3/5)\n\n**Holika Holika Aloe Waterproof Sungel (3 Months of use)** *Aloe*\n\nIngredients:\n\nAqua, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Niacinamide, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Caprylyl Methicone, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hippophae Rhamnoides Fruit Extract, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract, Rosa Canina Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Extract, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Juice, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Pentylene Glycol, Behenyl Alcohol, Poly C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Decyl Glucoside, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, T-butyl Alcohol, Tocopherol, Ascorbic Acid, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Ceramide Np, Phytosphingosine, Parfum\n\nTexture:\n\na thin cream Texture, not runny but almost there\n\nExpirience:\n\nIt comes in quite a big size for a Sunscreen, you can find 80 - 100 ml Tubes online for around 15-17 Euros! Wich honestly was the sole reason why i bougth it xD i figured my skin would be fine with the Ingredients and i just hate tiny sunscreens! And well... that was exactly what it is like, its decently moisturizing and doesnt irritate my Skin. But if you have sensitive Skin be careful, it does have Fragrance, smells kinda like very artificial Aloe. You can smell it but only upon first apllication, it doesnt linger. I have been using 1 bottle for 3 months and still have enough for another month at min. so a win!\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n**Purito Dermide Cica Barrier Sleeping Mask: (3 months of use)** *Squalane, Centella Extract, Jojoba oil, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Ceramide*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract(250,000Ppm), Caprylic/âCapric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Squalane, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Butylene Glycol, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Panthenol, Ceramide NP(3,000Ppm), Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyacetophenone, Sodium Carbomer, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract\n\nTexture:\n\nA thick Cream, feels quite emmolient\n\nExpirience:\n\nI love, love, loe this! Its the first moisturizer that i found that feels like it actually does its job well on my Skin. As a nigthtime moisturizer it keeps my Skin hydrated all through the Night and has my wake up nicely glowy. I love to use this when my Skin is irritated, it really soothes it quickly. Always have this on my Shelf, you would have to pry it out of my dead cold hands, to seperate me from it. One Bottle last me about 2 months.\n\nHG!\n\n(5/5)\n\n**Mary & May Blackberry Cream Essence: (4 months of use)** *Jojoba oil, ceramides, lotus water, centella*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Nymphaea Caerulea Flower Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit Extract, 1,2-hexanediol, Methlypropanediol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Hydrolyzed Gardenia Florida Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Trilaureth-4 Phoshate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Pvm/Ma Copolymer, Cyanocobalamin, Ceramide Np, Maltodextrin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopherol\n\nTexture:\n\nthin, watery but creamy? (just realized i suck at describing textures haha)\n\nExpirience:\n\nA really nice hydrating and moisturizing Toner, feels like a great balance of the two. Acts nicely as a layer with other Skincare because it absorbs really well. I like it, a bottle lasts me about 2 months.\n\n(4/5)\n\n**Abib Quick Sunstick Protection Bar: ( 3 months of use)** *Aloe, Centella, Ceramides*\n\nIngredients:\n\nOctyldodecanol, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Dibutyl Ethylhexanoyl Glutamide, Dibutyl Lauroyl Glutamide, Diisostearyl Malate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dextrin Palmitate, Octocrylene, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Saccharide Isomerate, Maltodextrin, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethyl Hexanediol, Ceramide NP, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol\n\nTexture:\n\nA translucent stick, glides on smooth, feels a bit occlusive on skin\n\nExpirience:\n\nNicely moisturizing Sunstick, feels good on my Skin and well... does its Job xD I really like the curved shape of it, it relly helps with the application. I just use it for reapplication of my sunscreen, but also sometimes when my Skin gets really dry during the day ( tho its not the best for that)\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n**Numbuzin No.2 Protein 43% creamy Serum: ( 4 months of use)** *Oat protein, Ceramides, cholesterol, fatty acids, ferments, Rice protein*\n\nIngredients:\n\nAvena Sativa Protein Extract, Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Poly C6-14 Olefin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Erythritol, Limnanthes Alba Seed Oil, Sodium Chloride, Allantoin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Adenosine, Dextrin, Theobroma Cacao Extract, Pantolactone, Ceramide NP, Cholesterol, Palmitic Acid, Oryza Sativa Seed Protein Extract, Stearic Acid, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Lactobacillus Ferment, Glycine Soja Protein, Hydrolyzed Lupine Protein, Glucose, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Sweet Almond Protein, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Myristic Acid, Hydrolyzed Pea Protein, Arachidic Acid, Lauric Acid, Sodium Succinate, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance\n\nTexture:\n\nVery thick serum, really is creamy like the name says\n\nExpirience:\n\nSooo repairing and soothing, does wonders for my barrier. It really helps keep my Skin moisturized and helps keep my transepidermal waterloss in check. Love it so much! HG!\n\n(5/5)\n\n**Purito Aha Bha Refreshing Solution: (1 month of use)** *Glycolic acid, Salcylic Acid*\n\nIngredients:\n\nSalix Alba (Willow) Bark Water, Butylene Glycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid (7%), Tromethamine, Water, Salicylic Acid(2%), 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Citrate, Arginine, Caprylyl Glycol, Citric Acid(0.28%), Hydroxyacetophenone, Pentylene Glycol, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Disodium EDTA\n\nTexture:\n\nlike water, it put 2-3 drops on a thin cotton pad and swipe over my Face with it\n\nExpirience:\n\nSince it has only been a month i cannot say too much about how it has worked (and i feel its hard to tell what effects on my skin is retinal and whats from this product) but my comedones are reducing in size and developing into breakouts. But the effects of these ingredients are well studied in these concentrations so i would say its save to say it works. Its my first time using glycolic acid and i can say it packs a punch for sure! So be careful, its intense, so far im using it once a week on my exfoliation day and i dont think ill be moving up.... Might also be the fact that its a combo product, but i have been using salcylic acid and mandelic acid in combo before, and that felt less sensitizing. So im attributing that factor to the 7 percent glycolic acid, since it is the smallest molecule size of all Aha\\`s.\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow lets move to quick first impressions of a few products i just started trying, wich i have seperated from the review portion because i just havent been using them long enough to really speak about the effects on my Skin: (these will also be shorter impressions with less info)\n\n\n\n**Neo:labs liquid enhancer Pycogenol:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Propanediol, Hydrogenated Poly C6-14 Olefin, 1.2-Hexanediol, Methylpropanediol, Glycerin, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Saccharum Officinarum Extract, Jojoba Esters, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Salvia Sclarea Oil, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa Root Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Theobroma Cacao Seed Extract, Melaleuca Altemifolia Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, C18-36 Acid Triglyceride, Coprylyl Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, C12-18 Acid Triglyceride, Squalene, Sodium Polyacrylate, Tromethamine, Albatreus Contuena Extract, Paimitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Phytasteryl Macadamiate, Citric Acid, Phytosterol, Dextrin, Tocopherol, Butylene Glycol, 4-Terpineol, Pentylene Glycol, Octonediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\nExpirience:\n\nBougth this because of the tea tree extract, oil and 4- terpineol for the antimicrobial and antiinflammatory benefits , plus it also promised balancing the water-oil contend of the skin. So far i have been using it for a week and it feels nicely moisturizing, but i cannot say if it has helped with my breakouts. Smells strongly like tea tree, wich i dont mind.\n\n**Isntree Spotsaver Mugwort Ampoule:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nArtemisia Princeps Extract, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth-26, Erythritol, Betaine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Piper Methysticum Leaf/Root/Stem Extract, Panthenol, Propanediol, Beta-Glucan, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Allantoin, Carbomer, Tromethamine, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\nExpirience:\n\nThis i got because i heard amazing things about mugwort and it was on a 50 % Sale, so i got it for a steal! So far i like the simple ingredient list an it seems soothing and hydrating.\n\n**RNW Der.Ceramide Cream:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Ceramide NP, Panthenol, Caprylyl Methicone, Glycerin, C12-16 Alcohols, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Ceramide NS, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Ceramide AS, Ceramide AP, Oligopeptide-1, Ceramide EOP, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Betaine, Arginine, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Carbomer, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Arachidyl Glucoside, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Stearic Acid, Adenosine, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium EDTA\n\nExpirience:\n\nIm really intriged by this brand an was debating between this and the Ceramide serum, but got this Cream. At first i was intimitaded by the essential oils and the strong smell it has (herbal, but to my nose very pleasant) so i patchtested it on my cheek. The Patchtests went fine and i have been using it on my whole face for 4 days now and i must say im impressed.\n\nIf you have oily skin i feel you could hate it but for my dry skin... the texture is amazing. Its a THIIICK cream, like an ointment, very balmy. Upon apllication it feels nice to spread it and it sinks in so well for the thick texture. The cream surprisingly dries down velvety and leaving a protective shield over the Skin. I also love that it has 3 % Panthenol, 3% ceramides and cholesterol and fatty acids.... so perfect ingrdients for skin barrier repair! Really a potential HG...\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "Alright, this was both a very easy and very hard review to put together as my views on this Water Based Cleanser are probably a little biased LOL! You seeâ¦this Cleanser saved my lifeâ¦\n\nLOL, not that dramatic but pretty close. If you remember (or donât) I decided about a month ago that it would be an excellent idea to use an âall-naturalâ Bar Soap that had been listed as okay for use on the face. WRONG LOLâ¦over the two plus weeks I used it I ended up stripping my Skin, clogging my pores, inviting breakouts, and generally messing everything up.\n\nWell, after that experience I really needed to switch to something that was going to reverse what I had done to myself. This Make P:rem Cleansing Foam jumped out since it has been recommended by a few bloggers as being great for Sensitive Skin. \n\nThe first thing that I surprised me about this Product was just how creamy/foamy it truly is. Most pH Balanced Cleansers do a decent job (at best) of foaming upâ¦but this one feels really thick and luxurious. Especially after mixing it in my Nooni Whip Makerâ¦WOW! The closest pH Balanced Cleanser I can compare it to is the Sulwhasoo EX Brightening Cleansing Foam. \n\nAs for the Formulaâ¦there are a couple of Ingredients that do raise some concern. The Coconut Based Surfactants (not an issue) followed by a few Essential Oils (can be an issue). I didnât have a problem with them but I would hesitate from recommending this as the ultimate gentle Cleanser as Essential Oils pose a problem for some. Bergamot Oil and Sage Oil are both here. In addition to the Oils we also have Raspberry Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, and Citric Acid (which I assume is there to help lower the pH). \n\nEssential Oils asideâ¦this Cleanser brought my Skin back from the brink so fast I was truly shocked. The foam feels so comfortable and luxuriousâ¦and the mild herbal scent was relaxing. Just after a few uses my Skin seemed to be less red and the few angry red bumps I had developed were much more calm.\n\nOver the past few weeks I have fallen in love with this Product LOL! Usually I am not a fan of such a âbasicâ Cleanser. Give me some antioxidants, give me some brighteningâ¦something! But, this Make P:rem Safe Me Cleanser was exactly what I needed in the moment. I came in and quietly said âIâm just gonna pop in here and fix this.â and went on its way.\n\nMy struggle with wholeheartedly recommending this Product (aside from the plastic bottle) is that I think my view is a victim of circumstance. If my Skin was happy and healthy at the time I brought this into my Routine I could totally see myself as calling it boring, basic, or not doing that much. And again, those Essential Oils would keep from saying its the new go-to for Sensitive Skin peeps.\n\nPersonally, I plan to keep the rest of this bottle as my âIn Case Of Emergencyâ¦Use Thisâ Cleanser. For those that arenât particularly triggered by Essential Oils (LOL)â¦this is an excellent go to for days when your Skin is feeling overworked or (in my case) you made a bad call with another Product. I feel like I would even put this one above my other favorites from Peach & Lily and Youth To The People (for the purpose of bringing Skin back to a happy state) as its creamy consistency adds a bit of comfort/luxury that Gel Style Cleansers have a hard time matching.\n\nFull Ingredients List: \n\nWater, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Coco-Betaine, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Potassium Benzoate, Sodium Chloride, Polyquaternium-67, Potassium Cocoate, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Oil, Sodium Acetate, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4bm67gdhtjo41.jpg?width=1240&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=451d64d229f10607a1c6d82b5ef104d11f6adfdb",

The simplest way to explain it is that the b3 works like doubled sided tape inside each hair strand and helps the strands reform as one strand. This treatment is only designed to last 6ish weeks, and is not a permanent long term fix.\nAlmost all products sold as a split end ârepairâ treatment will not actually repair the split ends. Theyâre most likely smoothing the hair shaft to give the appearance of less split ends, and it washes out when you wash your hair. The emollients concentration in these products is heavy, so they can be very challenging to people with oily hair, because you are essentially adding more oil to the hair.  These products will not help repair the split ends, they more likely mask the problem. \n\nThe only way to get rid of split ends once they are actually splitting is to get a haircut.",

    "body": "Alright, this was both a very easy and very hard review to put together as my views on this Water Based Cleanser are probably a little biased LOL! You seeâ¦this Cleanser saved my lifeâ¦\n\nLOL, not that dramatic but pretty close. If you remember (or donât) I decided about a month ago that it would be an excellent idea to use an âall-naturalâ Bar Soap that had been listed as okay for use on the face. WRONG LOLâ¦over the two plus weeks I used it I ended up stripping my Skin, clogging my pores, inviting breakouts, and generally messing everything up.\n\nWell, after that experience I really needed to switch to something that was going to reverse what I had done to myself. This Make P:rem Cleansing Foam jumped out since it has been recommended by a few bloggers as being great for Sensitive Skin. \n\nThe first thing that I surprised me about this Product was just how creamy/foamy it truly is. Most pH Balanced Cleansers do a decent job (at best) of foaming upâ¦but this one feels really thick and luxurious. Especially after mixing it in my Nooni Whip Makerâ¦WOW! The closest pH Balanced Cleanser I can compare it to is the Sulwhasoo EX Brightening Cleansing Foam. \n\nAs for the Formulaâ¦there are a couple of Ingredients that do raise some concern. The Coconut Based Surfactants (not an issue) followed by a few Essential Oils (can be an issue). I didnât have a problem with them but I would hesitate from recommending this as the ultimate gentle Cleanser as Essential Oils pose a problem for some. Bergamot Oil and Sage Oil are both here. In addition to the Oils we also have Raspberry Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, and Citric Acid (which I assume is there to help lower the pH). \n\nEssential Oils asideâ¦this Cleanser brought my Skin back from the brink so fast I was truly shocked. The foam feels so comfortable and luxuriousâ¦and the mild herbal scent was relaxing. Just after a few uses my Skin seemed to be less red and the few angry red bumps I had developed were much more calm.\n\nOver the past few weeks I have fallen in love with this Product LOL! Usually I am not a fan of such a âbasicâ Cleanser. Give me some antioxidants, give me some brighteningâ¦something! But, this Make P:rem Safe Me Cleanser was exactly what I needed in the moment. I came in and quietly said âIâm just gonna pop in here and fix this.â and went on its way.\n\nMy struggle with wholeheartedly recommending this Product (aside from the plastic bottle) is that I think my view is a victim of circumstance. If my Skin was happy and healthy at the time I brought this into my Routine I could totally see myself as calling it boring, basic, or not doing that much. And again, those Essential Oils would keep from saying its the new go-to for Sensitive Skin peeps.\n\nPersonally, I plan to keep the rest of this bottle as my âIn Case Of Emergencyâ¦Use Thisâ Cleanser. For those that arenât particularly triggered by Essential Oils (LOL)â¦this is an excellent go to for days when your Skin is feeling overworked or (in my case) you made a bad call with another Product. I feel like I would even put this one above my other favorites from Peach & Lily and Youth To The People (for the purpose of bringing Skin back to a happy state) as its creamy consistency adds a bit of comfort/luxury that Gel Style Cleansers have a hard time matching.\n\nFull Ingredients List: \n\nWater, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Coco-Betaine, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Potassium Benzoate, Sodium Chloride, Polyquaternium-67, Potassium Cocoate, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Oil, Sodium Acetate, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eqlgae0atjo41.jpg?width=1240&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea705dc9de5e8a1293e4b9371c2ced4d8c677813",

Others say these products are nothing more than snake oil.\n\nIf you're just looking to be kind to your scalp, this makes life super difficult. With so much hype here and on the interwebs, how the hell do you tell which shampoos are legit (if any)?\n\nThat's why I, your balding best friend, decided to be a guinea pig for your benefit by digging through the latest lists and testing a few of these shampoos myself.\n\nHere's the real talk on which DHT-blocking shampoos are worth your time and money, as well as who they work best for.\n\nJust in case you're wondering, DHT (dihydrotestosterone) is the hormone that's most responsible for male pattern hair loss, though it can also sometimes cause hair loss in women.\n\nWhile oral and topical meds like finasteride and minoxidil are probably the best way to block DHT and regrow hair, certain shampoos can help. They can reduce DHT on your scalp, and generally improve the health of your hair. \n\nThis said, you should always consider DHT-blocking shampoos as an extra layer to your hair loss treatment. They can't replace medication altogether. \n\n**Here are a few that have been shown to work:**\n\n1. Happy Head Hair Thickening Shampoo\n\nThis shampoo is infused with a veritable cocktail of healthy and DHT-blocking ingredients, including Argan Oil, Biotin, Collagen, Keratin, and Saw Palmetto.\n\nThe latter ingredient (Saw palmetto) is particularly good for reducing DHT levels on the scalp.\n\nWhat I really liked about this one is that it has a very fresh scent, it reminded me of being outside during the sunrise in Alaska! It's also not too overpowering, which I prefer in a shampoo. I'd say it's suitable for both men and women who are looking to tackle early-stage hair thinning, so long as it's coupled with other treatments.\n\nHappy Head recommends pairing this shampoo with its hair-thickening conditioner to stabilize hair loss completely. \n\nThe Hair Thickening shampoo bottles are 8 fl oz / 240 ml. You can buy them for $36 as a one-off purchase or $30 per month as part of a subscription. There's an introductory offer to get it for $21 for the first month, which I used to test this out.\n\n2. Hims Thick Fix Thickening Shampoo\n\nI was cautious about trying this out after reading multiple comments like this:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/comments/s9ojkd/comment/htqm056/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/comments/s9ojkd/comment/htqm056/)\n\nLong story short, redditors were saying they'd had pretty lukewarm results with this shampoo. Still, its key ingredient is saw palmetto which we already know is good for reducing DHT on your scalp. There are also some thickening agents like natural guar gum and Polyquaternium-67 (a synthetic polymer derived from cellulose that can smooth cuticles). \n\nLike Happy Head's offering, the shampoo has a fresh scent. It's actually quite minty. The website says it's eucalyptus. \n\nBottles are 6.4 fl oz / 190 ml. You can buy them for $19 each as a one-off purchase. Due to its relative affordability, I'd say this is a good choice for both guys and gals who need a simple, low-cost supplement for their hair care routine. Just bear in mind the lackluster Reddit reviews.\n\n3. MDhair Restore Shampoo\n\nWhile digging in to this particular product I came across Reddit threads like this [https://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/comments/12o9aej/anyones\\_thoughts\\_on\\_mdhair\\_products/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/comments/12o9aej/anyones_thoughts_on_mdhair_products/) that give mixed reports about this product.\n\nThe general trend seems to be it works well at first, then slopes off. I only used it for a couple of weeks, so have no complaints but you'll probably need to do your own research to check if this is the best long-term hair loss treatment.\n\nActive ingredients include our old friend saw palmetto extract, as well pumpkin seed oil which also has DHT-blocking properties. It also includes other components for maximizing hair volume like keratin, argan oil, and even tea tree oil. They all seem to be plant-based, making this a good option for vegans.\n\nOf all the shampoos I've tried, this probably has the longest list of ingredients, so I encourage you to read the bottle carefully before trying it out. Speaking of the bottle, when I opened it there wasn't much of a scent. \n\nThe product comes in quantities of 3.7 fl oz (110 ml) and costs $22 per unit. This makes it one of the more expensive DHT-blocking shampoos out there, but discounts are available if you buy in three or six units in one go.\n\nA word of warning: Remember, certain people (myself included!) are sensitive to ingredients commonly used in the above products, particularly saw palmetto and ketoconazole. If your scalp is itchy or red, stop using the shampoo immediately and contact your provider for a gentler formula.\n\nI'd love to hear from anyone who's tried these (or other) DHT-blocking shampoos for any length of time. Which one's worked (or didn't work) for you? Let me know!  ",

I have a darker Brown hair colour and about 1/2 inch of roots to colour. I have some Wella colour charm powder lightener and Wella cream developer volume 20. I plan to tone after but I'm wondering if I should be concerned, since I've been reading some articles about metallic salts in box dyes. I know metal salt dyes can't be combined with bleach (burning etc) but I'm not sure if Olia hair dye has these salts and I was wondering if one of you wonderful people with more knowledge then me could let me know. \n\nHere's the ingredient list: \n\nColorant:Â Paraffinum Liquidum/Mineral Oil/Huile Minerale, Aqua/Water/Eau, Ethanolamine, Steareth-20, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Polysorbate 21, Toluene-2,5-Diamine, Steareth-2, Resorcinol, Parfum/Fragrance, M-Aminophenol, 2,4-Diaminophenoxyethanol Hcl, Sodium Metabisulfite, N,N-Bis(2-Hydroxyethyl)-P-Phenylenediamine Sulfate, Ascorbic Acid, Edta, Polyquaternium-67, Hydroxybenzomorpholine, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil/Sunflower Seed Oil, Limnanthes Alba Seed Oil/Meadowfoam Seed Oil, Passiflora Incarnata/Passiflora Incarnata Seed Oil, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Thioglycerin\n\nTLDR: is there metallic salts in Olia hair colour and should I be concerned bleaching my hair at home after using Olia for a few yrs",

        "body": "Metallic salts react badly with most professional colors and bleaches. Metallic salts are typically the culprit when you hear about someone getting a \"chemical haircut\" i.e. their hair breaks off. It can also cause your hair to smoke and melt. I would recommend performing a test strand before each new color. Take a small section of hair from the lower back of your head and apply the color/bleach and let it develop to see how the hair reacts. Does it smoke, get hot, not color well, break, or cause your hair to feel like wet noodles? If the answer to any of those is yes, obviously don't go through with doing your whole head. If the test strand goes well, you're good to go!",

If you have skincare with it and donât have that issue, I would rule this out as a culprit. Itâs very common and wouldnât be in a very high concentration based on the ingredient list.
