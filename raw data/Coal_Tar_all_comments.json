    "body": "So, foolishly moved to a red state and bought a place in an HOA FULL of 70+ Boom-Booms, sight unseen in 22. INSTANTLY regretted it, as these boomers have absolutely no lives and are quite batshit in person, absolutely unhinged online. I‚Äôm the youngest person in my neighborhood by 30 years, minimum.\n\nSo, these boom-booms, not knowing a damn thing about Internet security, post with their real names and photos, and learned WAY more about these neighbors in 2ish years, from batshit political/religious views, their open racism to the bastard neighbor Jim from 2 doors down, posting photos of his engorged external hemorrhoids looking for ‚Äúhome remedies‚Äù when they needed a doctor years ago to fix what looked like the results of shoving a stick of dynamite up an ass and letting it explode, grey hair ringed poopy/bloody and gaping asshole with cherry red, wet, ‚Äúroid meat‚Äù protruding from that sad, worn out asshole with testicles that were hanging down to their knees from the bent over, asshoke selfies Jim lovely provided. Things anyone that has half a brain wouldn‚Äôt post to a neighborhood forum. Insane thing, the boomers posting  ‚Äúremedies‚Äù, like turpentine and onion dressing to slathering the whole hole in coal tar‚Ä¶..without so much as ‚ÄúWTF, Jim, you‚Äôre asshole looks like it was microwaved too long to where it looks like a hotdog that exploded in the microwave!!!!‚Äùbut I digress, I guess I don‚Äôt have the boomer mindset that accepts images of 80yo asses only a doctor needs see, but this helps to build this story of exactly the man and people involved in this tale that I‚Äôm dealing with. Trust me, we‚Äôll get there eventually! \n\nAnyhowwwwwwwe, there was a storm front that rolled in, Thursday evening, taking out power for the majority of my county. There were microburst winds of 70-80mph that damaged trees in a surrounding area taking out our electric 20 miles away, we got mild gusts and rain, no microburst damage, no destroyed trees, no hail. Gusts of 15-20 max I saw later online, along with the weather maps for the time period. Rained less than 20 minutes total. I was home, annoyed the power went out only as my generator kicked on, my power never faltered, not knowing the next town over got curbstompped, but none of my neighbors have one, so plan was to load up my fake profile to observe/troll the ones like Jim as they posted in powerless homes on NextDoor. ANY car backfiring is a slew of ‚ÄúI HEARD GUNSHOTS!‚Äù, so a power outage was gonna be good, free entertainment from the postings on that app! \n\nI was enjoying the posts the worst the ‚Äúme generation‚Äù neighbors had to offer, as they devised and implemented a scheme to ‚Äúget what they are owed‚Äù from their darkened, powerless homes over the weekend. Posts were selfish, and hit my dopamine receptors with each posting couldn‚Äôt take it anymore, it was delightful! Any slight, any act of god that mildly inconveniences them, and they are the biggest victims, not those a town over dealing with tons of legit property damages, nope‚Ä¶ they were mildly inconvenienced and it‚Äôs the end of their world and they are a gonna scream online to make it known!!!!!! \n\nAnyhow, this scheme they came up with, why the scheme is to collectively through 2 days of NextDoor postings to get all the worst boomers in my HOA to file claims for roofs/siding.  Posts over the weekend of my neighbors, on camera and video posts, IN FULL FRAME, pulling off shingles, siding and ‚ÄúHemorrhoid Jim and the boom-boom gang‚Äù on the block leading the charge, posting as if it wasn‚Äôt on a fully open forum that is able to be seen if you simply searched our neighborhood name.  \n\nOh, Jim filed a claim Friday, immediately after a detailed post of what to damage on the roof to get a whole new one, photos and videos posted by Jim showing him ripping off shingles from his garage roof apex, smugly in one of his last videos to mimic wind damage/ensure a whole new roof. When he stated the adjuster will be out, first thing Monday, with others in the ‚Äúboom-boom gang‚Äù making similar posts‚Ä¶. All having agents rolling in throughout the week to file claims for roofs or sidings, dumb dumbs posting who their providers were, older posts pulled up, others posting various levels of damage to which Jim would critique of other videos posted giving his ‚Äúlack of preparation H, bloody baboon ass‚Äù seal of approval!‚Äù Or suggestions by Jim of what more would be needed, and other smaller players took joy in the plan 12 moronic boomers devised and implemented, all on a public forum! \n\nLo and behold, I‚Äôm about to head to the airport to fly out for work and 2 doors down, a State Farm truck with adjusters and a guys on the roof, ‚ÄúHemorrhoid Jim‚Äù, beaming ear to ear.  Walked over and chatted with Jim and one of the adjustor, Jim look went from beaming to bitch faced, as the last time we spoke in person, I was elected to the HOA board seat he had just lost, with me demanding to know why there were multiple insurance claims made on HOA property in the years he was on the board only, which increased the dues from $265 to $395 a month in less than 2 years‚Ä¶.. to cover increased costs and his stepson being the one that made repairs vs doing as the bylaws stated and accepting offers. Had an audit by an independent accounting agency to the tune of $8k of HOA funds that those of us playing fair wanted, none of the boom-boom gang dud, with those in the board attempting to prevent me from doing as the bylaws had written to perform for events involving money. Unfortunately, nothing outright pointed to fraud, as things were replaced, though as shittily and cheaply looking as could be for the maximum payout.  Worst that happened was getting a few sane people on the board to stop the boom boom gang from causing more issues as I‚Äôm not getting $400 a month of service for my monthly fees, a big chunk is simply paying a share of higher insurance due to claims paid.\n\nAnyhow, played the party of the nosey neighbor, asked Jim what he was doing, he claimed the storm damaged the roof, said it must have been ‚Äúall the crazy hail!‚Äù! I was like, ‚Äúhail, when?‚Äù  When he was like, ‚Äúwhat do you mean when, Thursday, when the storms hit when you were outa town!‚Äù Typically work into Friday, but not last week, was home and yeah, no hail‚Ä¶. Not a bit, repeated ‚ÄúThursday you say, well then, it MUST have been real awful, I should check my roof‚Äù. Jim was like, ‚Äúoh, saw my shingles on the ground and thought it best to inspect‚Äù‚Ä¶.pointing to 3 in his yard, but let him continue as I was indeed home Thursday and guess he didn‚Äôt hear the only home generator in the neighborhood in my yard, nor did he pay attention to the cameras I have all over the property that were not impacted by any power outage. Guess having self centered neighbors that have no clue how modern tech works really helps in my situation.\n\nSo, I see that baboon ass Jim is paying close attention to me, watching me like a hawk, the ONLY reason I walked in his yard, on the public sidewalk,  was to see if there were markings on the vehicle to see what State Farm agent office it could be, or a name on the adjusters uniform.  Spotted both, plus phone number I memorized real quick, so bolted as quick as I arrived, ensuring to tell Jim bye and wish him well, as any friendly and concerned neighbor would.\n\nMy happy ass IMMEDIATELY CALLED the number on the car the second he rolled off minutes later, the inspector answered, explained the situation to which I‚Äôm sure he thought was insane, then texted him the link to our community where good old Jim was hamming it up in his roof, destroying it and staging the shingles he made damn sure to point out in the yard to me and this inspector.\n\nThe inspector calls me up about a half hour later, with a 3rd person on their fraud team, as I‚Äôm rolling towards the airport, thanking me for this info asking how exactly I obtained it. Explained it was simply in the neighborhood fourn and that my interest was piqued as I was home, not out like Jim claimed Thursday and 1000% know for a fact there was no hail, as I have video. When asked if the video shows into Jim‚Äôs yard, it did, but barely, but you could see him taking his pry bar and hammer up the ladder to the roof, shingles dropping, and then his placement of the shingles he pointed out into the yard he also videoed himself to 100% prove times in the event he attests to claim otherwise.\n\nImmediately after getting to the airport pulled video feeds from all day Thursday through yesterday and submitted them, I‚Äôm not going to face higher home rates on top of my already higher HOA fees because of Jim and 11 other assholes wanting new roofs, in a community that‚Äôs less than 6 years old! nope nope!  State Farm is also the insurer of the HOA property, so explained that situation where we hired a company to perform a financial audit, but couldn‚Äôt conclude definitively that there was fraud by Jim and likely the whole board, but explained that‚Äôs records he should easily be able to look at internally on the claims side. I thought this auditor and fraud associate  were going to stright up cum their pants when I provided the  name of the company that provided the independent audit.\n\nFew hours ago, get a call from the fraud associate informing me to not repost any of the videos or images, not to engage with Jim or anyone that posted to the forum and that they have already reached out the local PD and I may be called to answer questions asked by them. Fraud agent stright said that what he has seen is the absolute dumbest way ever to defraud insurance he‚Äôs ever seen. Said my name is not going to be mentioned and he‚Äôs obviously not going to explain the situation to him as he‚Äôs actively committing a crime and dropped that the agent had his doubts about the damage anyhow, the NextDoor postings sealed the deal. Said that outside of the police they doubted they would have further communications, but if so it would possibly be via the police.\n\nI‚Äôll post updates if I get them, but looking like old Hemorrhoid Jim and the boom-boom game is about to learn a life lesson that by posting detailed info on how to commit a crime on the open internet isn‚Äôt going to pay off with shiny new roofs. Now, I‚Äôm sure the company and possibly a cop or two are going to search post histories, hope they enjoy gazing at Jim‚Äôs raging hemorrhoid like a piece of fine art when they spot that post, if it‚Äôs not been removed‚Ä¶.. if it‚Äôs up, I do hope they post some of me-ma‚Äôs old country asshole soothing remedies. As if Jim did enough fraud that mournful ass will likely be used by all the boys in the general population for upto 15 years‚Ä¶.. \n\nThe biggest treat, Jim likes to think he‚Äôs ‚ÄúTrunp-esque‚Äù that rules and laws are for others, not him, unless he stands to benefit. That hubris is his potential downfall and couldn‚Äôt happen to a more deserving individual! ",

    "body": "20 years ago, in the last few months of his life, my grandpa became consumed with this idea of a plasma-heated coke oven. He was a coke oven engineer for decades and had several patents. \n\nBut as a non-engineer, I'm curious what /r/engineering has to say about this. Is it interesting and coherent? Have these ideas been adopted? Are they no longer relevant? Would it do the world good? \n\nRegardless, I'm sure he would want to see it shared! Here's a carefully made transcript from about 30 minutes of recording.\n\n\"Well, anyhow, the thing about how you're gonna to zap this: if we use the Westinghouse units, which are small, I figured that each unit would do about 4 cubic feet of coal. I think when you zap it, they have some kind of a bayonet or something goes down with this gas. And I figure you'd have one of those for each cubic foot. Now I'm guessing at that, but I think that's within the reasonable range of what you could do.\n\nSo if you have 24 feet of coal slug moving down this system, and you move it two-foot-a-clip‚Äîevery time you move it you move it two feet, you're actually moving 48 cubic feet, down this slot oven. \n\nYou have to get into the construction, a little bit, of this thing, because to build a refractory slot vertically, to put a lid on it is not much of a problem. You put a little arch over, you got 18 inches to span. Now you lay it down, you've got 24 feet to span, this way. And depending on how far you go, hundreds of feet that way to span. So you have to use a construction called a flat arch. The flat arch is a refractory arch that is supported on the exterior with metal. There's two designs that I'm familiar with: one's the American Arch, that uses round pipe as a supporting structure, and the other one is the Dietrich Arch, which uses cast iron casting support. Either one of them would work; the American would probably be easier to design.\n\nIn order to support that, the top of this oven would to have a support system, so that the first four feet or so is up where you're doin' the charging and have the pistons and all. Of course, that would all be structural steel, and you wouldn't have to support anything.\n\nAnd then when it gets to about six feet, then the refractory would start. When the refractory starts, then you have to support it.\n\nSo, I figured the way this would be designed is, going down you'd have six feet of the initial structure, then you could have two feet of trusswork strength that went across‚Äîwould be two foot wide and 24 feet or more that way, and it would completely span the unit. Then you'd have a space of six feet, you'd have another structure like that, two foot wide, and so forth. All the way down the line, every six feet you'd have this structure. To visualize it, it'd be like a little bridge across it, except it would be designed in such a way that could hold it.\n\nAnd then the whole area in the middle would have structural beams, or so forth, running from that two foot wide girder type unit over to the next one. And they would be just a few inches above the top of the refractory roof, so that the brick layer, when you put that refractory in, would hang it up and then you would be right there standing on it. And then you have removable grill work on the walkway.\n\nNow the first area you had of that, the first six foot wide area, you'd take the first two foot in the corner, and you'd equip that with a refractory sliding block that slid across the top, and have it powered with air cylinders so that it could be automatically backed off. And that would expose the coal cake, two foot of it‚Äî12 inches this way, 24 inches that way‚Äîright at that point. Then over on the other side of the six foot draw, it would go up a foot. So, in the first section you'd have two holes, two foot by one foot in the top of the refractory, which you could live with. And they would have removable doors and you would mount these bayonets or whatever they call them, the plasma units, right above them. And the unit for the plasma thing would be just up the, that same six foot area, a short distance, and could be hung on the structural steel, or however you wanted to support it.\n\nIt wouldn't take much room; it looked like the size of a refrigerator.\n\nNow you do that at one end of the 24 inch thing, and over at the other end you do the same thing. Now,  that meant in the first six feet you would have eight square feet exposed.\n\nSo, now you'd have the next two up the line, and the next two up this line. So that in a matter of about six of these units, you would eventually get where you had the whole business covered. So as this coal would be bein' pushed down, this part here would up the temperature, and, of course, as it moved, the next zap would hit the piece behind it. So there would be a piece there, and then a piece up here would be goin'.\n\nAnd on this end of the 24 feet, you would have what they call a 'collecting main,' which is common practice in the slot-baked ovens now. At the end, they have a main that goes along, and they have what they call goose neck connections. They come up out of the refractory‚Äîthey're lined with masonry‚Äîand they go into this collector main. And the collector main is under suction, and it's full of water‚Äîsprays, or liquor sprays as they turn out to be. And that's what cools the gases as they're generated. And it's drawing the gas out of this unit.\n\nAnd, of course, these first two at this end, when you're doin it, there's nothing hot coming over the top of it‚Äîthat's nothing but raw coal above them. And over here the same way. And that's true right up to the middle one. Now, you have a collecting main on both ends, so you're pulling, really, suction on 12 feet of em. 'Cause you have it not really blocked in the middle, but you have it so there's not much clearance.\n\nAnd, so anyhow,  when you finally get down here about 40 feet, you've got it all red hot, and it's gone. And then, every so often from then on, you have resistant bars‚Äîlike they have in a toaster‚Äîthat would be fed with electricity. It would be red hot. It would be in the base of the slot. So that any temperature that was lost through the evolution of gas, or radiation, or conduction, or for whatever reason, would be regenerated by these... I don't know what you would call them... resisting units, that would be tied into  your high voltage units over here. And they'd also act as dampeners, because when you kept switching these things off over here, you don't want to slam a million volts and stop it right now; you would instead use a dump switch where it wouldn't be stopped, it would just be diverted into these dampening things. And then through it was used next to heat the coal.\n\nNow, we've got that all, and I, we figure that that would be countin' the first six feet and the rest of you would have 36... you'd have somethin' like 42 feet, maybe. Tthat area would be what we'd call a Preheating Area. All you were doing was heating the coal charge to get it up to around 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, that's all we need‚Äîmaybe a little bit more, a little bit less. We don't have to fuse it when you get it up there. So the whole unit wouldn't have to be as strong as most units of this type would be.\n\nSo, now that only takes 42 feet. But we still have all this structure goin' down here‚Äîwe have 120 more feet. And the reason we have that is, we found from carbonizin' the coal it takes usually in a typical slot-type oven, they call it 'an inch an hour'‚Äîso, if you have an oven 18 inches wide, it takes 18 hours to cook it. But, of course, that's based on the fact of startin' from ambient temperature and heating it up‚Äîwhen you dump the coal in, you dump it in by the ambient temperature.\n\nWell, with this setup, you zap it and you're at a workin' temperature of 2000¬∞ right away. So I don't think you'll need an inch an hour‚Äîin fact, I know from experience you'd probably get by with half that much. So we have only a a 12 inch thick slab and if we decide we could heat it in six hours, then since we're movin' this unit down two foot every six minutes, in an hour we move at 20 feet. And so to get a dwell time of six hours, you need 120 ft.\n\nSo, after this charging area, 42 feet, you'd have 120 more feet of this flat arch business, some strip heaters buried in the floor... and by the time it got through there it, should be completely devolatilized and completely carbonized.\n\nBut now, it's a red hot mass‚Äîthe same as it would be in a slot-type oven. On a slot-type oven, they open the door and take this pushing machine and push out all this flaming red hot coal‚Äîcoke‚Äîinto a car that catches it, a railroad car. And then, after they catch it‚Äîwe're talkin' on a typical oven about 50 feet of that and 20 some feet high, 18 inches wide‚Äîthen they run that up under a Quenching Tower, and then they dump tons of water on it. And that's what you see in these Coke Plants, where you see these tremendous clouds. And if you you're down in Indianapolis some days, you look to the southeast and every so often you see this tremendous cloud go up, that's a Quench Cloud. All that heat is wasted. So with this system, you're in a position to much easier recover the heat and cool it down scientifically without quenching it.\n\nSo, you would turn that over to a boiler company and they would have the next 40 feet where this stuff would be going through there at 20 foot an hour. And they would extract the heat from it and make steam. Then when it come out of the end of that, it would be hot, but you would be able to handle it on rubber conveyor belts and whatnot. It would come out, get on conveyor belts and go to storage, and be screened and sorted later.\n\nAnd it would be built sort of like a boiler, and this red hot coke would be running over these tubes that would be full of‚Äîyou wouldn't use water in them, you'd use Dowtherm, which is a salt solution that can get awfully hot without vaporizing.\n\nAnd so the first two cooling areas that this coke would get in would have tubes of Dowtherm‚Äîor similar, there's other chemical‚Äîand then they would cool it down. And then the next area would have tubes with water in 'em. Now, then they'd have a Dowtherm boiler, and the Dowtherm converts water to steam. And this whole unit end result would be would makin' steam that would go someplace and make electricity, hopefully. And then your coke would be cool enough to handle, which is all you were after. \n\nNow, the other big source of energy that you're getting is all this gas! That would be handled just as it is now in the modern byproduct gas plant off of coke ovens. So they strip all the goodies out of the gas and then instead of burning it in the unit, they would burn it to make electricity. Because you used electricity up in the initial step and now you're getting sources of electricity. It would power itself.\n\n And the byproducts would be the same as they are in a modern coke oven‚Äîyou still make all the tar and chemicals and things that they do now! That's where the tar for your roof comes, most of it's coal tar. And your highways: what isn't asphalt is coal tar! And they use the coal tar to mix with the asphalt. Makes the asphalt easier to handle, I guess. And that's a problem today, because these companies don't have a source for their tar! They have to go to China or something, because the coke industry has dropped considerably from when it was at its height right after the World War, after I come back from the Army. But then it started goin' downhill. It's still a big industry in this country, despite all the beating it's taken. But everybody else are in the business now‚Äîtheir governments are more friendly about pollution than our government is.\n\nI didn't mention the plasma stream is a gas stream, and in order to make it, the easiest way, you use natural gas‚Äîwhich has been used before for the plasma ionized stream, is what they call it. And they use the natural gas. Now in this case, the beauty of it is that, since the ionized beam hits the coal within the chamber, within the oven itself, the gas that comes in with the plasma ray goes into the effluent product of the coal and ends up in the byproduct plant. And it's cleaned up and then it's part of the coke oven gas! So it's all recovered. Where in most cases, like where they use this plasma heating for heating steel and stuff, that's all wasted‚Äîit goes into the air. But in this case, it's recovered.\n\nAnd now, that just one of these units. And say, well, and of course we got no labor involved! All we have is couple fellas sitting up with a pulpit running and looking at a bunch of instruments and timers and things like that are taking care of‚Äîthe automation as this thing goes through. Because once it's set it, nobody has to do anything, it just goes.\n\nAnd but now that would, you got 24, say, roughly for figuring sake. You had 24 cubic feet of coal and you move two feet of it every six minutes: in an hour, you'd move 480 cubic feet out of this one oven. And at a conservative rate, the coke would weigh 30lbs.\n\nThe other thing that's very important about this is the materials of construction! The refractory has to be fused silica, which is an expensive refractory, but it has some properties that are essential‚Äîfor one thing, it is a insulating refractory rather than a conducting refractory and where in a standard coke oven you want to conduct the heat from the gas to the coal, in this process you want to retain the heat in the oven and not lose it through the wall. And fused silica is a very good insulator. It also is very hard and would be resistant to the mechanical abrasion that would come with this type of a utilization. It would also have good structural strength. They also make it in castable, so that the ceiling or flat arch type construction in the oven could be castable fused silica.\n\nRegular silica refractory, like we'd use in a modern coke oven, has very high expansion coefficient. So it expands very high durin' heat and if you cool it down, it cools down in such a way that it's almost impossible to heat it up and cool it down without fracturing the refractory. So in the case of fused silica, the coefficient of expansion is practically nil. So you don't have the problems of expanding refractories, and you can cool the unit down or heat it up! And one of the things I hadn't mentioned when I showed the dual feeding system, you could either feed coke in, and if you set the levers right, you could feed 100% coke, or you could feed it in fractions depending on where you put the slide gates.\n\nAnd if you have a shutdown for whatever reason‚Äîif a major strike or major catastrophe or a major loss of base product or something, that you had to shut the unit down and in a hurry you might have to shut it down, without sufficient help and so forth... you could, once you set the gates and so forth, you could start filling the unit with coke and then at the end of a day's time you would have the complete unit shut down, full of coke! And it would be safe that way, because of the fact that the fused silica did not crack up on ya'. Well, you could never do that with a modern slot-type coke oven. Once you start those, you have to continue running them.\n\nThis, I think, would be a good feature for modern industry, to have a unit that could be started up and shut down with such ease. And it would not take a big crew to do it‚Äîit just could take the normal operating crew, and they could shut it down without getting their hands dirty, except for movin' a few slide valves that might not have been automated.\"\n\nIf you've made it this far, thanks for reading!",

But admittedly having a difficult time visualizing his idea. \n\nOur by-product coke ovens were built in the 40‚Äôs but worked just fine and were super reliable. They were fired by coke oven gas produced as a byproduct of the process. So the fuel was basically free. We also used the coke gas to fuel just about everything at the entire plant. We also burned coal tar mostly to make the flames more radiant. An example was burning tar, but atomizing it with coke gas. \n\nAll of our process heat was tri-fueled depending on what was cheapest that day. In increasing cost order - coke gas (unless we ran out), natural gas, or propane.\n\nSo I guess a continuous process could be interesting but not sure why the traditional batch process is a problem. Maybe higher capital cost. But it‚Äôs not like you are avoiding a reheating process for something like a continuous (slab) casting process from a basic oxygen furnace (BOF), where you avoid soaking pits and rolling ingots into slabs.\n\nPlasma heating would also use a lot of electric power. And not sure how well coke gas would work as the process gas in a plasma (versus natural gas)\n\nAlso coke gas is less carbon producing than natural gas because it is about 50% hydrogen.

The old guide has been archived [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12nvg2scUcaZdH-wNFhUtQwhPM3cWU6PCiQQNOQp9C6I/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nPlease don't comment or message me to add A, B, or C treatment - the writer only included those that he has worked with and saw results.\n\n^(Disclaimer: Although written by a board-certified dermatologist, this is not a substitute for any medical advice. Please visit your healthcare specialist.)\n\nHair loss is a common issue affecting millions of people worldwide. Understanding its causes, treatments, and prevention methods can help you take control of your hair health. In this comprehensive guide, we will discuss various factors contributing to hair loss, different hair loss conditions, their effective treatments, and other steps you can take to maintain healthy hair.\n\n# What factors can cause hair loss?\n\n1. **Genetic Factors:** Hereditary hair loss, also known as androgenetic alopecia, is the most common cause of hair loss. It affects both men and women and is characterized by a receding hairline and thinning hair.\n2. **Hormonal Imbalances:** Hormonal fluctuations due to pregnancy, menopause, or conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can lead to hair loss.\n3. **Nutritional Factors:** A balanced diet is crucial for hair health. Deficiencies in nutrients such as iron, zinc, vitamin D, and B vitamins can contribute to hair loss.\n4. **Medical Conditions:** Thyroid disorders, autoimmune diseases like alopecia areata, and scalp infections can cause hair loss.\n5. **Medications and Treatments:** Certain medications and treatments, including chemotherapy, can lead to temporary or permanent hair loss.\n6. **Stress:** Both physical and emotional stress can cause hair loss by triggering telogen effluvium, a temporary hair-shedding condition.\n\n# Identifying your type of hair loss\n\nThere are many hair loss types, and knowing which one you have can be very beneficial when treating it.\n\nFirst, it's essential to understand the difference between androgenetic alopecia (male or female pattern baldness) and non-androgenetic alopecia (non-pattern hair loss).\n\nThe former affects men and women differently - men generally have a receding hairline at their temples, while women tend to experience general thinning throughout the scalp.\n\nThe latter includes rarer forms, such as alopecia totalis (total scalp baldness), alopecia universalis (total body baldness), and telogen effluvium (i.e. brief shedding after childbirth or major surgery).\n\n# How to treat your hair condition?\n\nThis is designed so you know the most effective treatments for each condition. This is by no means an exhaustive list, it's just a list of the most popular ones.\n\n# Receding hairline\n\nA receding hairline is a common condition that affects millions of men worldwide, typically caused by heredity, hormones, aging, and other factors. The condition usually appears in males between 30 and 40 years old.\n\n# Symptoms of a receding hairline include:\n\n* Thinning or balding on the top of the head\n* Widening part line and sparse hair on the temples\n* Itchy, flaky scalp\n* Patches of thicker, darker hair or bald spots near the back of the scalp where new hairs do not grow\n* Increased shedding from other parts of the body, such as eyebrows and eyelashes\n* Weaker or finer hair on the scalp leading to breakage\n\n# Recommended treatments for a receding hairline:\n\n1. Essential oils: Natural treatment options like peppermint oil, rosemary oil, and lavender oil can help stimulate blood circulation, reduce inflammation, and promote healthy scalp conditions. Massage these oils into the scalp twice daily for the best results.\n2. Minoxidil: This over-the-counter medication can be applied directly to the scalp to promote the growth of new hairs in areas affected by receding hairlines. Use minoxidil as directed for optimal results.\n3. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) treatment: PRP therapy involves drawing a patient's blood, processing it to concentrate the platelets, and then injecting the platelets into the scalp. This treatment can promote hair growth but may be expensive and suitable only for some individuals.\n\n# Male Pattern Baldness (MPB):\n\nMale pattern baldness is a common form of hair loss among men caused by genetic and hormonal factors. It usually begins with the thinning of hair on the temples and crown of the head, resulting in a receding hairline or bald spots. In some cases, it can even lead to complete baldness.\n\n# Symptoms of male pattern baldness:\n\n* Gradual thinning of hair at the crown or top of the head\n* Receding hairline around the temples and a generally sparse appearance\n* Increased shedding\n* Excessive oiliness or dryness of the scalp\n* Irritation or inflammation\n* In advanced cases, bald spots may form on the scalp or forehead\n\n# Recommended treatments for male pattern baldness:\n\n1. Medications: Topical minoxidil and oral finasteride are both available to treat male pattern baldness. Minoxidil can be applied directly to the scalp twice a day to promote hair growth, while finasteride is a pill that reduces the production of DHT, the hormone linked to male pattern baldness.\n2. Hair Transplants: Hair transplants involve removing healthy hair follicles from the back or sides of the head and implanting them into areas where hair has been lost. This surgical solution can be successful but costly and may not be suitable for everyone.\n3. Scandinavian Biolabs Hair Growth Routine: Designed to address early-stage non-scarring hair loss, including androgenetic alopecia, this natural hair growth solution harnesses the power of bioactive ingredients to help strengthen hair, reduce hair loss, and stimulate new growth.\n\n# Alopecia Areata:\n\nAlopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder that causes patchy hair loss on the scalp, face, and other parts of the body. The immune system attacks hair follicles, leading to hair loss in small, round patches.\n\n# Symptoms of alopecia areata (continued):\n\n* Sudden onset of one or more round, smooth patches of hair loss on the scalp or other body parts\n* The skin in these areas is usually not inflamed or scaly\n* Scaling and inflammation on the scalp\n* Dandruff-like flaking\n* Hair loss on other areas of the body, such as the beard or eyebrows\n* Sometimes, the affected area may have a burning or itchy sensation\n\n# Recommended treatments for alopecia areata:\n\n1. Topical corticosteroids: These medications help reduce inflammation in the scalp and promote hair regrowth. Intralesional corticosteroids may also be used for this purpose.\n2. Medications like minoxidil and anthralin can help promote hair regrowth in some individuals.\n3. Scalp-cooling caps or cold caps can be used to reduce inflammation and improve the effectiveness of topical corticosteroids.\n4. Immunotherapy: This treatment stimulates an immune response to promote hair regrowth and may be beneficial for some people with alopecia areata.\n\n# Telogen Effluvium:\n\nTelogen effluvium is a temporary increase in hair shedding caused by various factors, such as stress, illness, surgery, or significant weight loss. Hair shedding typically occurs 2-3 months after the triggering event and can last for several months before resolving.\n\n# Symptoms of telogen effluvium:\n\n* Rapid, noticeable thinning or shedding of scalp hair\n* Excessive amounts of hair in the shower drain or on pillows after sleeping\n* Small \"peach fuzz\" hairs on the scalp\n* Visible scalp through thinning hair\n* Itching, burning, or redness of the scalp\n* Loss of eyebrows or eyelashes in some cases\n\n# Recommended treatments for telogen effluvium:\n\n1. Address the underlying cause: Treat hormonal imbalances or nutritional deficiencies that may be contributing to hair loss. This may involve taking medications or supplements to balance hormones and provide essential nutrients.\n2. Stress management: Practice relaxation techniques such as yoga and meditation to help reduce stress levels.\n3. Medications: Prescription medications like minoxidil (Rogaine) and finasteride (Propecia) can help reverse telogen effluvium by promoting hair growth.\n4. Hair transplant: In some cases, a hair transplant may be necessary to restore lost hair due to telogen effluvium. This involves removing healthy follicles from the back of the head and transplanting them to areas of thinning or baldness.\n5. Scandinavian Biolabs Hair Growth Routine: This natural hair growth solution is recommended for early-stage non-scarring hair loss, including telogen effluvium. The Hair Growth Routine's bioactive ingredients can help strengthen hair, reduce hair loss, and promote new growth.\n\n# Anagen Effluvium:\n\nAnagen effluvium is a type of hair loss caused by an interruption to the normal growth cycle of the hair follicle. This can occur when the cells producing new hairs are damaged or destroyed, leading to rapid hair shedding. Chemotherapy treatments, some medications, certain medical conditions, and nutritional deficiencies can trigger anagen effluvium.\n\n# Symptoms of anagen effluvium:\n\n* Rapid hair loss, usually within 2 to 4 weeks after the triggering event\n* Hair thinning, with a reduction in overall hair volume\n* Patches of baldness on the scalp or other areas of the body where hair is present\n* Brittle, easily broken hair\n* An itchy, scaly scalp or lesions on the scalp or other body areas with hair loss\n* Eyebrows and eyelashes may be affected in some cases\n\n# Recommended treatments for anagen effluvium:\n\n1. Minoxidil: This topical medication can be applied directly to the scalp to help stimulate hair growth and reduce hair loss.\n2. Steroid injections: Corticosteroid injections can help suppress scalp inflammation and promote hair regrowth.\n3. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy: This treatment involves taking a blood sample from the patient and injecting it into the scalp to stimulate hair growth.\n4. Hair transplantation: For severe cases of anagen effluvium, a hair transplant may be necessary to restore lost hair. The hair follicles are taken from another area of the scalp and implanted in the affected area.\n5. Hair Nutrient Tablets by Scandinavian Biolabs: These multivitamins are enriched with essential nutrients like zinc, riboflavin, and other vitamins that support healthy hair growth.\n\n# Traction Alopecia:\n\nTraction alopecia is hair loss caused by prolonged, constant tension on the scalp. It can occur from hairstyles that pull too tightly on the follicles, such as tight buns, braids, and ponytails. Traction alopecia is commonly seen in African Americans, but anyone can be affected by it.\n\n# Symptoms of traction alopecia:\n\n* Thinning hair and bald patches in areas repeatedly exposed to tight hairstyles\n* Tenderness or burning sensations on the scalp and itching\n* Inflammation or open sores (known as folliculitis) due to excessive tension placed on the hair follicles\n* Hair loss may spread beyond the initial area of damage, and other scalp issues, such as scarring or infections, may occur\n\n# Recommended treatments for traction alopecia:\n\n1. Removal of the cause: Avoid activities that cause excess tension on the scalp, such as tight hairstyles or clips. Wearing protective hairstyles, like loose braids or ponytails, can help prevent traction alopecia from reoccurring.\n2. Scandinavian Biolabs Hair Growth Routine: This natural hair growth solution is designed to address early-stage non-scarring hair loss, including traction alopecia. The Hair Growth Routine's bioactive ingredients can help strengthen hair, reduce hair loss, and promote new growth.\n3. Essential oil massage: Massaging the scalp with essential oils like lavender and rosemary can help stimulate hair growth. Alternatively, try a [hair protection oil](https://scandinavianbiolabs.com/products/hair-protection-oil) ‚Äì a blend of essential and beneficial oils designed to revitalize your hair.\n4. Maintain a healthy diet: Ensuring a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle can improve the overall health of the scalp and hair. If left untreated, traction alopecia can lead to permanent baldness.\n\n# Scalp Psoriasis\n\nScalp psoriasis is a prevalent skin condition that affects millions of people globally. It is characterized by red, scaly patches on the scalp, leading to itching, burning, discomfort, and even hair loss. By understanding the symptoms and recommended treatments for scalp psoriasis, you can better manage this condition and reduce its impact on your hair health.\n\n# Symptoms of scalp psoriasis:\n\nDepending on the severity, symptoms of scalp psoriasis can vary. Common symptoms include:\n\n* Itchy, scaly patches on the scalp\n* Redness and inflammation\n* Thick, silvery scales or plaques that may appear as large patches\n* Hair loss in patchy areas\n* Burning or soreness\n* Stiffness in the scalp\n* Flaking skin that may appear on clothes or furniture\n\n# Recommended treatments for scalp psoriasis:\n\n1. Topical medications: corticosteroids, calcipotriol, coal tar products, dithranol, and salicylic acid.\n2. Oral or injected medications: to control inflammation and reduce scaling.\n3. Light therapy: beneficial for scalp psoriasis alone or combined with topical medications.\n4. Lifestyle changes: stress reduction, diet improvement, and regular exercise to reduce flare-ups.\n5. Self-care measures: avoid scratching the scalp, and use gentle shampoos designed for scalp psoriasis.\n\n# Trichotillomania\n\nTrichotillomania, or hair-pulling disorder, is a psychological condition marked by a recurrent urge to pull out one's hair. This behavior can lead to noticeable hair thinning, patchy baldness, or even complete hair loss in severe cases.\n\n# Symptoms of trichotillomania\n\nCommon symptoms associated with trichotillomania include:\n\n* Obsessive thoughts or urges to pull out hair\n* Feelings of tension before and relief after hair-pulling\n* Frequent playing with, twirling, or rubbing pulled-out hair\n* Inability to resist hair-pulling in specific situations or when experiencing certain emotions\n* Noticeable bald patches on the scalp and other areas of the body\n* Emotional distress related to hair-pulling, such as guilt or shame\n* Excessive grooming behaviors leading to hair loss, such as over-combing or brushing\n* Feelings of satisfaction when looking at pulled-out hair\n* Using techniques to disguise bald patches, such as wearing hats or frequently changing hairstyles\n\n# Recommended treatments for trichotillomania\n\n1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): helps identify and modify thoughts, feelings, and behaviors contributing to hair-pulling urges.\n2. Medications: antidepressants or antipsychotics to reduce hair-pulling urges and relieve symptoms.\n3. Habit Reversal Training (HRT): a type of CBT that helps identify and modify hair-pulling behaviors.\n4. Support Groups: provide a safe place to share experiences, build coping skills, and reduce stigma.\n\n# Female Pattern Baldness\n\nFemale pattern baldness, or androgenetic alopecia, is a common type of hair loss affecting millions of women worldwide. It usually begins in the 40s and can continue until menopause. The primary cause is an excess of androgens or male hormones, which causes hair follicles to shrink, leading to thinning hair on the scalp.\n\n# Symptoms of female pattern baldness\n\nCommon signs and symptoms include:\n\n* Gradual thinning on top of the head\n* Receding hairline, especially at temples\n* Widening of the center hair part\n* Increased hair shedding on a pillow in the morning\n* An overall decrease in scalp coverage\n* Visible bald patches (in advanced cases)\n* Hair shedding or breakage\n\n# Recommended treatments for female pattern baldness\n\n1. Medications: Finasteride (Propecia) and minoxidil (Rogaine) are commonly used to treat female pattern baldness. Finasteride blocks the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), while minoxidil promotes hair growth by increasing blood flow to the scalp.\n2. Laser Therapy: Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a non-invasive treatment shown to reduce hair loss and promote new hair growth in some women. It uses low-intensity lasers to stimulate the scalp, increasing circulation and encouraging follicles to enter the anagen phase of the hair growth cycle.\n3. Hair Transplant Surgery: This procedure involves transplanting healthy hair from an area of the scalp with thicker hair to balding areas. The transplanted hairs will grow naturally in the new location, providing a permanent solution to female pattern baldness.\n4. Scandinavian Biolabs Hair Growth Routine: Designed to address early-stage non-scarring hair loss, including androgenetic alopecia, this natural hair growth solution harnesses the power of bioactive ingredients to help strengthen hair, reduce hair loss, and stimulate new growth.\n\n# Hairline Recession & Thinning at The Crown\n\nHairline recession and thinning at the crown can be distressing for many people, especially those who had a full head of hair in their younger years. This issue affects both men and women but is more common in men.\n\n# Symptoms of hairline recession & thinning at the crown\n\n* Widening of the central and frontal hair part line\n* Visible scalp on forehead, temples, or crown areas\n* Reduced amount of hairs in specific areas\n* An overall decrease in fullness and body of hair along the parting line\n* Widening of the scalp line with a receding hairline\n* Hair loss in patches, mainly on the crown area\n* Breakage or shedding hairs along the parting lines or around the crown area\n\n# Recommended treatments for hairline recession & thinning at the crown\n\n1. Minoxidil: Minoxidil is a topical medication applied directly to the scalp, available in over-the-counter and prescription formulas. It stimulates hair growth and makes existing hairs stronger and thicker.\n2. Finasteride: This medication is taken orally, usually once a day, and works to block the production of DHT (dihydrotestosterone), a significant contributing factor in male pattern baldness.\n3. Platelet-rich Plasma Therapy: Platelet-rich plasma therapy (PRP) is a treatment that uses the patient's blood to stimulate hair growth. It injects the patient's plasma, containing high platelets and other healing factors, directly into the scalp.\n4. Hair Transplant: A hair transplant is a surgical procedure that involves transferring hair follicles from one part of the scalp to another. It can treat hairline recession and thinning at the crown.\n5. Laser Therapy: Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a newer form of treatment that uses light energy to stimulate hair growth. The lasers are typically painless and can treat both men and women experiencing hair loss.",

You need herb medications to bust your blood flow , to increase metabolism. Coconut oil mixed with ginger or red pepper or turmeric will only make your hair greasy and your scalp itchy . I tried it believe me . Nicotinic acid works a little  because it makes your blood flow betterIts  . It‚Äôs never a bad idea to consult a professional therapist .

Scalp Micropigmentation is a completely different process, uses different tools and techniques, different pigments, etc. I just want to make sure that everyone viewing your wonderful list of resources knows the difference.

    "body": "# or, I Farmed 600 Gyrm So That No One Else Has To\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs requested, I spent the last couple days searching out and testing the different methods for farming Chunks. I found not only the single best method *by far*, but also the best methods for the early, mid, and late game as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mu29Y1lowGp9eB0HTrAgBWYA4sf2EKB7g-Bs0g1ThH8/edit?usp=sharing), which has all of my data as well as detailed guides and notes for each method, plus some pretty charts and other info not included here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n###Let's jump in!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\n\n***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Overview\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI tested four methods total:\n\n* Coal Tars\n* Gyrm Warriors\n* Harvest Valley Ascetic Runs\n* Giant Lord Ascetic Runs\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll break them down into categories based on when in the game they become available - Early-Game, Mid-Game, and Late-Game. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut first...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\n\n***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Highlights\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### Chunks-per-Minute\n\n* Coal Tar - 0.7375\n* Gyrm Warrior - 0.1346 (Yes, really)\n* Harvest Valley Ascetic Run - 4.6092\n* Harvest Valley Ascetic Run + Farming an Ascetic from Aldia's Keep - 1.6276\n* Giant Lord Ascetic Runs - **43.6086**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf no surprise is how insanely OP the **Giant Lord** method is - it is *by far* the ~~penultimate~~ ultimate Chunk farming method, but also the one with the highest requirements: you have to beat the final boss, so you can buy Chunks with the resultant Scrooge McDuck horde of Soul-bucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn second place is the **Harvest Valley Ascetic Run**, a method that was unknown to me until I started these tests. \n\nBy burning an Ascetic in the first bonfire of Harvest Valley, you spawn 4 Chunks in the first poison pit. Not a bad deal, but also not sustainable without a supplementary farming method - enter the Aldia's Keep Run, where you can pay 1 Ascetic to loot 2, but not until the very end of the Mid-Game.\n\nAlternatively, once you reach Drangleic Castle you can farm the Chasms of the Abyss, where all enemies have a roughly 20% ascetic drop rate, but the Covenant of Champions doesn't work on them, so each time you despawn them you'll have to fight a progressively more powered up Darklurker to ascetic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn third is the workhorse method, **Coal Tars**. I was actually surprised by how strong this turned out to be, when using the right strategy. Triple points for being available at any point in the game, *even without fighting a single boss*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly, so far behind that it's almost hard to believe, boasting the *impressively* bad CpM of **0.13**, let's have a tepid pity clap for the **Gyrm Warriors**. I hate this method, and I hope that these tests will be the last time anyone even *considers* wasting precious moments of their life on that *godawful* slog of a run.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nE: There's been some mention of using the Bell Keepers covenant for farming; it is certainly viable, but I didn't include it for a few reasons: \n\n1. It doesn't have the consistency to be a truly testable method; there are too many variables involved in PvP, not the least of which is matchmaking time\n\n2. It would be outside the scope of this project, and even further outside the scope of my personal knowledge to write a guide for PvP with any degree of quality\n\n3. I don't have good enough internet to play online, so I couldn't test it regardless\n\n4. Most importantly, I want my guides and methods to be available to everyone, and not everyone can play online\n\nThat being said, if PvP is your thing, it's worth looking into!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### Now, lets break this thing down!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\n\n***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Early-Game\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is everything within 3 or 4 bosses of starting the game. The two methods under the spotlight here are **Coal Tars** and **Gyrm Warriors**. \n\nBesides the marked difference in quality, it's also worth noting that to farm Gyrms you must kill Scorpioness Najka, while Coal Tar can be farmed after only getting the Silvercat Ring. However, my method used a Fire Infused bow, requiring me to beat Dragonrider and Flexile *or* Last Giant and Pursuer before farming. I went with Last Giant/Pursuer, since I needed the Firedrake Stone from FotFG anyways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Coal Tar\n\nThe Coal Tar method performed much better then I expected. It was also by far the easiest to run; just light each oil pool with a shot from a Fire infused bow, wait a few seconds, then rinse and repeat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Gyrm Warriors\n\nDon't bother if you value your time or sanity. \n\nI've never been so bored while farming.\n\nLittle known fact: there's an ancient Gyrm law forbidding them from forming a passable farming route at any time. These bastards have a population density roughly equal to that of the Antarctic, their loot despawns if you blink too many times, and their drop rate is solidly D-tier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Run Info\n\n**Coal Tar:**\n\n* Total Runs - 250\n* Kills per Run - 4\n* Seconds per Kill - 6.102\n* Average Run Length - 24.408\n* **Chunks per Minute** - 0.7375\n* Chunks per Hour - 44.2484\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Gyrm Warrior:**\n\n* Total Runs - 200\n* Kills per Run - 3\n* Seconds per Kill - 15.66\n* Average Run Length - 46.797\n* **Chunks per Minute** - 0.1346\n* Chunks per Hour - 8.0774\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\n\n## Raw Drop Rates\n\n* **Coal Tar** - 19.20%\n* **Gyrm Warrior** - 9%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\n\n## Drop Rates by Item\n\n**Coal Tar:**\n\n* Large Shard - 11.7%\n* Chunk - 7.5%\n\n**Gyrm Warrior:**\n\n* Some Bullshit I Don't Want (Magic and Old Mundane Stones) - 5.5%\n* Chunk - 3.5%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExtrapolating from those drop rates, the probability of a Chunk dropping in a 25 second Coal Tar run is **30%**. Contrast that with the 47 second Gyrm run, with a probability of **10.5%**. \n\nThat is nearly *one third* the chance for a Chunk, in *almost double* the amount of time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### Don't farm Gyrms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\n\n***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Mid-Game\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor this breakdown, I'm considering Mid-Game to be everything up to getting the King's Ring.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's some overlap here, in that Coal Tar runs remain the most sustainable method of farming Chunks for much of the Mid-Game, all the way up until you reach Aldia's Keep, which fully opens up the next method: Harvest Valley Ascetic Runs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Run Info\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### No Ascetic Farming\n\n* Cost - Bonfire Ascetic x1\n* Loot - Chunk x4\n* Total Runs - 50\n* Average Run Time - 0:52.1\n* **Chunks per Minute** - 4.6092\n* Chunks per Hour - 276.5508\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### With Aldia's Keep Ascetic Farming\n\n* Cost - None\n* Loot - Chunk x4, Petrified Dragon Bone x2\n* Total Runs - 50\n* Average Run Time - 2:27.45\n* **Chunks per Minute** - 1.6276\n* Chunks per Hour - 97.6585\n* PDB per Minute - 1.2581\n* PDB per Hour - 75.4860\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I found this pair of runs to be rather unenjoyable, but it's hard to argue with results; it outputs between 2 to 6 times more Chunks compared to the Coal Tar method.\n\nThe main drawback of this method is that the run isn't fully sustainable until the end of the Mid-Game, when you reach Aldia's Keep.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\n\n***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Late-Game\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point, you are able to go fight Nashandra, or have already killed her. The Giant Lord method is now available.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Run Info\n\n* Total Runs - 25\n* Average Run Time - 1:56.46\n* Minimum Souls per Run - 507,882\n* Converted to Chunks per Run - 84.647\n* Chunks per Minute - 43.6086\n* Chunks per Hour - 2616.52\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is when things get crazy - the Harvest Valley/Aldia's Keep method is in full swing but it is quickly and completely overshadowed by the numerical juggernaut of the Giant Lord method, which exceeds every other option by **orders of magnitude**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\n\n***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Recap\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## The Best Early-Game Method:\n\nAbsolute wash in favor of the Coal Tar method.\n\nFrankly, I'm embarrassed on behalf of the Gyrm. Get your shit together my dudes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## The Best Mid-Game Method:\n\nI go against my heart, but I have to give it to the Harvest Valley Run. Even including Ascetic farming, it more then doubles the output of the Coal Tar method and can supply respectable numbers of Petrified Dragon Bones to boot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Best Chunk Farming Method in the Game:\n\nIt's the Giant Lord run. Of course it is. It's so insanely dominant that I don't even bother farming chunks at all until I can buy Chunks using this method. It eclipses every other option, being *ten times* more efficient then the next best method. **A single 2 minute run will buy almost a full stack of Chunks**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\n\n***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere you have it! All the methods, all the runs, all the results. Here's hoping this info is helpful to some people out there!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think tha- no listen I know about the Tseldora Villager guys but that run is garbage I'm not doing it have merc-\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't forget to check the spreadsheet if you're interested in my testing methodology, step-by-step guides for each method, or even just pretty colors!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll be back to working on Twinkling Titanite now, after a power nap or 10. Keep an eye out for that post in the next week or so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n##### Thanks for reading, and happy farming!",

        "body": "First off, you are beautiful. Now for the advice. \n\n Skincare wise, your skin is pretty blemish free, so I would prioritize moisturizing. Everyone should moisturize, especially with conditions like eczema and in this cold weather. I recommend a hyaluronic acid serum or essence with Niacinamide to bring out your skin's glow. \n\nFor Hair, you're doing well with moisturizing and twisting it at night. If you don't want the hassle of dealing with your hair, you can invest in a protective style like braids or twists. It offers a change of style and extra protection for the ends of your hair. However, i know that with conditions like psoriasis, it makes hair styling more difficult. I have eczema myself, and I need a steroidal solution prescription to help with my scalp. But before then, when I was really itchy, I used a tea tree shampoo for some relief.\n\nMakeup: I would get color matched at an Ulta or sephora. A little tip about finding what kind of undertone you have is to look at the veins in your wrists. If they appear blue or purple, you're more cool toned. Bluish green means you're more neutral toned. And green or olive veins means you lean more warm. This should help when picking out foundations, skin tints, or bb creams. I recommend getting tinted moisturizer instead of foundation as they are more subtle and feel lighter. \nYou have thick gorgeous lips, highlight them with some gloss. First, line them with a brown lip liner, then put on a nude brown gloss. It's a classic combo. For more expert tips and tricks, I would watch youtube tutorials of the basics. There are plenty of professional makeup artists that can walk you through step by step for beginners. \n\nFor fashion: I like your librarian style. üòÜ I think you should try some \" peplum\" tops or blouses. They accentuate the waist and float over the tummy. Like the floral dress you have on, very nice. Bright colors (like the light blue jeans jacket) and jewel tones are the way to go, in my opinion, because they suit you very well. The green shirt in the other picture is a jewel tone, and it looks great but is covered by that dull gray flannel. The flannel washes your color out and makes you look gray.",

Personally, having a moderate amount of healthy carbs in my diet improves my hair shedding. I shed so much hair when I was on a low carb diet. My detailed hair growth routine is here:*** [***https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/173ktba/how\\_i\\_have\\_successfully\\_grown\\_my\\_hair\\_back/***](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/173ktba/how_i_have_successfully_grown_my_hair_back/)\n* **Scalp conditions: healthy white scalp, no itchiness, no flakes**\n* **Shampoo routine: shampooing every other day, using Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair every  7-10 days, Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo for the rest of the week.**\n* **Diet and Lifestyle: Mediterranean diet; go to bed before 12; 7-8 hours of sleep everyday;**\n* **Stress management: don't give a shit about things that used to bother me, overall better mood**\n\nHi there, I've benefitted a lot from this community, so I'd like to make some contributions. I was losing an average of 200-300 hairs everyday at the onset of my sebderm. After two months, I'm now only shedding about 90 hairs daily, which is within the normal range. I know that clinically speaking there is no cure to sebderm and it may come back later, but I'm just happy that it's at least under control now. So I want to share this as my SOS protocol. As for long-term maintenance, I'm still learning so much about it from this community.\n\nBackground:\n\n\\- suffered from dry dandruff (large and white flakes) for more than 12 years but never experienced any hair loss\n\n\\- Because of COVID, I developed a bad habit of only shampooing 1-2 times a week (I have an oily scalp and straight hair). On non-wash days, I used a lot of hair products to keep my scalp feeling clean, e.g. scalp serum and dry shampoo. I only found out later that they contained denatured alcohol, which can destroy our skin barrier.\n\n\\- In late Aug, I experienced increased hair shedding of a daily average of 200-300 strands when I usually only shed a maximum of 30-60 strands a day. At the worst point, I was losing 500 hairs when I was shampooing one day. And I almost passed out.\n\n\\- My scalp was tingling, burning, and sore.\n\n\\- I went to a dermatologist in early Sept. He diagnosed me with severe sebderm and folliculitis on my scalp. He said I needed to get my sebderm under control before he could treat my hair loss\n\n\\- My before and after pics (warning: my sebderm was really bad on my scalp): [https://imgur.com/a/jmhG46i](https://imgur.com/a/jmhG46i)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSebderm and hair loss:\n\n\\- I was very anxious and depressed about my hair loss because I've always had thick and healthy hair. People always give me compliments on how my hair looks. The point is that I was feeling so much pain mentally.\n\n\\- I consulted other dermatologists. Some said sebderm could cause telogen effluvium because my condition was so severe that it shocked my hair. Some said even though sebderm could cause increased hair shedding, mine was too serious to be caused by sebderm alone. There might be other causes.\n\n\\- But from Dr. Donovan's blog, there is a study that revealed that the more seborrheic dermaitits a person has, the more shedding (telogen effluvium) a person will experience. This tells us that individuals with severe seborrheic dermatitis are likely to have a severe telogen effluvium.\n\n\\- I still went to my family doctor and a naturopath to get blood tests done just to be sure what we're dealing with here. Everything was normal, so I focused on getting my sebderm under control.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow I got the situation under control:\n\n\\- My dermatologist prescribed me with clobetasol solution and ciclopirox 1.5% shampoo.\n\n\\- At first, I was reluctant to use steroid. However, the longer my scalp stays inflamed, the more possible damage will be caused to my hair follicles, so I followed my derm's instructions and applied clobetasol to the affected areas daily for 21 days. My scalp was less red but I was still shedding 150-200 hairs a day.\n\n\\- Using the ciclopirox 1.5% shampoo (every other day for 8 weeks, as instructed by my dermatologist) was not very helpful. After much research, I came up with my own protocol that has really helped me get my sebderm under control.\n\n**- What I found is key is that the protocol needs to consist of three components: 1) destroy the biofilm, 2) kill malassezia, and 3) rebuild skin barrier. For each component, there are numerous ingredients/products available.**\n\n**- You can do all three components on a particular day or scatter them around throughout the week, depending on whatever suits your schedule and skin needs. Experiment and observe what suits your skin the best.**\n\n\\- An example of a three-component routine **on a given shampoo day**: 5% xylitol solution on the affected areas to be left on for at least an hour --> wash it off with an antifungal shampoo --> apply a malassezia-safe moisturizer\n\n\\- An example of a three-component routine **in a particular week** (this is what I'm doing now): biofilm shampoo on day 1 and day 3 of the week followed by ciclopirox shampoo on day 5 and day 7. Each time after shampooing, apply a malassezia-safe moisturizer\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 1) destroying the biofilm: xylitol, ACV, and selenium sulfide, MCT oil without lauric acid\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 2) killing malassezia: ciclopirox, ketoconazole, coal tar, zinc pyrithione, and MCT oil without lauric acid\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 3) rebuilding skin barrier: panthenol (vitamin B5), niacinamide (vitamin B3), glycerin, and aloe vera\n\n\\- Salicylic acid is not anti fungal per se, but it's great at removing the scales, regulating sebum production, and calming down inflammation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy detailed protocol:\n\n**-  I shampoo four times a week: Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide --> Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide OR T/Sal --> Ciclopirox 1.5% Shampoo --> T/Sal (I only use Selsun Blue twice a week for 2 weeks when things are bad because it is very strong)**\n\n**- This protocol is for short-term ONLY, e.g. 2-6 weeks! To get things under control first.**\n\n**- (updated on 4 Jan 2022) As my sebderm is getting much better, I have switched to this gentler protocol, which again incorporates all the essential components, for long-term maintenance. I'm rotating three different shampoos: Neutrogena T/Sal, DermaKB Scalp Detoxifier (biofilm disrupter), and Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Shampoo (contains an antifungal Piroctone Olamine). To hydrate my scalp, I've been using a DIY niacinamide and panthenol spray.**\n\n\\- Selenium Sulfide 2.5% is a game changer for me!! The dandruff/biofilm was finally coming off after 1-2 uses. Antifungals cannot get to the malassezia to do their job if the biofilm is present.\n\n\\- After shampooing, ~~I apply a DIY 3% panthenol aloe vera gel to my scalp.~~ I'm now using this DIY 2% glycerin, 2% panthenol, and 4% niacinamide in water spray.\n\n\\- Avoid ANY ingredient that may feed malassezia (I use a website called Sezia. Simple Skincare Science is also a very good source).\n\n\\- Even though I don't suffer sebderm on any other area, I switch all of my skincare products to seb-derm safe products because my skincare may transfer to my pillow.\n\n\\- I use a silk pillow case to reduce the friction (I can't afford to lose even one more hair).\n\n\\- I change my pillow case every 2-3 days and wash my pillow every week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct recommendations:\n\n\\- What is weird is that a lot of the products that are supposed to be formulated for people with sebderm are not sebderm friendly. They contain ingredients that feed malassezia. There is a useful website called Sezia that I use to check whether a product is safe (not affiliated). This is also the reason I need to DIY the panthenol and aloe scalp treatment.\n\n\\- Products that I like: Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide Shampoo, Neutrogena T/Sal, Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Scalp, dermaKB Biofilm Scalp Detoxifier, Philosophy B5 powder, the Ordinary 100% niacinamide powder,\n\n\\- Products that made my situation worse: Head and Shoulders Royal Oils Scalp Elixir, Inkey List Salicylic Acid Scalp Treatment, Head and Shoulders Clinical Strength 1% Selenium Sulfide\n\n~~- I will be experimenting with a DIY niacinamide and panthenol toner (for rebuilding skin barrier and calming inflammation) and 5% xylitol solution (for destroying the biofilm) and will keep this community updated of my results.~~ After much trial and error, I settle on this DIY scalp toner (2% glycerin, 2% panthenol, and 4% niacinamide in distilled water, which I think is really helpful for calming my scalp.\n\n**- Neutrogena T/Sal shampoo may be too harsh for people with a dry/sensitive scalp, but my oily scalp loves it!!! It helps get rid of the oily buildup and flakes on my scalp while also regulating my sebum production. My scalp is definitely less oily. And malassezia loves an oily scalp because they also feed on our natural sebum.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDiet and supplements (Please see here for a detailed wholistic approach to tacking sebderm: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/rggsrj/a\\_novelwholistic\\_evidenceinspired\\_approach\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/rggsrj/a_novelwholistic_evidenceinspired_approach_to/)):\n\n\\- Daily: Vitamin D3+K2, cod liver oil, ~~reishi, homemade kefir~~, nutritional yeast, ~~MCT oil~~\n\n\\- 2-3 times a week: zinc, magnesium glycinate, and collagen powder\n\n**- What I would recommend for almost everyone: vitamin D3+K2, magnesium, and fish oil.**\n\n\\- Around 60-70% of people in North America are deficient in vitamin D. There are also studies that point to an association between vitamin D deficiency and inflammatory skin conditions such as sebderm. Although this does not mean a causal relationship, taking vitamin D3 overall can help regulate our hormones and immune system. Magnesium and vitamin K2 should be supplemented with vitamin D3. This combo also help me better deal with stress, which is also a trigger of sebderm.\n\n\\- Fish oil supplement helps the body repair the skin barrier. It is also highly anti-inflammatory. But remember to choose a reliable brand. Many of the fish oil supplements on the market are contaminated. Brands I love that are also third-party tested: Nordic Naturals, Natural Factors Pharmaceutical Grade Fish Oil, and InnovixLab.\n\n\\- Probiotics that I've tried and quite like: Garden of Life Dr Formulated, Seed, and Visbiome (not affiliated in any sense; purchased all products with my own money)\n\n\\- Garlic powder supplement and oregano oil capsules daily for 1 week for killing the bad bacteria in my gut\n\n\\- Homemade bone broth for repairing my gut\n\n\\- Gluten-free\n\n\\- No refined carbs at all\n\n\\- No sugar\n\n\\- No dairy ~~except kefir~~\n\n\\- Lots of greens with some meat each meal\n\n\\- Berries everyday (there is a study that revealed a correlation between low fruit intake and sebderm in women). Plus, berries are anti-inflammatory\n\n\\- Avoid using vegetable oil in cooking. Opt for more heat-stable oils that are also low in omega-6s, e.g. extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil, ghee, and butter.\n\n\\- To sum up, the key is to incorporate as much anti-inflammatory food as possible. Some further examples are turmeric and ginger.\n\n\\- What I usually eat: [https://imgur.com/a/nr1JKne](https://imgur.com/a/nr1JKne)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSummary of helpful resources/research:\n\n\\- Simple Skincare Science website\n\n\\- Sezia Website\n\n\\- Dandruff Deconstructed Website\n\n\\- Dr. Donovan's blog (He has recently published quite a number of articles on sebderm)\n\n\\- Ceramide insufficiency in sebderm patients ( [https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(07)01771-9/fulltext#relatedArticles](https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(07)01771-9/fulltext#relatedArticles)) ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12115025/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12115025/))\n\n\\- Niacinamide increases ceramide production ([http://fagron.lookhere-dev.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Atopic-Dermatitis\\_Nicotinamide-Tanno-O-2000-BJD.pdf](http://fagron.lookhere-dev.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Atopic-Dermatitis_Nicotinamide-Tanno-O-2000-BJD.pdf))\n\n\\- Caprylic and Polygalacturonic Acid Combinations for Eradication of Microbial Organisms Embedded in Biofilm ([https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01999/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01999/full))\n\n\\- Topical nicotinamide \\[i.e. niacinamide\\] for seborrheic dermatitis: an open randomized study ([https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/55117499.pdf](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/55117499.pdf))\n\n\\- Skin moisturizing effects of panthenol-based formulations ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21982351/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21982351/))\n\nFinally, I want to say that there is still hope.

And also to add the things that I forgot to mentionEdit: Added some before and after pics and meal idea pics.\n\nFeel free to message me if you have any questions\n\nEdit on 19 Jan 2022: Now my scalp is free from dandruff with very mild redness, itch is very neglectable like only very mild itch every 5-6 days, and I'm shedding an average of 70 strands of hair daily, which is within the normal range of 50-100 hairs daily as advised by most dermatologists. This is my latest weekly routine (I shampoo four times a week): Neutrogena T/Sal Shampoo --> Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Scalp (start with as little shampoo as possible because it lathers very well; too much lather can be irritating to the scalp) --> Phillip Adam Apple Cider Vinegar Shampoo (Fragrance Free) --> Ciclopirox 1.5% Shampoo (available by prescription only; alternatives are ketoconazole shampoo and selenium sulfide). ~~Each time after shampooing, I apply the DIY hydrating scalp spray containing 2% panthenol, 2% glycerin, and 4% niacinamide.~~ No longer using the toner as the shampoos I'm using now are very hydrating and gentle.\n\nEdit on 23 Jan 2022:  I've just stumbled across some substitutes for this DIY spray from a brand called COSRX. Although they are not hair products, the ingredient lists seem pretty good. This toner ([https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/centella-water-alcohol-free-toner](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/centella-water-alcohol-free-toner)) contains panthenol and sodium hyaluronate, which are both good hydrating ingredients. This one ([https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/bha-blackhead-power-liquid](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/bha-blackhead-power-liquid)) contains salicylic acid, niacinamide, and panthenol. I'm probably going to try these out soon as I sometimes don't have the time to make the DIY spray. BIG **DISCLAIMER: These are not products formulated for the scalp. Use at your own discretion.**\n\nUpdates on 15 Mar 2022: I'm now using a routine targeted at healing my skin barrier because my scalp is now flake-free but mildly red. Shampooing every other day: ciclopirox shampoo once a week and Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo (if you have a really oily scalp, Briogeo Be Gentle Be Kind Matcha Shampoo may be a better alternative) for the rest of the week. Each time after shampooing, I apply some diluted niacinamide serum from The Ordinary because the original 10% may be too irritating. The study that suggested niacinamide as a potential treatment for sebderm used a concentration of 4%. I also added some panthenol powder to the mixture (at a concentration of about 1.5%), which is completely optional. I'm now shedding about 50 hairs daily.\n\nThe new HA hydrating serum by The Ordinary did not work for me. I tested it on my hairline, then the sebderm migrated to my hairline while my scalp, luckily, is still clear.\n\nUpdates on 12 May 2022: Shampooing every 2-3 days because my scalp is less oily and less itchy. Not using any topical hydrating product because I think my skin has healed so much. Now I'm using ciclopirox shampoo (by prescription only) once a week, and Bioderma Node A Shampoo for the rest of the days\n\nUpdates on 7 July 2022: Shampooing every other day; Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair once a week and Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for sensitive scalp for the rest of the week; taking anti-inflammatory herbs prescribed by a licensed Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner (TCM); shedding 40-50 hairs daily; scalp pretty healthy; incorporated more carbs in my diet because realized a low-carb diet makes me shed more hair\n\nUpdates on 28 Aug 2022: Shampooing every other day; Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair every 10 days and Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo for the rest of the week; been taking the herbs for almost 2 months now. Noticed my scalp is less oily, zero itch now, no flakes, and redness almost gone. There are some days where I'm shedding only 20-30 hairs daily, which is my pre-sebderm level. But I DON'T recommend visiting a TCM practitioner in western countries. Most of them have no idea what they're doing, and the herbs, if not prescribed properly, can cause damage to the liver and kidney. They are also not well-regulated under the law. My diet is lots of cooked vegetables, some berries, some carbs, and some meat. My TCM doctor told me to avoid seafood (except some fish) and beef.",

    "body": "Ed eccoci ancora qua per la seconda parte della guida sulla dermatite seborroica.\n\nQui trovate la prima parte per chi se la fosse persa: [prima parte](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/xjns2b/skincare_e_dermatite_seborroica_guida_completa/).\n\nAnzitutto vi ringrazio per il caloroso supporto nella precedente puntata. Sono molto felice di aver contribuito alla discussione e in tantissimi mi avete chiesto un'opinione sugli shampoo.\n\nPrima di iniziare, ci tengo a ribadire un concetto: **della dermatite seborroica non abbiamo capito un cazzo e non c'√® una cura definitiva.** E' terribile, ma purtroppo viviamo in un sistema dove fare ricerca scientifica non conviene. Le case di dermocosmesi preferiscono tenere tutto vago per provare a vendere qualsiasi stupidaggine possibile. Nessuno ha un incentivo a fare degli studi seri e quei pochi che si fanno sono ridicoli, si parla di campioni da 10 persone. \n\nIo, come nella guida precedente, esporr√≤ una serie di consigli pratici il quanto pi√π possibile radicati nella ricerca scientifica. Ma siccome questa non ci d√† una risposta definitiva, l'invito √® sempre quello di sperimentare e se avete trovato un prodotto/routine che per voi funziona non posso che essere felice per voi.\n\nFaccio anche una premessa importante: io ho dei capelli grassissimi che producono una quantit√† d'olio imbarazzante. I miei consigli sono pensati per chi come me ha lo stesso tipo di cuoio capelluto.\n\n# Parte 1: Il piano d'attacco\n\nNella prima parte della guida spiegavo come la dermatite seborroica si pensa sia causata dalla malassezia: un lievito che vive sulla nostra pelle e nel 3% della popolazione causa rossori ed ipersensibilit√†.\n\nIl problema forte √® che non basta uccidere la malassezia per far sparire il problema. Tutta quanta l'incertezza scientifica sulla causa della dermatite seborroica, deriva dal fatto che anche una volta morta la malassezia, o addirittura anche solo componenti di essa rimaste sulla pelle, possono scatenare reazioni infiammatorie.\n\nIl nostro piano d'attacco deve dunque avere 3 priorit√†, che vanno in questo ordine:\n\n1.\t**Fare di tutto per impedire che la malassezia cresca**: siccome anche da morta sembra causare danni, il nostro obiettivo principale √® fare in modo che non cresca proprio. Per fare questo dobbiamo da un lato deprivarla del suo cibo naturale (i trigliceridi a catena lunga, in pratica il grasso della nostra pelle) e dall'altro stare molto attenti ai prodotti che ci mettiamo sulla testa. Soprattutto le donne, che spesso usano balsami e molti altri ingredienti per la cura dei capelli. Se gli diamo da mangiare attivamente √® la fine. La cosa peggiore in assoluto che si possa fare √® qualche trattamento strano con l'olio d'oliva \"come facevano i nostri nonni\".\n2.\t**Gestire il prurito**: questa √® la seconda priorit√† assoluta. Perch√®? Perch√® se avete prurito vi grattate e se vi grattate √® un cazzo di casino. Quando vi grattate andate a danneggiare la barriera protettiva della pelle. Questo rende da un lato la pelle pi√π suscettibile alle irritazioni e dall'altro si rende molto pi√π difficile il corretto assorbimento dei prodotti da parte della pelle. Purtroppo grattarsi √® un gesto spesso inconscio, quindi l'unico vero modo di affrontare la cosa √® gestire fin da subito il prurito.\n3.\t**Uccidere la malassezia**: solo alla fine, come terza priorit√†, cerchiamo dei prodotti che ammazzino la malassezia. Questo aiuta soprattutto durante gli attacchi pi√π pesanti e con i dolori acuti per mantenere sotto controllo il problema.\n\nCi tengo a stressare in particolare modo l'importanza di questo specifico ordine di priorit√†. \n\nSe ci pensate un attimo, √® lo stesso identico motivo per cui non basta usare il collutorio per avere denti sani. Non basta uccidere i batteri, ma dobbiamo con lo spazzolino andare a rimuovere ci√≤ di cui si nutrono. Solo cos√¨ riusciamo a mantere in salute i nostri denti.\n\nPer gli amici ingegneri, il perch√® intrinseco lo si trova nel \"modello logistico\". E' la stessa logica per cui non serve disinfestare le citt√† per eliminare i topi definitivamente, ma bisogna tenere pulito e salubre il luogo in cui si vive. L'idea √® che fintanto che c'√® cibo a disposizione, tutti questi fenomeni sono governati da processi di crescita esponenziale. Quindi, non puoi pensare di uccidere la malassezia per rallentare una crescita esponenziale, dopo due ore siamo punto e a capo. Dobbiamo cambiare \"l'ambiente\" della malassezia affinch√®, a livello strutturale, non ci sia cibo a sufficienza per sostenere una popolazione pi√π grande di un certo numero di esemplari.\n\n# Parte 2: Gli ingredienti con evidenza scientifica (per i capelli) \n\nCredo di avervi stressato abbastanza con il concetto di prima. Ma ci√≤ nonostante, quali sono gli ingredienti per combattere la dermatite seborroica?\n\nAnche qua, come spesso accade nel mondo della dermocosmesi, ci sono una miriade di minchiate e giusto una manciata di agenti attivi veramente efficaci. Non tutti sono adatti a qualsiasi tipo di cuoio capelluto, ma qua ci concentreremo sui principali per capelli grassi.\n\n1.\t**Disolfuro di selenio (selenium sulfide):** E' un antimicotico che rallenta la crescita della malassezia ed un agente cheratolitico (ovvero favorisce il ricambio superficiale degli strati della pelle). Pu√≤ aiutare anche a gestire il prurito. Come funziona? Bho! Non si √® capito molto del perch√® abbia questi effetti o come li produca. Quello che sappiamo √® che in alcuni studi da circa 250 persone (credetemi, sono sorprendentemente grandi per questo ambito della dermocosmesi) ha un'efficacia significativamente maggiore di un corrispettivo placebo. Al momento lo si sta anche studiando per eventuali utilizzi sugli occhi. Servirebbe a regolarizzare la produzione di olio dalle ghiandole che gestiscono il film oleo-acquoso che previene la secchezza oculare. **Fun Fact**: Raga io vi giuro, quando ero piccolo c'era un film / cartone animato dove c'erano questi che dovevano sconfiggere gli alieni. Un tizio scopriva che per loro il selenio era tossico e si andavano a comprare le bottiglie di shampoo antiforfora per sconfiggere gli alieni. Ve lo giuro non sono pazzo, ho questo ricordo stampato nel mio cervello.\n2.\t**Piroctone Olamina**: anche questo ingrediente viene utilizzato come antimicotico, ma sembra avere anche propriet√† antisettiche pi√π generalizzate. La sua efficacia sembra legata alla capacit√† di penetrare e spaccare la parete cellulare dei lieviti (oltre che di vari batteri). Spesso si trova insieme, o in sostituzione, dello Zinco piritione che ha effetti simili. Lo Zinco piritione, per chi si ricordasse qualcosa di biologia dalle superiori, nello specifico va a bloccare la pompa protonica delle cellule, andando a spaccare quel meccanismo che consente alle cellule di scambiare elementi con l'esterno.\n3.\t**Ketoconazolo (Nizoral):** Ne abbiamo gi√† parlato ed √® uno degli antimicotici pi√π efficaci sul mercato contro la malassezia. Oltre che in pomata, √® presente anche sotto forma di shampoo per trattare attacchi acuti di dermatite.\n\nIn questo caso non dir√≤ that's it, perch√® ci sono a disposizione anche altri 3-4 ingredienti efficaci (Climbazole, Ciclopirox Olamine, Coal Tar). Ma conoscendo i 3 di cui sopra, pi√π o meno avete un'idea di tutto quanto quello che c'√® nell'80% degli shampoo antiforfora seri.\n\nInoltre, terrei sempre anche d'occhio la presenza degli ingredienti di cui abbiamo parlato nella guida sulla skincare. La **niacinamide** aiuta sempre con i rossori e **l'acido salicilico** √® alla base della maggior parte dei trattamenti che si possono fare applicati direttamente al cuoio capelluto.\n\n# Parte 3: La routine e i consigli sui prodotti\n\nOra che abbiamo capito gli ingredienti e la filosofia alla base della routine, dobbiamo mettere tutto in pratica.\n\nL'aspetto pi√π importante in assoluto √® **la costanza.** Ricordate che il nostro obiettivo numero uno √® evitare che la malassezia cresca fin dal principio. La costanza nella routine √® la chiave. Io devo per forza farmi una doccia al giorno con gli shampoo. Mi basta saltare anche solo 2 giorni per avere immediatamente a distanza di poco tempo un attacco. A quel punto c'√® poco da fare, si pu√≤ solo contenere l'episodio. Questo perch√® come abbiamo visto, anche da morta la malassezia sembra causare danni e reazioni infiammatorie.\n\nLo so che √® palloso e spesso sono io il primo a non starci dietro, per√≤ per chi come noi soffre di questa patologia, tenere puliti e non grassi i capelli √® la cosa pi√π importante in assoluto.\n\nUn consiglio che d√≤ a tutti √® di comprarsi a 2/3‚Ç¨ delle bottigliette vuote da riempire con i nostri prodotti per quando si viaggia. Cercate di portarli sempre con voi, altrimenti le vacanze (o il ritorno) rischiano di essere rovinati.\n\nAltra cosa fondamentale, come detto, √® quello di assicurarsi che nessun ingrediente alimenti la malassezia. Fortunatamente esiste questo sito web [https://www.sezia.co/](https://www.sezia.co/) che vi consente di identificare quali ingredienti non vanno bene. Per qualsiasi prodotto non dedicato alla cura della dermatite seborroica che volete utilizzare, andate ad inserire gli ingredienti l√¨ dentro e vedete se pu√≤ causare problemi o meno. In alternativa c'√® anche questo database pi√π dettagliato: https://folliculitisscout.com\n\nQuando andate dal parrucchiere / barbiere, declinate ogni prodotto a meno che non sappiate con precisione cosa ci sia dentro.\n\nPer quanto riguarda la routine vera e propria, quale ingrediente devo scegliere? Siete pronti? Lo volete proprio sapere? Rullo di tamburi... **Il gold standard √® fare un mix and match.**\n\nNon sappiamo per quale motivo, ma dopo qualche settimana dall'inizio di un trattamento, la malassezia sembra smettere di rispondere. C'√® chi dice che sia lo sviluppo di una qualche resistenza, chi dice che ci sia qualche biofilm protettivo che si viene a creare insieme ad altre comunit√† di funghi e batteri. Non lo sappiamo.\n\nPer√≤ penso che tanti di noi abbiano trovato \"lo shampoo magico\" che per 1 mese ha funzionato e poi, boom! Di colpo un nuovo attacco.\n\nIl consiglio principale √® quello di utilizzare un mix degli ingredienti sopra citati. Questo sembra prolungare di molto l'efficacia dei trattamenti.\n\nLa routine diventa dunque questa:\n\n1.\t**Trattamento per cuoio capelluto all'acido salicilico**: da utilizzare 1/2 volte a settimana. Questo √® l'unico vero trattamento applicato direttamente al cuoio capelluto prima del lavaggio. Io personalmente uso \"The Inkey list - Salicylic Acid Exfoliating Scalp Treatment\". Molto competitivo dal punto di vista del prezzo per essere un acido salicilico ed ha un packaging pensato per l'applicazione sul cuoio capelluto. E' fondamentale per rimuovere scaglie, accumuli di sebo e quant'altro.\n2.\t**Disolfuro di Selenio:** da utilizzare 2/3 volte a settimana. Io utilizzo Vichy Dercos Technique per capelli grassi (che contiene anche lui acido salicilico, quindi magari questo shampoo non va insieme al trattamento). Attenzione che la linea dercos ha tanti prodotti con ingredienti diversi, quindi assicuratevi di comprare quello giusto.\n3.\t**Piroctone Olamina:** da utilizzare 2/3 volte a settimana. Io qua utilizzo i classici head & shoulders. Vi segnalo che alcuni possono includere \"Glycol Distearate\" che pu√≤ nutrire la malassezia. Tuttavia la formulazione nel suo complesso sembra efficace e personalmente non mi ha mai dato problemi.\n4.\t**Ketoconazolo (Nizoral Shampoo)**: da utilizzare 1/2 volte a settimana. In caso di attacchi, diventa il vostro shampoo principale e l'utilizzo va potenziato a 3/4 volte a settimana.\n\nFacendo un buon mix di questi shampoo ed utilizzando la routine di skincare proposta precedentemente, la gestione della dermatite seborroica cambia completamente. Vedrete proprio una pella diversa, di un altro tipo, pi√π pulita e lucente.\n\nIo spero che questi consigli possano tornarvi utili e se non altro a dare un po' di consapevolezza in cosa ci sia nei prodotti che ci mettiamo addosso ogni giorno.",

    "body": "**If you don't want to read this story, there's a TL;DR at the end**\n\nSo I've been battling with seborrheic dermatitis since I was a little girl. Long story short, my younger brother threw some of our mother's fragrances and essential oils into my scalp (and his own). This was when I was around 8 or 9. I'm 21 now.\n\nMy mother always combated it my mixing some Nizoral (ketoconazole 1% OTC shampoo) with regular kids shampoo. If it was really bad, she'd use the Nizoral whole. She'd use regular products to style my hair (edge control, Luster's Pink Olive Oil, etc) and I'd be good to go. I could use anything on my scalp without issue. As I got older, I used the Nizoral less and less because my scalp was nice and healthy.\n\nThen by the time I hit 16/17, my seborrheic dermatitis started flaring up like hell. I'd wash it like usual and it'll flake up within two or three day of washing. At the worst points, it'll start flaking as soon as my scalp dried.\n\nI tried all the common dandruff shampoos on the market. Head and Shoulders (zinc pyrithione), T Gel (coal tar), T Sal (salicylic acid), and Nizoral. I used each one alone for several months, then tried to alternate between them. I left them on from 5-10 minutes before rinsing. I'd double wash.\n\nI switched to a SLS free shampoo (Cantu Sulfate-Free Cleansing Cream Shampoo). I used a clarifying shampoo (Suave Daily Clarifying). I used all of these shampoos in various combinations.\n\nI went no shampoo; I'd only \"wash\" with water. I tried different water temperatures. I tried filtered, distilled, spring water. Then, I went to using ACV (apple cider vinegar) as shampoo. I tried ACV and baking soda. During senior year of high school, I went to my graduation rehearsal smelling like ketchup because I'd washed my hair with ACV that morning. \n\nI tried washing my hair every day. It would keep the flakes at bay, but it was a tedious process to wash my hair every day and wait for it to dry. It also stripped the hell outta my hair. It wasn't practical. Sometimes I'd have to go to sleep with wet hair. Then, I switched to only washing in the morning.\n\nI tried hot oil treatments: olive oil, coconut oil, mineral oil,  and castor oil either by themselves or in various mixes. I tried to leave in the hot oil treatments, I tried them before washing, I tried them after washing.\n\nI scrubbed my scalp with tea tree oil. I tried various \"dandruff\" shampoos and conditioners. \n\nThen, I finally went to to the dermatologist this year. I was prescribed 2% Ketoconazole shampoo and 0.01% fluocinolone acetonide oil. I used them as prescribed (leave the shampoo on for 5 minutes, wash every 3 days, use the oil after washing). My dandruff got better. I thought it was fixed after I finished the bottle. I switched back to the otc ketoconazole shampoo, and the dandruff returned. I was damned. \n\n*Cue MCT oil*\n\nMCT oil (Medium-chain triglyceride) is derived from coconut oil. *Wait a minute*, you're probably thinking. *Isn't coconut oil bad for dandruff? Won't it only feed the yeast?* Not MCT oil! Sciency science has shown that malassezia  yeast (what causes seborrheic dermatitis) can't metabolize the fatty acids in medium-chain triglycerides. [Basically, we're in the clear to use MCT oil](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10507598)\n\nSo, after washing my hair with the Nizoral, I apply MCT oil to my entire scalp. I hadn't washed my hair in about two weeks, and I noticed only minimal flaking. As in, I only noticed one flake large enough to pick off, and then a few sparse flakes if I scratched hard enough.\n\n**td;lr**\n\n**MCT oil has fixed my dandruff.**\n\n**I tried a lot of methods to fix this issue. Now, I just wash my hair with Nizoral and oil my scalp with MCT oil afterwards. I'm good to go.**",

I've been suffering from SD for the past 4-5 years, went for a Brazilian keratin treatment and the hairdresser applied it onto my scalp :-|\nIt tingled, but I have high pain tolerance, so I wasn't too bothered.\nThat was until I started becoming allergic to shampoo, and my scalp had acne on it, small to medium sized burning bumps.\n\nLike you, I've also tried 'organic all-natural' shampoos (Moroccan Method, Himalaya, Dermaveen, Dr.Bronner's baby, Burt's bees baby shampoo, Aubrey Organics, god knows what else. FYI I was aware that I'm allergic to fragrance, so most of the stuff I tried were fragrance free and I also tried to avoid essential oils), ACV rinse, JUST WATER, Free & Clear shampoo, coconut oil scalp masks, black soap, and when one day my scalp was actually warm to the touch and burning on the inside, I finally went to the dermatologist. She prescribed me Polytar, which didn't really work for the dandruff, but it calmed my scalp. Did a patch test which shows that I'm allergic to formaldehyde!!! I did read that the Brazilian keratin treatment had formaldehyde in it. (I was also prescribed a scalp lotion called Elosone, which was nice but too lazy to put it on, and a shitload of strong antihistamines which made me very very depressed, so I stopped taking it)\n\nPolytar stopped production about a year I was into it, and I've tried pine tar and other types of coal tar shampoos since. I've been on the routine of alternating between [DHS zinc shampoo](https://www.amazon.com/DHS-300960729165-Zinc-Shampoo-16oz/dp/B0046JOT4O?th=1) and [MG 217 shampoo](https://www.amazon.com/MG217-Psoriasis-Medicated-Conditioning-Formula/dp/B009ZBMVHU) a couple of years ago, this reduced my dandruff about 70%. I only feel the bumps 10% of the time now and it's *nowhere* near as painful as it was. \n\nThat said, I've also been taking [turmeric pills](http://www.vitahealth.com.my/product/proddetail.aspx?act=PI&PID=86) which helps A LOT. I'm usually very sceptical, but my doctor-surgeon parents prescribed it to my sister who has RA, and tried to cook more turmeric-based meals due to the anti-inflammatory property, so I thought I had nothing to lose anyway. WHOO HEY side effects: skin cleared up, no more scalp burning and acne, and 95% dandruff gone (the dandruff is back because I switched to a lower dosage turmeric pill -____-)\n\nCan't wait to get my hands on MCT oil! Coconut oil doesn't even penetrate into my hair and skin so I had a bad impression on it. *continues thanking profusely*\n\nEdit: Fixed abbreviation",

ACV soaks before medicated shampoos can greatly improve their effectiveness. UVB exposure is really effective and probably the most effective IMO. Supplementation with Vitamin D is vital. Dosage is 1,000 IU's per 25lbs of bodyweight. Vitamin D can reduce the over proliferation and turnover of skin cells. Sulfur and selenium are very effective topically as well as internally. Thyroid glandular supplementation or T3 if TSH is over 3. So many things can be done to win the battle of Seb derm. and psoriasis. Having adequate water and lower inflammatory foods is always the best prevention, of course. The nuke that I've found is topical DMSO(50-90%) if it's malassezia overgrowth.

Elegant like a knife point. It explains - this is not  hyperbole, this is the farthest thing from exaggeration - EVERYTHING.\n\nBut you lay it out and they stare at you like you've just been exhaling dust. Maybe they're missing some underlying scaffold of truth. **Maybe they are all propped on a bed of lies that must be burned away.**\n\nWhy does anything exist?\n\nNo no no no no don't reach for that word. There's no 'reason'. That's teleology and teleology will stitch your eyelids shut.\n\n***Why do we have atoms?*** **Because atomic matter is more stable than the primordial broth. Atoms defeated the broth. That was the first war.  There were two ways to be and one of them won. And everything that came next was made of atoms.**\n\n**Atoms made stars. Stars made galaxies. Worlds simmered down to rock and acid and in those smoking primal seas the first living molecule learned to copy itself. All of this happened by the one law, the blind law,  which exists without mind or meaning.** ***It's the simplest law but it has no worshippers here (out there, though, out there - !)***\n\nHOW DO I EXPLAIN IT it's so simple ***WHY DON'T YOU SEE***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Clue in Book Confessions Entry III to Toland mentioning The Blind Law of Atoms aka WHY CAN'T WE SEE)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBook Confessions: Entry III\n\n[https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/entry-iii#book-confessions](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/entry-iii#book-confessions)\n\nWe are all losing hope, but as long as we are still losing it, then it  has not run out.

In my imperial forgiveness, I stopped her ships. I asked myself: ***who but a true genius could reconstruct the OXA? Who but a Psion who craved the OXA's power to see the unseen? Surely we could use that mind!***\n\nI invited the builder to join me at a fete in her honor. She was called Otzot, freeborn Psion, and she glowed with the power of her  thoughts. She said, ***\"Is this not Calus's new Empire, an empire of achievement? Can't the Psions grow fat in thought, as you grow fat with power?\"***\n\nI said, you have a deal!

She joined the conspiracy against me. ***She used the OXA to transmit messages in secret*** \\- the military's plans for their coup.\n\nOtzot must die.\n\n***She can sense the hostility and focus of an assassin.

While atoms that are neither carbon nor hydrogen are normally referred to in organic chemistry as heteroatoms, this is usually in comparison to the all-carbon backbone. But this does not prevent a compound such as  borazine (which has no carbon atoms) from being labelled \"heterocyclic\".  [IUPAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry) recommends the [Hantzsch-Widman nomenclature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hantzsch-Widman_nomenclature) for naming heterocyclic compounds.\n\n***Heterocyclic compounds can be usefully classified based on their electronic structure.***  ***The saturated heterocycles behave like the acyclic derivatives.  Thus, piperidine and tetrahydrofuran are conventional amines and ethers, with modified steric profiles.*** Therefore, the study of heterocyclic chemistry focuses especially on unsaturated derivatives, and the preponderance of work and applications  involves unstrained 5- and 6-membered rings.  Included are pyridine,  thiophene, pyrrole, and furan.  Another large class of heterocycles are fused to benzene rings, which for pyridine, thiophene, pyrrole, and  furan are quinoline, benzothiophene, indole, and benzofuran, respectively.  Fusion of two benzene rings gives rise to a third large  family of compounds, respectively the acridine, dibenzothiophene,  carbazole, and dibenzofuran.  ***The unsaturated rings can be classified according to the participation of the heteroatom in the conjugated system, pi system.***\n\n***Heterocyclic Compounds Can Have up to 9 Atom Rings*** (I think this another clue with 9 entries in this lore book, plus the actual Nine. merely a clue that were on the right track)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**All of the items that Match places into the Y-Goblet in the entries of the Confessions Lore book are derivitives of a OXA-Heterocyclic Compound as explained in detail below**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**History of Heterocyclic Chemistry**\n\nThe history of heterocyclic chemistry began in the 1800s, in step with the development of [organic chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_chemistry).

In 1701, the city of Karlsberg was founded by the [Desfours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desfours) family, who were known for the estates of [Gro√ü Rohosetz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gro%C3%9F_Rohosetz) and [Morchenstern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morchenstern).  The new village was known for producing glass and [crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal) products.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef%C5%AFv_D%C5%AFl_(Jablonec_nad_Nisou_District)#cite_note-josefuvdul-4)   Karlsberg was divided into Untermaxdorf, Karlsberg and Josefsthal in  1827. Fifty years later Untermaxdorf and Antoniwald were incorporated.\n\nThe [Munich Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement) permitted Nazi Germany's [Adolf Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler) to annex the area in 1938 into what he called the [Sudetenland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudetenland).  Shortly thereafter Karlsberg was dissolved becoming Obermaxdorf and  Antoniwald. Josefsthal and Untermaxdorf formed a new community named  Iserwald. Following [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II), in 1945, the town returned to [Czechoslovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia) and the German inhabitants were [expelled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsion_of_Germans_from_Czechoslovakia) under the terms of [Bene≈° decrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bene%C5%A1_decrees).\n\nChurch\n\nThe Josef≈Øv D≈Øl church was built between 1862 and 1865 in a neo-gothic style. Its construction was partially funded by a lottery and 4000 gold pieces were  collected. The ceremonial laying of the foundation stone was held in September 1862.

The confirmation of their claims in the ensuing years involved  independent teams of scientists working in the **United States**, **Germany**,  Sweden, and **China**, as well as the **original claimants in Russia** and  Japan. In 2015, the [IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUPAC/IUPAP_Joint_Working_Party) recognised the element and assigned the [priority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_priority)  of the discovery and naming rights for the element to Riken, as it  judged that they had demonstrated that they had observed ***element 113***  before the JINR team did so.

All but boron are [post-transition metals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-transition_metal),  and ***nihonium is expected to be a post-transition metal as well***.

I was asked by my sister to watch her and her husband‚Äôs house and cat while they are out of town for two weeks, and I was like ‚Äúhell yeah, I get away from people for two weeks?!‚Äù (I have roommates) so, I pack my bags and head over. I get over there, settle in, and decide to have a shower before I go to bed. I dig in my suitcase, get my hairbrush, tooth brush, toothpaste‚Ä¶ and where is my shampoo? Fuck. So I decide to check if my sister or brother in law left any shampoo in the shower, and they did! So I fire up the shower and hop in. I grab the shampoo bottle, get a good dollop, and lather it in. Fucking hell was that a mistake. Immediately I was overwhelmed with the scent of some infernal chemical concoction from the depths of Satan‚Äôs domain. It smelled like I had doused myself in gasoline and then rolled in a construction zone. I scrubbed and scrubbed my scalp trying to rid myself of the stench of the devil‚Äôs asshole, and IT WOULD NOT LEAVE. I grab the bottle thinking I must have grabbed some sort of cleaning agent by mistake. It was coal tar shampoo, for dandruff prone scalps. I am now left smelling like the late 1800‚Äôs, early 1900‚Äôs factory worker, and will remain as such until I can go retrieve my shampoo. \nTL;DR: I accidentally used Dandruff control shampoo that smells like an industrial zone, and the smell is lingering.

To creatively aquire. \n\n\"Hobbs,\" Robert called out, \"Can you explain to me why we need to collect urine?\"\n\n\"Well Robert, you did give us that paper and said to get whatever we needed, but with the dwindling supplies I couldn't procure everything.\" Hobbs explained. \n\n\"Did the fact that we were Convicts up until a day ago factor in at all?\" Robert asked.\n\n\"Did you think it wouldn't?\" Hobbs replied. \n\nHobbs had a point, but it still didn't explain why everyone had to collect their pee.\n\nTo be fair, every unit was preparing for the expected counter offensive in any way that they could, and considering the current shortage of material with no end in sight, some units had started resorying to rationing consumables. Fuel, batteries, food and medicines were only available in limited quantities, which meant that the 449th was shit out of luck when asking for anything since they were former convicts. That didn't detere the former convicts from embracing their previous occupations however. \n\nHobbs had been able to obtain much of what the 449th needed in an honest fashion by requesting secondary and tertiary items. Instead of the top tier fuel that was being hoarded by other units, Hobbs asked for Kerosene and diesel as well as polystyrene waste from packaging. Hobbs would request Nitric Acid instead of the more standard solvents used to clean equipment then inquire if they had any loose beer cans as well. Needless to say, every reasonable request came up a little short and every outlandish request garnered an odd look, but if the convicts wanted the trash they were free to have it. \n\nMedicine was also being hoarded for obvious reasons and requests for pain relievers were denied outright, but Hobbs would then ask for 'oil of mirbane' or nitrobenzene which the pharmacies didn't even realize they had on hand or what to do with it. \n\n\"My daddy showed me how to turn this stuff into 'hell of it' and a pain killer.\" Hobbs would reply when asked what it was for. \n\nWhen Robert asked what 'hell of it' was he was thankful the pharmacists didn't inquire further, but it did make him wonder what Convict Regiment his dad was eventually sent to. As it turned out, Nitrobenzene really was used in the creation of over the counter pain relievers some time in the 20th and 21st centuries, and the process was not that difficult. He also went into the process of distilling coal tar into acetaminophen. The things people would put in their bodies back then...\n\nWhen it came to food requisition, Hobbs couldn't get a single cracker which infuriated him to no end. That's when Jacob and his new \"sticky finger\" friends went into action. Canned and dry foods were paramount since nobody knew how long the siege would last, but that didn't stop a refrigerator packed with cured meats from magically appearing one morning. Thankfully there were no accusations of theft, but that only made Robert more curious to how it had been acquired, and from whom. \n\nThomas introduced himself at some time during the crime spree by singing  \"13 year sentence for chopping up some cars\" and sent strait to collecting scrap and metal water for whatever Hobbs had in mind. Robert decided it was the best course of action after 19 empty oil drums and a broken welding torch were hauled in, and Hobbs insisted they would be used to make a perimeter defense. Robert didn't want to know what he meant by \"big-bada-booms\". \n\nThe last thing to be covered was also the most important, weapons and ammunition, which nobody would spare. The 449th was heavily dependent on light ballistic weapons since that was all they had been issued, and some of the guns that had been issued were completely useless. The ammunition that they had been issued was also in rough shape, having formed patina from years on neglect and bad storage practices. It was fortunate that Robert's own criminal past was helpful in that regard. \n\nGuns, outside of law enforcement and military use, were expressly forbidden in society in the same way Narcotics were. That didn't stop people from obtaining either of them however, drugs were just more inexpensive and readily available. When it came down to possessing a firearm you had two options, have enough money to buy one or learn how to build one. Robert had done the latter. \n\nIt had started as an innocent curiosity, a pipe pistol he had found discarded on a routine dumpster dive. Incredibly crude but in working condition, Robert decided to keep it for self defense. It wasn't like the police cared about the homeless anyway. The pistol had been used and abused before it was discarded and Robert decided to take it apart and clean it. The thing came apart quite easily, and cleaned up rather nicely, but what Robert had noticed was how simple the materials were. Steel pipes were readily available as well as discarded wood which often contained the nails required as well. The other parts were also easily obtained as trash from construction areas and even municipal dumps. \n\nAmmunition was another matter. Since guns were outlawed, only police and military were suppose to have ammunition and the black market price could be better used to obtain food. Casings, on the other hand, were easy to find in scrap yards, but spent casings didn't have any propellant or even a round left in them, not to mention the primer was already used. \n\nRobert had decided that the manufacture of single shot pipe guns could be a useful skill and became increasingly better at it to the point that even the cartels showed interest in his craftsmanship. He had started to make something of a living creating pistols and even rifles of various calibers, even with a half assed  spring fed magazine for the less than law abiding individual, but would always take apart any casings he could scrounge hoping to learn how to create ammunition. It wasn't as difficult as he had thought it would be, and that's how he got caught. \n\nMost people would have assumed the powder would give a hint to the craftsman, but a simple mixture of chared wood, sulphur and salt peter isn't that easy to use as an identification, the primer on the other hand is. Robert used a specific brand of matches for his primer, a rather cheap but good quality that was only sold in specific stores. The police had noticed the amount of pipe guns increase, as well as improvised ammunition and had started an investigation to find the culprit. \n\nAs it turned out, the primers didn't consume all the material, and the brand of matches was identified, stores were observed and Robert was completely unaware unit he went to the convenience store near the park he camped in. A homeless person would usually purchase a butane lighter, so when Robert places ten boxes of matches on the counter, the cop who was watching him knew something was amiss. Robert beat the cop to the draw and put a single round through the cops left eye before he fled leaving fingerprints, DNA evidence, and a perfect camera shot of his face. Next stop, the Convict Regiment. \n\nRobert was able to disassemble the rifles that the 449th had on hand, and even cannibalise the more broken ones to bring others up to a usable state. He had instructed and drilled everyone in the proper cleaning and maintenance of weapons and ammunition alike, as well as how to make replacement primers dry out and create powder, and even how to create the bullets he had made in his past life. He also schooled the most capable of the 449th in the assembly of his half assed, magazine fed rifles made from whatever was lying around. \n\nRobert started to wonder if everything that had happened in his life had led him to this singular point. It was a fantasy to think he was somehow that important, but he allowed himself to indulge in it none the less. This group of misfits and criminals, by some miracle, making it to this point together felt like more than random chance. He didn't believe in destiny or divine providence, but he genuinely enjoyed how the former refuse of society had come together into a useful weapon.\n\nWeapons do need to be tested periodically to ensure that they will not break, and the 449th would soon face their first true test as an official regiment. \n\n\n\n",

The Prometheans pulled up their sleeves and embarked on their technology project with a resolve that was breathtaking even by human standards.  They already had bronze when we came to them, and within six months they had made their first steam engine.  They found a surface seam of anthracite coal and were soon mining it and doing their first experiments with blacksmithing, a skill they had never developed since advanced weapons did not interest them.  Within a year bio-powered handmade machine tools were being replaced with tools run from shop steam and everything was getting progressively bigger, more precise, and more capable.\n\nIn other labs the arts of glassmaking and glass blowing were perfected.  First methane then coal gas powered bunsen burners and tubing was extruded by the tens of meters.  In every lab walls were covered with 8.5 by 11 inch sheets of paper printed at the lab that had grown up around our first landing point, where we were based.  Within two years the glassware and other lab techniques were producing the first primitive medicines and chemical processes.  Every day we took the *Plausible Deniability* to a different location, usually taking a few passengers so that the Prometheans could share what they had learned in person.\n\nBy the third year there were a dozen boiler shops and engine works, and they were making multi-horsepower triple expansion steam engines.\n\nWe had warned them that they would need clean working spaces for their endgame, and some of them set about figuring out how to make their traditional wooden structures less dusty.  On their own they came up with a coating made from coal tar which bubbled to the surface at some places and cellulose fibers; steam powered mixers pulped this into a smooth liquid which could be painted on and hardened into a remarkably tough plastic-like impermeable surface.\n\nWe had also warned them that optical techniques would be critical, so other shops were working on lenses and mirrors.  With these they built microscopes which were helpful both in the clean working space project and in demonstrating the germ theory of disease for their doctors.  In the middle of their third year they discovered a natural substance much like penicillin that could be cultured and made surgery commonly survivable for the first time in all their history.\n\nAt the beginning of the fourth year I happened by the radio room as the operator was transcribing a message from one of the clean labs which was trying to make electronics.  They had managed to grow small pure silicon crystals and bake dopants into them to turn them into semiconductors.  I saw the operator write the word \"transistor\" and stopped in my tracks.  (The operators of the radio network, built around those fifty-three QRP transceivers I had brought, had elected to dodge the issue of making their own code and simply translated everything to English and used actual Morse.)\n\nThe next day M and I visited in the *Plausible Deniability*.  They let us examine their transistor with all the advanced testing gear they didn't have themselves; they had been evaluating it with galvanometers.  M pronounced it a workable depletion mode N-channel MOSFET with a voltage gain of 110.  For bonus points they had made it with optical lithography techniques, which could be directly scaled to make an integrated circuit and optically scaled to miniaturize it.\n\nI had thought we would need to go back to the Witnesses and the Curators to arrange another Earth run for more paper and toner, but as the years passed that became less and less necessary.  The Prometheans were making their own paper and ink and while it wasn't suitable for our copiers it was fine for them to exchange knowledge among themselves.  We told them how printing presses worked and when they felt a need they started building those themselves.\n\nAt five years they were still using animal-drawn carts for most travel but they were experimenting with steam powered road cars and steadily improving the roads, using not modern Earth techniques but those of our ancient Romans, which were more suitable to less automated construction and demonstrably more durable than asphalt and concrete surfaces.  They weren't shipping so much of anything, even coal to power the steam engines, that any of this was inadequate.\n\nSince the Prometheans didn't have anything like money or an economy we occasionally tried to figure out how they worked out what went where.  It turned out that those who made things took what might be called bids, which were letters or radio transmissions of request with what they called as near as we could translate \"pleas of utility.\"  The makers selected the bids that made the best case and sent their surplus works along to be used.  The system seemed to work like their systems of agriculture and food distribution, which also continued to work as they had for tens of thousands of years.  The idea that someone might try to game the system seemed incomprehensible and even obscene to them.  What sort of person, I was asked several times, would risk the stain to their credibility that would certainly result from an exaggerated plea of utility?  M and I decided not to enlighten them.\n\nOne day we found a cast bronze statue on the yard outside of our base lab.  It depicted M and myself, hairy but anatomically correct, encountering a female Promethean child on the road.  The artist turned out to be the female child, who was now a young adult.  She told us her plea of utility was simple; however it turned out, one day we humans would call our work done and depart, but her people should not forget the moment we came to shift their destiny.  It was a bit embarrassing but kind of hard to argue with.\n\nAt the dawn of the fifth year of their project, the coal mine exploded.\n\nThere was chaos on the radio network and we understood that wagons were heading toward the site from every direction, but they would take hours to days or longer to arrive.  We had a spaceship.  We were there fifteen minutes after we learned about the accident.  The site foreman explained that they had started following the seam underground, and in their excitement they had forgotten the early warnings we had given them about explosive gases building up in cavities.  There were several workers buried in the rubble.  M ran for the ship.\n\n\"Tell them to tether themselves,\" she yelled through the door.  \"I'm going to expand the supergravity field and make everything weightless.\"  I explained what this meant to the foreman as the *Plausible Deniability* positioned itself above the field of debris.\n\n\"Rope! Tie yourselves off and get ready to throw some rocks!\"\n\nIt took a few tries for most of them to figure out how to maneuver but soon we were all heaving chunks of coal toward the edge of the field, where they would drop into an impressively clean little wall around the site.  It turned out the best way to keep yourself in contact with the debris was to use the debris as rocket fuel to push you back into the ground.  If you got stuck you just had to haul yourself back to the edge of the supergravity field by rope and jump back in with better direction.  When first one, then two, then five survivors were uncovered, they were quickly and easily pulled from the wreckage.\n\n\"This is everyone,\" the foreman told me.  I got M's attention and she normalized the supergravity field and landed the ship.\n\n\"Well that's one way to get a lot of coal out of the ground,\" the foreman said, then he looked at his injured workers.  \"Not so good for them though.  I've never seen anyone survive injuries like that.\"\n\n\"They can now,\" M said.  \"J, they have antibiotics at site 194.\"\n\n\"She's right,\" I said.  \"You people have done so much in so little time you're not all aware of it all.  There have been medical advances.  We need to get these people into the ship now.\"\n\nOn a primitive world there is no air traffic control.  We raced the QRP radio signal to the hospital site and only barely got there before the crash team assembled to meet us.\n\nThe foreman and four other mine workers accompanied us.  It had been a bit crowded in the ship but nobody complained.  \"How will they be?\" the foreman asked as the lead medical researcher followed her people into the clean operating room.\n\n\"This is a test for us,\" she replied.  \"The humans have given us powerful tools but we have never tried to use them before in such a dire situation.  Go have a drink for us.\"\n\nWhile the Prometheans had more than one of almost everything else, they only had the one coal mine; the other coal veins they had found were far dirtier and unappealing.  We went with the foreman to the local pub where we drank to the health of each of the injured, and to the success of the Promethean project.  In the morning we learned that two of the five injured workers had not made it, but that it was looking good for the other three.\n\n\"Can you take us back?\" the foreman asked us.  \"We have a lot of work to do.\"\n\n\"I think we left enough coal sitting on the ground to keep you shipping for at least a month,\" M said.\n\n\"Oh, that's a good thing too.  We need to make sure we understand what happened so we can prevent it before we start digging again.  Do your reference books have anything in them about this?\"\n\nThe Wikipedia entry on mine safety turned out to be a pretty good introduction for them.\n",

        "body": "Well, they have standard 8.5 inch √ó 11 inch i.e. 216√ó279 mm paper... and it probably lists on the side of the package how much one box of that paper weighs. Any errors in those values from their respective manufacturing processes is likely to be smaller than the accuracy the Prometheans can measure them by at the moment.\n\nAnd with temperature scales, both major systems do have known calibration points. Thermometers can come soon after glassblowing. Afaik both temperature scales assume the calibration experiments are done at Earth sea level pressure, but iirc you can measure air pressure with a glass tube with one closed end, a bowl, and a bunch of liquid mercury, and pretty much the only prerequisite measurement/unit scale you need is a length scale. 760mm of Mercury = 1 Earth atmosphere = a bit over 1013 mbars.\n\nHm, looking up the Mercury column thing, it also varies by local gravity, but that can be measured with a simple pendulum experiment, too.\n\nFor a time standard, the *Plausible Deniability* definitely has an internal clock they can use as the standard for the length of a second for now. And/or they can work out the length of a Promethean day in Earth seconds, and work out a conversion ratio to the relevant local customary units (or invent new units? Maybe decimalize it all?!).\n\nI was about to write that the fundamental unit for electric current might have to wait, but they actually already had galvanometers. And out of the base SI units, the only missing anymore is the candela, I think (for moles, you just need accurate weight measurements and chemical purification processes, I think?).",

I can smell it when I'm walking around outside usually, especially if I get a little sweaty. And I'm SO EMBARRASSED. If I can smell it then I'm sure others can. I often see other people smelling their hair, scarves or fingers when I'm around üò≠üò≠\n\nI really don't understand why. I wash my hair every other day and blow dry after. And by then end of the day it has that dirty, scalpy smell!! I'm nearing the end of a course of antifungal tablets ( to rule out a fungal infection). I've used clarifying shampoos, nizoral, 'dry scalp' shampoos and they haven't worked!! \n\nPLEASE HELP!! I'm too embarrassed to leave my house. Ps I have Afro hair that's currently in box braids. So I can't tell if my scalp gets greasy or not. But If I rub my fingers in my scalp the smell lingers for a bit. \n\nEDIT: I should have mentioned earlier but my doctor says I have seborrheic dermatitis. Which was really bad and thick when the problem started. BUt my scalp has been pretty much clear for the past few months (except for my hairline in some areas)\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you SO much for all your advice!!!! I really appreciate you guys taking the time to help me out. I've ordered Neutrogena T-gel for greasy hair and will vigorously blow dry my hair. The suggestions of using an essential oil like lavender and or tea tree will be my the next course of action if the t-gel doesn't work out, as well as seeing my doctor.  This is such a nice sub üòÑüòÑ I promise to update later this week xxx\n\n**Final edit: Its been a year and I still get occasional messages so I‚Äôd like to just update with what‚Äôs going on and help a fellow frustrated person who‚Äôs going through google now. My scalp doesn‚Äôt smell as long as I wash it regularly. So every 3 days ish for me. Too frequently or not frequently enough is not healthy. I use t-gel. The 2 in 1 sensitive one not the one with coal tar and leave it in for about 5 minutes while I give my scalp a good massage and usually wash my hair right after I‚Äôve worked out in the morning. Do this for a week and it should be gone. I used to have this white sticky ish thing that I could scrape off with my nails even after I washed my hair and I read somewhere that people who have dandruff/seb derm and have a biofilm of yeast which is my current theory as to why it happens. So good luck to anyone else struggling, once it‚Äôs washed off you just need to maintain**üíÅüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",

I know there is a phenomena where People can be much more aware of their own bodily odors than others. So keep in mind that what may seem terrible to you may just be because you are hyper aware of it. \n\nNow, some ideas. I'm wondering if there's a hormonal component to it. How old are you? And are you female or male? If you are still in or near puberty, this could be a body chemistry thing that you may grow out of.",

This does in fact help! I used Jason Natural Dandruff shampoo a few times and then once a week for maintenance for a while because of the sulfur content, not for dandruff. It really worked. Be forewarned that the Jason shampoo does smell like sulfur so you may want to give the rest of your hair (not scalp) a light washing with a different shampoo or conditioner after to get rid of the sulfur smell. It never bothered me though.\n\nI don't rhave the problem anymore, not sure why it mostly stopped. Sometimes it starts again if I don't wash my hair for a few days or use a different shampoo. I also have a theory it went away because I don't eat dairy of fried food anymore. Good luck and let me know if it works for you!",

Couple this with ANY form of compromised immune system (thyroid, HIV, diabetes, PCOS, lymphatic stuff) and all of that excess candida just travels free reign where, hormonally, your body is all 'wtf?!' and just does whatever it can to rid itself of it. \n\nYour body may have decided that secreting this junk through your scalp's hair follicles was the best method for doing this. \n\nThis is going to sound strange but bear with me...if you look really closely at your scalp and hair and your scalp is extra dry/flaky and your follicles look...plugged or clogged or whatever...then, throw on a set of gloves, section out your hair, and brush it from scalp to ends with...a flea comb (pref new). I know it sounds weird as hell but, i have some as yet unexplained skin thing which causes scalp/hair/keratin issues and i can assure you that you'd be surprised at the kind of little particles that come out on that comb. Obvs go gently over the scalp/roots but enough so you can get your hair follicles somewhat open by sloughing off some of the dead skin on your scalp. \n\nAfter that, I recommend using some kind of clarifying shampoo, rinse, then pour some Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar over your scalp/hair and massage in really good. The ACV helps to neutralize the ph levels in addition to other great benefits like being antibacterial. I would then use an all natural tea tree or antifungal shampoo and a light conditioner, trying to keep off scalp and only working through hair.\n\nYou may get little whiffs here and there if the ACV but it's really not that bad. Depending on how it works you can do it 1x/wk, gradually extending the time between usage.\n\nIdk...just my .o2 :)",

Water can get trapped in the braids too. The smell of the shampoo lingering means it might not be getting washed out completely (no the oil and bacteria isn't either). Is it possible to try a different style? Also you should be sure to treat the scalp condition. Coal tar shampoo smells horrible I know (I have to use it too). You could try selsum blue. Look on the back to make sure the active ingredient is sacyillic acid. Doesn't smell as bad and will help with that condition. Or, you can use a cleaning conditioner after the coal tar. Make sure your scalp isn't dry either. That could maintain any infection. Also make sure you (lightly) scrub your scalp to get any dead skin and buildup off.",

Marble will be placed near mountain ranges.\n\n* **Jade** is placed not too far inland along ancient or current convergent plate boundaries that occur or occurred along a coastline. They will be located on the steeper parts of drainage basins where erosion reveals the uplifted mineral. Was also used as stone age tools.\n\n* **Obsidian** is formed when water flows over volcanic lava to cool it rapidly. Placed near volcanic plate boundaries that no longer have large amounts of water. Water breaks down obsidian over time.\n\n* **Granite** is formed when molten rock is slowly cooled. It forms the bottom layer of all land continents. Placed along two land type convergent boundaries on the uplifted side where it is raised to the surface, making quarrying easy.\n\n* **Sandstone** is formed when sand is deposited in large quantities and under goes large amounts of pressure, heat, and drainage causing the sand and other minerals to \"cement\" together. Placed near ancient drainage basins that deposited sand from deserts or beaches, or alternatively where hills or mountains meet a dry desert.\n\n* **Clay** can be placed on hillsides, on lake and sea bottoms or on shores, and near volcanic hot spots that heat a water source.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Gems**  \n* **Agate** place near ancient volcanic flows that met active drainage basins.\n\n* **Amber** occurs in ancient pine type forests then carried by rivers and tides to deltas in coastal regions, where they were buried over time.\n\n* **Amethyst** can be placed where ancient lava would flow near an iron deposit.\n\n* **Aquamarine** normally found in the interiors of tectonic plates and located near Granite and contains a Tin - Tungsten deposit in the same water shed.\n\n* **Carnelian** normally located near ancient volcanic plate boundaries with iron deposits and then are washed down to river beds in current times\n\n* **Citrine** is formed by heat treating purple Amethyst or can be found where Amethyst has been naturally heat treated\n\n* **Coral** is normally found between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn (the equator to the lower and upper temperate zones) but can be farther out where warm currents flow out of tropics.\n\n* **Diamonds** will go in the middle of stable tectonic plates (near Nickel-Copper and PGE-Chromium, make them rare)\n\n* **Emeralds** almost the same as an Aquamarine but when a PGE-Chromium deposit is in the same water shed.\n\n* **Garnets** can be found in Granite but is also found where two tectonic plates converge.\n\n* **Jade** is placed not too far inland along ancient or current convergent plate boundaries that occur or occurred along a coastline.

Coal is from ancient wooded swamps, Jet is from wood material being washed into a body of water, becomes waterlogged, sinks and is covered by organic rich sediment.\n\n* **Lapis Lazuli** can be placed in high naked mountain valleys along plate boundaries and is somewhat rare. formed when underground magma contacts limestone.\n\n* **Obsidian** is formed when water flows over volcanic lava to cool it rapidly. Placed near volcanic plate boundaries that no longer have large amounts of water. Water breaks down obsidian over time.\n\n* **Onyx** is formed in the same way as Agates and can be placed in the same manner.\n\n* **Opals** are placed near or in sandstone deposits.\n\n* **Pearls** can form in any mollusk like creature in any body of water. \n\n* **Peridot/Olivine** is normally found around active lava flows near tectonic hot spots or where lava has fallen during a pyroclastic blast around an erupted volcano and cooled quickly.\n\n* **Rubies** are placed near convergent plates that has no iron but has trace amounts of Aluminium and Chromium.

This is a fantastic write-up, and I appreciate the sources.\n\nI'm currently working through finding out what kind of pigments will be more valuable in my setting, and while the Earth's history of pigments and dyes is useful, most of what I have found just covers *how* the ancients attained certain colors. Also, countless pages saying, *Did you know that purple was the most valuable color? Did you??*\n\nIn other words, other than the rarity of purple, I can't find solid info on how the pigments are valued compared to each other (yellow, blue, red; which one is more $?). So anyway, understanding the actual *placement* of the materials used will be invaluable to me.\n\n**I am very excited to have this. Thank you.**",

Well, except that he's a member of the Joestar family on account of Joseph ~~cheating on his wife~~. After meeting Jotaro, Josuke becomes aware that there are others who possess a stand, a physical manifestation of one's soul, and he begins using his own to rid the town of Morioh of several murderers that hide within.\n\nJosuke's stand is named [Crazy Diamond](http://imgur.com/a/1H89zTp), and it's a strong short range (about two meters) power type stand with a very versatile ability. Crazy Diamond's ability allows it to \"fix\" objects, allowing Josuke to heal wounds, fix broken objects, and much much more.\n\n*Note: All of Crazy Diamond's durability feats should apply to Josuke as well, as any damage a stand takes is reflected back onto the user.*\n\n# Relevant Threads for Scaling¬†\n- [Jotaro Kujo/Star

The neighborhood gets its name from the notoriously polluted 1.8 mile waterway that runs through the middle of it. \n\nBefore it was a canal it was a pristine meandering creek full of fish, beavers and foot long oysters. It was a natural defense during the Battle of Brooklyn allowing the American troops (those who could swim) to escape the larger British forces. \n\nThen, in the 1860s, the ironically named Brooklyn Improvement Company built the canal kicking off over a century of epic industrial pollution. At its peak, over 100 boats used the waterway which frequently had to be dredged due to the ‚Äúsandbars‚Äù of sewage that made passage impossible. \n\nWith the opening of the Gowanus expressway in the 1950s, trucks became the preferred method for transporting  goods in and out of the city and traffic on the canal fell dramatically. The advent of container shipping requiring larger, more modern ports made the shallow waters of the Gowanus wholly obsolete. \n\nWhen the EPA designated the Gowanus a Superfund site in 2010, the process of dredging the 10-foot-thick deposit of sediment at the bottom of the canal, colloquially known as Black Mayonnaise, began. \n\nWhether or not all the pollutants can ever be fully cleaned out is up for debate, but that hasn‚Äôt slowed down developers‚Äô efforts to make Gowanus the ‚ÄúVenice of Brooklyn.‚Äù\n\nThe area was rezoned in 2021. Despite findings of high levels of cancer-causing chemicals like trichloroethylene, the continued presence of coal tar in the soil, and strong community opposition, construction is underway on over 8,500 new apartments, including 3,000 units of affordable housing.\n\n \nTo read/see/hear more about the Gowanus, or other neighborhoods in NYC, you can subscribe to (or just read) my newsletter [here](https://theneighborhoods.substack.com/p/gowanus-brooklyn)",

But it seems too unreal that I had to post it as a separate thread:\n\nAccording to [this link](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/10/12/why-it-costs-you-2-million-a-mile-to-build-a-nj-road/17125069/), New Jersey spends $2 million a mile that is 8 times above average. That means, in the US, average road construction cost is $250,000 per mile. That's $156,250 per kilometer. \n\nIn INR, that's **Rs. 1.03 crore per kilometer**. \n\nAccording to [this link](http://www.businesstoday.in/magazine/focus/highways-to-prosperity/story/5111.html), the cost of building national highways in India is 8-9 crore per kilometer. Without land acquisition, it is **4-5 crore per km**\n\nEssentially, this means, cost of constructing a highway in India is 5 times that in the USA. This is despite cheaper labour. At the outset, it may seem that the cost of raw materials could be a reason.  But not so. The two important needs to construct a road are the jalli stones and coal tar. \n\nPrice of coal per ton in India (Aug 2015) : Rs. 3000 per ton  \nPrice of coal per ton in USA (Feb 2015) : $45 per ton (Rs. 2971 per ton)\n\nETA: The article in the link above is for 2010.

According to this, an 8000 km project is worth 1 lakh crore. That makes the cost of road construction at present day value = **Rs. 12.5 crore per kilometer**. Since the project \"was awarded\", I am assuming this does not include land acquisition costs. But even then, the cost is so fucking high",

Parts of the back of my head are extremely red, and parts are extremely flaky. One derm said it was definitely psoriasis, another derm said it was definitely seborrheic dermatitis, and a third derm said it was definitely sebo-psoriasis. That said, because none of those derms took a biopsy, my new GP referred me to another derm that will, so I'll be seeing her in the coming months.\n\nI've tried all the typical recommendations: OTC and Rx ketoconazole, sulfate/paraben free (disastrous), coal tar, t-sal, and Rx clobetasol (steroids). None really did much. My doctor suspects that whatever it is likely needs a very different treatment approach (she suspects a topical immunomodulator would be the best next step, but said the derm will know better than her, which makes sense).\n\nBut whenever I look for anything non-Rx to try to at least somewhat alleviate the flaking and pain and is specifically targeted towards people with dandruff, it has coconut oil. My understanding of coconut oil is that it is the correct fatty acid chain length to be an ideal food for the scalp yeast that causes seborrheic dermatitis to begin with, so... why? Just this morning I saw a product that had pyrithione zinc (standard seborrheic dermatotis treatment ingredient) AND coconut oil, and idk,maybe i'm missing slmething but I can't for the life of me understand why those two ingredients would be in the same product. Am I missing something?\n\nInterestingly, in my early 20s I was able to put straight coconut oil into my hair.

Sugar is their source of energy, but they also need fatty acids to build the cell membranes. They can make these themselves or get them from their environment. The fatty acids they use are mostly unsaturated long chain fatty acids though. Coconut oil contains mostly short to medium saturated fatty acids. Several studies have actually demonstrated that coconut oil actually has antifungal properties. Although coconut oil isn't strong enough to be considered an antifungal treatment on it's own, I doubt it would have negative effects on a topical fungal issue. You've probably heard warnings against using coconut oil because some people have tried to use it to treat vaginal yeast infections because of it's antifungal properties. This is a very different environment however so the coconut oil can end up making things worse. On topical fungal issues it shouldn't have that same negative effect. If anything I'd stay away from palm oil because it has high concentrations of palmitic acid that yeast do actually enjoy. I would also suggest seeing an allergist/immunologist instead of a dermatologist if possible. Both psoriasis and SD are technically immune system issues. All the symptoms caused by SD are actually your immune system's negative response to the fungi, not the fungi itself.",

I've had an oily, itchy scalp that starts to smell bad 12 hours after washing and always thought this was normal. I tried all sorts of things - tea tree oil shampoos, apple cider vinegar rinses, making sure my hair was dry before going to bed, and while I was living in the UK, Head and Shoulders. Nothing worked, scalp was always problematic.\n\nI moved to the US, and bought Head and Shoulders because it was the only shampoo available at my grocery store at the time. After about a week of use, I noticed my scalp wasn't as itchy and my hair didn't smell bad even after 24 hours and felt more voluminous. Turns out the US version of Head and Shoulders contains zinc pyrithione, and ingredient which is banned in the EU and UK. This ingredient is an antifungal and antimicrobial, perhaps that explains why my scalp doesn't smell anywhere near as bad now. I'm happy I've finally found something that works, is cheap and is easily available at most stores. I haven't tried other options like ketoconazole or coal tar and perhaps they would have worked. Also I'm not a H&S salesperson, just want to share what's worked for me.\n\nTldr: If you have an itchy smelly scalp, try a shampoo that contains zinc pyrithione. Head and Shoulders in the US contains this ingredient.",

    "body": "*(reposting since my daughter was fiddling with my phone and accidentally deleted my user flair which automatically removes a post - so sorry! she's at the age where her fingers are faster than mine lol)*\n\noriginal post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/OliveMUA/comments/1dcn3to/some\\_insights\\_on\\_mauve/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OliveMUA/comments/1dcn3to/some_insights_on_mauve/)\n\nHeya - I dug up some data on mauve shades in blush, lipstick, lipgloss and lipliners after coming across complaints in this group and¬†r/MakeupAddiction about mauves being mostly peachy/orange.\n\nMauve was created by accident by 19-year old William Perkin from London, who was dabbling in his home lab with coal tar to come up with a treatment for malaria. He made a mess, tried cleaning it up with alcohol, but instead created mauve. He named it after the french word for the mallow flower, ‚Äòmalva‚Äô.¬†[This flower is purple.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Malva-sylvestris-20070430-1.jpg)\n\n[mauve was named after this 'malva' flower but note that there are variations in color of this flower](https://preview.redd.it/s77vlib53y5d1.png?width=1116&format=png&auto=webp&s=e85aac6503b09498e3a0ceec77c7dfdd0f431085)\n\n1. Here's a full list of those mauves (with most links to view swatches/images) -->¬†[see here](https://app.glossa.me/products/mauve?tab=products).\n2. Mauves that appear to be super warm (i.e. peachy) come from these brands: 100% pure, colourpop, estee lauder, half caked, kylie cosmetics, winky lux\n3. Mauve isn't a super popular shade among lippies and blushes. It represents 3-4% of the shades in each category but that doesn't mean there's plenty of options lol\n4. For products whose shades are 'mauve' but don't include mauve in the shade description, mauve is described as a cool rose, dusty rose, or rose nude so brands see a connection between mauve and rose.\n5. There are some products that are described as mauve by retailers but not by the brands. Kulfi's mehndi moment cream blush in ‚Äúsandalwood swirls‚Äù is¬†labeled by Sephora¬†as a '[neutral mauve](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2d43de3-4723-41aa-96c6-91c9c1af62bd_2610x1074.png),' whereas¬†[Kulfi describes it as a 'rosy brown,'](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93d068c4-6e8b-4e4f-a493-e37dc2eb1cf4_2742x1612.png)¬†which seems more accurate to me. Sephora also described Milk Makeup‚Äôs lip + cheek cream blush stick in the shade ‚Äòrally‚Äô as a ‚Äúmauve with shimmer‚Äù, while Milk Makeup calls it a ‚Äúmauve pink shimmer.‚Äù So also best to double check how brands describe their shades. (Edit: i agree with¬†[lilbabyeggplant](https://www.reddit.com/user/lilbabyeggplant/)¬†that rally looks like a cool pink, not a mauve!).\n\nP.S. i tried adding a bunch of photos showing different kind of mauves (true, cool, dusty, warm) but not sure if they attached so here's a link to a PDF of those images:¬†[link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F2HqEFJx_GI2N61zOBDPiS8tOXpfKncG/view?usp=sharing).\n\n**For y'all**: Is there a color you'd like analyzed next? I'm really curious about peach myself so was going to dig up data on that. I received suggestions for lilac, burgundy vs wine, and terracotta vs. rust.\n\n[sampling of mauves](https://preview.redd.it/d1qdc0r63y5d1.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&s=85f1a86432a55d467329bc368f8d038134650944)",

For blush, Rare Beauty liquid blush in Believe is a true mauve and it is beautiful, and I also like Fenty's cream blush in RiRi.

Since it alters your body's chemistry, a doctor should:\n\n* Assess if it‚Äôs safe based on your medical history\n* Decide the right **dose** and **form** (oral vs. topical)\n* Monitor side effects and hormone balance\n\n# ‚úÖ Is Low-Dose Finasteride (1 mg/day) Safe?\n\nYes, **low-dose Finasteride (1 mg/day)** is considered **relatively safe for most healthy adult men**, especially under medical guidance. In fact, this is the **standard dose** used to treat androgenetic alopecia (male pattern baldness).\n\nBut even low doses **can have side effects**‚Äîthough not everyone experiences them.\n\n# ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Side Effects (in 1‚Äì10% of users)\n\n* Low libido (reduced sexual desire)\n* Erectile dysfunction\n* Reduced semen volume\n* Breast tenderness or enlargement\n* Depression or mood changes\n\nThese are often **mild and reversible** if the drug is stopped.\n\n# ‚ö†Ô∏è Rare but Serious Risks\n\n* **Post-Finasteride Syndrome (PFS)** ‚Äì Persistent sexual, neurological, or psychological symptoms after stopping (very rare, still debated)\n* Gynecomastia (male breast growth)\n* Severe depression or anxiety (in rare cases)\n\n# üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Who Should Avoid Finasteride Without Supervision\n\n* People with **liver issues**\n* History of **depression or sexual dysfunction**\n* **Those planning to conceive soon** (Finasteride may affect sperm in rare cases)\n* **Women and children** (especially pregnant women)\n\n# üîç Monitoring Required If You Take It\n\n* **DHT levels** (optional, but helpful)\n* **Liver function tests**\n* **Prostate exam** (PSA levels can be falsely lowered)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n#

        "body": "Errors in your guide which even ChatGPT cannot correct. Hence why you should not use it as a personal doctor. Allow me to correct it from using what is proven and in accordance with my knowledge. \n\nA) In section 1. Types of Hair problems. The root cause of both hairloss, hair thinning, breakage and Density is all causes by DHT. DHT is a useless harmone in adults which is converted from testosterone (good harmone) with an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase (5AR). So all those problems are solved by Finasteride which is 5AR1 inhibitor.\nRegarding scalp with dandruff and flaking problem - 1% ketoconazole is enough. \nAnd that is all \n\nReferences:\n\n1) Shin J, Chung E, Kim M, Kim T, Kim W, Huh C. Evaluation of long‚Äêterm efficacy of finasteride in Korean men with androgenetic alopecia using the basic and specific classification system. J Dermatol. 2019;46(2):139-143. doi:10.1111/1346-8138.14719\n\n2) Yanagisawa M, Fujimaki H, Takeda A, Nemoto M, Sugimoto T, Sato A.

Journal of Dermatological Treatment. 2022;33(4):1938-1946. doi:10.1080/09546634.2021.1959506\n\nAnd here you go. This is all you need to solve all the problems mentioned in section 1. \n\nB) Bloodflow Theory - This theory stated a century ago that bludflow restriction caused by wearing tight hats and creating tension in scalp is the reason for male pattern baldness. this theory has been overused till this day to sell Nonsense products. This theory has been debunked over century ago (1916) by Dorothy Osborn. \n\nReferences : \n1) Osborn D. INHERITANCE OF BALDNESS. Journal of Heredity. 1916;7(8):347-355. doi:10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a110746\n\n2) Nor does wearing Hats or Helmets cause any damage to hair. Here is the study : \nTellez-Segura R. Involvement of Mechanical Stress in Androgenetic Alopecia. Int J Trichology. 2015;7(3):95-99. doi:10.4103/0974-7753.167468 \n\n3) Shoemaker JK, Tiidus PM, Mader R. Failure of manual massage to alter limb blood flow: measures by Doppler ultrasound. Med Sci Sports Exerc. 1997;29(5):610-614. doi:10.1097/00005768-199705000-00004\n\nConclusion : Never drive bike without Helmet and caps when going out in sun without any worries of Bludflow. \n\nC) Supplements are called supplements because they are not FDA approved. When it is not FDA approved, companies can put anything in it without having to disclose the proper composition. So it's best to avoid them or take FDA approved vitamins. Imo just finasteride is enough to solve all hairloss problems. \n\nD) Microneedling does not work as a standalone treatment nor is it safe as a long term usage. it is observed in 3 studies that Microneedling combined with  topical 5%minoxidil has more efficacy than just standalone microneedling and topical minoxidil. This is because the efficacy of minoxidil increases due to channels in epidermis caused by microneedling. \nThere is no standardized protocol for microneedling, so anyone can just dismiss the ineffectiveness of microneedling using No-true Scotsman falacy even when there is compelling evidence to prove otherwise. \nBasically Microneedling is causing inflammation in the scalp and in long term it will become chronic inflammation. Ultimately creating Scar tissue in scalp resulting in a similar situation to what androgenetic alopecia does to scalp. \nI.e back to square one.\nApplying Tretinoin is better than microneedling along with minoxidil to give maximum benefits to hair growth.\n\nReferences: \n1) Chronic inflammation in the etiology of disease across the life span\nDavid Furman et al. Nat Med. 2019 Dec.\n\n2) Unusual Presentation of Tinea Corporis Associated With the Use of a Microneedling Device\nN√©lia Margarida Martins da Cunha et al. Aesthet Surg J. 2017.\n\nE) Stop using oils if your scalp is already oily. Adding more oils will not benifit in any way. It may even create more grounds for fungal infections.",

        "body": "Please for the love of Hairs, stop asking GPT and Reddit on hair care routine. It never ends well. Consult a proper Dermat (not someone who says to rub oil) and monitor your scalp condition. \n\nWhat has worked for me : \n1. 1mg finasteride orally per day keeps the hair transplant doctor away. ( Only Finasteride/Dutasteride will cure your hairfall issue which is caused by DHT- a useless harmone in adults (useful until puberty passes). \n\n2. Ketoconazole %1 shampoo (%1 is already most effective and strong. Using 2% is overkill unless you suffer from severe case of seborrheic dermatitis. I use it once or twice a week.\n\n3. Never needed topical Minoxidil but it helps only in compliment with Finasteride. Never used minoxidil alone as it does not solve the hairloss issue.\n\n4. I use Tresemme sulphate free shampoo + conditioner for regular use. \n\n5. When I don't use conditioner, I use Kraves wax for styling along with a cold air blower.(Only occasionally)\n\n6. I don't use any oils because my scalp is oily. Applying more will worsen the dandruff problem. \n\n\nThings to Note : \n1. No other serum works unless it does have proper clinical trials and meta analysis studies on it.\n\n2. Never fall for all natural and organic scams. They do not work. be skeptical. Never be blinded by a brand and Fake doctors who claim ridiculous 'CURES'. They do so because people fear drugs and they don't have any evidence or proof of the efficacy. \n\n3. Depending on food and diet as your only way to fight the Slap head curse is a bad idea. Food is food not a medicine. Just because our ancestors used it, does not mean it's good. Our ancestors did not have knowledge nor the protocols for developing cures and conducting clinical trials. \nThe most heinous diseases like TB black death, Hairloss etc have been cured by Pharmaceuticals. So don't fear drugs.\n\n4. DON'T use microneedling. It will cause scar tissue in your scalp which will permanently remove any chance of you growing new hair in that area.\n\n5. Exercise is a must. Never skip a leg day.",

    "body": "\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis article presents a comprehensive, patient-driven investigation into the efficacy of various topical agents in managing scalp psoriasis symptoms over a three-year period. Unlike traditional brand comparisons, the analysis isolates specific active ingredients found in over-the-counter and clinical treatments, assessing their impact through systematic self-experimentation. Key compounds evaluated include salicylic acid, zinc pyrithione, coal tar, selenium sulfide, piroctone olamine, tea tree oil, pine tar, bisabolol, and ketoconazole. The findings suggest that while many mainstream treatments offer limited or purely symptomatic relief, a combination of 1% salicylic acid and 1% selenium sulfide provided a near-complete remission without adverse effects. The study also highlights the efficacy of zinc pyrithione and salicylic acid‚Äîdespite their underrepresentation in psoriasis-specific treatment literature‚Äîand raises questions about overlooked ingredients that may offer genuine therapeutic benefit.\n\n\n\nIntroduction:\n\nI am a guy who has suffered from scalp psoriasis since my teenage years. For most of that time, I relied on coal tar shampoo, but in the past two to three years, I‚Äôve conducted extensive self-experimentation driven by personal frustration and informed by scientific literature. I undertook this journey with a goal: to isolate which specific chemicals‚Äînot brands‚Äîactually alleviate symptoms of psoriasis. Having read many peer-reviewed articles and product studies over the years, I focused strictly on ingredients featured in scientific research, avoiding anecdotal claims and brand biases. This self-experimentation was documented carefully to avoid confounding variables, aiming to provide clarity for others who may feel unheard or misinformed about their treatment options.\n\n\n\nMethodology:\n\nEach treatment was tested in chronological order. I maintained consistent hair care routines and avoided introducing multiple new ingredients simultaneously, ensuring any effects could be attributed to the active compound in question. Products were selected based on scientific literature or suggested efficacy in treating similar dermatological conditions like seborrheic dermatitis. Observations were made over a period of several weeks per compound, and effects were noted regarding itch relief, flake reduction, hair/scalp health, and need for adjunctive care like conditioner.\n\n\n\nFindings and Analysis:\n\n-2% Ketoconazole: Provided no noticeable improvement in symptoms.\n\n-0.5% to 1% Coal Tar: Relieved painful itching and significantly reduced dandruff and flaking, but some remained.\n\n-3% Salicylic Acid: Eliminated flakes and fully cleared symptoms.\n\n-1% Zinc Pyrithione: Cleared all symptoms and left hair smooth, but caused hair thinning.\n\n-Tea Tree Oil (approx. % unknown): Reduced flakes and psoriasis, but damaged follicles and increased itch without conditioner.\n\n-1% Selenium Sulfide: Marginally reduced symptoms but did not eliminate pain, itch, or flaking.\n\n-1% Piroctone Olamine: Slightly more effective than selenium sulfide but also mostly symptomatic.\n\n-1% Salicylic Acid + 1% Selenium Sulfide Combo: Fully effective; no symptoms, no hair damage, and no need for conditioner. This combination was found specifically in the Vichy Dercos Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, which also contains several other compounds that may have contributed to its superior effectiveness. Among them is tocopheryl acetate (Vitamin E), a known antioxidant which may also contribute anti-inflammatory effects. Additionally, menthol is included, which I also noted helps prevent itchiness. The synergy of these ingredients may enhance its therapeutic profile.\n\n-Pine Tar (with Tea Tree Oil): Moderately effective, slightly better than tea tree oil alone, but difficult to isolate effects.\n\nSpecial Mentions:\n\n-Menthol: Provides significant itch relief and improves comfort.\n\n-Conditioner: Helps prevent scalp dryness, which can reduce flaking and itching when used with active treatments.\n\n-Vitamin E (Tocopheryl Acetate): Acts as an antioxidant that protects scalp cells from oxidative stress and may offer additional anti-inflammatory support, potentially enhancing treatment effectiveness.\n\nPromising Untested Compounds:\n\n-Bisabolol: Not formally tested in this self-experimentation, but theorized to have potential due to its anti-inflammatory properties and scientific support in dermatological contexts.\n\n-Urea: Also untested directly in this study, but research shows highly promising effects in reducing scaling and inflammation in psoriasis, making it a strong candidate for future trials.\n\n\n\nDiscussion:\n\nThe results show a pattern of strong efficacy from salicylic acid and zinc pyrithione‚Äîboth of which are rarely promoted as psoriasis treatments compared to coal tar. Coal tar and pine tar, although effective for itch, were less helpful in controlling flaking. Selenium sulfide and piroctone olamine offered symptomatic relief but no long-term benefit, suggesting their mechanism is more palliative than curative. Tea tree oil offered temporary improvements but presented drawbacks in hair follicle health. The combination of 1% salicylic acid with 1% selenium sulfide emerged as the most balanced and complete solution. Interestingly, ketoconazole, though widely recommended for scalp issues, had no effect on psoriasis, aligning with clinical skepticism about its use beyond fungal conditions. This study underscores the need for more ingredient-focused guidance in over-the-counter psoriasis treatments and suggests that compounds like salicylic acid, zinc pyrithione, and possibly bisabolol, urea, and pine tar deserve more clinical attention.\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThrough persistent, controlled self-experimentation over three years, I found that the most effective treatments for scalp psoriasis were not always the ones most commonly advertised. The best results came from 3% salicylic acid and 1% zinc pyrithione individually, and even more so from a combined 1% salicylic acid and 1% selenium sulfide formula. This formula, found in Vichy Dercos, also contained tocopheryl acetate (Vitamin E) and menthol, which likely contributed to its effectiveness by reducing inflammation and itchiness. These findings could serve as the basis for future controlled studies and provide a roadmap for other sufferers navigating treatment options.\n\n\n\nScientific References:\n\nSalicylic Acid: Lebwohl, 1999\n\nZinc Pyrithione: Kruglova et al., 2024\n\nCoal Tar: Slutsky et al., 2010\n\nSelenium Sulfide: van de Kerkhof & Franssen, 2001\n\nPiroctone Olamine: Lod√©n & Wessman, 2000\n\nTea Tree Oil: Summary\n\nPine Tar: Rachev et al., 2003\n\nBisabolol: Search\n\nUrea: Rachev et al., 2003\n\nMenthol: Prunel et al., 2012\n\nVitamin E: Cruz, 2013\n\nKetoconazole: Alford et al., 1986",

    "body": "Hi everyone!\n\nSo I'm not a mod, but I've seen quite a few posts floating around the sub asking questions about black henna / chemical henna and I just thought I'd pull some of my answers together in a single post and hopefully clear up some common misconceptions.\n\n(MODS: If this isn't appropriate, please let me know.)\n\nFirstly (and most importantly) **I am not a healthcare professional**. I am a henna artist who has been working with henna on and off for the last 10 years. As a general rule for life: please don't ever take any advice off an internet stranger without speaking to a healthcare professional to verify what you've found. Everything I'm sharing is based off my personal experience and research, and I certainly don't claim to be an expert on the subject.\n\nLet's dive in!\n\n# Key Points\n\nHenna is always brown. If it's not brown, it's not henna.\n\nHenna always takes 24-48 hours to develop its final colour. If it promises instant colour, it's not henna.\n\nHenna is like food. It needs to be used or frozen. If you see it on sale sitting on a shelf, it's not henna.\n\n# I got chemical \"henna\", what should I do?\n\n*I've put this towards the top because this is probably the most common reason why people are looking at this post.*\n\nFirst things first: get the paste off your skin as soon as possible.\n\nIf you've had a chemical paste on your skin, you've now been exposed and your skin and body may develop a sensitivity towards one or more of the chemicals used in the paste. This sensitivity could stay with you for the rest of your life.\n\nAs soon as you can, see your healthcare professional (GP, family doctor, or other medical person who will have access to and will be able to update your medical records). Tell them that you've been exposed to chemical 'henna'. If you're able to take any evidence with you (a sample of the paste, or one of the cones) this may be helpful. You may need to specifically mention the risk of PPD or aromatic amine (black coal tar dye), and you may wish to ask that your exposure be noted on your medical records.\n\nThe first 48 hours are vital, however don't assume that you're safe just because you haven't had an immediate reaction.   [According to this article, patients without previous exposure to black henna can take up to 14 days to display signs of an allergic reaction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5385600/). It also goes on to say that some reactions may appear 45 days following the application. (You may want to share that article with your healthcare professional if they are unaware of the risks of black henna and/or PPD).\n\nIn the short-term, keep a close eye both on the area where you had the black \"henna\" and also your body in general. Be aware of any new sensations like redness, itching or tingling or just anything that doesn't feel right. Go with your gut on this one. Over-the-counter antihistamines may be able to help in a real pinch, but wherever possible **always** speak to a healthcare professional before taking any kind of medication.\n\nPPD (and other solvents and chemical preservatives) can remain within your body for years, and can cause increased sensitivity to a number of things including over-the-counter and professional hair dyes. If at any point in the future you are considering dying your hair, please ensure that you do a full patch test (or ask your salon stylist to do a patch test, even if they've dyed your hair for you before). Allergic reactions can be triggered by repeat exposure, so even if you dye your hair after now and don't have a reaction, you're unfortunately never completely out of the woods.\n\n# Identifying Chemical \"Henna\"\n\nChemical \"henna\" pastes use unsafe chemicals to extend the shelf-life of the paste and create unnatural stain colours such as red, green, blue, pink or - the most common culprit - black. Black henna is particularly dangerous, as it is most commonly mixed with a chemical called paraphenylenediamine (\"PPD\"). When used in black \"henna\", the PPD levels are dangerously high and can cause dangerous reactions.\n\nHenna paste is like food; once it's made you have a small window of 24-48 hours in which you need to use it or freeze it. If you freeze henna paste, it will retain its staining power usually for around 6 months. Freezing does not stop the deterioration process, it merely slows it down. Putting your henna in the fridge can also slow this process slightly, but it can cause issues with the essential oils in the mix, so it's often not recommended.\n\nIn addition to offering a range of unnatural colours, chemical pastes will also use a combination of solvents and preservatives to make the paste \"shelf-stable\", meaning that it can be left on a corner store shelf. Natural henna paste cannot survive this, and it will lose its staining power after 24-48 hours.\n\nSo how can you identify chemical paste? There are a few telltale signs:\n\n**CHECK THE CONE**\n\nChemical henna cones are often brightly coloured and branded. They are usually sold in boxes and can be found in corner stores, family stores and online (Amazon and eBay sell a variety of chemical pastes marked as \"henna\", as do other notable retailers).\n\n**CHECK THE NAME**\n\nMost chemical pastes are sold under one or more brand names. These include:\n\n* Golecha\n* Kaveri\n* Neha\n* Prem Dulhan\n* Chandni\n\nMost of these products will be labelled as \"natural henna\", \"herbal henna\", \"henna product\", \"product of India\" and - most worryingly - \"No dangerous chemicals!\". Henna is not currently regulated like food or cosmetic products, so currently there is nobody to stop these companies from deliberately misleading customers.\n\n**CHECK THE SMELL**\n\nHenna should have a natural, earthy smell with distinct natural oils such as lavender, cajeput, eucalyptus or tea trea. Chemical paste smells, well, *chemical*. It will be harsh, sharp and unpleasant.\n\n**CHECK THE DATE**\n\nAs mentioned above, chemical preservatives are added to chemical pastes to make them last longer. Natural henna must be used or frozen with 24-48 hours of dye release. If left at room temperature, the quality of the henna will decline very quickly.\n\n**CHECK THE COLOUR & STAIN**\n\nNatural henna paste will always appear as a brown or greenish-brown paste when applied. It will dry as a dark brown paste that sits on top of the skin and will crumble away like piped icing. Once removed, the initial stain will be orange at first and will darken to a shade of brown over 24-48 hours. Chemical pastes often stains instantly and in a wide range of unnatural colours.\n\n**CHECK THE INGREDIENTS**\n\nNatural henna paste is made from 4 main parts:\n\n* Henna powder (dried leaves from the *lawsonia inermis* plant)\n* Essential Oil (cajeput, eucalyptus, tea tree or lavender are the most common)\n* Sugar (for consistency and to help keep the paste from cracking as it dries)\n* A mixing liquid (usually water or lemon juice; some artists like to use tea, coffee or other citrus juices)\n\nIf you can't find the ingredients, or if an artist or supplier won't tell you the ingredients, walk away. It's better to be safe than sorry.\n\n# How long will it last? How do I get it off?\n\nThis is a hard one to answer, and it will completely depend on how the chemical paste has been made. The short answer is that your skin cells have been stained, and the stain will fade as either the dye or your skin naturally wears away.\n\nMy understanding is that the stain from a chemical paste often comes from a dye molecule which could be henna-based or could be completely synthetic. The best answer I can give is that the stain will come out after all of the stained skin cells have worn away, which will happen naturally. You can speed up the process slightly with gentle exfoliation, but please don't try and scrub the stain away. The skin in this area will now be sensitive, and scrubbing too hard could cause further damage. A gentle exfoliate like a light body scrub with a soft loofah and gentle circles is the best thing I can recommend.\n\n# Cross-contamination after staining\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, once the chemical paste has been removed and the area has been washed, there should be no further contaminants on the surface of the skin. However, I've not currently been able to find a definitive answer either way. I would always err on the side of caution, even if it's only for your own peace of mind. If your exposure to chemical paste was on the hands or fingers, take extra care to wash your hands before eating or drinking and try to avoid touching your eyes.\n\n# The artist/supplier told me it was natural henna...\n\nAs above, there is nothing to stop chemical paste manufacturers from labelling their product as natural henna. And technically, they're not wrong - the ingredients in their paste are natural. You wanna know what else is natural? Cyanide. Arsenic. Snake venom. Natural does not equal safe.\n\nThis is especially common in tourist trap areas where locals are trying to make a quick buck off unsuspecting tourists. Sourcing, mixing and storing henna is a time-consuming process, and if the henna doesn't get used then it's a wasted investment. Chemical paste is cheaper and lasts longer, and often satisfies the needs of impatient tourists who don't want to wait for a natural stain to develop. Those headline henna horror stories you see about someone who got a scar from 'henna'? I've yet to come across one which wasn't some con-artist in a tourist trap looking to take advantage.\n\n# Is it ever safe to buy henna online?\n\nYes! Go direct to an experienced henna artist. Try searching online (or tag me in a comment below with your country/state/region and I'll see if I can help you find someone). Going to a henna artist means that you're getting a cone or batch of their henna paste which they have made. This means that they should be able to tell you the ingredients. The pre-mixed paste will likely be delivered in hand-rolled cellophane cones, and any branding will be the henna artist's own label (often added as a sticker to the sealed cone). The paste will likely be sent with next day delivery and the artist/supplier should tell you to use or freeze the cones within 24-48 hours after delivery.\n\nIf the artist won't tell you their ingredients, or if the cones don't look like they could have been made in someone's kitchen, then it's time to look for another supplier.\n\n# What are some safe alternatives to henna?\n\nHenna is not the only way to safely adorn your body with temporary art. Here are some alternatives that you might want to look at:\n\n**INDIGO / WOAD** \\- a traditional Celtic/Pagan dye made from plants which leaves a navy/blue stain.\n\n**JAGUA** \\- this creates a navy/black stain. This is a fruit extract which has recently gained some traction. People tend to be more sensitive to Jagua than other staining methods, and sensitivities can develop rapidly with repeat use\n\n**WHITE HENNA** \\- not actually a staining agent! Also known as \"henna glam\", \"shimmer henna\", \"moon mehndi\", \"mica mehndi\". This is a cosmetic or medical-grade glue/adhesive which is applied to the skin like henna, often using a hand rolled cone or a jacquard bottle with a plastic or metal nib. Once the glue is tacky/almost dry the area is dusted with a cosmetic pigment or mica powder which sticks to the glue. Other methods include mixing the pigment with the glue prior to application. This leaves a raised design that sits on top of the skin (rather than staining the skin underneath) and disappears in 1-2 days. Gaining popularity for western weddings and proms as an alternative to jewellery.\n\n**TEMPORARY TATTOO INKS** \\- does what it says on the tin. These are often applied with paint brushes or airbrush guns and sit on top of the skin. Some can stay on the skin for days whilst some will wash away like make-up.\n\n# Where can I get more information?\n\nWhether or not you've come in to contact with chemical \"henna\", you are absolutely encouraged to do your own research Here are some handy links that I've found:\n\n[NHS UK - Dangers of Black Henna](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/black-henna-neutral-henna-ppd-dangers/)\n\n[FDA - Temporary Tattoos, Henna/Mehndi, and \"Black Henna\": Fact Sheet](https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetic-products/temporary-tattoos-hennamehndi-and-black-henna-fact-sheet)\n\n[The Henna Page - Is Henna Safe?](http://www.hennapage.com/henna/warnings.html)\n\n# How does henna work?\n\nHenna works because there is a dye molecule in the henna plant (*lawsonia inermis*) which reacts with the chemicals in your skin (predominantly keratin). When the henna plant is made into a paste, it is mixed with an essential oil which helps to extract and maximise the dye molecules readily available. When the paste is applied to the skin, the dye molecules move from the paste to the skin where they bind with the skin cells. This works from the top down - the dye stains the topmost cells first, and once that layer is saturated it starts to stain the cells underneath, working through the layers of skin.\n\nThis process takes time. This is why most henna artists will recommend leaving paste on the skin for at least 4 hours (although half an hour will get a 'good enough' stain that should last around a week for most people). The more skin cells the dye molecule can reach, the darker the stain will be and the longer it will last.\n\nWhen the paste is first removed, the stain is orange. The stain now needs to go through its second stage - it needs to react with the oxygen in the air to develop its final colour (it needs to oxidise). After paste removal, the stain will take 24-48 hours to fully oxidise and reveal its final colour, which will be a shade of brown. The colour of the final stain will vary depending on the chemical composition of a person's skin, the aftercare routine (keeping it warm, away from water, able to breathe etc.), and will also experience some variation based on what the henna was mixed with and also the yield of the crop that the henna powder came from in the first place. It will also vary depending where on the body it was applied. Hands and fingers have lots of thin layers of skin, meaning that the dye molecule has lots of skin cells to stain. On the other hand (no pun intended), the upper arm, back, shoulders etc. have fewer layers of thicker skin. This is why a stain on the palms and fingers will always look darker than a stain on the upper arm or back.\n\nSome people's skin is very receptive to henna, and it is possible to see palm and finger stains that can look almost black (especially once photographic filters have been applied over the top to enhance the picture). This is often the result of a great henna crop to make the powder, a skilled artist's henna paste mix, and a diligent customer who has cared well for their stain after the paste was removed.\n\n(So when I said above that *henna is always brown*, no two stain colours are identical because of all these factors above. The main things to remember are that henna will never be black/red/green/blue/purple, and it will always need time to develop its final colour.)\n\n# Any questions?\n\nThis isn't by any means an exhaustive document containing everything you need to know about natural henna and chemical \"pastes\", but hopefully it's helped to clear up some misconceptions and confusions about the two.\n\nIf you have any questions, comment below or drop me a DM and I'll do what I can to help.",

Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ld6u66nl9XEh8I3Xp8ZHQMkpYSWi_rXpHBxgIQ7-kB4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nWhen testing I used a character with 99 in both Int and Fth. For melee damage I used different resins on a +10 Old Knight Hammer 2HR1. For spells I used Great Heavy Soul Arrow, Great Lightning Spear and Dark Orb from a +0 Black Witch Staff and Fireball from a +10 Pyromancy Flame. Varangian Sailors in No Man's Wharf are used as a baseline because they have 0 resistance to every type of elemental damage.\n\nRed phantom versions of enemies have the same resistances as their normal versions.\n\nIn the base game there are really only 8 resistance tiers before other modifiers are applied:\n\n* 0% - Varangian weak. No other enemies have 0 resistance without outside help.\n* 10% - Super Weak.\n* 15% - Weak.\n* 30% - Average.\n* 50% - Strong.\n* 70% - Super Strong.\n* 85% - Don't even bother.\n* 100% - Immune. Only Salamanders are in this tier without outside help.\n\nOnce you get into DLCs and enemies added with Scholar, things get a lot messier.\n\nWith a few exceptions (which are listed) enemies of the same type will always have the same elemental resistances no matter where they are encountered in the game. There are also a number of environmental factors and situational modifiers that can affect resistances.\n\nThe simplest and most common is water. Even if you so much as step in a puddle it adds 30% fire resistance and removes 15% lightning resist. This directly modifies normal resistance, so for instance Bowman Guthry has 30% resist across the board, but in Doors of Pharros since she invades in water her lightning resist drops to 15% and fire resist raises to 60%. Another example are the Enhanced Undead in Sinner's Rise. They normally have 70% resistance across the board, but in water they have 'only' 55% lightning resistance and are completely immune to fire.\n\nThe second most common type of specialized resistance is DLC resistance. Every enemy in the DLCs including bosses but excluding Drakeblood Knights for some reason takes greatly reduced elemental damage from spells and arrows. There are also a fair number of enemies in the base game that have it too. Crystal Lizards, Forest Guardians, Razorback Nightcrawlers, Corrosive Egg Crawlers, the pyromancers by the Altar of Amana, Insolent Phantoms, the glowing Dragon Knight, and every NPC invader added in the Scholar of the First Sin edition like Forlorn and Armorer Dennis. The damage reduction isn't uniform across the board for some reason. I assume there was a lot of analysis and testing that went into the decision, but from my end it just looks like random numbers. The short version is that compared to their melee elemental resist, enemies with DLC resistance will take half or less damage from spells. Lightning is hit the hardest because of course it is.\n\nBase game bosses (excluding the Prowling Magus and Royal Rat Vanguard) also take reduced damage from ranged elemental attacks. In this case it's a much more uniform 15% reduction, applied after normal resistance. This means that a boss with 0% melee resistance would have 15% spell resistance and one with 50% melee resist would have 57.5% spell resist. I assume this was added as part of the Great Spell Nerf back in the day.\n\nIn the Iron Keep invaders all gain a huge amount of fire resistance compared to normal. This also applies to the turtle bro phantom by Eygil's Idol, but not to red phantom versions of normal enemies. It doesn't affect the Bellkeeper invader or Mad Warrior so the effect seems to be restricted to the Iron Keep proper.\n\nWall Ghosts, Leydia Pyromancers, Witchtrees, and Darklurker have something I call Ghost Resistance. They take half damage from melee attacks, including elemental damage on weapons, but normal damage from spells. Except that Darklurker and the Witchtrees in Eleum Loyce have Boss Resistance and DLC Resistance on top of that, meaning they resist spells as well.\n\nWitchtrees with chime arms are capable of casting Great Magic Barrier, adding 25% to their normal resistances. Luckily there's only 2 of them in the game.\n\nVelstadt's phase 2 buff reduces all damage by 40%.\n\nAshen idols can give Ashen Warriors a buff that reduces all damage by 50%.\n\nAldia's flame buff reduces damage by about 70%.",

    "body": "Scroll for tl;dr. \n\nI was researching natural remedies online and came across a post about using apple cider vinegar to help with dandruff.\n\nMy head has been itchy and flakey for what feels like years. I use coal tar shampoo which stopped working ages ago. I was totally fed up and embarrassed of the dandruff falling out and past my face as I was talking to people! \n\nSo I thought I would try it and see. 1/4 cup of ACV to 1 cup of water in a spray bottle. Conduct a patch test to check you aren't sensitive! If all is OK, part your hair in sections and spray directly onto the scalp, targeting any problem areas in particular. Massage in with your fingertips and leave in for an hour. Wash and dry your hair as normal.\n\nWhen I dried my hair, I checked my scalp in the mirror and I couldn't believe it that I was completely flake free! My hair was shiny and soft also, with no trace of vinegar. It's now been three days and there are still no flakes. \n\nI'm sharing this as I hope it can help others. I don't know whether using ACV has been discussed here before, but I just wanted to share that it definitely worked for me. \n\n**Tl;dr:**\n\n- 1/4 cup of ACV in 1 cup of water, add to spray bottle. \n\n- Conduct patch test. If OK, part hair in sections, apply solution to scalp and massage in. Leave for 1hr.\n\n- Wash and dry your hair as normal (i.e. shampoo and condition).\n \n- Use the solution before each hair wash until your dandruff is under control, then apply periodically if/when you notice it's coming back. \n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n4y update:\n\nACV still works for me but won't work for everyone. The best advice I have is to try it and see if it helps. \n\nI still intermittently get dandruff, particularly during periods of high stress. I keep an ACV mix in my bathroom cabinet and apply as needed. Even now my dandruff is nowhere near as bad as it was before I started using ACV. \n\nGood luck!",

I did a patch test with a 50/50 solution and responded well so I decided to go apply it to my entire scalp region.\n\nI get bad eczema on my face too (namely around my nose and eyebrows) and thought I would apply the solution there too. \n\nI first rinsed my hair with water (my skin is very sensitive to soaps and shampoos), applied the solution massaging thoroughly with the tips of my fingers, let sit for 15 minutes, and then rinsed again.\n\nNow just 2 hours on I have so visible sign of dandruff or eczema on my face. Normally after a shower the water will immediately leave my skin absent of hydration. However, in this case, my skin feels neutral, and there are no visible scalp flakes in sight‚Ä¶ for the first time in over a decade!\n\nThis is rather unusual behaviour for my‚Äùstandard‚Äù biology as the ACV has gone above and beyond my expectations at an initial reaction. \n\nNormally at this 2 hour mark I couldn‚Äôt run my fingers through my hair without it looking like a blizzard, and not to mention the visible flaking on my face that I would mask with moisturiser.\n\nI am very eager to see how my body goes tomorrow and will post an update if anyone here is curious!

    "body": "Hey, I'm writing this post to share my experiences with the treatments and give a few words on the psychological aspect of it, which I think it's the worst part.\n\nFirst of all, I'm 23M. I noticed hairloss for the first time when I was 20 years old. The treatments that didn't work: ketoconazol shampoo, coal tar shampoo, eating better, not being stressed out, sunlight. The treatments that worked: finasteride. I'm 2,5 years taking it. No sides except first month. 1mg everyday. \n\nThe rest of this post will be my views on this situation that we're going through, so if you don't care you can stop reading. \n\nI'm writing this update because I'm at peace right now, and hopefully I can inspire someone to see through my perspective as well. I see people here saying they spent 2, 3 and sometimes 10 years being depressed or hiding from social situations because of hairloss, and I think that is awful. 10 years is a big chunk of your life, we simply cannot allow ourselves to lose this much time.\n\nI'm not trying to step on a high horse here, because 3 years ago I was exactly like that. When I noticed I was losing hair, I panicked. I was in denial for the first three months, then I discovered this subreddit and realized I was in fact suffering from genetic hairloss. I  searched for all available treatments, took many pictures of my hair trying to figure what Norwood level I was. I was angry at everything. I was angry at nature for making me this way, I was angry at my parents for passing down the genes, I was angry at the world for caring too much about hairloss, I was angry at myself for caring that they care. I was afraid of being mocked, of being treated differently, of never finding love and whatever else that you can attribute this condition.\n\nAnd after that I became depressed. There were days on the summer break that I barely left my bed. I remember I went to a frat party in 2019 and saw everyone healthy, young, with full heads of hair and no worries in their lives. After some hours, I just went back to my apartment and broke down crying. I was feeling like complete shit.\n\nNowadays I feel like a different person than three years ago. It took me many months to work it out, and many more months to break the habit. I'm hoping to share some tips that helped me sort it all out.\n\nFirst of all, the main thing I asked myself is \"*why am I suffering?\"*. And that is a hard question. Three years ago I would have answered: \"it's because hairloss is the worst thing that could happen to a young healthy male\". But I need to be honest about it. It was really because I was afraid of the impact it would have on my life. The rejection and isolation it would cause me. I didn't wanna see myself as less than others. I was suffering from imaginary scenarios and the mental abuse I did with myself. Looking at the mirror and thinking things like *\"Wow you are so fucking deformed, it is sad actually\".*\n\nI then thought to myself \"*Well, whatever. It doesn't matter what you think of it. Other people look down on baldness, and that is a fact. How you see yourself has little to no impact on how other people see you.\"*  and this thought convinced me for a long time. It's just that one day I was cleaning my wardrobe and found an old pair of skinny jeans I used to wear in high school. And I remembered one day I saw one of my classmates who was in the sports team, he looked at me and said *\"Hey you know that skinny guys should not wear skinny jeans right? They only look good if you have muscle.\"* and, at the time, I didn't even look away from my phone and just answered *\"I don't give a fuck\"*. I remembered that and asked myself what was the difference. What's the difference between the opinion of imaginary colleagues and girls and the opinion of my classmate? None. There is no difference. I just convinced myself that I absolutely needed the approval of people who look down on hairloss, and never gave a second thought to it.\n\nAfter that, I spent a period of time thinking like a stoic (if you don't know what stoicism is, look it up, but it's basically being indifferent to pleasure or pain. I don't like it though.). I thought to myself *\"Yeah, right. I don't need the approval of colleagues and girls anyways. I don't need the approval of anyone actually! There is so much that I want to achieve, and I can do that by myself for all I care.\"* And that worked out for a while, almost a year. I was slowly becoming antisocial though. Worse than that, I realized I was becoming a resentful person. I would look at a famous actor and think *\"But would he be famous if he was bald? I don't think so.\"*. I'd look at a couple on the street and think *\"She probably wouldn't be with him if he was bald.\".* And more than that, I was feeling very lonely. I missed laughing with people, I missed receiving hugs from girls, I missed trusting people in general. I was feeling miserable.\n\nSo, I went into deep thought again. I tried to think of all possible perspectives I could have on my life, and which one of them would make me the happiest. I went over my life for the periods that I have felt the best and tried to remember how I was thinking at the time. I came to the conclusion it was not that these periods were actually better than the others, but my perspective on things was different. I would brush aside my fears If I thought I could have a new experience by doing it. I would focus on the positive side of things happening around me.\n\nIt then got to me how afraid I have been up until that moment. How many times I looked at strangers and thought they were noticing my hairloss. How many times I refused to interact or go out with people because I feared I would be judged. How many times I adopted a defensive tone when talking to people because I feared they would look down on me? I was trying to live like a role model stoic, but really I was a coward. I was running away from my insecurities. I was preemptively judging people so they wouldn't hurt my feelings.\n\nThis was around 6 months ago. Since then, I can say that I've been the happiest since my early teens. I'm not free from insecurities, I still have them. But I try really hard to overcome them when they creep up. Most importantly, I trained myself to see the positive side of things (and people) everywhere I go. Honestly, it really surprised me. I was not expecting it would make such a difference. Just stopping the daily mental abuse is half of the journey. The other half is easy: I discovered people are very good at picking up your mood. And, of course, not everyone is nice. Sometimes people can be mean, and that can make me feel sad. But that is fine. It is important to process your emotions, both good and bad. No matter how mean people are to you, I guarantee the experience is 100% better than just sitting in your room half-alive and half-dead.\n\nAnother thing that I realized: similar people attract each other. Sometimes I will just be talking with someone, without making any initiative or taking any risks, and somehow I meet another person that really matches my personality. They are not blind, they can see my hair is not perfect. But they for some reason don't care. Makes me wonder how many people I could've known in the last years have I not been living as a recluse. \n\nAnyway, the text is pretty long and If you come here, I hope you learn from my mistakes and make better decisions than I. Maybe you read it all and thought that I am a faggot, or that it doesn't apply to your situation. But I still suggest you give it a try. It's not easy though. When you are in a social situation, sometimes it can be hard to let go of old habits. Always remember to keep a positive mindset and forget the past, that's all I can say. I hope you guys have a nice New Years, and see you all next year.",

I have reconsidered and, while I still think the differences between the descriptions of the letters are not accidental, I no longer believe that another author is as (or more) likely than Ramsay. Accordingly, I am striking through the conclusion but leaving the rest untouched. Thanks to everyone who commented.\n\n~~Ramsay~~. (All chapter references are from ADWD unless otherwise noted.)\n\n* What we know about Ramsay's letters\n  * We have two examples of letters we know to be Ramsay's\n      * The letter relating the fall of Moat Cailin (hereafter \"Letter A\") is described by Asha (The Wayward Bride)\n      * The letter summoning Bolton's bannermen to Barrowton for his wedding to \"Arya\" (hereafter \"Letter B\") is described by Jon (Jon VI)\n  * The handwriting in both samples is described *exactly* the same way: \"a huge, spiky hand.\"\n  * Letter A is signed \"Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell\"\n  * Letter B is signed \"Ramsay Bolton, Lord of the Hornwood\"\n  * Both letters are written in blood rather than a maester's black ink\n      * Maester's black ink (sometimes simply referred to as \"maester's black\" (Jon XI, Tyrion XII))  is \"made of soot and coal tar\" (The Wayward Bride), and is commonly used as a reference to a deep, dark black\n          * \"On moonless nights the water was black as maester's ink\" (Tyrion VIII)\n          * \"... a fiery gray courser with a mane as black and shiny as maester's ink.\" (Jon XII)\n          * \"Black as maester's ink he was...\" (The Kingbreaker))\n      * His writing in Letter A is brown and he explicitly claims that he \"[wrote] this letter in the blood of ironmen.\"\n      * The writing in Letter B is also brown, and Jon observes that it \"came away in flakes when [he] brushed it with his thumb.\" This is consistent with the physical characteristics of blood, and with Inkpots' statement (Tyrion XII) that \"blood makes piss-poor ink.\" Since it also describes the fall of Moat Cailin and \"the flayed corpses of the ironmen,\" it was likely written at the same time as Letter A, which we already established was written in blood.\n* What we know about the Pink Letter\n  * The Pink Letter is signed \"Ramsay Bolton, **Trueborn** Lord of Winterfell\" and contains five instances of the word \"bastard\"\n      * Not only is this different from his other signatures, it highlights the fact that he is a legitimized bastard\n      * Ramsay HATES being reminded of his bastardy\n          * \"His lordship was not a bastard anymore. Bolton, not Snow... ***Calling him Snow reminded him of his bastardy and sent him into a black rage.\"*** (Reek I)\n          * When Stannis calls him \"the Bastard\" in the Theon sample chapter, Theon responds: \"Never call him that... Ramsay Bolton, not Ramsay Snow, never Snow, never, you have to remember his name, or he will hurt you\"\n          * Later, Stannis calls him \"the Bastard of Bolton,\" and Theon thinks, \"You must not call him that!\"\n  * In contrast to the other letters, it is almost certainly written in black ink\n      * In both the other letters, the unusual brown color of the writing is noticed right away, but no such mention is made here\n      * Tormund can't read it, but he does look at it, and he says the claims in the letter might be lies, because \"if [he] had... a nice goose quill and ***a pot o' maester's ink***, [he] could write\" a false report of the length of his member\n      * If any of Ramsay's letters should have been written in blood, surely it is this one\n      * The Boltons (Ramsay in particular) have never exactly been hesitant to spill blood, and after a battle there should have been no shortage anyway\n      * Maester's ink freezes just as blood does (in the Theon sample chapter from TWOW, Stannis signs his contract with the Iron Bank in blood because the ink is frozen), so saying that the blood of the dead would freeze out in the cold is not very strong evidence against\n  * Like the other letters, it is sealed with the pink wax of the Dreadfort\n     * But Stannis has access to the Dreadfort's sealing wax, since Theon's sample chapter shows that Maester Tybald is with Stannis' host (Stannis: \"You are maester at the Dreadfort. How is it you are here with us?\" Tybald: \"Lord Arnolf brought me to tend to his wounded.\") and that his treachery has been revealed (Stannis: \"What was in the message you sent to Winterfell?\" Tybald: \"A m-map, Your Grace.\") \n  * Its handwriting is unfortunately not described, but given that the \"huge, spiky hand\" of both of Ramsay's previous letters was noticed right away, it is odd that no mention is made of it\n     * As for the objection that Jon had previously seen Ramsay's handwriting but doesn't note any changes, his single exposure to it was months before, the intervening time has been eventful to say the least, and the shock of the letter's contents could impair his ability to recall the previous letter. He never mentions it.\n  * The Pink Letter contains a lot of information that seems unlikely to have reached Ramsay, but which would or could have been easily known by Mance, Theon, and Stannis. It contains no information that Ramsay could have but that is NOT known by Mance, Theon, or Stannis.\n     * Theon just regurgitated everything from when he became Reek up to the escape from Winterfell, and is currently with Stannis (TWOW, Theon sample)\n         * He is presented to Asha as a gift (and tells her \"Don't you call him that\" when she asks if \"the Bastard\" was responsible for his appearance)\n         * \"Then the words came spilling out of Theon in a rush. He tried to tell her all of it, about Reek and the Dreadfort and Kyra and the keys... He told her how he'd saved the girl, leaping from the castle wall into the snow. \"We flew. Let Abel make a song of that, we flew.\" Then he had to say who Abel was, and talk about the washerwomen who weren't truly washerwomen.\"\n       * \"The spearwives and their number\" were known to Mance and Theon\n       * The idea or language of \"want[ing] his Reek [back]\" is expressed by Theon to Stannis\n       * Mance is not known on sight, even by the northmen, because he was able to hide in plain sight at Winterfell during both the events surrounding \"Arya's\" wedding, as well as the welcoming feast for King Robert back at the beginning of AGOT (ASOS, Jon I)\n       * Any awareness at Winterfell of Mance's supposed death would make it even more of a leap to identify \"Abel\" as Mance\n       * The statement \"You told the world you burned the King-Beyond-the-Wall\" is unusual\n         * Jon never claimed responsibility for burning anyone, and Melisandre's presence at Castle Black is specifically noted\n         * Granting Mance his style seems out of character for Ramsay and for the letter in general\n       * Demanding Mance's son and Val requires knowledge of their presence at Castle Black\n         * Word of Val's beauty spreads among Stannis' men, but Winterfell seems oblivious to it\n       * There are two significant objections to using the relative availability of information as evidence\n         * The information might have been obtained from Mance or any of the surviving spearwives if they were captured and questioned\n             * But some of the items (particularly knowledge of Val and Mance's son) would seemingly have to be offered\n             * Mance and the spearwives are unlikely to allow themselves to be taken alive, because they know what would be in store for them\n             * \"Did the Bastard hurt you?\" Rowan asked. \"Chopped off your fingers, did he? Skinned your widdle toes? Knocked your teeth out?\" (A Ghost in Winterfell)\n              * \"Ramsay will use your women as his prey,\" he told the singer. \"He'll hunt them down, rape them, and feed their corpses to his dogs. If they lead him a good chase, he may name his next litter of bitches after them. You he'll flay. Him and Skinner and Damon Dance-for-Me, they will make a game of it. You'll be begging them to kill you.\" He clutched the singer's arm with a maimed hand. \"You swore you would not let me fall into his hands again. I have your word on that.\" He needed to hear it again. \"Abel's word,\" said Squirrel. \"Strong as oak.\" Abel himself only shrugged. \"No matter what, my prince.\" (Theon VII)\n           * Our only knowledge of what Winterfell is aware of comes from Theon's chapters, and there are gaping holes in his memory. He relates a short conversation as having started at breakfast and ended at lunch (A Ghost in Winterfell).\n\nI don't know who the real author is. I just wanted to consolidate the existing evidence against Ramsay's authorship and add some of my own observations. Please attempt to demolish and/or offer improvements.\n\nFor a much more detailed analysis of *all* aspects of the Pink Letter (as opposed to just the case against Ramsay's authorship), I highly recommend [this essay](https://cantuse.wordpress.com/2014/09/30/the-pink-letter/) by /u/cantuse (thanks for linking it!).",

I think it's more likely that he did torture one or two of the spearwives and Ramsay is under the impression that Stannis is dead. Ramsay hates being reminded of his bastardry but I think it's totally within character that he then mocks another prominent bastard for it.\n\nI just think the motivation for someone else to write the letter (say Stannis or Mance) just really isn't there. If they really wanted to incite Jon to come down they could have made up a better lie about Arya - since both Stannis and Mance know Jon is fond of her (particularly Mance who was sent on a mission to rescue her).",

    "body": "Resources for finding an enemy's physical weakness or resistances are woefully underdeveloped, so I took it upon myself to record every single enemy's defenses in the game.\n\nOne small complication is that there's actually two stats to contend with: **Physical Defense** and **Physical Resistance.**\n\nDefense, much like how it works for players, is a flat reduction that is subtracted directly from a weapon's AR. The exact value varies from area to area and even within levels at times, but in general defenses will rise as you get further into the game and the same enemy types will take less damage in later levels. More information about defense under the chart.\n\nResistance is a value that multiplies your AR value similar to counter damage and attack strength. the Resistance multiplier of an enemy type is always the same no matter where in the game it appears. It varies from elemental resistance in that weakness to a physical damage type actually results in bonus damage, rather than just less resistance. At the absolute weakest, enemies can take 50% bonus damage stacked on top of whatever other multipliers your attack does.\n\nFor ease of readability and to save on character count, the physical damage multiplier will be represented as a decimal. Average resistance will be a simple \"1,\" 50% resistance will be \"0.5,\" and 50% weakness will be \"1.5\" etc.\n\nMethodology and further information under the table.\n\n|Enemy|Strike|Slash|Thrust|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Falconer|1|1|1|\n|Kobold|1|1|1|\n|Ogre|0.7|0.7|1.35|\n|Undead Traveler|1|1|1|\n|Bastard Sword Phantom|1|1|1|\n|Crossbow

Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ap-msX77HL860speIdr8sQ4aiAD95fTboQmX1T6-UY0/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nAt 24 Strength and 97 Dex, a Raw Black Scorpion Stinger, Blackmith's Hammer and Drakekeeper's Sword all deal almost identical damage. The Stinger has higher AR but a lower damage multiplier so it reacts a little differently in some situations, but they're all still very comparable and all 3 deal no extra damage on a counter strike which really simplified things. Damage recorded was with a 1HR1 from each. There's also data in that sheet from crossbow bolts and my attempts to record resin on just the sword before I realized both dealt too little elemental damage to accurately measure resistances so that part can be ignored.\n\nSome of the more ambiguous resistances had to be double checked. RoB+2 and Flynn's Ring gave me a convenient way to adjust the AR of my weapons exactly 100 points up and down. Since the 1HR1 from both the Drakekeeper's Sword and Blacksmith's Hammer have a damage multiplier of 1.0 that means they would add exactly 100 damage to the attack, and any deviation is the enemy's resistance. So that's how I figured out some bosses have 7% resistance to some damage types.\n\nVery few enemies are weak to Slash and fewer still are weak to it exclusively. If you plan to take advantage of weaknesses you'll want to switch between a Strike and a Thrust weapon, or use one of the very few weapons that can do both on command (well hello, Partizan).\n\nOnce I knew for sure what the resistance was it's pretty easy to figure out an enemy's Physical Defense by comparing the recorded damage to what all 3 weapons should do before defense (338 damage). I don't know enough about Cheat Engine to datamine the actual values, so what's on the sheet is more how it works in practice. If you're interested in what every enemy's defense is in every zone, you can check my spreadsheet. It's not completely exhaustive since defense can vary even within the same level. I know for a fact the enemies at the bottom of Brume tower take less damage than the ones at the top, but even I'm not anal enough to test every single enemy individually.\n\nSince Defense is subtracted directly from AR this means that low AR weapons that depend on counter strikes for damage will struggle more against high defense enemies than high AR weapons. This was probably a lot harder of a counter before Flynn's Ring was a thing.\n\nSudden spikes in enemy defense correspond neatly with common roadblocks to players. It isn't just your imagination that the Pursuer feels much harder than anything else in the Forest of Fallen Giants, your AR is effectively 23 points lower than when fighting the Last Giant. And the one in the Iron Keep has the same defense as the Throne Duo, Fume Knight, or the piglets in Majula.\n\nConversely, really easy bosses correspond with sudden dips in defense. The poor Covetous Demon has the lowest defense in the game. Lower than even the kobolds in Things Betwixt. If he didn't have high lightning and moderate strike resist he wouldn't have anything going for him.\n\nIf you're curious, the top 3 natural defenses in the game are Ancient Soldier Varg with 166 and a tie between the Giant Golems in Eleum Loyce and the Possessed Armor in Brume Tower with 152.\n\nThe Hollow Priests in the Prowling Magus fight and the Hollow Priestess in the Dragon Aerie can cast what's effectively a supercharged version of Sacred Oath that luckily only affects themselves. It doesn't affect their resistances, but it adds a massive amount of defense and puts them on par with the tankiest DLC enemies.\n\nVelstadt's phase 2 buff reduces all damage by 40%.\n\nAshen Idols can buff nearby Ashen Warriors to reduce damage by 50%.\n\nAldia's flame buff reduces all damage by about 70% and it's a bad idea to be close when he lights it up.\n\nWhisper of Despair reduces defense by about 33.3 points. This isn't a huge difference solo since that's only 33 more effective AR, but it applies to everything attacking that enemy and can stack with the +50 AR buff of Sacred Oath in co-op.",

        "body": "Wow, you anticipated me! Amazing job, I must say.\n\nLet me just post here my thoughts and impressions, also some questions (don't take them as an attack to your work at all, these are just things I naturally came up with when reading this post based on my past experience).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n~~I'm curious about one thing tho, here you are reporting different Physical Defenses values for each damage type, similarly to what players in PvP use (e.g. Things Betwixt Ogre has 201/201/388 Strike/Slash/Thrust Defense, and 51 Physical Defense). How did you find these values? I'm not saying these are wrong, cause you are using these to derive Resistance Multipliers and you nailed them all. This is interesting because it allows to \"convert\" Enemy Resistances to the Player Resistances format.~~\n\n~~Looking at the game files, enemies seem to have only one Physical Defense value, which can vary for the same enemy (e.g. Stone Ring Ogre has 310 Physical Defense, coffin Ogres have 577), but always the same Resistance Multipliers.~~\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNever mind, I just realized this is actually Damage Dealt and not Damage Resistance, but then I have a question about Physical Defense, cause it doesn't match the value I see and use when I test my formula. (e.g. you report that Ogre has 51 Physical Defense, but the value I used to test my formula, which I took from the game files, is actually 310. How did you find these values?\n\nWhen calculating Elemental Resistance, you are dividing the difference between Physical Bolt Damage and Elemental Bolt Damage by 88. What's that?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, if you want to be 100% precise, you could report the Elemental Resistances as integer percentages (e.g. 15% instead of 14.77%), cause these are actual integer values and not decimals. These values pretty much match the ones in the game files (except some DLC enemies, which have completely different values compared to the ones I'd expect from the files), pretty neatly accurate!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA thing that's interesting is that you are reporting for DLC bosses a separate row for Ranged Damage Resistances and Melee Damage Resistances. This is interesting because the Param files only report one Elemental Resistance Multiplier (which in most cases is the one you report under Melee Magic/Lightning/Fire Resistance). Understanding this might actually help me crack how Ranged Damage is calculated, which is something I'm working on (occasionally, very busy right now).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I have noticed that you report Physical Resistance as Defense Type/338. What's 338? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI say again, this is a very good work, testing all the enemies one by one is something that requires a lot of patience :)\n\nEDIT 1: This post made me find the value that regulates the difference between ranged and melee elemental resistance.\n\nMost bosses take 0.85 times the Elemental Damage from spells. This means that the formula for elemental damage is ElemAR(1-ElemRES/100)*0.85.\n\n\nThis is consistent with your findings! Let‚Äôs take as an example Executioner Chariot: \nMagicRES is 30, this means that you deal 70% of your Magic AR as damage.\nLet‚Äôs hit him with a spell, he now takes (100-30)*0.85 times the Elemental AR of the spell.\n\n\n(1-30/100)*0.85=0.595\n\nThis is the same as saying that he takes 60% your spell AR (which in turn means it has 40% ranged Resistance).\nYou helped me give a name to some mysterious numbers inside EnemyCommonParam (responsible for enemy damage type specific resistance).\n\nThanks Skeleton!\n\nEDIT 2: I have cracked Ranged Damage! That was really quick, many thanks to you for bringing out the difference between Ranged Damage Reduction and Physical Damage Reduction.\n\nThe way the game calculates Ranged Damage is very simplistic really, it‚Äôs the same as Physical Damage, but overall damage is always reduced by 10%.\n\nEach enemy then has a set of ranged resistances that further adjusts the damage.\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you! :)",

It's so bad that if I even brush my hand through my hair, it looks like it's full on snowing. For the longest time, I thought it was dry scalp - I get dry and flaky on other parts of my body when it's winter. I tried coconut oil, extra hydrating conditioners, hair serums, washing my hair more, washing it less, using just vinegar, nothing. \n\nSomeone over on skincare addiction told me it was most likely Seborrheic dermatosis (that's probably spelled wrong?) And recommended that I try some medicated shampoo. I tried zinc, salycilic acid, nothing. \n\nThen I bought t/gel from Neutrogena, a coal tar shampoo, and tried that. \n\nI admit. I was skeptical. Stuff smells absolutely HORRIBLE. but oh my god, you guys, this stuff WORKS!!!\n\nI have been using it for 3 days. THREE DAYS!! And already, my scalp barely flakes. It used to be, if I scratched my head wearing a black shirt, TONS of flakes. Now, barely any!! There are still some, but y'all, I am losing my mind. My scalp has never been this good. I am so excited!!! \n\nAnyways, I guess this is mostly just a rant, but: if you're struggling with scalp problems, try coal tar shampoo!!

    "body": "This is my psoriasis story. I recently spent a few hours on a train writing it down in the hope that someone else could benefit from it. Please let me know if there's anything I could or should add (I'm considering adding a list of the products and brands I've used). The one thing I wish I could add is photos of myself, but I avoided having any photos taken of me while I had psoriasis, especially of my skin! Any feedback is appreciated, and if you have a loved one or an acquaintance who you think could benefit from this story please pass it on. Good luck! \n\nTLDR\n\nI suffered with psoriasis for years. I tried every treatment recommended by dermatologists, doctors and the internet. Finally I had had enough of the lotions and potions and made a decision - no more chemicals. Within one week of eliminating all chemical products from my life my psoriasis had completely faded away and my skin was healthier than it had ever been. And the cure is lasting.\n________________________________________________\n\nThe Breakout\n\nSix years ago. I was 22, fit, a professional tennis player.\n\nOn a train through the center of England between tennis tournaments I felt the first inklings of a sore throat. Over the next few days this turned into a minor annoyance but nothing I couldn‚Äôt deal with. \n\nA few days later my skin started feeling itchy and soon a rash of small, red bumps appeared. I thought I‚Äôd had an allergic reaction to the different washing powder I‚Äôd been using and went to the tournament doctor to get myself sorted out. The doctor confirmed my suspicion and prescribed me some strong antihistamine as the rash had steadily spread and worsened. \n\nI took the antihistamine pills for a few days but rather than easing the rash it spread further and became redder and angrier. \n\nBy this stage I was extremely self-conscious and scared. The rash was all over my body and was starting to appear around my eyes. It itched like crazy and I looked contagious and diseased. I was still competing in tournaments, by now at an event in Dublin that annually draws a reasonably big crowd. I saw the tournament doctor in Dublin for a second opinion but he couldn‚Äôt give me any new advice and just suggested I continue with the antihistamine. The pills did nothing. \n\nI didn‚Äôt want to go on court. I didn‚Äôt want to take my tracksuit off and hear people whispering about the horrific state of my skin. In the changing rooms the other players ‚Äì friends and acquaintances alike ‚Äì would gasp when I got changed or took a shower and ask what had happened to me. I assured them it was an allergic reaction and nothing that could be passed on. I didn‚Äôt know that the diagnosis was wrong.\n\nLittle surprise considering my mental state but I lost early in the event and went back to Bath where I was living at the time to get more medical help. The third doctor I saw finally recognized the nature of my affliction. It was not an allergic reaction. It was guttate psoriasis. \n\nIt took three years of misery and experimentation to find a cure, and it came from a completely unexpected direction.\n\n______________\nThe Problem ‚Äì What Is Guttate Psoriasis?\n\nQuoting WebMD, Guttate psoriasis is a type of psoriasis that shows up on your skin as red, scaly, small, teardrop-shaped spots. You usually get it as a child or young adult. Up to 10% of people who have psoriasis have this type. Plaque psoriasis is more common. Outbreaks are usually triggered by a bacterial infection, typically streptococcus (strep throat). It sets off an immune system reaction that causes the spots on your skin.\n\nOkay.\n\nHaving a diagnosis that fit all of the facts was terrifying in some ways but comforting in others. Those who know me know that I‚Äôm a (sometimes [often] annoyingly) stubborn person. Now I knew the enemy and had something tangible to research and fight against. This theory was somewhat inhibited by the fact that I was my own enemy ‚Äì psoriasis is an autoimmune disease, meaning that my body was treating my own cells like invaders and attacking them, producing excess skin. \n\nNevertheless, I wrung the doctor for every single recommendation she could give me for managing or curing the disease. I went online and found every piece of advice that had even the slightest chance of helping. Having experienced the social ostracism of looking overtly diseased I was willing to do anything at all to normalize myself. In reflection, this self-consciousness and ostracism was largely self-inflicted. I looked in the mirror and thought, ‚ÄúWow, you are disgusting.‚Äù and in my mind everyone who looked at me thought the exact same thing. \n\nMy solution to this was twofold: 1) do everything I could to fix the problem, and 2) avoid people. \n\nIn a profession that revolves around competing in front of a crowd, number 2 was not easy, and just led to more self-disgust and more frenetic attempts at amelioration and management of the disease.\n\n______________\nTreatment Methods\n\nThe first methods I tried were those recommended by the doctor.\n\nSteroid (cortisone) gels --\nInitially, the steroid gels the doctor prescribed to me were useful. They helped to calm the first (worst) outbreak and somewhat tame the subsequent flares. However, they achieve this by destroying your skin. You‚Äôre supposed to use tiny amounts of gel for around a week at a time and then refrain from using it for a month before treating again. This guideline is impossible to follow. If I stopped using the gels for more than two days my skin would rapidly break out in angry red spots again. As a compromise, I tried to use the gels for two days, then stop for two days to give my skin a chance.\nThis routine allowed me to keep most of my psoriasis in check most of the time, though I always had patches around my eyes and on my torso and thighs. \nThe cost of using the gels was permanently painful and sensitive skin, especially around my eyes where the skin is thin. I thought this a worthwhile payment in return for some semblance of regained self-confidence and apparent health.\n\nHypoallergenic moisturizers --\nThe doctor prescribed moisturizer as a way to keep my skin from becoming too itchy and scaly. She said I should moisturize after every shower or bath and I took this advice to heart. However as an athlete I would shower three or four times a day - after every training session or match. I‚Äôm quite a lanky guy, so it takes a hell of a lot of moisturizer to cover me. I started travelling with huge 1kg tubs of moisturizer that had to be bought again every couple of weeks or so. \nMoisturizing did seem to drive away the worst of the itchiness, but my skin came to rely on it so heavily that if I had even one shower without moisturizing my psoriasis would instantly flare up and my skin would become flaky and itchy. \n\nThese two treatments were enough to keep the psoriasis under some form of control, but it was very much a never-ending battle. I kept looking for a solution.\n\nAnti-dandruff Shampoos --\nYou know the sort - Head and Shoulders etc. These were useless and just made my scalp hurt.\n\nOatmeal Baths --\nThis is pretty much exactly what it sounds like. I‚Äôd run a bath, pour half a bag of oatmeal into it, and then luxuriate. Well, luxuriate as much as I could with sludge squishing between my toes and butt cheeks. This was supposed to neutralize my skin, calm the lesions and reduce itchiness. I tried this around half a dozen times but never felt any positive effects. It‚Äôs also a massive hassle to clean up‚Ä¶\n\nCoal Tar --\nThis can come in a few different forms, but is typically added to a cream that you use as a moisturizer. The coal tar is supposed to have the same neutralizing effect as oatmeal. I tried both the cream form, and also tried adding straight coal tar to a bath. Neither had any noticeable benefit.\n\nUV Light --\nThis was easily the most effective long-term treatment for me. Living in England I unfortunately didn‚Äôt often have ready access to an uncovered sun, so I found some fake sunshine at a tanning salon. \nIt took me a while to work up the courage to walk in the door for the first time - the thought of being seen by anyone I knew walking into a tanning salon made me incredibly embarrassed. I stole a furtive glance around the square, hurried over to the entrance and ducked inside with my head down. Unfortunately the whole front wall was glass. I felt like the occupant of a tanning aquarium. I hurriedly asked the androgynous creature at the reception desk if they ever had people come in to treat skin problems. He laughed. ‚ÄúOh, we get all sorts in here darling. How many minutes do you want?‚Äù I had no idea how many minutes I wanted, but soon discovered that the maximum allowed was 14. I played it safe and went for 5 but still came out with a reddish tinge, especially in those areas not necessarily accustomed to spending time in the sun. 14 minutes was ‚Äògoing on holiday to Ibiza‚Äô level and way out of my league. \n5-6 minutes in a stand up tanning room one time per week was very effective at maintaining the severity of my psoriasis at a low level. Obviously when I was able to spend time in real sunlight I would do that instead, but if real sunlight was lacking then responsibly using artificial UV light was a good alternative for me.\n\n______________\nThe Turning Point\n\nI fought my battle with psoriasis for years, constantly moisturizing, rubbing cortisone into my skin, and going to tanning beds, and periodically trying holistic methods and taking strange baths. The combination of treatments kept my psoriasis present but manageable for the most part. I would have flare-ups every month or so and would use the cortisone gel more liberally until it was under control again. My skin, however, was becoming more and more sensitive and thin, especially around my eyes. If I rubbed my eyes my eyelids would be agony for minutes afterwards. I had gone through dozens of kilograms of moisturizer and the problem didn‚Äôt look like it was ever going to go away. \n\nAround three years after I first got psoriasis I was having a chat with a Kiwi friend of mine about his hair. It was long, well past his shoulders, and luxurious. But the subject of our hair chat was his maintenance routine, which was exactly nothing, zwilch, zero, nada. This friend is a fanatical surfer and general go-getter. He sweats, swims in chlorine, surfs in salt water and gets dumped head first onto the sand. Despite all of this he hasn‚Äôt washed his hair in over ten years! At the time I found this unbelievable and a little bit disgusting, but I couldn‚Äôt refuse what was staring me in the face ‚Äì he and his hair were a picture of health. \n\nHis theory was that your body knows how to take care of itself, and using shampoos and conditioners just tells your body to disregard its natural knowledge and rely on chemicals instead. \n\nThis chat triggered a turning point for me. I was sick of destroying my skin to try to make it better. I was sick of having to spend five minutes moisturizing after every time I got wet. I was sick of carting around kilograms of lotions and potions with me to every tournament I played, most of which were a plane flight away from each other with all of the baggage restrictions and airport fun that entails. \n\nI decided to do an experiment on myself: three weeks completely chemical free. What was the worst that could happen? My psoriasis could flare up and I‚Äôd be back to square one, but that was exactly what had already happened dozens and dozens of times over the previous three years.\n\nScrew it. I‚Äôm going au naturale baby!\n\nNo moisturizer, no steroid gels, no face wash, no soap, no shampoo, no conditioner, no deodorant. \n\nPerhaps I would be a smelly, rash-covered yeti by the time the three weeks were up, but I‚Äôd had enough of what had become my status quo and was ready for something radical. By this stage of my life I was living with a girlfriend in London. Initially she was unsure of my experiment (fair enough, she had to share a bed with me!) but she realized I needed to at least cross this method off my list of things to try. So I put all of my chemical products into a bucket and put the bucket under the bathroom sink. \n\nThe first three or four days were tough. After every shower my skin would instantly become dry and flaky, especially around my nose and lips. My psoriasis got a bit redder and angrier and my natural scent became a little stronger (read: I had a bit of BO), though according to my girlfriend it was never horrible and was actually pleasant in an earthy, human sort of way. I‚Äôll take her word on that one and won‚Äôt question it too hard‚Ä¶\n\nAfter those first few days, things began to change. My skin became a little oilier, but not in a bad way. The first improvement I noticed was that I stopped getting flaky skin after showering. Then my psoriasis started fading a little. This was the point at which I started getting excited. By the end of the 7th day my psoriasis had faded completely and the skin around my eyes had lost its sensitivity. For the first time in over three years I didn‚Äôt have a spot of psoriasis on my body! It felt like a miracle. And this was purely the result of avoiding chemicals for a week. \n\nOver the next week my hair became more lustrous and healthy than it had been in years and my skin balanced out, losing its oiliness but retaining the ability to stay hydrated after showering. After a month or so off chemicals I decided to try a natural, plant based roll-on deodorant. Nothing changed on my skin. No more ‚Äòpleasant, earthy‚Äô BO! \n\nSince that experiment three years ago I have not once used any of the chemicals I mentioned above, but I have managed to find natural substitutes that are useful for maintaining personal hygiene. I use virgin coconut oil as both soap and moisturizer. I use baking soda to wash my hair and a mixture of half apple cider vinegar and half water to rinse it out and condition. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to avoid washing my hair altogether as my athlete life involves copious amounts of sweat, airports and airplanes, all of which give me the urge to clean off. This combination works amazingly well as a natural substitute. \n\nI cannot describe how life changing this experiment was for me. I had always been a relatively self-confident guy but the psoriasis pushed me to the other extreme. I avoided the public eye when I could. I avoided intimacy. I was embarrassed and self-conscious and considered myself deformed. It did not matter whether this was a valid opinion or not, it was what I believed. It was my reality. The only positive that came from this belief was an understanding of the emotional pain suffered by those who are truly and unmistakably deformed or different. I gained a huge compassion for those who experience it permanently.\n\nCuring my psoriasis felt like being let out of a cage for the first time in years. I could interact with people fully and openly without feeling like they were wondering what was wrong with me. I could take my shirt off at the beach without feeling self-conscious. I could shower at the tennis courts without being asked if I was contagious. \n\nSince I cured myself three years ago I have had one flare up of psoriasis, which again followed a throat infection. However this flare up disappeared within a month without the help of any chemicals at all. I can also confirm that this method is not unique in working for me. My tennis coach suffered with psoriasis on his scalp for years. I told him about my experiences going chemical-free and suggest he try my method for washing his hair. He hasn‚Äôt had dandruff for over a year. \n\nI‚Äôve been meaning to write about my experiences with psoriasis for some time now. I have first hand experience in how demoralizing, emotionally exhausting and confidence sapping the disease can be. I‚Äôm not a doctor and I‚Äôm not under the illusion that this method will work for everyone, but there can be no harm in cutting chemicals out of your life for a month. And the potential benefits are huge. If you believe my story could help someone you know or love, please pass it on. It could change their life the way mine was changed.\n",

Anti-dandruff Shampoos are also not an appropriate treatment for scalp psoriasis as it's treating something else entirely, so no wonder you didn't have any luck with those. \n\nGlad you found a solution that worked for you though!",

I will list below the things I did and you can help me in the comments below by writing the number or the thing you think was leading my healing process:\r  \n1 - stopped alcohol.\r  \n2 - stopped coffee.\r  \n3 - stopped diary.\r  \n4 - stopped bread and gluten.\r  \n5 - stopped red meat.\r  \n6 - drinking 5-10g L-Glutamine (powder diluted in water) first thing in the morning + 1 tablet of probiotics.\r  \n7 - drinking celery juice (recipe= 4 celery sticks+cup of blueberry+ some kale+1 banana+ almond milk).\r  \n8 - taking digestive enzymes when easting protein (chicken or fish).\r  \n9 - taking 10,000 IUs D3.\r  \n10 - taking Nature Made Super C.\r  \n11 - turmeric + Black seed oil tablets before sleeping.\r  \n12 - drinking lots of water.\r  \n13 - drinking lots of tea (green, black, cleanse, detox, turmeric.. all herbal tea).\r  \n14 - Adding flax, chia, hemp seeds to oatmeals.\r  \n15 - applying MG217 Multi Symptom Relief 2% Coal Tar Medicated Psoriasis Ointment once a day.\r  \n16 - moisturising 2-3 times a day with shea butter mixed with tea tree oil, black seed oil, vitamin E oil, jojoba oil.\r  \n17- Epsom-salt bath with drops of tea tree oil 3-4 times a week.\r  \n18 - taking a 30 mins walk about 4-5 times a week.\r  \n19 - fasting first month, it was Ramadan, so was no food no drink from \\~5am to \\~8pm.\r  \n20 - eating salad (lettuce, cabbage, cucumbers, carrots, arugula) every morning with apple cider vinegar.\r  \n21- no sugar.\r  \n22- no nightshades.\r  \nI used to heal my psoriasis with methotrexate+dovabet ointment, and they work also after two months!. I couldn‚Äôt believe that the natural path can fix it. I do believe its an issue in the gut and probably I was healed because my gut was healed. I started to feel really good after one month, and my metabolism has increase dramatically. You will know and feel you are doing so good. Maybe in the first 5-6 weeks, you won‚Äôt see a fast change in the skin, but the last two weeks or so the skin just healed all of the sudden. It‚Äôs slow in the beginning but very fast at the end. You may follow this protocol, and two month should be enough to heal the psoriasis (from experience). Feel free to ask questions, very happy to help, good luck everyone!",

    "body": "\r\nThe history of Nylon really starts with the term hosiery which was first coined around the early 16th century. This was mainly due to the fact that tights in its singular form were called hose, this is where the word pantyhose came from. Most men at this time wore hose as a part of their daily outfits. If you‚Äôve ever been to see a Shakespearean play you will no doubt be aware that most of the characters wear hose. These were mainly knitted garments and were made from yarns such as cotton and silk. These products were quite expensive as at the time, almost all leg wear was made from silk imported from China. It was not good etiquette for women to show their legs so hosiery was not a necessary part of a lady‚Äôs wardrobe.\r\n\r\nThe 20th century soon changed all that. Once the Victorians custom of dressing a lady‚Äôs legs was gone, people found it fashionable and fun to show off their shapely figures a lot more and leg wear soon became a more acceptable type of garment.\r\n\r\nThe 1930s brought us the invention of a very famous fabric we use each and every day. Nylon. This product was to change the face of hosiery forever. Wallace Carothers, Julian Hill and a team of men were employed as researchers for the DuPont Company. Wallace Carothers was a brilliant man who held a PhD in chemistry and became a professor of Harvard. He was revered as being one of the world leaders in the discovery of Nylon and other products such as neoprene. Despite having a wonderful career and having more than 50 patents to his name, he was a very troubled man and sadly ended his own life.\r\n\r\nWhilst working for DuPont, this team‚Äôs job was to study chains of molecules called polymers to find new uses for crude oil. They specifically wanted to create innovative new materials, fabrics and manufacturing components. As they attempted to find a substitute for silk, as we know was very expensive, they stumbled upon this. By pulling a heated rod out of a mixture of carbon, alcohol, coal tar and water, they found that the mixture stretched. At room temperature, it had a silk-like look and feel. The texture was very similar to silk and, eventually, this work culminated in the production the first Nylon fabric, thus marking the start of a new era in the hosiery marketplace.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.uktights.com/article/6/the-history-of-nylon---uk-tights\r\n",

Since it contains early 20th century source material it should be free of copyright.  \n\n[LINK BACK TO THE LIBRARY: survivorlibrary.com](http://www.survivorlibrary.com/)\n\nWhat if... you could tuck away and forget ~109Gb of general purpose knowledge that might be invaluable in the event that our modern civilization suffers partial or total collapse? Most modern survival libraries tend to cover the basics, which essentially makes you into a medieval sustenance farmer and hunter-gatherer. But let us say you've survived your first Winter and your children are asking, what now?  \n\nWhat if... you have preserved and cherished your local paper library because you believed it was 'the' repository of human knowledge... but find that they have tossed out that old stuff and stocked Harry Potter books, vague general political-historical reference and some 'for dummies' books that are built on the very things --- Home Depot, grid power, cell phones, things from faraway places --- that are down.  \n\nWhat is key here is that much of this Library dates from the 1850-1940s. It goes beyond country living. This was a time when the modern essentials of engineering were established, the industrial revolution well under way, and books were available that were descriptive and accessible to the general audience. They showed cross sections of devices and sometimes described process in detail. Much of this detail is missing from modern works.  \n\nFor example --- I have a modern textbook on Heating and Air Conditioning which may give me the ability to understand, troubleshoot and repair refrigeration systems. Using it I could keep some things working, for awhile. But what happens when we run out of bottled refrigerant? We would be re-tasking ammonia once again as we once did, and converting or rebuilding fridges to use it. But where did this ammonia come from? You may know already that ammonia can be separated from stale urine or pigshit but the yield is small. Where would bulk ammonia come from? What do the laboratory apparatus for separating ammonia look like? My modern textbook has no clue. Ammonia comes from bottles that say 'ammonia'. There's the rub.  \n\nWagner's Chemical Technology handbook [pub 1900] not only tells that ammonia can be obtained by the dry distillation of coal, it shows how starting on page 399. And George Lunge's volume on Coal Tar and Ammonia [pub 1887] delves into apparatus and chemical process in detail. Both are in this Library. Are they in your local library?  \n\nModern technology has become so specialized, interconnected and rife with mass-produced shoddy construction techniques that its products and devices would fall into disrepair, and fail, within a single generation. I'm sure you can imagine a culture of scavenging and progressive feudalism as working devices become fewer, eventually to be held by the most privileged or violently ruthless. And for their children, nothing, and we are pulling plows with animals and feeding a few people once again.  \n\nBut what if... a few people here and there can offer knowledge to make possible a fall-back to a previous yet modern age, such as existed in the year 1900? In tandem with the scavengers and those trying to restart modern tech, there would be others grounded on early 20th century tech, and using it. We know it works because it did work. Might make a difference.  \n\nI featured this torrent in [an article that made the Slashdot front page](https://tech.slashdot.org/story/14/10/28/0531223/a-library-for-survival-knowledge). Here is the summary and part of a message about it.  \n________  \n\nA Library For Survival Knowledge  \n\nThe Survivor Library is gathering essential knowledge that would be necessary to jump-start modern civilization, should it fail past the point where a simple 'reboot' is possible (video). Much of it (but not all) dates to the late 1800s and early 1900s: quaint, but we know these things work because they did work. In 1978, James Burke said our modern world has become a trap (video), and whether it springs shut or not, all survival starts with the plow. Could you make one, use one? Sure, even a steam engine to pull it. I rescued my copy of Henley's Formulas from a dumpster outside a library.  \n\nThink of the Survivor Library as a trove of survival skills, a \"100-year civilization checkpoint backup\" that fits on a hard drive. If one individual from every family becomes a Librarian, gathering precious things with the means to read them, there may be many candles in the darkness. Browse at will, but if acquisition is the goal, someone has kindly made a torrent snapshot as of 14-Oct-2014 available.  \n\n________  \n\n(from a Message posted to Slashdot thread posted November 1 2014)  \n\nA collapse event could happen never, next year or tomorrow. It could be a impact of a Near Earth Object we have not cataloged, Yellowstone, a pandemic. A political Orwellian slate-wiper followed by a Chairman Mao-style 'revolution', famine and dark age. Or over time, even some ridiculous consumer movement to phase out paper books and do away with autonomous storage altogether in favor of some 'cloud' that a future despot ruler could centrally edit, revoke or just turn off. Yes, we are that stupid.  \n\nYour modern civilization has failed you. It provides for you collectively but, because it was never a real priority, as it stands it cannot provide for itself in a time of disaster. It cannot repair itself. Many steps have been taken over the last hundred years, little things, that enabled life to become a bit easier and better. And in key areas (food, energy, communication, transportation) 'best' paths were chosen exclusively over other paths that were not as desirable, maintainable or as economically feasible (though not impossible). Some of these roads not taken were not merely abandoned. Details of the technology that ours was built upon live on only in old books for which few copies exist, that never made it to the Internet age.  \n\nWhen I say '100 year backup' I mean a knowledge backup you could use tomorrow if you need it, to help ensure that normal people like yourself could, with practice and patience, re-create civilization as it was 100 years ago, as an alternative to sliding completely into a medieval existence --- or worse, a Mad Max scavenger based existence where everyone waits for some 'miracle' reboot that never arrives.  \n\nYour modern civilization has failed you. You cannot hope to even gather a scope of knowledge such as contained in this Library, for our modern world. That is because it is bound by non-disclosure, proprietary processes, and to catch a glimpse of it you'd need access to a volume of copyrighted textbooks and industry publications that you, oh best beloved, could particularly never afford. There are few lay introductions to how modern technology is actually made put together, and even if you could find them you will never have access to the 'experts' who understand it.  \n\nThat is because in a real disaster the relatively few experts of any particular field of modern technology will be just like you, disconnected and fighting for survival. Some will not make it. They have specialized because civilization has permitted them to do so, and together we have built something that is foolishly fragile.  \n\nYour communications will be down. You will be walking, bicycling or riding horses again. You will be fighting to obtain food, heat (for most, wood) and supplies. And if you weather all of these challenges you and your kids will be asking, what now?  \n\nYou are conditioned to think of each of everything that surrounds you as the best that has yet been developed, the finest and ultimate of it kind and most advanced. And in many aspects this is true. You may be conditioned to ignore and dismiss older folks who point out exceptions or sound warnings of vulnerability.  \n\nFor example, the warning I sounded recently here at Slashdot, [The Dismantling of POTS: Bold Move Or Grave Error?](https://yro.slashdot.org/story/13/11/30/1418238/the-dismantling-of-pots-bold-move-or-grave-error). Your grandparents (I speak of my own United States) grew up with a wired Plain Old Telephone Service that was engineered so that in small communities or even cities people could communicate with one another, practically forever, so long as you could provide power to a few buildings. Forty years of little compromises later, what you have now are cell towers and unmanned subscriber remotes that are too stupid to connect calls, all of this controlled by a few central points of failure in distant cities. It's all good and cheap until disaster strikes and everyone pays the price. If you think those cell towers and 'cable phones' in your town will keep everyone in touch after a real disaster, you've got a lot to learn. I hope when you've learned what they replaced and how resilient it was, you'll be at least a little angry.  \n\nBut to learn how vulnerable we are don't listen to 'old geezers' like me. I'm not really old, just seen a lot happen in my time. Research it for yourself. If you can imagine even one potential disaster (I could cite several) you owe it to your own children to do so. Perhaps a hundred gigabytes of FREE books that were considered to be vital reference 100 years ago would at least help. The \"for dummies\" books will not help at all.",

I've been putting it on my face and I don't know if its doing anything but it helps cooling it.  I came across this video and the naturopathic doctor (who is an MD) says not to use products with DMDM Hydantoin because its a formaldehyde releaser.  Towards the end of the segment, she recommends using aloe instead of coal tar.  Well guess what, her example of aloe to use is the CVS one I have which, you guessed it, contains DMDM Hydantoin.

These are so gooey they will pop and spread out the white pus if I just move my nose (not even need to touch them). Are these whiteheads or something else? \n\nIts been years I'm getting these no matter what I do. I had full face acne (and cysts) 3-4 years back and I went on medication (and accutane) which cleared my face but these nose pimples never stopped. Not only they come overnight, but during morning/evening too. \n\nI've tried BP/AHA and everything. 3 days ago I started applying Salicylic acid gel too on my nose but its not helping either. Mostly, every week there will be 1-2 days when these pimples will not come (2 days I am able to live, lol)\n\nI recently started using Ducray Keracynl Foaming face wash (contains Poly hydroxy acids)  day and night and Ducray Keracynl Complete regulating cream (contains PHA) at night, and these are really awesome life changing products and diminish scars and even my skin tone. But the nose pimples will ruin my skin everyday no matter what. I exercise a lot and my diet is extremely healthy and I drink shit load of water. My skin type is hyper oily (around the T zone)\n\nIs there anything I should do to get rid of these? Please help\n\n**[Update 1]** I visited my derm today and explained him the situation (He's the one who prescribed me isotretinoin (accutane) 2 years back, so he certainly knows my situation). He said my skin is hyper oily around the T zone and that's what's causing it. He prescribed me the following meds/cream:\nDoxycycline Hyclate Tablets (100mg) : Morning and evening\nNadifloxacin (10mg) gel : At night, to apply to only nose side and crease areas or where active pimples are on face.\nA sulphur lotion he prescribes to everyone everytime: At night (only to spots)\nA cleansing facewash: Morning (Main Ingredients: Salicylic acid 2%, Glycerine 4%, Vitamin E 0.1% )\nLets see if that works. I remember I have been on doxycycline 2 years back in my accutane days, don't remember much but I think it worked back then. However, this Nadifloxacin gel is something new to me. I'm stopping my other AHA/BHA face washes and creams for the next 20 days to see this new routine's results.\nHope it works. I will keep you guys updated.\n\n\n**[Update 2]** 14 days in the course and zero positive effect so far. The number of whiteheads are still the same. I'm discouraged. 6 days more before this course finishes and I will visit my derm again.\n\n**[Update 3]** 20 days in the course and zero positive effect. So I visited Derm again and it was his son this time who is also a Derm and he said he is sure that the whiteheads are because of oily dandruff on my head and that I should shampoo it daily. He prescribed me a stay on overnight hair lotion (Ketoconazole 2%) and a morning dandruff shampoo (containing 1% coal tar) and asked me to apply them daily. He sounded way too confident and said majority of the times the side nose whiteheads/blackheads are because of hair dandruff. Well I am gonna give it a try for the next 10 days. Hope it helps.\n\n**[Update 4]** ok, The shampoo and hair lotion did clear the dandruff but had zero effect on the whiteheads. So I went to derm again today and he set me on isotretinion again.. he said this time we will only do it for 40-60 days and only low dose (20mg  day). So, now I am on Doxycycline Hyclate Tablets (100mg) : Morning and evening, and isotretinoin (20 mg): Evening . I am hoping this is gonna work.. already feeling the dryness after the first dose today. Lets hope.\n\n**[Update 5]** GOOD NEWS! 10 days in on accutane and seems like all the whiteheads disappeared forever. They have stopped by 99% I'd say and I'm soooo excited and happy. Hope it continues! \n\n**[Update 5]** Stayed 2 months on accutane (only 20mg dose, one per day)..and zero acne as long as I was on it. Stopped it ~3 weeks ago.. still zero acne so far.",

    "body": "Ever since I was in elementary school, I had issues with dandruff. My parents would buy coal tar shampoos and work it into my scalp, but it had no lasting results. I got used to the fact that I had a flaky scalp, and it just became a part of my life; I would just shower everyday to minimise the effect it had and that way it wasn't very noticeable to anyone except my barber.\n\nRecently I moved to a new area for school, and not too long after that I started having new skin problems. My skin would be dry and flaky, and breakouts became unpredictable. I started to routinely moisturise, but nothing helped. Over the course of a year it only got worse, I even had dandruff in my eyebrows. I had no idea what to do.\n\nAbout a month ago, I was tired of feeling defeated. I felt sick from how bad my skin was, so I went to Shoppers Drug Mart to see what I could find. I looked at all the anti-dandruff shampoos they had, and saw the usual suspects like Coal Tar and the like...but then I noticed Nizoral, which targeted fungi. I had never heard of a dandruff cure like that, so I gave it a shot.\n\nTo make a long story short, not only do I not have dandruff anymore, but my skin is bright and healthy because the moisturiser can properly be absorbed. No dryness, no flakes in my eyebrows, nothing. This stuff has changed my life and I just wanted to write this post so that if anyone else out there is in a similar situation maybe they will see this and experience the change I'm having!\n\nThrough research, I've found out that the hardness of the water in the area I moved to has most likely contributed to my skin problems intensifying. Certain conditions allow dandruff and dry skin causing fungi to be more rampant, and Nizoral kills that type of fungi.\n\nMy routine with Nizoral right now is twice a week I take a shower with it, and during the shower I work it into my eyebrows and basically apply it all over my face. Immediately after the shower I moisturise.\nThis is the exact brand I use:\n\nhttps://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/nizoral-ketoconazole-2-anti-dandruff-shampoo/6000188696474",

Here's what he had to say about the Great Smog:\n\n\n>I remember very well the smog of 1952. I have a theory about this, for what it's worth. \n\n\n>London sits in a horseshoe shaped bowl opening to the east and the North Sea. As a result, any cold winter, east, winds (from Siberia) gets trapped in that basin. Heat, in those days was mostly by coal fires in open grates, one to a room and not very efficient. 1952 was only seven years after the end of the war and most things were hard to come by including coal. In London the trams (Street cars) had just finished running and the tracks were being pulled-up. In many places the road level around the tracks was made up of wooden blocks as this kept down the noise. The blocks were  put down with grain of the wood up and down and not parallel  to the tram rails. The blocks were saturated with coal tar to make them waterproof (it was cheap). Sometimes this tar layer was up to 4 inches thick. Any way, when the tracks came up the wooden blocks were left at the side of the road and many people used them instead of coal for heating. Knocking off the coal tar coating first they burned like crazy producing large amounts of smoke which became mixed with the cold trapped air which became smokier and smokier. Not nice.  \n\n\n\n>I remember breathing IN through a handkerchief to find a dark yellow stain upon it. The smog was so thick that you could not see a hand extended at arms length and many people, especially older folk, died of lung related illnesses. Road transport became a night-mare with bus conductors walking in front to show the way! This situation lasted for 3-4 days until the wind blew from the south-west and pushed out the smog.  That I remember, there were two or three  lots of smog that winter. My theory is that the smog would not have been so bad had the wooden blocks not been burnt. I hope that this was not too tough to read. Ah yes, I remember it well.",

What you may not realize is that by the late 1800s, roughly one in every 25 Americans were heavy opium users, most using daily. Between 1890 and 1900, a half a million pounds of opium was imported into the US. Morphine was the drug of choice for those wounded in war, sick people of all kinds, bored housewives, and even the doctors themselves. \n\nThat brings us to coal tar; the residue from coal gas extraction. It was discovered that you can make all kinds of stuff with it: plastics, fertilizers, explosives, synthetic fibers, rubber, drugs, etc. In 1863, a man named Friedrich Bayer began using coal tar to make dyes. He opened up his business, the Bayer Company. Unfortunately, the dye-making business wasn't doing too well. They would have gone bankrupt had it not been for them hiring a man named Carl Duisberg. Lucky for them!\n\nCarl Duisberg was a chemist. When Mr. Bayer died in 1880, Carl took over the company. He turned this dye-making business into the most powerful chemical company in the world. They went on to create the sedatives Sulfanol, Trional, and a barbiturate called Veronal, as well as the wonder drug: aspirin. But, the aspirin actually came out ten years after another one of their drugs hit the market. Yes friends, that would be heroin. \n\nIt wasn't long after that, that Carl Duisberg joined up with other high-profile businesses forming the most powerful cartel in the world: I.G. Farben. Neat huh? Unfortunately for the entire human race, Carl  Duisberg and the rest of I.G. Farben were, oh how should we put this... HUGE fans of Adolf Hitler. In fact, 24 of I.G.'s top men were tried for Nazi war crimes, as they were all serving in the Nazi government. How about that? And, all the companies that made up I.G. Farber are still thriving to this day. How exciting! -\\_-\n\nSo besides heroin, what else did they invent? Oh, right. chlorine and phosgene gases. You know, the first poisons used in world war I? Yeah. On April 22, 1915 at 5pm, 5000 metal cylinders filled with liquid chlorine were opened on the French lines, emitting a five-mile long cloud of greenish-yellow fog leaving 15,000 casualties, one-third of them dead. Carl Duisberg was personally involved in the research and creation of this gas, and was beyond excited for it to be used in the War. He knew he would be making BANK. And he did. \n\nNow, let's fast-forward 30 years. Do you recall the name of the deadly gas used in the chambers of Auschwitz? It was called Zyclon B. I'll give you one guess as to who invented this Zyclon B. If you said ol' Carl and friends, you would be correct! Yes, Zyclon B was sold to the Nazis by the THOUSANDS of gallons. In fact, 63% of their business was supplying Zyclon B to Auschwitz. And even tho the name BAYER was not on the cannisters, it is an absolute fact that Zyclon B was produced by I.G. Farben/Carl Duisberg/Bayer. Not only this, but the I.G. had a labor camp set up where thousands of prisoners were literally worked to death. I.G. Farben was played a crucial role in the rearming of Germany, developing and making munitions, synthetic rubber and fuels, making Hitler's design for European conquest possible. Without the I.G., there is zero chance Hitler would have been able to start the war. ZERO chance. They made it happen. \n\nOh, and there was another chemical they created. Ever heard of sarin? It's a nerve-gas. Nasty stuff. Hitler loved the idea of testing it on humans, in concentration camps, but didn't really want it being used as a weapon for fear it would do more harm that good. Thank fuck, right? You may, however remember sarin mentioned a time or two during the Gulf War? Thanks Carl and I.G. Farben! Ahhhh, money money money!\n\nOne last fun fact before I wrap this up: as WWII was coming closer, the Nazis were afraid that their opium supply would be cut off. And lord knows they were going to need some pain-killers for all the wounded and dying that were about to be. So, BAYER got to work and created a synthetic morphine substitute they called DOLOPHINE, in honor of Adolf Hitler. Today, it goes by a name you might be more familiar with: methadone. \n\nSo, there we have it. The birth of heroin by the BAYER COMPANY/nazi lovers/war criminals. Now, I dare you to go to [bayer.com/en/history](https://www.bayer.com/en/history) and read their version of the history of their company. 100% of the details I've written here seem to be missing from their version, however. Imagine that! \n\nI owe all of this knowledge to a person named Th. Metzger who wrote the book \"The Birth of Heroin and the Demonization of the Dope Fiend\" which I highly recommend you read. You can read it for free on the internet archives website, or you can buy a physical copy from [betterworldbooks.com](https://betterworldbooks.com).  Oh, yeah, and FUCK BAYER!!!",

The content of the FAQ is below.  Here is a link to the FAQ, which will continuously be updated, so you can check regularly.  I will continue to post updates using the most recent FAQ plus other information until things settle down.\n\n**Part of this is to address some of the rumours and concerns in the community with real information.**  The FAQ has been put together with input from Metro Vancouver air quality and Fraser Health.\n\nThe only thing I have to add for now is that sadly **the W did have to come down in pieces**.  I don't know about it's long-term future, which would be discussed with the community.  It was in pieces in the first place when installed, and the Wow Westminster art installation was created by artist Jos√© Resende, who has done similar installations in other cities, and it would not be at all impossible to replicate if the current installation could not be repaired - if the community wished for that to happen, which I am sure would be discussed.\n\nWith love and hope,\n\nJaimie McEvoy, City Councillor, New Westminster\n\n[https://www.newwestcity.ca/2020/09/13/westminster-pier-park-fire.php](https://www.newwestcity.ca/2020/09/13/westminster-pier-park-fire.php)\n\n**Westminster Pier Park Fire FAQs**\n\n**1.** **Is the fire still burning and when will it be extinguished completely?**\n\nThe fire may continue to smolder while crews work to dismantle the pier surface to better access the areas that continue to burn. New Westminster Fire and Rescue services is monitoring hot spots 24/7. We expect the fire will be largely extinguished by the weekend and is unlikely to intensify.\n\n**2.** **What is the cause of the fire?**\n\nThe investigation into how the fire started is ongoing. New Westminster Police Major Crime Unit detectives are working alongside New Westminster Fire and Rescue at the site. If you have any information on how the fire started, please contact the New Westminster Police Department at 604-525-5411.\n\n**3.** **How is the fire affecting air quality?**\n\nThere is currently an air quality advisory in effect for New Westminster and surrounding areas due to fine particulate matter in the air due to wildfire smoke and smoke from the Westminster Pier Park fire. Fine particulate matter, also known as PM2.5, refers to airborne solid or liquid droplets with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres (¬µm) or less. PM2.5 can easily penetrate indoors because of their small size.    Exposure to fine particulate matter can be a health concern for people with underlying health conditions such as lung disease, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and/or diabetes, individuals with respiratory infections such as COVID-19, pregnant women and infants, children, and older adults. Individuals who are socially-marginalized may also be at elevated risk.\n\nFraser Health and the City of New Westminster are regularly reviewing Metro Vancouver air quality reports and modelling of PM2.5 in New Westminster and will provide updates as the situation evolves.\n\nVisit the Fraser Health website for more information about the advisory.\n\n4. **Are the creosote pilings creating hazardous fumes?**\n\nThe pier pilings are covered by creosote. Creosote is a wood preservative made up of coal tar and other chemicals. Short term exposure to the burning of creosote can cause respiratory irritation; long-term exposure is not currently a concern, as this typically refers to exposure over years, not days or weeks.\n\n**5.** **I can smell smoke from inside my residence and/or business. What should I do?**\n\nAs per Fraser Health‚Äôs recommendations, we are urging anyone with chronic underlying health conditions or acute infections, including children and the elderly, to refrain from participating in any outdoor physical activity, and to remain indoors with windows closed as much as possible while still following COVID-19 protocols.\n\nFraser Health has advised that workplaces, schools, and daycares do not need to close but should limit any associated outdoor activities. No evacuation orders have been issued.\n\nAny person experiencing symptoms such as chest discomfort, shortness of breath, coughing or wheezing should visit the emergency department. In an emergency, please call 9-1-1.\n\n6. **Should I relocate myself and/or my family until the air quality advisory is removed?**\n\nThis is a personal choice for individuals and families. Factors impacting that decision would be an assessment of underlying health conditions of yourself or anyone in your home. Air quality is poor across the Metro Vancouver region with smoke shifting with the wind, so relocating may not result in having better air quality.\n\nHowever, if you are experiencing significant symptoms while staying inside, and you live adjacent to the pier, you may wish to relocate further away until the smoke from the pier subsides.\n\nFor ways to reduce further exposure, please see the FHA Air Quality Website\n\n**7.** **How can I keep myself and my family safe if we live in the area?**\n\nResidents are advised to keep windows and doors closed. Strenuous activities outdoors should be limited. An air purifier can help improve air quality in your home. These can be purchased at home stores and online (e.g. Canadian Tire, Walmart, Amazon etc.).\n\nFor ways to reduce further exposure, please see the Fraser Health Air Quality website.\n\n**8.** **What will happen to the W art structure?**\n\nFire crews and City engineers have worked since the onset of the fire to secure and save the iconic WOW New Westminster public art installation. Unfortunately, despite best efforts, the timber wharf structure that supports the W is significantly compromised, and the connection points to the art piece are also damaged to the point that the piece cannot be removed safely. The piece will be dismantled and removed from the site.\n\n**9.** **How will the fire impact the marine environment?**\n\nWe do not yet know the extent of the damage to the marine environment or remediation that will be required. We will be working with the Ministry of Environment and environmental consultants to perform structural and environmental investigations during the recovery and remediation phases.\n\n**10.When will access be available to the Front Street Mews?**\n\nAccess at the bottom of Sixth Street to the Front Street Mews to the west has been restored. Access to the east continues to be restricted due to the ongoing fire investigation.\n\n**11.When will Front Street fully reopen?**\n\nAccess to the Front Street Mews has now been restored to vehicle traffic west of Sixth Street. Access to the east is also available to pedestrians up to the 400 block.\n\n**12.When will the rest of Westminster Pier Park reopen?**\n\nIt is still too early in the investigation process to determine when the park will reopen. As soon as investigations are complete and the new portion of Westminster Pier Park has been assessed and determined to be safe, the park will reopen. Updates will be provided as more information is available.",

    "body": "**Introduction**\n\nI‚Äôve been seeing a lot of posts on this sub regarding sex, masturbation, adultery, fornication, *zina*, and so on. This is of course a hot button issue because many young people growing up outside of Muslim cultures probably struggle to conform to the ideals prescribed to them. Even growing up in a Muslim community this was the issue that my family went back and forth on the most. Conservatives from any faith love to harp on these issues too when they can, especially conservative Muslims, and as a woman my chastity was always my greatest virtue, and lack thereof was always regarded as a blight on society.\n\nAs I‚Äôve been having a tough time at work I figured I would adopt a pet project to busy my mind, and this topic seems like one I might be able to add some perspective to. I am not religious scholar, but I am a scientist with an interest in sex and LGBTQIA+ issues, so I‚Äôm going to leverage my training and see what kind of perspectives I can offer. I‚Äôll talk about what science seems to tell us about sex and intimacy, and how do mainstream interpretations of the text interact with what is ‚Äúbest practice‚Äù in the field, maybe add some of my own musings to wrap it up.\n\nSince I know there will be some who have opinions to share, let‚Äôs get some things out of the way right now.\n\n>I don‚Äôt care what science or you say, *zina* is *haram*.\n\nOkay. However, how you *define* *zina* can make a difference on how we interpret where the line is. Even if you believe that the definition of *zina* is incontrovertible and no further debate is required, I am not beholden to *your* definition, and you don‚Äôt have to read this post let alone agree with it. Live your life my blessed friend in faith.\n\n>Dating is *haram* as it leads to *zina*. The Islamic way is to ask for the girl‚Äôs hand in marriage through her parents.\n\nDating doesn‚Äôt *have* to be *haram*. Some people quote ahadith that suggest that men and women shouldn‚Äôt ever be alone with each other, but not everyone here follows ahadith, and I consider myself to be a hadith skeptic. So, I take this one with a grain of salt.\n\n>You‚Äôre just trying to justify sinful acts.\n\nOr you‚Äôre trying to curtail normal human behavior to have control; who‚Äôs to say?\n\n>I intend to wait till marriage and no one will tell me otherwise.\n\nGood for you, bud.\n\nI‚Äôll also be focusing almost entirely on cis-heteronormative relationships for this piece, not because it is not important to discuss but purely to simplify this already long, complex discussion. Additionally, I‚Äôll be using girls/women and boys/men as shorthand for assigned female at birth (AFAB) or assigned male at birth (AMAB), for the same reason as before but also as research on trans and gender non-conforming folks (GNC) is often very limited in this regard.\n\nI also want to note that while I am doing this to escape my terrible job, *this isn‚Äôt my job* so I am not treating it with the sagacity of my job. If I have a broken link, a missing citation, or linked an article with disputed methodology or analysis, I more than welcome constructive feedback, but I have done my best to not base my argument on a single source or reference (even when I have linked only one source). So, do not treat this essay as sacred and feel free to explore the links as much as you‚Äôd like.\n\n**What is sex?**\n\nSex is a normal biological function and need, as humans are one of the many animal species that reproduce sexually. Puberty, which is the process of sexual maturation, occurs between 8-13 years for  girls and 9-14 years for boys on average [(1)](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/puberty). While sex can be defined in many ways, when many people say ‚Äúsex‚Äù they are referring to penetrative vaginal intercourse. However, it can encompass anal penetration, oral sex, masturbatory acts, and even acts not normally regarded as sexual (e.g. tickling one‚Äôs feet, choking, etc) [(2](https://flo.health/menstrual-cycle/sex/sex-and-relationships/sex-definition#sex-definition)[,3)](https://serc.mb.ca/sexual-health-info/the-basics/what-is-sex/). Sex is not just a tool for reproduction, as I‚Äôm sure I don‚Äôt need to cite for humans, but several animal species engage in sex for pleasure [(4)](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20140613-do-animals-have-sex-for-fun). Sex can also have several physical, mental and emotional benefits, such as improved sleep, improved heart health, reduced depression and anxiety, to name a few. [(5)](https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sex-health-benefits#health-benefits). On the flip side, unprotected or irresponsible (but consensual) sex can result in getting a sexually transmitted infection or disease (STI/STD) and an unplanned and/or unwanted pregnancy, and even acute or chronic physical injury [(6)](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/sexual-health/sex-activities-and-risk/).\n\nUnlike what we assume, premarital sexual activity is very common among people young and old. A study that collected data from several African and some Asian countries showed that the probability of a Muslim person having had sex before marriage was 0.61 (or 61% when converted to a percentage), with Hindus at about 0.67 (67%), with the highest reported probability for someone from an organized faith being that for Buddhists at 0.84 (84%) [(7)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0003122412458672#table2-0003122412458672). It is important to remember that this number doesn‚Äôt actually tell us how many people have had premarital sex, but how *likely* a person from a group is to report that they have had sex before marriage. This number might be lower for Muslims and Hindus, for example, possibly because of the greater repercussions and social stigma associated with premarital sex, or because of actual lower participation in the act [(8)](https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2013/03/03/which-religions-have-most-premarital-sex/whTrXNlukf5nFRk9UlZ64I/story.html). The onset of sexual activity can also be very early‚Äîby age 18, nearly 55% of US teens report to have had sex [(9)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2017/201706_NSFG.htm), this is similar in the UK where the average age for ‚Äúsexual debut‚Äù is 17, and between one-third to half of teens have had sex by age 16 [(10)](https://www.nhsborders.scot.nhs.uk/patients-and-visitors/our-services/general-services/underage-sexual-activity-interagency-guidance/sexual-activity-and-the-under-sixteens/). Even in more conservative countries there is a similar trend. In India, the recent National Family Health Survey showed that 53% of women reported having premarital sex before they turned 18 and 10% reported that they had sex before they turned 15 [(11)](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-63953752). These numbers should still be interpreted with nuance, with consideration that self-report data does not give us a complete picture. Having said that, we still do see people beginning to engage in sex very early in their lives, outside of the covenant of marriage.\n\nAt this point I also want to quickly note that withholding sex education from adolescents is harmful. Particularly, abstinence-only sexual education (or sexual risk avoidance education) *does not work* as intended and is potentially harmful, and has been called as such by several medical and professional organizations [(12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5913747/)[,13)](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/abstinence-only-programs). While most of this research is from the US where abstinence-only education has been on the rise, there are compelling reasons to expand sexual education in countries such as India as well [(14)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4209665/). In summary, abstinence-only sex education does not reduce sexual activity in young people, and exposes them to harm from STIs/STDs, unwanted pregnancies, and unsafe or unwanted sexual experiences, and comprehensive sexual education is very important for teenagers and adults to have healthy sexual lives.\n\nSo far, I‚Äôve told you that sex is innate and normal, that many young people and adults engage in sex across the world regardless of religious affiliation, and that sex education should extend beyond abstinence. Now I want to ask: why do many of the world religions prohibit premarital sex, and what does the science say about it?\n\n**Religions and Sexual Morality**\n\nIn many Muslim countries, and even in Western societies, conversations around sex are often steeped in shame and guilt. Additionally, engaging in sex (even within marriage) often comes with a lot of social stigma and is considered especially taboo in certain contexts. And this has a lot to do with the religiosity of people‚Äîseveral studies show that the more religious someone is, the less likely they are to engage in premarital or nonmonogamous sex [(15](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ792808.pdf)[,16)](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-polyamorists-next-door/201401/religious-attitudes-towards-polyamory). Sexual morality is very important to several world religions, including Islam, and here are some reasons why. According to the reproductive-religiosity model, one motive in religiosity is to have a mating strategy that will result in long-term commitment, and so casual sex and other modes of noncommittal sex are discouraged so as to maximize the number of people reproducing in committed relationships. By restricting sex, religions also increase paternal buy-in into raising their children‚Äîif men feel more *confident* that the children are theirs, due to religiously-enforced monogamy in the context of relationships, they are more likely to stick around and raise them, and may discourage them to engage in polygamous behaviors. Furthermore, by establishing these sets of norms and expectations about sexual behaviors, religious people who are married may also receive more support in raising their children (known as alloparenting), which would incentivize people to only engage in monogamous, marital sex [(17](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X20301421)[,18)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X20301421). There are probably several other reasons that explain why religions focus so much on discouraging premarital sex, but I feel these do give a good overview of why sexual morality is central to religions, including Islam.\n\nIt's also worth exploring the role of Christianity in creating much of our understanding around sexual morality (especially as many Muslim countries are still recovering from their colonial pasts). One of the reasons to police sexual behavior was to maintain male-domination over society and religion‚Äîthe priests understood that by controlling people‚Äôs sex lives, they would have a lot of control over people‚Äôs lives in general, as they would have immense control over what amounts to be a ‚Äúsurvival function‚Äù for our species [(18](https://www.cybercollege.com/history.htm)). There is evidence to suggest that not all organized religions were inherently patriarchal in their initial stages, but the patriarchal societies they existed in eventually hijacked them to control women‚Äôs sexuality in particular, and ensure that in this way they can be controlled [(19)](https://feminisminindia.com/2017/06/22/religion-furthering-patriarchal-agenda/). In the same vein, as the Church was the primary authority in early stages of Christianity, and it was recognized that unrestricted sex could result in transmission of disease and multiple pregnancies (which was especially dangerous when early maternal age is correlated with maternal death and lower infant survival [(20)](https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2400-x)), religion was then the primary tool used to discourage people from having casual sex [(21)](https://www.cybercollege.com/history.htm).\n\n**Religiosity and its Role in Purity Culture and Sexual Shame**\n\nNow that we have some theories about why sexual prohibition is so central to world religions, we can ask if that‚Äôs worked out for the better. One study showed that religiosity is correlated with dysfunctional sexual beliefs and increased sexual pain [(22)](https://scholar.archive.org/work/337kzeisozbptbxnwagwiyo45y/access/wayback/https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/pfigshare-u-files/36594747/ReligiousandCulturalSexualPurityIdeologiesPainRelatedFemaleSexualDysfunctionandFemaleSexualPainScopingReview.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIYCQYOYV5JSSROOA/20220811/eu-west-1/s3/aws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220811T041019Z&X-Amz-Expires=10&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=9d33068a9c07a5a13ae283401284a653e8abb7079c183242789ad0315b82da93). Some studies have shown that Muslim women tend to report higher rates of sexual dysfunction due to vaginismus (a condition where penetrative sex is not possible or painful) [(23](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23686649_Marital_Satisfaction_Sexual_Problems_and_the_Possible_Difficulties_on_Sex_Therapy_in_Traditional_Islamic_Culture)[,24)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29678473/). The most common sexual dysfunction reported by married Arab Muslims was vaginismus, resulting in unconsummated marriages in 20-67% of couples [(25)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/EB14A87F556D7D4B82D76A1BA8013C96/S1754470X18000119a.pdf/cultural-aspects-of-vaginismus-therapy-a-case-series-of-arab-muslim-patients.pdf). These studies also acknowledge that people do not always seek sex therapy as these topics are often taboo in Muslim societies, so the scope of these studies (and their statistical power) is limited.\n\nMore concerning to me however, is how these ideas contribute to sexual shame and purity culture. Purity culture is often associated with white Evangelical Christians, but many Muslims are also susceptible to its lures. It places restrictive sexual expectations on both men and women, particularly teaching women that they must remain ‚Äúpure‚Äù and ‚Äúuntainted‚Äù for their husbands‚Äô pleasure, and that they must guard their worth and honor by preserving their virginity. This often gives fuel to religious commentators who might compare ‚Äúpious‚Äù women to covered candy, and ‚Äúpromiscuous‚Äù or ‚Äútainted‚Äù women to uncovered candy. Purity culture also teaches that women are responsible for sexual thoughts and actions that men make‚Äîthat the social fabric of society requires that women limit their freedom and liberties so that men not make ‚Äúmissteps‚Äù [(26)](https://lindakayklein.com/what-is-purity-culture/).\n\nPurity culture dehumanizes women, asserting that a woman‚Äôs moral value is not in her actions or inherent worth, but in her genitalia. Hence, many women feel like they are no longer pure or are unclean once they experience sexual assault or rape (and men might also feel the same) [(27)](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/09/elizabeth-smart-purity-culture-shames-survivors-sexual-assault). I also felt the same when I first had an unwanted sexual encounter, and when describing the experience in a poem, I said that ‚ÄúI am black, like coal tar dripping from the inside of my thighs‚Äù, ‚Äú‚Ä¶my sickness I can‚Äôt hide‚Äù, and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a lover, I‚Äôm a wench with legs for days‚Äù, which in retrospect was internalized purity culture and sexual shame.\n\nEndorsement of purity culture is also associated with rape myth acceptance (that are prejudicial and stereotyped beliefs about rape e.g. only bad girls get raped), and consideration of acquaintance rape or marital rape as not being rape at all [(28)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0091647120974992), and these beliefs have been modeled to be causally linked [(29)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12119-022-09986-2). In some traditional Islamic societies, women feel their womanhood is equivalent to their virginity, and loss of virginity has prompted attempts at suicide [(30](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1998/01/27/suicide-attempts-fuel-virginity-test-debate/b9267ef1-6dc0-4799-aab2-d6ea3bcb48e1/)[,29)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lut_Tamam/publication/274835302_Premarital_Sexual_Attitudes_and_Experiences_in_University_Students/links/552abf550cf2779ab792effb.pdf). Importantly, while religiosity itself need not be correlated with disorders of sexual pain, when the religious beliefs teach sexual shame and guilt, it is correlated [(31)](https://academic.oup.com/jsm/article/18/4/770/6956014).\n\nAll of this (and other factors that are beyond the scope of this essay) have contributed to societies around the world, and specifically in Muslim countries, that are deeply patriarchal and misogynistic, and harmful to women and their wellbeing. While there is an overwhelming amount of research to corroborate this, I particularly liked the graphical data compilation by WomanStats, which shows that many countries in Asia and Africa, including the Middle East, socially sanction murder of women [(32)](https://www.womanstats.org/vlbMAPS/images1/murderscale12016.jpg), have rape and sexual assault of women as an endemic issue [(33)](https://www.womanstats.org/vlbMAPS/images1/combinedscaleandsanctionofrape2011.jpg), have significant social barriers to reporting rape [(34)](https://www.womanstats.org/vlbMAPS/images1/strength_of_barriers_to_reporting_rape_2011tif_wmlogo2.jpg), and score very poorly the International Weighted Rape Scale [(35)](https://www.womanstats.org/vlbMAPS/images1/weightedinternationalrape2011.jpg).\n\n**Is Abstinence Bad?**\n\nIt might appear that I am trying to make the argument that the ideal of abstinence until marriage and monogamous commitment is bad and harmful. That is *not* the primary point of the preceding discussion, but the purpose has been to delineate the harms the kind of sexual morality policing many world religions, include Islam, engage in has produced for people, especially women. If someone chooses to abstain from sex or wishes to have sex in the context of a committed relationship, that is a completely valid choice and might even have some benefits. Some studies over the years have shown that people who have only one sexual partner, rather than multiple sexual partners, report more satisfaction in their marriage and are less likely to divorce, and this is not entirely accounted for by religiosity i.e. it isn‚Äôt only religious people who are more satisfied when they only have a single sexual partner [(36)](https://ifstudies.org/blog/does-sexual-history-affect-marital-happiness). However, the author notes that this effect is really small in his re-analysis of the literature (7%), and there are possibly other confounds that may account for this effect. Another study showed that rapid sexual involvement reduces marital quality, but only for women. Early sexual involvement also led to earlier cohabitation, which was associated with lower sexual satisfaction for women, though in this study other indicators such as marital quality and relationship satisfaction did not change [(37)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2012.00996.x). This is supported by other work that shows that the longer people waited to have sex, the higher marital satisfaction, better sex, better communication, and less consideration of divorce. They proposed that this *sexual restraint* helps relationships by encouraging people to intentional select their partners, rather than on the basis of sexual chemistry or attraction, and it also encourages people to develop the emotional aspects of their relationship [(38)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21171775/). I should note that I do suspect some of this research, as it comes from conservative thinktanks that have vested interest in purporting a certain ideal about sexual morality, but I did not observe red flags in these links so let‚Äôs assume the research is reliable. Abstinence from pornography consumption and masturbation in men has also been shown to have psychological benefits by reducing fatigue and improving wakefulness [(39)](https://vbn.aau.dk/ws/files/483977271/Open_Access_Article.pdf).\n\n**Islam and premarital sex**\n\nMost Muslims understand premarital sex to be *haram* (prohibited), and one of the major sins. The evidence from this comes from both the Quran and Hadith. In both sources, the operational term is *zina*, which occurs in the Quran nine times and has four derived forms. It is often translated as adultery or fornication, but more accurately it means *illicit sexual intercourse* [(40)](https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=zny). In the Quran, *zina* (or its derived forms are mentioned as follows (Yusuf Ali translation has been used for all Quranic translations).\n\n>**Nor come nigh to adultery : For it is a shameful (deed) And an evil, opening the road (To other evils).** (17:111)  \n>  \n>Those who invoke not, With God, any other god, Nor slay such life as God Has made sacred, except For just cause, **not commit Fornication** ;‚Äîand any that does This (not only) meets punishment. (25:68)  \n>  \n>**The woman and the man Guilty of adultery or fornication,‚Äî Flog each of them With a hundred stripes** : Let not compassion move you In their case, in a matter Prescribed by God, if ye believe In God and the Last Day : And let a party Of the Believers Witness their punishment. **Let no man guilty of Adultery or fornication marry Any but a woman Similarly guilty, or an Unbeliever : Nor let any but such a man Or an Unbeliever Marry such a woman** : To the Believers such a thing Is forbidden. (24:2-3)  \n>  \n>O Prophet ! When believing women come To thee to take the oath Of fealty to thee, that they Will not associate in worship Any other thing whatever With God, that they Will not steal, **that they Will not commit adultery (Or fornication)**, that they Will not kill their children, That they will not utter Slander, intentionally forging Falsehood, and that they Will not disobey thee In any just matter,‚Äì Then do thou receive Their fealty, and pray to God For the forgiveness (of Their sins) : for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. (60:12)\n\nAdultery and fornication are mentioned in the Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim compilation several times, but here is a selection of the ahadith:\n\n>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas: I did not see anything so resembling minor sins as what Abu Huraira said from the Prophet, who said, \"**Allah has written for the son of Adam his inevitable share of adultery whether he is aware of it or not**: The adultery of the eye is the looking (at something which is sinful to look at), and the adultery of the tongue is to utter (what it is unlawful to utter), and the innerself wishes and longs for (adultery) and the private parts turn that into reality or refrain from submitting to the temptation.\"  (Sahih Bukhari, Book #77, Hadith #609)  \n>  \n>Abdullah reported: I asked the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him): Which sin is the gravest in the eye of Allah? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: That you associate a partner with Allah (despite the fact) that He has created you. He (the reporter) said: I told him (the, Holy Prophet): Verily it is indeed grave. He (the reporter) said: I asked him what the next (gravest sin) was. He (the Holy Prophet) replied: That you kill your child out of fear that he shall join you in food. He (the reporter) said: I asked (him) what the next (gravest sin) was. He (the Holy Prophet) observed: **Then (the next gravest sin) is that you commit adultery with the wife of your neighbour**.  (Sahih Muslim, Book #001, Hadith #0156)  \n>  \n>Imran b. Husain reported that a woman from Juhaina came to Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) and she had become pregnant because of adultery. She said: Allah's Apostle, I have done something for which (prescribed punishment) must be imposed upon me, so impose that. Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) called her master and said: Treat her well, and when she delivers bring her to me. He did accordingly. Then Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) pronounced judgment about her and her clothes were tied around her and then he commanded and she was stoned to death. He then prayed over her (dead body). Thereupon Umar said to him: Allah's Apostle, you offer prayer for her, whereas she had committed adultery! Thereupon he said: She has made such a repentance that if it were to be divided among seventy men of Medina, it would be enough. Have you found any repentance better than this that she sacrificed her life for Allah, the Majestic?  (Sahih Muslim, Book #017, Hadith #4207)  \n>  \n>Abu Huraira reported that a person from amongst the Muslims came to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) while he was in the mosque. He called him saying: Allah's Messenger. I have committed adultery. He (the Holy Prophet) turned away from him, He (again) came round facing him and said to him: Allah's Messenger, I have committed adultery. He (the Holy Prophet) turned away until he did that four times, and as he testified four times against his own self, Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) called him and said: Are you mad? He said: No. He (again) said: Are you married? He said: Yes. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Take him and stone him. Ibn Shihab (one of the narrators) said: One who had heard Jabir b. 'Abdullah saying this informed me thus: I was one of those who stoned him. We stoned him at the place of prayer (either that of 'Id or a funeral). When the stones hurt him, he ran away. We caught him in the Harra and stoned him (to death). This hadith has been narrated through another chain of transmitters.  (Sahih Muslim, Book #017, Hadith #4196)  \n>  \n>'Ubada b. as-Samit reported that whenever Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) received revelation, he felt its rigour and the complexion of his face changed. One day revelation descended upon him, he felt the same rigour. When it was over and he felt relief, he said: Take from me. Verily Allah has ordained a way for them (the women who commit fornication),: **(When) a married man (commits adultery) with a married woman, and an unmarried male with an unmarried woman, then in case of married (persons) there is (a punishment) of one hundred lashes and then stoning (to death). And in case of unmarried persons, (the punishment) is one hundred lashes and exile for one year.**  (Sahih Muslim, Book #017, Hadith #4192)\n\nFrom these verses and ahadith, it is clear that *zina* is regarded a major sin, in the same category as shirk and theft. The punishment prescribed for adultery or fornication is a hundred lashes in public, while the hadith seem to prescribe stoning for fornication, though not all interpreters agree that hadith can abrogate the Quran, and would not agree with this prescribed punishment. Some other interesting observations we can make from the hadith is that there is lesser *zina* (such as *zina* of the eye) that is also sinful, that once one has been punished for (or has repented) for committing *zina*, they are free of blame, and that the Prophet (PBUH) was not eager to punish people who confessed to having committed *zina*, giving them the opportunity to recant their statements.\n\n**Why is premarital sex** ***haram*****?**\n\nAt this point you might be wondering: given what we know about sex as a biological function, its ubiquity around the world across cultures and religions, and the general lack of evidence that sex prior to marriage is harmful, coupled with evidence that policing sex has far-reaching, negative consequences‚Äîwhy does Islam strongly prohibit premarital sex? For this, I think it is useful to think about how we define *zina*, the people to whom the Quran was revealed, and how that message has persisted in the world we live in today.\n\nAs noted earlier, *zina* is the Arabic word for ‚Äòillicit sexual intercourse‚Äô, and this means the operational definition is decided by what was considered illicit in the Prophet‚Äôs time‚Äîsex outside of the bounds of a *nikah* contract. But the fact is that a *nikah* doesn‚Äôt have to look like a marriage in today‚Äôs time‚Äîit can be a contract with legal status, allowing a man and woman to be married in front of two witnesses (and in some schools of thought, without a guardian/*wali* for the woman).\n\nFrom the hadith, it is apparent to me that the Prophet (PBUH) did not wish for a society where people‚Äôs missteps, including them engaging in *zina*, condemned them to be ostracized from it indefinitely (though there are some ahadith that indicate that individuals engaging in *zina* should be banished for a year). The Prophet (PBUH) also did not pry or investigate people‚Äôs private lives, and the perpetuators of *zina* were either brought to him by witnesses or they confessed of their sin themselves. In the event of the confession, the Prophet (PBUH) gave them multiple chances to recant their confession. There is no evidence that I have found in the Quran, Sunnah or Hadith that women and their worth is tied to their sexual purity. The closest we come to it is 24:3, but even going through a very traditional tafsir, it is interpreted as such:\n\n>That is, only an adulterous woman is a fit match for an adulterous man who has not repented, or an idolatrous woman. No believing, virtuous woman can be a match for hull. It is forbidden for the Believers that they should give their daughters in marriage to such wicked people knowing them to be so. Similarly the tit match for adulterous women (who have not repented) can only be adulterous or idolatrous men; they are not fit for any righteous Believer. It is forbidden for the Believers that they should marry women who are known to possess immoral character. **This thing applies to those men and women who persist in their evil ways, and not to those who repent and reform themselves, for after repentance and reformation they will no longer be regarded as \"adulterous.\"** (Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi - Tafhim al-Qur'an)\n\nIt is also valuable to contextualize that these commandments came at the heels of an accusation of adultery made on Aisha (RA), wife of the Prophet (PBUH), where Allah not only speaks to the honor of Aisha (RA), Allah prescribes a punishment for people who make false accusations:\n\n>And those who launch A charge against chaste women, And produce not four witnesses (To support their allegation),‚Äî Flog them with eighty stripes ; And reject their evidence Ever after : for such men Are wicked transgressors ;‚Äî(24:4)\n\nThen, in today‚Äôs world, it seems that even in criminalizing acts of premarital sex, we have lost the essence of Allah‚Äôs commandments. After all, the purpose of these commandments was not to create sexual shame, or a culture of sexual purity, and it was not to police people‚Äôs personal lives. It would appear from these verses and many of the hadith, that the purpose was to preserve the moral character of Muslims, guard women and men against false accusations of impurity, and promote a family structure. In a society where birth control was errant and paternity could not have been confirmed, it makes sense that adultery and fornication would have dire consequences‚Äîunwanted children would be born, and they would not have systems of support, and animosity may breed between a husband and wife if the husband suspects her of infidelity. In today‚Äôs world, while this is still a pressing concern for much of the developing world (where birth control or paternity tests are not readily available, and social systems may or may not be in place for granting those children habitat), if you are living in the developed part of the world, many of these harms are avoidable. That does not nullify the commandment, but it does demand us to reconsider the righteousness of how we treat people who do engage in *zina*, and what we even consider to be *zina*.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn this essay, I have striven to demonstrate the following. Sex is a normal biological function that many humans engage in, starting at a young age and often outside of the covenant of marriage. Religions converged on sexual morality as a target for valid concerns, such as to preserve the family structure and prevent transmission of disease, as well as for more nefarious reasons such as to control men and women through a culture of policing sexual behavior. This has had far-reaching consequences in societies around the world, especially targeting women and their freedom of movement, and makes them susceptible to violence, rape, and social sanction. We see that we cannot substantiate this kind of policing or control through the Quran, Sunnah or Hadith, even if we are to take them on their face value. And in fact, there may be room to understand these laws and principles differently, now that the circumstances that largely motivated these prohibitions do not exist in the same way.\n\nNow, it is not important for you to agree with everything I‚Äôve said. You can fully believe that any kind of sexual intimacy prior to marriage is *haram*, and equivalent to *zina*, but I hope you can at least concede that what we are doing thus far does not work. The way we treat the subject of sex, the way women are especially condemned for their behavior in many Muslim societies, and the judgement we pass on people who do engage in premarital sex, does not create any good, and in fact has created a lot of harm. Moreover, Allah does not ask us to pry into people‚Äôs personal lives, or pass judgement onto their sins. Think that Allah also prohibits theft, lying, and slander in the same verse that *zina* is prohibited‚Äîis the social sanction for any of those actions comparable to *zina*? Is the way you perceive and relate to sex and *zina* in any way comparable to how you perceive lying? Do you think lying or committing slander a few times is just as damaging and harmful as committing *zina* once or twice? Do you imagine that someone who lies or steals is just as morally bereft as a *zani* or *zaniyah*?\n\nUltimately, I am not advocating for people to have unrestrained sex without the institution of marriage, but I am advocating for a version of a Muslim society where people who *do* engage in *zina* are not shunned from society, are not assumed to have a fundamentally lower self-worth or moral character, and can still avail safety and security in their community. While I think there are arguments to be made about what constitutes a *nikah* in the modern age, even if you do not revisit your definitions of *zina* and *nikah*, I hope you can widen your acceptance of people who engage in *zina*. I hope you can see that a truly Islamic society is not just one where people avoid casual sex, it is also only where we have no shame around our bodies, and women (and men) are safe and valued regardless of the sins they commit, and where we assume the best of people‚Äôs intentions, not their worst. The prohibitive, cruel cultures we live in are not Islamic, no more than pre-Islamic Arabia‚Äîand it is now on us to find the straight path.",

And even when elaborated, the arguments and support are so painfully flawed on so many levels that my brain bleeds out my ears.

        "body": "Birth control really changed to consequences of zina, but only in terms of pregnancy, the psychological impact and risk of STIs remains. I think the distinction that the Qu'ran states between premarital zina and extra marital zina is really important. It's clear to me that sex in an unmarried but committed relationship is much less haram than someone who engages in casual sex or even worse cheats on their committed partner.\n\nI also think that a lot of the strictness that some modern Muslims in the west follow is a necessary counterculture to absolute madness that the west has fallen into. The western culture really is reaching a point of compete moral decay. Most western people meet their long term partners by having a string of drunken sexual misadventures, often sex is seen as less of a symbol of a relationship than holding hands. It is completely normal in the west to reveal yourself to someone else in the most complete and intimate way, and then still be questioning whether you are in a relationship or not.\n\nIt doesn't surprise me that the average age of losing virginity is 17. Virginity just isn't seen as a virtue but is something to get rid of, and often western people will not date someone who doesn't want sex until marriage, as it is seen as unromantic, cold and old fashioned.\n\nSo yes while the Islamic world needs to less harsh and judgemental on people, this extends beyond just zina. People would focus on their own morality and the morality of others should be left up to others. On the other hand, western culture does need to take a look at itself and realise that marriage exists for a reason beyond just pregnancy and religious dogma. People should be taught the value of committed relationships and marriage, not just be told it's a thing you have to do because it's \"the rules\".",

        "body": "There is still significant pearl clutching when it comes to approaching polytheism & sexuality in Abrahamic religions. Religious texts are worded very cleverly, so that many ppl who try to repress it wouldn‚Äôt catch on; if you read between the fine lines and wonder about the examples brought forward, we need to wonder whether we are dealing with social conditioning and culture or divine revelation? \n\nWhat I said about scripture being clever is not meant to be taken that the scripture or religion itself is ‚Äòflawed‚Äô, but rather an acknowledgement and effort into fitting the idea inside our head. A lot of the internal *jihad* is between the head and scripture, IMO. There‚Äôs a tendency for people to be more nuanced with many subjects, but purity is an absolute stop with no other way around. This reminds me of LGBT+ friendly feminist and left-wing communities who treats sex workers with condescension and try to gaslight those that actually *did* choose their profession, that in actually, they did not have a choice. \n\nThis reveals more of our lack of understanding of how these things affect people. The fact that laws based on Abrahamic religions often have these kinds of impossible requirements in order be proven guilty on human trial, as demonstrated by 'Isa & Muhammad (SAW) could be them trying to bring some ‚Äòsense‚Äô by conveying to authorities (and most ppl for that matter) using the kind of language *we* would understand, especially coming from purity culture. I have seen this being used for benevolent purposes before when we try to talk sense into a deeply ignorant person.\n\nMuhammad (SAW) had his personal views influenced by the culture of the time. However, it was revealed through Jibril in such a way that I‚Äôve wondered this historical and modern application of *zinah* was **NOT** how it was originally revealed.\n\nWhen we apply kalam and fiqh through a secular perspective, our Denial sometimes push through and we refuse to look further and see the contradictions between how prophets apply those principles and Intelligent/Divine Design or Natural Law, as opposed to societal norms and deeply entrenched beliefs.\n\nScripture is 1/3 Book; the other 1/3 is Logos and 1/3 Pathos.

What i have learned the hard way is that have u noticed when they prescribe you smth for example hair and face and the company or brand of the product is the same even if they gave u 100 products they all have the same brand and  that is because of the CONTRACT that they have with these brands so they will prescribe it to you even if it not the best solution for you they don‚Äôt care (i now this bcs i‚Äôve been switching doctors for almost 3 years). My sister‚Äôs boyfriend told me about an old school doctor who‚Äôs a retired dermatologist and he told me that she don‚Äôt use branded medication&shampoos she just prescribes people what she knows work 100%.\nWhen i went there as soon as she saw me she started writing and for my hair everything i got prescribed was a baby sensitive shampoo and a salysalicis acid serum just these two nothing else at all. At first i was like‚Ä¶ this is some BS cause aint no way from all the things i have tried some baby shampoo gonna fix my dermatitis and le tme tell u within a week my hair became the best they had ever ever been in years and now 2 years later im still using the same two things and they still work just as well. The rutine i had was to wash my hair every 2 days with the baby shampoo and put the saliysilic acid every other day and when its bottle is finished then i used it once a week. And if u have seb derm on the face too the thing thats been a perfect result after years of sufering is URIAGE Regulation Soothing Emulsion and for cleaning the face i just use water cotton pads. \n\nI tried to be as clear as i could i hope this helps u or anyone with sebderm.\n\nGod bless you people cause i know the sufferings of living with Sebderm.",

The collective list was one of the more alarming things that I've read:\n\n**[Saccharin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharin#History)**\n\n>Saccharin was produced first in 1878 by Constantin Fahlberg, a chemist working on coal tar derivatives in Ira Remsen's laboratory at the Johns Hopkins University. (As discussed below, the relative contributions of Fahlberg and Remsen to the discovery were later contested, with no final resolution in sight; the 1879 paper announcing the discovery lists both names as authors, with Fahlberg's name first.) Fahlberg noticed a sweet taste on his hand one evening, and connected this with the compound that he had been working on that day.[10][11]\n\nWow.  That sounds kinda dangerous; what *other* newly-synthesized substances had he been eating?\n\nI guess maybe this thing was common, though, at one point...it *was* back in the 1800s.  Let's move on...\n\n**[Aspartame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartame#Discovery_and_approval)**\n\n> Aspartame was discovered in 1965 by James M. Schlatter, a chemist working for G.D. Searle & Company. Schlatter had synthesized aspartame as an intermediate step in generating a tetrapeptide of the hormone gastrin, for use in assessing an anti-ulcer drug candidate.[19] He accidentally discovered its sweet taste when he licked his finger, which had become contaminated with aspartame, to lift up a piece of paper.[8][20][21]\n\nOuch.  That's 1965, and chemists are still swallowing new substances that they've developed.  Well, at least we hopefully learned from that not to lick fingers in the lab to pick up paper.\n\n**[Acesulfame potassium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acesulfame_potassium)**\n\n> Acesulfame potassium was developed after the accidental discovery of a similar compound (5,6-dimethyl-1,2,3-oxathiazin-4(3H)-one 2,2-dioxide) in 1967 by Karl Clauss and Harald Jensen at Hoechst AG.[6][7] After accidentally dipping his fingers into the chemicals with which he was working, Clauss licked them to pick up a piece of paper.[8]\n\nOr not...\n\nWell, that was still the '60s, and these were all unintentional contamination incidents.  I suppose that the occasional error will slip through.\n\n**[Sucralose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucralose)**\n\n> Sucralose was discovered in 1976 by scientists from Tate & Lyle, working with researchers Leslie Hough and Shashikant Phadnis at Queen Elizabeth College (now part of King's College London).[4] While researching ways to use sucrose and its synthetic derivatives as an insecticide, Phadnis was told to test a chlorinated sugar compound. Phadnis thought Hough asked him to \"taste\" it, so he did.[7] He found the compound to be exceptionally sweet.\n\nArgh.\n\nIt really makes me wonder (a) how many not-strong-tasting substances are eaten by chemists on a regular basis and (b) how many artificial sweeteners we've produced but simply never discovered, because nobody has yet accidentally put the substance in their mouth.\n",

I used to have super oily scalp and hair when my symptoms first started, but now its dry(diagnosed with pcos 1yr ago). Anyone else? \n\nEDIT: As this post is quite popular I've compiled a list of products(with active ingredients) to try:\n\nT-sal(salicylic acid)\n\nJas√∂n dandruff relief(salicylic acid and sulfur)\n\nHead and shoulders(versions with zinc pyrithione or selenium sulfide) check the label\n\nT-gel(coal tar)\n\nSelsun blue(selenium sulfide) \n\nNizoral(Ketoconazole)\n\nUse them on scalp and wait 5-10 minutes before rinsing the foam.\nThen I recommend putting a conditioner on ur hair, but not scalp. Active ingredients can be drying \n\nMy dermatologist said putting essential oils on scalp can irritate and worsen hairloss so I avoided the products with tea tree oil, but it works for some people. \nTry a different active ingredient shampoo if you're not seeing results. I'm seeing some results with jas√∂n shampoo, but read  selenium sulfide is even better so that's what I'm trying next.",

What has worked for me at various times:: \n\n* apple cider vinegar + water 1:1 (or 1:2 if you're very sensitive) ratio sprayed on the scalp & left for a few minutes before being rinsed out. I played around with doing it before shampoo and after. After left my hair softer & not needing to follow up with conditioner. \n* oat flour + plain yogurt scalp mask. Oat flour can be made with a coffee grinder & regular oatmeal. It's important that the yogurt not have sugar. Mix together, apply to scalp, leave on for 10-15 minutes & follow your normal hair routine.\n* aloe vera + raw honey \"shampoo\"/mask. Can be used as a scalp mask, or \"shampoo\". It needs to sit on the scalp for a minimum of ~3 minutes. The aloe must actually be from the plant & not the shelf stable stuff sold during the summer that's dyed blue or green. Add a splash of hot water to 1 tablespoon of honey to make a runny consistency, add 2 tablespoons of aloe, mix thoroughly, apply, massage into scalp, & rinse. This usually left my hair soft without having to follow it up with regular shampoo or conditioner. \n\nAs with anything, your results may vary. \n\nEdit: these aren't supposed to be used all at once, but are three different things to try one at a time. You might only want to try one & that's fine. You should see how your scalp reacts before trying a different option. If this is too crunchy granola & none of this interests you, that's okay too. :)",

They're white, so the skin flakes don't stand out, and the laundry runs 24/7 so I'm always comfortable and clean.\n\nFood is fresh, healthy, delicious - and whether you're doing whole food vegan, or avoiding trigger foods, or cheese is the only joy left in your life, your needs are catered for.\n\nFeeling itchy? Perhaps a moisturising massage with cool lotions in a colder room. There's dermatologists on site to find the treatments and solutions that work for you.\n\nThere's things to do, of course, a gym, salt water swimming pool, yoga classes for those whose skin isn't too tight to move. Quiet reading rooms, a small cinema with reclining chairs and blankets, little crafting sessions.\n\nAll your classic beauty salon treatments; manicures, massages, facials - but done by people experienced with psoriasis, so there's no fear, no shame, no sitting in a public salon worried that other customers are looking at you.\n\nAt night, there's smooth, cool, sheets, satin pillowcases, and your last cream/ointment massage of the day is never greasy.\n\nYou can stay as long as you like, and magically it's all covered by the NHS or your health insurance, so it doesn't cost a penny.\n\n----\n\nWhat did I miss?\n\n\nEdit: Updating to add some excellent new suggestions from the comments.\n\nThere's an army of roombas working non-stop (quietly) to collect all the flakes, so not only are we less self-conscious, but there's less guilt about leaving a trail for the cleaners. The robots are handling it.\n\nAfter our lunch, we can take a stroll onto our private beach. There's a tropical climate and the seawater is warm, so we can get our sun exposure and bathe in the clear blue waters. Plenty of umbrellas for those of us who are a little photosensitive, and lots of showers to get all the sand off without being abrasive.\n\nI may also add those swimming pigs from the Bahamas, less for the psoriasis and more because I think they'd be cool. This is my fantasy, so I'm having swimming pigs.",

Those were my hands!! Not really, but VERY similar. \nIn recent months another of you posted a photo of your neck, broken out in a very different way from my ‚Äúregular eczema‚Äù but the same. A commenter suggested coal tar‚Äîsomething I had on hand in the form of T/Gel shampoo but never thought of applying directly to my neck. THANK YOU. \nI could go on with more helpful tips... FWIW, I see my medical professionals and do everything prescribed...

So no gloves, no eye protection, bunsen burners, no inert conditions, we were lucky to have NMR.\n\nIn my phd i had to make a series of polyazolic ensembles, including tetrazolyltetrazole (C2H2N8), which, if you think of it, has more % nitrogen than the air (or at least that was what we joked about it). I know about Klapotke, and I am not from his group.\n\nI've made a bunch of organic azides, and honestly they are not bad at all. I am from a poor country originally, so we even have gloves in my first year of grad school, and then in my third year I had to wear the same pair for a couple of weeks. We had NMR broken for a couple of months, and the way I knew I made the compound was dropping a bit of it on the hot plate - if I saw a small pfft-boom, then I made it.\n\nThe worst was methyl azide. Even I wore gloves for it. The procedure is as follows: add dimethyl sulfate into a solution of NaN3, and CH3N3 evolves as a gas which you have to collect into a flask cooled by liquid N2. I accidentally dropped a drop of Me2SO4 on my glove, and even tho I took it off right away, I still have a scar on that spot on my hand.\n\nI had a couple of accidental explosions, but the hood sashes were strong, I just had to clean the inside of the hood from all the silicon oil from the hot bath.\n\nDid a lot of brominations too. One time the stopcock from the sep funnel fell off and Br2/CHCl3 poured on my hand (no gloves, poor country). I was fine, no consequences.\n\nHad all kinds of inorganic acids eat through my lab coat and get on my skin. No permanent damage.\n\nIn my postdoc years (moved to the US and adopted all needed safety rules) I dealt with organotin compounds, but they are not too bad too, compared to organocadmium or organomercury. I'm not saying they are not bad, just not as bad in comparison. Did a total synthesis of a very toxic natural compound. THF Na-benzophenone still is very freaky.\n\nBut no, g-d save me from using t-BuLi, no thank you.",

    "body": "I've had pretty bad dandruff that comes and goes. Sometimes it's bad, sometimes it's barely noticeable. But when it's bad, I get a lot of flakes and a lot of itching. I've had this for years now. Nothing helped substantially. I found this product at my grocery store. It has coal tar in it, whatever tf that is. It smells bad. But damn it works. I massaged it into my hair when I showered and let it sit there for 5 minutes then I rinsed it out thoroughly. As I rinsed it out, literally half my flakes came off my scalp. 50% better right off the back. I used it the next two days, and it got rid of the rest. You have to use conditioner after you rinse it out because it smells pretty bad. After you use conditioner, you can't smell it anymore. This cures my dandruff for weeks at a time. When it starts coming back, I just use it for another 3 or 4 days. It's really powerful stuff, not something to use daily regularly. I highly recommend it if you've never used it. It was like $7.\n\nEdit: I'm glad you all find this helpful. I forgot to mention something in my post. When you use this shampoo, you're going to notice an increase in flakes. This is because the flakes are coming off your scalp and falling off. So don't think it's making it worse. It only lasts a few days while it all falls off.",

Yes. \n\nAbout 6 weeks ago, I posted a pic of me with my head shaved (38yo F). The idea was to get some sunshine on the old melon to help clear my scalp psoriasis. I had lost a ton of hair from using salicylic acid and coal tar shampoos daily, scale removal, the alcohol base for my clobetasol, and some just from the constant inflammation. I had curly hair down to my bra strap that I wore up constantly to hide my bald and thinning spots. So, below you will find an update on my progress. \n\nThe sad stuff:\nThe sun hasn‚Äôt really helped any, but it was worth a try. \nThe efficacy of my biologic seems to have bottomed out, so the inflammation hasn‚Äôt really diminished. \nA server at a restaurant I frequent worried I might have cancer since she saw me wearing my hats whenever I was in. \n\nThe good stuff:\nMy head is so incredibly easy to treat!\nThe scaling is down due to the fact that I can more easily remove it with the shampoos and lotion with urea in it. It‚Äôs so much less messy, too. \nThere is no more hair to pull on the inflamed areas. \nBaby fine hair is growing back on the big (full hand sized) bald spot on the back left hand side of my head. \nThere is the tiniest bit of hair beginning to grow back on the (slightly larger than a golf ball) bald spot on the right side of my head. \nI have hope for hair to grow back on my ‚Äúlighting streak‚Äù (line of psoriasis stretching from my crown, behind my right ear, and to my neck).\nIt turns out, I like having no hair, like the way I look without it, and I am completely comfortable and confident with it!\nThere are so many cute hats and scarves to wear when I need to look more ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù\nThere is absolutely no style more ‚Äúwash and wear‚Äù\nI have an awesome Halloween costume ready - Negasonic Teenage Warhead (from Deadpool). \n\nHonestly, when I first shaved it, I was a little worried, but if I had to do it all over again, I would‚Äôve done it sooner. It has been freeing, and I am so much more comfortable. It feels great to feel the sun and breeze on my head - especially in my new baby fine regrowth! Lol. \n\nAnyway, that‚Äôs my update, and if you are thinking about buzzing it all off because of your psoriasis (or just because), I highly recommend it. \n\nBest wishes and good luck my fellow sufferers. Sometimes even if something doesn‚Äôt work the way we thought or hoped it might, it ends up being worth the try anyway. \n\n\n\n",

I‚Äôm pretty shocked, and obviously experiences differ, but this is how things played out for me. It might help someone make sense of something.\n\nHad pretty bad atopic dermatitis since birth, cleared up majorly from 2021-2022 but started flaring badly after I got COVID in late 2022. I didn‚Äôt put 2 and 2 together at the time but I‚Äôd been mostly vegan and basically dairy free for the prior 2 years. Could only consume milkshakes for a while and that I started eating dairy again.\n\nTreated my increasingly bad SD for a year with everything under the sun, ketoconazole, selenium, zinc, coal tar, ACV, MCT, fluconazole, elidel from a dermatologist- nothing. Then comes the elimination diet. I eat a meal comprised of solely dairy and boom. I‚Äôve grown uncomfortably familiar with the ‚Äòhistamine feeling‚Äô triggered by pollen, dust, mould, some nuts etc. and I felt it full blown.\n\nSince then I‚Äôve gone entirely dairy free and I‚Äôm seeing results in just a couple of days. I‚Äôll check back in if I have another flare, but the relief is crazy right now. I‚Äôve always had IBS symptoms triggered by dairy but never bad enough to fully cut it out, I‚Äôm kind of shocked  I didn‚Äôt put two and two together sooner. I tried pushing for an allergy test with two GPs and they never followed up, but I seem to have found a major trigger at least.\n\nEDIT:  I was diagnosed with atopic dermatitis as a baby, and first had signs of seb derm at 15-16. It was officially diagnosed early last year.",

It comprises ingredient safety, registration fees, resources for small businesses, labeling regulation and more.\n\nIf passed, the act would initially prohibit use of the following:\n\n* Oxybenzone, Octinoxate, and Octocrylene (sunscreen filters)\n* Butylated Hydroxyanisole (BHA) and Butylated Hydroxyoluen (BHT) (antioxidant and preservative boosters)\n* Coal tar dyes (p-Phenylenediamine) (color additive and medicine, found in shampoos for scalp treatments and hair dyes for dark colors)\n* Cocamide Diethanolamine (surfactant/emulsifying agent)\n* Dibutyl Phthalate (Phthalates DBP), Bis(2-ethylhexyl) Phthalate (DEHP) (fragrances)\n* Toluene (fragrance)\n* Styrene, Styrene Acrylates (polymers, film formers)\n* Formaldehydes (methylene glycol/methandeiol/formaldehyde) and Formaldehyde-releasing preservatives (DMDM hydantoin, diazolidinyl urea, imidazolidinyl urea, methenamine, quaternium-15, and sodium hydroxymethylglycinate) (AKA our favorite preservative, Germall Plus)\n* Tricolsan (antibacterial/antifungal agent, found in antibacterial soaps and hand sanitizes)\n* Lead acetate and other lead compounds (color additive in hair dye products)\n* Parabens (iso¬≠pro¬≠p¬≠yl¬≠paraben, iso¬≠bu¬≠t¬≠yl¬≠pa¬≠ra¬≠ben, phenylpa¬≠raben, ben¬≠zyl¬≠¬≠pa¬≠ra¬≠ben, pentylpa¬≠raben, propylparaben and butylpar¬≠aben) (AKA the most effective preservatives)\n\nListed ingredients have the potential to be removed if they are later deemed \"safe\", under the act's definitions. Manufacturers would have one year to reformulate their products to eliminate aforementioned banned ingredients.\n\nAn additional list would be created of at least 300 ingredients to be assessed, to which 100 further ingredients would be added annually until all ingredients that are used in the formulation or manufacture of cosmetics have been added for review.\n\n>‚ÄúMost Americans would be shocked to realize that cosmetics are one of the least regulated consumer products on the market. Yet the average American uses about ten of them every day. That translates to being exposed to about 126 unique chemicals from your personal care products. This includes countless products families use on their babies and children.  \n>  \n>That‚Äôs why today I‚Äôm introducing the Safe Cosmetics and Personal Care Products Act of 2018. This bill not only calls for full disclosure of the many chemicals in our products but would ban toxic ingredients, including carcinogens, in them. This bill takes a step that should have already been taken ‚Äì consumers, families, and workers have been at risk for far too long. We need to ban toxic beauty and personal care products and give the Food and Drug Administration the resources it needs to keep Americans safe, including recall ability.‚Äù said Schakowsky in a [statement](https://schakowsky.house.gov/press-releases/schakowsky-introduces-bill-banning-toxic-ingredients-from-personal-care-products/).\n\n&#x200B;",

California is already dealing with this as a result of Proposition 65. There's warning labels everywhere, no one even reads them anymore. Why on earth would they want to take this joke of a policy nationwide? Can't they learn from California's mistakes?\n\nAs far as banning preservatives - in some ways, wouldn't it be good for cosmetics companies if cosmetics had a shorter shelf life across the board? It'd force people to buy cosmetics more often. I always wonder about the influence of lobbyists when I read something like this.",

I will post vote cards (who voted for what) when it is available. \n\nSide note, if you want a great live Twitter feed during city council meetings, check out our local TPR resident, [Joey Palacios](https://twitter.com/Joeycules)\n\nIn my haste, I forgot to mention two items in that post that were up for vote today. They are as follows: \n\nItem [16-3428](https://sanantonio.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=2768015&GUID=96A7748E-7CF7-4CE0-80EB-83CFAE5D2E0D)\n\nPosting Language: An Ordinance limiting the idling of heavy-duty vehicles to five minutes within specific areas of San Antonio's city limits, allowing for exemptions of certain vehicles; establishing an administrative penalty fee; appropriating funds from the Energy Efficiency Fund balance for public outreach efforts; and, establishing an effective date of January 1, 2017.\n\nELI5 Version: This ordinance would authorize the fining of people who let their vehicles idle for too long in hopes of slowing emission of harmful pollutants. \n\nMy Thoughts: Vote to pass this ordinance. \n\nItem [16-3763](https://sanantonio.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=2768035&GUID=50D1655B-F15D-49C4-97EE-CAD8FB0B2A7D)\n\nPosting Language: An Ordinance in the City of San Antonio City limits banning Coal Tar Sealant Pavement Products; establishing an administrative penalty fee; and, authorizing an effective date of January 1, 2017.\n\nELI5 Version: The city would like to stop the use of all coal-tar sealants used to seal roads and parking lots with the thought that it will reduce air pollutants and reduce the chance of aquifer pollution. Many other cities have similar ordinances. \n\nMy thoughts: Vote to pass this ordinance. \n\nAs always, these posts are meant to be informative and encourage you to become more involved with your local government. [This page](https://www.sanantonio.gov/council) has tons of information regarding contacting your local elected officials. \n\nI am always looking for feedback on these, so if you have something you would like to see, let me know. \n",

    "body": "I get a pretty heavy buildup of skin on my crown (and crown only) that is not associated with any kind of discharge, rash, scaling, swelling, redness, itchiness, or pain.  It comes off in white flakes with a kind of waxy feel.  I do my best to remove it when I wash my hair, but it consistently returns within a day or so.  This first started happening a few years ago after I switched to using sulfate, paraben, etc. free shampoo and conditioner (Kind Natured), but has not resolved after switching back to \"regular\" hair stuff, and the fact that I never had any problems whatsoever with scalp flaking before the switch (not even occasional stray flakes) makes me suspect the timing may have been a coincidence, instead of it revealing a problem I had unknowingly been keeping in check.  I also don't see how it could have outright caused a problem that has persisted so long after stopping use of the product.\n\nFull list of things I have tried for at least a period of several washes each:\n\n* **Dandruff treatment suite** (**OTC ketoconazole shampoo**, **pyrithione zinc conditioner**, **pyrithione zinc leave-in scalp solution**) (no effect beyond that of unmedicated shampoo and conditioner)\n* Normal shampoo and conditioner (lots of different ones, right now Bed Head Tigi Urban Antidotes Recovery Level 2) (baseline)\n* **Clarifying shampoo** (VO5 Herbal Essences) (no noticeable effect)\n* Shampooing twice with normal shampoo (no noticeable effect)\n* Shampooing twice with clarifying shampoo (no noticeable effect)\n* Pre-treating scalp with **coal tar shampoo** (DHS) (helps remove buildup, but it comes back within the same amount of time)\n* Pre-treating scalp with **30% AHA solution** (The Ordinary) (helps remove buildup, but it comes back within the same amount of time--have experimented with leaving it on longer than the max suggested time, haven't gotten a chemical burn \\[guessing because of how much buildup is shielding my living scalp\\] but it doesn't seem to have any additional effect when I do this)\n* Pre-treating scalp with **apple cider vinegar** straight out of the jug (helps remove buildup a little, but it comes back within the same amount of time)\n* Deep conditioning with my various conditioners (no noticeable effect)\n* Only using a small amount of leave-in conditioner (no noticeable effect)\n* Stuff with **tea tree oil** in it (no noticeable effect)\n\nI can't find anything I haven't already tried when searching for help, which is frustrating because I feel like I can't be the only person with this problem.  Do you have any other ideas on the same level of intensity as what I've already tried (way past the point of diluted ACV and a little tea tree oil being able to solve all my problems)?  Does this sound like some kind of medical condition?\n\nLast notes:\n\n* The only other hair/scalp products I use are topical minoxidil solution (Kirkland) for androgenic hair loss (same reason using Recovery Level 2, for brittle hair), occasionally a bit of aloe for a cowlick, and even more occasionally, dry shampoo.  I started minoxidil after being \"diagnosed\" with dandruff, stopped for a period of time, then re-started.  None of this had any effect on the flaking except making it more or less \"moisturized\" from the PG (which my skin is not sensitive to).\n* I have very short hair that gives me easy access to my scalp.  It could only be easier if I shaved my head.  Stuff I try to apply to my scalp is definitely making it onto my scalp and not getting lost in hair.\n* I have no other skin conditions except hormonal acne, moderate at its worst when I was in high school, and no hormone disorders unless you count the effects of finasteride.  I also have no problems with my hair feeling dry, oily, crunchy, etc.\n* I am a 25 year old white man with a 2A/2B hair texture.\n\nEDIT: Compilation of suggestions from the comments, for future people with the same problem who find this post:\n\n* Some kind of **salicylic acid** treatment (salicylic acid is a beta hydroxy acid, which is oil-soluble and penetrates deeper into the skin than alpha hydroxy acids)\n\n* Install a **shower water filter** (if you live in an area with hard water)\n\n* Use a **silicone scalp massager brush** to loosen the buildup before washing\n\n* Try **topical antifungals other than ketoconazole**; the problem could potentially be a fungal infection with atypical presentation\n\n* A **scalp scrub** or **exfoliating shampoo** will physically remove buildup\n\n* Make sure you **try new things long enough for them to work**.  Results may take awhile to show\n\n* Someone messaged me directly to suggest **Veterinary Formula Clinical Care Antiparasitic & Antiseborrheic Shampoo**, which contains coal tar, salicylic acid, and micronized sulfur.  It comes in a pretty big bottle and is very affordable, $9 each.\n\n* A **pre-poo oil mask** could make it easier to remove loosened buildup, and will keep your scalp and hair from getting dried out from...\n\n* **Washing your hair every day**, especially when you first start trying something medicated, like ketoconazole shampoo.  This goes hand-in-hand with giving something time to work",

Your hair will feel nice and fluffy and not get as oily as fast right after, but don‚Äôt continue doing that because you‚Äôll damage your hair and you‚Äôll be triggering your scalp to produce more oil to replace what was stripped when using this often.

Try and avoid any super heavy shampoos during this time as those usually only make the dry scalp worse for me.

I think it's most likely the best treatment for seborrheic dermatitis since it treats the scalp issue and you get added benefits from the oil such as hydration, natural oil balance, etc. \n\nA lot of treatments such as nizoral and coal tar are good but they are very drying which causes your body to overproduce sebum which the fungi feed on. \n\nMCT oil addresses the fungi without dehydrating the scalp, instead it actually does the opposite which amazing since your sebum is regulated. \n\nI've seen people say that MCT oil does not work for them but the thing about oils, it has to actually touch and penetrative your scalp to actually get any benefits out of it which is why, if you have very thick scaling of dandruff the oils will be very limited in its penetrative ability. The best thing for removing the scaling that I've found is using a medicated shampoo which softens the flakes (coal tar and even a salicylic acid shampoo would work well). Once you've done that and your scalp is completely clear, massage some mct oil with your fingers directly into your scalp and make sure you leave it in your scalp for at least a day. \n\nDo this every 2-3 days and you'll get the most out of MCT oil. \nThe main thing that's important to remember is keeping the MCT oil on your scalp for a long period of time instead of washing it off after 2-3 hours which is not enough time for the oil to work on the scalp properly.\n\nI've noticed a significant difference in itching and general dandruff when I left it on my scalp compared to only keeping it on for 2-3 hours and washing it off.

Went from itchy at night and during the day and when I‚Äôd wash my face, to feeling fine. I only started using it there a few days ago, but I‚Äôve used it on the top of my nose months ago.\n\nTacrolimus helped but only temporarily, and the itchiness was still there, probably because it just reduced the inflammation but the fungus was still there.\n\nI‚Äôve used it after I exhausted other options already.\n\nI‚Äôve also used it for a terrible flare up that left the top of my nose crusty and flaky for 2+ weeks. MCT oil once a day for a week was enough to completely get rid of it for MONTHS. I say months because I haven‚Äôt needed to use it (top of nose) since I started it almost 3 months ago, so the effects were long lasting enough but I don‚Äôt have super long lasting proof.\n\nSide note, I had two itchy and raised but smooth bumps near my nose but not directly on it. Idk what they were but tacrolimus, lotion, anti-fungals, anti-bacterials none of them worked. MCT oil has been making it go down and smoothen out. The bumps were there for months so based on baseless correlation I‚Äôd say the oil helped.\n\n\nI sound like an MCT oil marketing shill ngl but this shit feels like magic.

    "body": "Hey Everyone, \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThis is going to be a lengthy post but I wanted to share my story in hopes of helping others out there with a similar situation. \n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\nJust to provide the history and my situation, I'm 26 male with a pretty healthy body weighing in at 170 lbs at 6'0. I started developing pimples on my scalp since 2015. Back in the day, it would normal sized pimples all over my scalp which did not irritate me and would come and go. I did not do anything at the time since it was less bothersome. Fast forward to 2017 the pimples on my scalp were getting itchy, burning sensation, irritated...basically all the shitty symptoms you could experience. I went to the doctors about 4-5 times for this cause and was prescribed Tetracycline.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow I  researched so vigorously on Tetracycline and read the worst reviews about this anti-biotic (thanks to many reddit users). I did NOT intake any of the pills, and at the time doctor also said I had hair folliculitis mixed with some acne. These pimples were pretty big in size about 4-5 at a time mixed with lots of red spots throughout my scalp. I went to a different doctor for a second opinion and was prescribed stieprox shampoo and was told it was Scalp Psoriasis. I was getting a different opinions and I was just so confused on what to do. I was also getting stressed during this whole tenure and felt like I was losing hair. After reading many forums and testimonies I came to the conclusion this is honestly a trial and error process and I will need to come up with a solution fast before it gets worse. Keep in mind my symptoms were  itchy scalp, 4-5 big pimples throughout my scalp and lots of red like pimples throughout my head. Below is the process of what products I went through to get my scalp cleared. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n1st option - I switched to a Paraben free shampoo. Went onto youtube and found this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg8ZUZymApw&t=48s. I have what he is describing and the youtube got a lot of views. I ordered the shampoo Jason Biotin Shampoo and tried it out. This didn't work that great for me at all, I think mainly because it contained fragrance which I will get to later was a irritant for me. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n2) Nixrol - I tried this for 4 weeks and it worked out pretty good until after the 4 weeks my scalp acne came back. (This also contained fragrance) \n\n&nbsp;\n\n3) Tried numerous shampoos - Coal Tar, Head and Shoulders, Dove Shampoo with Tea Tree Oil, Tea Trea oil from Bath and Body works. None of this worked for me \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWinning Solution: \nSo basically this is my current routine, my scalp isn't 100% PERFECT but its certainly way more manageable and in a condition I will be able to live in. I haven't had any huge breakouts for about 2 months now (knock on wood it continues) and will continue to follow the process. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nFirst step - Apple Cider Vinegar. Basically, I don't know the exact science behind this (I know I read it balances the pH level) but basically I went through everyones solution and took a bit of everything and combined it all in one big manual process for myself. I took a bottle a spray bottle and pour apple cider vinegar inside and mixed with water. I literally sprayed my scalp before I showered and left the ACV in my hair for about 15-20 mins. I did this for about 4-5 weeks straight everyday until it was gone. Now I only do it 2-3 days per week just to maintain and ensure my scalp acne doesn't come back.\n\n&nbsp; \n\n2) Shampoo - I use a whole food market brand (360) which is fragrance free. The ingredients also contained coconut oil which I heard was good so why not.\n\n&nbsp;3) I use once or twice a week Steproix which was prescribed by doctor. Pretty harsh on the hair so I pair it up with the shampoo above\n\n&nbsp;4) Clean towel and pillow cases. I change my pillow case twice a week now and use a clean towel when drying my hair. I recommend using a fragrance free detergent. Also comb your hair, not sure if this helps\n\n&nbsp;5) I consume Vitamin D , Zinc and a spoonful of coconut oil. Now I dont know if this works, again I just complied everything that other people do and just made it into one whole weekly routine in hopes my scalp acne would go away. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI went through this process because I really wanted to avoid taking anti-biotics (tetracycline) and go more of a natural way. Sometimes my scalp still acts up especially when I am stress (had the worst breakout when stressed) and when its super hot outside but again using the steps mentioned above I was able to manage it really well. If you guys want to send me pictures of your scalp through DM i can take a look and tell you If i had something similar. Again, this may not work out for everyone but I'm just sharing my story hoping it will help someone because I remember everyday how stressed and sad I got over this. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nPeace and Love, ",

    "body": "So I've had Seb Derm my entire adult life. When I was a kid I don't think I had it but around my late teens I started getting it. I've also had what I think is Keratolysis exfoliativa on my hands since I was about 14. So I always thought my face being so flaky was just part of the same issue - eczema or something. I get Seb Derm around my [beard](https://library.med.utah.edu/kw/derm/mml/22320086.jpg), my [eyebrows](https://dermatim.rs/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/dermatim-seboroicni-dermatitis--1024x681.jpg) and my [nose / moustache](https://skinsight.com/app/uploads/2021/04/seborrheicDermatitis_47710_lg.jpg) (these images are not of me, I just found examples that look very similar to mine). The beard is by far the most annoying as it would cover any dark shirt I wore with so much dandruff.\n\n  \nNow a quick back story about my recent flare up, about 2 months ago it was worse than it had ever been. My skin had gone bright red, every day it seemed like a new layer of skin would flake off and it was so painful and tight that it felt like it might split. I felt so embarrassed going to social gatherings and it was so difficult to focus on much other than the burning sensation in my skin so I decided to go to war with it.  \n\nI'm not certain that I've fixed it yet as it's often seasonal but for now my skin is the best it's ever looked and I wanted to share my shotgun spray of things I changed in my life. I know it's not ideal, and I can't say exactly what change has done the trick but I'll also share what didn't work and if you're in the same boat as me then maybe try a few of these things. \n\n  \nThings I Tried that didn't work: \n\n* Vaseline - Didn't seem to do anything other than address the feeling of dryness\n* 10% Urea Cream - Also just seemed to address dryness. It didn't really soften the skin or reduce flakyness\n* Using head and shoulders as a face wash - It didn't seem to make any change\n* Using COCONUT OIL (NOT MCT) - I tried straight coconut oil a year or 2 ago and it caused a horrific flare up.\n* Exercise - I do brazilian jiujitsu and it seemed to always make it worse. I think heat + sweat + friction. \n* Sunlight - Seemed to cause a new layer of skin to flake off (and not from sunburn). \n\nThings that Seemed to have worked:\n\nCreams: \n\n* MCT Oil - Specifically C8 and C10. I used [Melrose Kick Start MCT](https://static.chemistwarehouse.co.nz/ams/media/pi/88684/2DF_800.jpg) but I think the main thing is the chains. Look for one where the ingredients are 100% Medium Chain Triglycerides derived from Coconut Oil (C8, C10) or Caprylic (C8) and Capric (C10) fatty acids.\n* 2% Ketoconazole shampoo\n* Dakta Gold Ketoconazole cream - marketed as Athletes Foot treatment\n* Coco-Scalp - 12% Coal Tar Solution, 2% Salicylic Acid, 4% Sulfur-precipitated\n\nThe routine with the creams is 1 hour before a shower I would apply the Coco-scalp cream to help get rid of any dandruff. I would apply it all over the affected areas, including beard and scalp. I don't use it anymore mainly because all of the flakes are gone, but if they came back I'd start using it again. Then in the shower I use a small amount of the shampoo, apply it all over my head/face and then rinse it off. This seems to remove any layers of oil. Then I apply it again, this time it seems to foam up much better, and I let it sit for 3 - 6 mins depending on how bored I get. After the shower I apply a small amount of the Ketoconazole cream to affected areas (Again, I don't anymore because there are no affected areas, but if it flares again I will), and then lather my face and beard with a good coating of MCT oil. I would re-apply the MCT oil every now and then throughout the day. Maybe 2 - 4 times per day.  \n\nNow that it's calmed way down I'm just using the shampoo (rinse, repeat and wait a few mins) and then the MCT oil around the morning and around bed time + right after any showers I take. I also change my pillowcase relatively regularly now, maybe once a week. \n\nDiet:\n\n* Cocoa powder and trim milk - as a drink, about 3 teaspoons of high quality cocoa powder in milk, 1 - 2 times a day. I try to find one that has about 10g of protein per 100 calories.\n\n* Eating less processed food. A few days before the massive flare up I had eaten a bunch of pizza hut so I assumed it could have something to do with it. \n* Stopped drinking energy drinks, Coke or coffee. - I would have about 1.5 liters of Coke zero per day as well as 2 or so energy drinks. This was more health and finance related but I changed this around the same time so I thought I should include it incase. And honestly, going from probably 400 - 600mg of caffein per day down to 0 was only hard for the first few days. I felt headachy and sick, but now I feel no different energy-wise to when I was drinking so much, so I guess what's the point. \n* Started drinking a lot more water. Since I'm not drinking anything else I've started drinking more water naturally. I don't enjoy it but If I have a bottle nearby it seems to do the trick of curbing any craving for more fun drinks. I probably drink around 4-6 liters per day. I'm a big guy though and I do a fair amount of exercise. I think just drink whatever feels natural. \n* Kimchi - I made a big batch of homemade kimchi, more because I love kimchi, but I think the gut biome thing probably plays a part. I followed [this recipe](https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/yangbaechu-kimchi). \n\n",

Keto shampoo while it does stop hair loss from sebderm it will cause your actual hair to become fragile and break (I only applied to my scalp). What worked for me was 1% SELENIUM SULFIDE shampoo once a week and a bamboo charcoal shampoo mid week. Every morning when I wake up I spray my scalp with a mixture of 1/4 apple cider vinegar, 3/4 distilled water and 10 drops of tea tree oil (you can add lavender oil to make it smell better).

    "body": "I‚Äôve struggled with psoriasis (predominantly scalp psoriasis) since I was a young child. I was only diagnosed with psoriasis in my mid 30s after several doctors and dermatologists over the years misdiagnosed me with dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis for decades.\n\nIt was only after I started getting large patches of psoriasis on my elbow that I was finally diagnosed properly. But like all other doctors, I was still sent home with a topical treatment and told to keep using coal tar shampoo. This regimen hardly kept my symptoms at bay, and I had to use coal tar shampoo EVERY DAY or my scalp would flare up so badly. I spent 3 decades of my life with massive amounts of flakes on my shoulders. You can imagine the bullying that transpired during my school age years and the embarrassment that transpired in my dating and professional lives.\n\nI started getting patches on my leg and my psoriasis was worsening after a series of traumatic events in my life. I was so despondent that none of the topicals seemed to be working. I started researching again and found out about UV light therapy. I made an appointment with my derm and when I went in, I asked if they did this treatment and they said yes, but it‚Äôs likely my insurance won‚Äôt cover it until I try another more powerful topical treatment. I advocated for myself and said look, I‚Äôve been on topicals for years and they are not working. Please just try running UV through my insurance. I wanted to try everything possible before going on to biologics. \n\nMy insurance approved UV treatments THE SAME DAY. I started a few days later, twice weekly treatments for my scalp, arms and legs. All I was responsible for was a $10 copay every session. I couldn‚Äôt believe it.  \n\nWithin two months my psoriasis is GONE. My husband and Derm said they can‚Äôt even see any remnants that I ever even had psoriasis on my scalp. This, when 2 months ago my scalp and ears were red, raw, itchy, uncomfortable, peeling like crazy and sometimes bleeding. \n\nI‚Äôm so angry that no one had mentioned UV light therapy to me YEARS AGO. But now I know and I needed to share this info here, even if many of you are already aware of it. \n\nThis is where I first found out about UV light therapy: https://www.psoriasis.org/phototherapy/\n\nThere is hope you guys!!! Of course I am aware that flare ups will very likely happen again. But I am so grateful for now to have some relief and know I have another tool in my arsenal to go back to when I need it. ",

I had the idea at the time that I didn't really want to be very forward with my spells, so as to not be direct with any future plans that my mage may have as on a side note for his back story, he was a tactician in training (planning on using his summoned monsters as pieces in chess represent a battle) and seeing as how he was a conjurer he was going to be very snobbish and insult peoples intelligence as most conjurers see themselves as the highest form of magic users. So looking through the players hand book I found what would soon be Adam's signature spell, conjure grease. My DM was thoroughly confused. The spell had said that as long as the mage had some sort of oily grease substance or butter, the mage could make a magical grease that was always slippery causing the enemy to be trapped in it to roll a saving through or fall flat on there ass. \n\nSo there was Adam in the new group with the summon grease and summon mount spells at his finger tips. (the only mount he is able to summon at the moment however was a weak horse for maybe about an hour) During his travels Adam had figured out that grease can catch fire and if compressed correctly can act as a small but useful fire splash, he essentially figured out how to make a Molotov cocktail. However he had not used his magic grease to do so, I as a person in real life did not expect what happened next. One day the group was in a pickle and was essentially starting to die left and right with the only two healers out of battle as they were keeping the rest of the group alive, and having the other half (a half elf bard and Adam himself) fighting for their lives. \n\nAs the bard fought decently with his long sword, Adam was luckily dodging every physical attack thrown at him and running around in circles. The half elf managed to some how get all of the enemies to attack him for a short while giving Adam a chance to think. He then came up with the brilliant idea of putting some butter in a glass flask and using the spell to create the grease, then rip off some of his cloth sash and use his flint and steel to catch it on fire. \n\nI as a person only thought that it would act as a simple Molotov, my DM on the other hand had other thoughts. Adam throws the Molotov in an attempt to save the half elf, after landing the hit the Molotov not only bursts into flames but also explodes hard enough to leave a crater on the floor. The half elf somehow made it out with 2 hp, the enemies on the other hand weren't so lucky. The group stops and looks at Adam. Adam slowly grows a grinch smile. I as a player had no arguments with this. From then on Adam carried around a bandoleer of those glass flasks filled with grease and carried around ten of what he called \"butter skins\" which were water skins filled to the brim with nothing but butter and food grease. This was especially disgusting when he would reach for his wallet as he kept it under his pants on is left thigh so thieves could not pickpocket him. \n\nThere was one occasion were the DM actually got the group in prison from a corrupt king and took away all of the groups items. However during lunch when the guards would bring crappy food to the group, Adam was always armed and luckily had some spell charges left over from his last reading session. The conversation went something like this:\n\nDM: the guards bring sloppy nasty food for all of you to eat and continually call you maggots.\n\nMe: may I ask what specifically is in this food?\n\nDM: some bread pieces and some old wet meat that doesn't look fit for a dog.\n\nMe: So how greasy is this meat?\n\nDM: If you turn the platter oil just falls from the plate and it....OH GOD DAMIT NO!!! WHAT HAVE I DONE!\n\nME: wait what exactly is the material we are wearing made of.\n\nDM: I forget exactly what it's called but it's a bit thicker than cloth but not exactly leather either... DAMIT not only did I give you a weapon, I gave you something to hold it in.\n\nAdam then made a makeshift grease sack that he hid under his thigh wear his wallet use to be. Later in prison they were sentenced to trial by combat having everything riding on our best fighter to win the lives of the rest of the group. Adam then revealed what he had slowly been building behind bars, and told the fighter to use this as a last resort to give himself the upper hand during battle.\n\nThis was long in Adams travels so by now he also knew the blind spell and was just close enough to use it, so he told the fighter he would help from the side lines as best he can. During the start of the battle the fighter landed a critical hit to the enemies head, at that moment Adam used a blind spell on the enemy and then an audible glamer in the crowd to have one of the civilians sound like they said, \" the force of the blow must have blinded him!\" The fighter then very quickly threw down the small grease sack having it spread a bit under the enemy and then failing the saving through, the fighter took care of the rest. \n\nOne more memorable action of Adam the grease mage was what we like to call the horse bomb. During one of Adams earlier adventures, the group had to join with another joining member, but story wise they were crossing the sea and later realizing that they were on a pirate ship and tried to help save a merchant ship that the pirates were attacking where they would meet the new member on the merchant ships deck. \n\nAdam quickly explaining the situation and then proving that they were not the enemy to this new member asked for the merchants help. The merchant, who later explained that he was only on board to protect the merchandise and was not actually a merchant, was very skilled with a bow and asked how he could help. Adam had earlier summoned a horse from the crows nest were he was reading allowing it to fall and instantly kill a pirate below him (don't worry it wasn't a real horse it later disappeared after the spell wore off), and was about to use it again. While the rest of the group fought off the pirates Adam summoned another horse with his last remaining horse hair, and pored magical grease all over the horse. The new guy couldn't help but be confused. Adam then explained that his grease can act as a bomb to ignite any gun powder that he would be willing to part the cannons from. The new guy had a better idea, he had showed Adam an excess of pitch on the ship. (for those who don't know pitch is a very flammable substance used to water proof a sea vessel usually made of coal tar, wood tar, or petroleum) They then put as much pitch as the horse could carry on its back and sent it to the pirate ship on a crossing board. It luckily made it over and the pirate ship which was slowly catching fire eventually ignited the horse. I suppose at this point the DM said fuck it you won the encounter anyway, so the horse then exploded tearing what was left of the ship apart. \n\nAdam the grease mage is one of my favorite creations and is presently about to make a catapult which will launch his grease bombs at enemy flesh golems which are being mind controlled by a great necromancer which is holding a kingdom hostage. unfortunately due to group meeting issues it is on hold, but I someday hope to launch that catapult....Someday.              \n\n ",

You can buy it over the counter, I get mine at Wal Mart. It sounds like your situation is getting pretty uncomfortable, I would suggest going to see your dermatologist and tell them you are in agony and need to try something new. Maybe give the coconut oil another go, might take a few times for it to do it's thing as its all natural. I really hope you find relief. I'm currently on Humira.

(The spray comes with a nozzle attachment for reaching through the hair into the scalp.)\n\nNote that clobetasol is very potent, and must be used for no more than 2-3 weeks at a time, with breaks in between. Your doctor can tell you more.\n\nAnother drug that is beneficial is calcipotriene (also called calcipotriol), a synthetic derivative of vitamin D, which also comes as a solution.

Don‚Äôt put too much pressure even though it itches like hell. Then you‚Äôre gonna take the listerine & put it in a spray bottle & spray it all over your scalp, soak the entire scalp with it there‚Äôs no such thing as too much. It will burn just for a minute but it will soothe it self down. Let it sit for 35 minutes & don‚Äôt scratch at it. Then you‚Äôre gonna wash your hair again with the head & shoulders shampoo.

    "body": "**Lignin** \n\nLignin is an essential element of wood, and of most vascular plants, including tobacco. (The word itself is derived from the Latin lignum, meaning wood.) Lignin fills the spaces between the cell walls of many plants, provides strength, and is thought to be responsible for moving water through cell structures. This would be of no interest to cigar smokers except for one fact: lignin is the most abundant natural organic aromatic polymer found in the vascular plant kingdom. Lignin accounts for 4 to 5 percent of tobacco weight; far less than hard wood, but significant nevertheless. \n\nWhen burned, lignin produces phenols with specific aromatic properties, the most evident of which is the smell of wood burning. Two of these phenols, guaiacol and syringol, are responsible for the flavors of smoked foods. That is one of the reasons why more highly lignified woods (hardwoods) are preferred for barbeque. Guaiacol is associated with smoky flavor, and is present in roasted coffee compounds, while syringol is associated with the aroma of wood smoke. Guaiacol is also a precursor to other phenolic compounds that contribute to flavors commonly found in cigar smoke: vanillin and eugenol. We all know what vanillin is, but the term eugenol is derived from the scientific name for clove, and its aroma is exactly that: clove-like. It has also been extracted as an essential oil from nutmeg, cinnamon, and basil. Other phenols produced include cresols, which have a petroleum-like scent. Cresols are also found in coal tar, crude oil, and creosote. \n\nCresols are also, apparently, a component of Sharpie markers. I‚Äôm already on the lookout for a cigar review that includes ‚Äúa whiff of Sharpie marker.‚Äù These phenolic constituents are also produced as pheromones by certain insects. The desert locust is ardently attracted to guaiacol, and the orchid bee is erotically aroused by both eugenol and p-cresol. So don‚Äôt be surprised if these guys crash your next herf. They only want to make friends. It‚Äôs difficult to say what chemical compounds are specifically responsible for the flavors and aromas of cigar tobacco ‚Äìthere are thousands of them ‚Äî but it seems reasonable to me to say that we aren‚Äôt hallucinating when we find vanilla, or clove, or related aromas in cigar smoke. Some cigar smokers are more sensitive to subtle aromas than others, and some people are just better at putting names to sensations; but I don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs fair to say that an unexpected flavor, like honey or aniseed, is the product of an overactive imagination. Different people won‚Äôt always agree on the flavors they find in a particular blend, but to deny that those flavors are there seems unwarranted when there is a basis for it in chemical analysis. \n\nBy: Tom Ufer",

    "body": "Hi All:\n\nI went to a hair loss specialist a few month's back, and a lot of the information in the \"consultation letter\" she sent me afterwards was really helpful to me. I often refer back to it when I'm feeling anxious about my treatment plan. Below is what she wrote up (minus some identifying information) to the extent it might help one of you. <3\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nYour chief concern was hair loss diffusely throughout your scalp but primarily in the frontal region of your scalp.¬† This loss was noticed by you about 6-9 months ago, and over time it has manifested as increased shedding, thinning of the hair shaft itself (i.e. more \"wispiness‚Äù)¬†and fewer hairs present (i.e. less density).¬†¬†\n\nWe discussed that the first step for a definitive diagnosis (or to exclude other potentially treatable diagnoses) would be to get blood tests.¬† The blood tests I recommend include; T3, T4, TSH (all three of these), DHEA, Total Testosterone, Prolactin, ESR, Ferritin (anything below 70 is concerning), (optional RPR), and a CBC. ¬†You have already had a battery of tests done and I just like to include this as a reference.¬† We did discuss your lower than ideal Ferritin at 44 and advised iron supplementation as discussed further below. ¬†\n\nYour hair loss is most likely due to a number of factors including¬†genetics and hormonal changes leading to possible early signs of female pattern loss, with potentially periods of increased shedding as a result of stress. ¬†Stress, chronic illnesses, surgery, changes in medications, a low protein/vegetarian diet, or B-12 and Vitamin D deficiencies can also play a role in accelerating hair loss, as can low iron (even when not frankly anemic).¬† Heat (straightening, curling or drying), chemicals (perms and coloring), and traction (pulling, plucking, extensions or tight hairstyles) are all long term risks for damaging hair, especially if done daily. ¬†Smoking, strict vegetarianism, and severe weight loss are definitely correlated with poor hair growth and should be avoided.\n\nI suggested a treatment plan that involves medical treatment first, as medical therapy alone may improve your situation. ¬†We went over the risks, benefits, expectations and timelines for a number of treatments during our visit and I answered all of your questions.¬† Please note that none of these treatments are mutually exclusive, and indeed a multi-pronged approach utilizing all potentially beneficial treatments to maximize the results is often advocated. ¬†\n\nMedically, our plan was to use minoxidil (Rogaine) as an initial treatment.¬† We typically recommend either the 5% foam (many of my female patients find that the foam is easier to apply, but the generic liquid works just as well providing you *use* it, and patients find that applying it on damp or dry hair just before bed seems easiest) OR the off-label low-dose ORAL version (typically 2.5-5mg to start).¬† The topical versions have to be applied daily (or twice daily if using the liquid form) and the oral version needs to be taken daily for 9-12 months to accurately evaluate its effects, but they both have a great track record of demonstrable results in the population of our patients who have tried other one.¬† There is also a compounded topical product that you may want to consider, called 82 M.¬† It is a prescription that we could call in for you at a compounding pharmacy and includes Minoxidil, Tretinoin (Retin A), an anti-inflammatory, and antioxidants.¬† If you are interested in this, you can purchase through our office and we can prescribe it for you.\n\nWe also discussed the off-label use of oral Minoxidil in the future.¬† This has been used in the 2.5-5mg doses by some providers and has been shown to be helpful in hair growth, particularly when topical Minoxidil alone is not producing ideal results, and patient has diffuse thinning.¬† This medication is an antihypertensive agent, with possible side effects when used in higher doses typically used for treating blood pressure.¬† The side effect profile at the lower doses is significantly less, and we can start out with a very low dose and titrate up slowly to monitor for side effects. We agreed to have you try topical Minoxidil (in the form of Rogaine or 82M) first, due to your history of low blood pressure.\n\nWe also discussed some other prescriptions that may help.¬† Finasteride (Propecia) 2.5-5 mg daily has shown some good results for women's hair growth in preliminary studies.¬† Birth control formulations like Yasmin may also be used simultaneously.¬† Since you are still of childbearing age, you are not a candidate for this treatment, but we may consider it in the future.¬† I did mention Spironolactone, as this is another drug that can be useful in slowing women's hair loss.¬† It is usually taken for high blood pressure.¬† Because this drug typically demonstrates efficacy at higher doses (200 mg versus a typical starting dose of 25 mg) I generally slowly titrate the dose up as tolerated.¬† Due to your history of low blood pressure you did want to hold off on trying this medication for now.¬†\n\nWe have also found that PhotoBioModulation Treatments (PBMT, also known as low level light treatments ¬†or LLLT) help to grow thicker hair - particularly those with finer hair to begin with. ¬†The ideal wavelength is not yet known, and dosing the light therapy to the scalp can still be improved, but current science indicates the therapeutic wavelengths are likely to be between 668-684nm, or possibly in the 830nm range. ¬†As with all hair loss treatments, this requires a year of therapy before full results can be evaluated, but the treatments are safe and require a twenty-minute session several times per week (I recommend daily or every-other-day therapy). ¬†\n\nThere are several shampoos that have been shown to improve hair growth, especially when added to other hair loss therapies. ¬†2% Ketoconazole is an anti-fungal shampoo that may be the most effective of these for unknown reasons. ¬†It is used 2-3 times per week and is available by prescription only. ¬†The OTC version is the 1% formulation (known as Nizoral) and can be used daily.¬† You can also alternate with zinc shampoos (e.g. Head and Shoulders), selenium shampoo (e.g. Selsun Blue), or coal tar shampoo (e.g. T-Gel). ¬†We also carry several proprietary formulations of these if the over the counter brands do not appeal. ¬†The key to using these shampoos is to lather and leave on the scalp for 5 minutes before rinsing off.¬† You may use a regular shampoo or conditioner after if you do not like the texture it leaves your hair (and admittedly, these are not the most luxurious shampoos).\n\nWe discussed trying PRP injections to possibly help the growth of the native hair (and possibly the grafts if surgery is done) in the area.¬† Since this use of PRP +/- ACell (MatriStem) is not yet fully tested, it is impossible to know how much of an effect it would have, but it is not likely to be detrimental and may in fact help your growth (a recent reference can be found at¬†[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25111436](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/5JnKB9uVaDH7)). ¬†That being said, in some patients there are great results and in others the results are not as significant and like all medical hair treatments it may require ongoing maintenance treatment. ¬†If PRP is used alone, the treatment schedule with the most efficacy seems to to be monthly. ¬†When PRP is used with a protein like ACell, the frequency is roughly every three months. ¬†Whichever treatment is used, at least 6 months are needed to see results. ¬†We reviewed the pros and cons, and this treatment may have a chance of helping you if you do decide to do it.\n\nVarious supplements can also help, particularly for those deficient in iron (again Ferritin should be at 70 or above), vitamins D and B-12, and protein. ¬†Zinc, selenium, and magnesium deficiencies have also been associated with hair loss, although these are more rare. ¬† Iron supplementation seems to be most effective (with the fewest side effects) when taken more frequently and in low doses (15-50mg - like the infant ‚Äúdropper\" vitamins). ¬†Improved iron absorption is also accomplished when iron supplements are taken with vitamin C. ¬†Vitamin D supplementation can be obtained over the counter (anything from 2000-10,000 IU daily has been suggested) and benefits calcium absorption when taken simultaneously. ¬†Vitamin B-12 is not easily absorbed through the stomach, so supplementation is best accomplished either through sublingual tablets, oral liquid forms, or injections every 3-6 months.\n\nWe also discussed the importance of protein in your diet for optimizing hair growth.¬† You should try to add protein to your diet on at least a daily basis, if not with every meal (and animal proteins are especially effective for unknown reasons). If you do not think you have enough protein intake, or if you just want to try a hair growth supplement, an easy and effective option seems to be the Help Hair Shake (with or without the amino acids in \"Help Hair Vitamins‚Äù).¬† The shake is composed of proteins that are not androgenic (i.e. do not promote the production of androgens which cause hair loss) and it has been shown to maintain or improve hair growth, sometimes remarkably. ¬†SWMD does not endorse these products, but we do use them ourselves and keep them in stock for the convenience of our patients in case you are interested in trying them.\n\nAside from treatments which can take a full 11-12 months to work, there are some camouflage options which can be used to improve the appearance of hair almost immediately. ¬†Hairpieces hats/scarves, and keratin hair fibers like Toppik or Infinity are excellent alternative camouflaging agents. ¬†We carry several at the office and if you want to try some we are happy to help (I think your color match was medium brown).¬† Scalp Micropigmentation (SMP), may also be a camouflage option for you. ¬†This is a technique that uses tiny points of pigment (almost like a tattoo but much smaller and different inks) to provide a visual background making the hair appear fuller and denser.¬† The appearance can be either permanent or temporary, and often requires multiple sessions, but the results can be particularly useful when more density is needed than grafts are available.¬† It is also great when scars need camouflage, or for helping the hair look fuller when wet.\n\n\\*\\*\\*",

I have been to many dermatologist and I always get the same diagnosis, and prescriptions; ketoconazole shampoo, fluconazole, and clobetasol propionate. The antifungals have never had any sort of effect, only steroids have ever helped with treatment, but they wreak havoc on your skin and I feel it always comes back worse after steroid use.\n\nI have mainly dealt with this on my face, scalp and chest. I've been leaving a trail of skin flakes everywhere I go for years. I can't wear dark clothing with looking like I came in from a snowstorm.I've tried anything and everything, but whenever I think I've found something that works, it just comes back. I've never really done things in a scientific way either, in desperation just throwing the kitchen sink at it. I've done various dead sea salt cleanses/soaks, coal tar options, coconut oil(bad idea), tea tree oil, witch hazel, you name it, I've probably tried it. I did just get MCT C8 to try, but have been waiting to try this.\n\nSo that brings me back to my title. I was reading a random TIL post on scurvy about a month ago, and saw a picture of some various scurvy rashes. They didn't look too different from seb derm in less severe cases. It got me thinking about what my sources of Vitamin C are, and realized I don't have many in my diet. I take a few supplements daily; Fish Oil, Curcumin, D/K, ACV, Mushroom Complex, so I decided to add Vitamin C into the regimen. \n\nThe results were astounding. Within 24 hours of my first dose of 1000mg, I wasn't itchy for the first time in a very long time, my complexion was more even. I showered and my existing flare up was not looking extra aggravated after getting out. Within a week I had no more flakes and no more dandruff. It has now been over 3 weeks of taking 1000mg of vitamin C daily and my skin is still improving every day. This is the longest I have gone without a flare up in over 10 years and I'm ecstatic.\n\nI am still using a vanicream bar to wash my chest and face, but have stopped using my nizoral psoriasis shampoo entirely, where I was having to use it every 2-3 days, I haven't touched it in 2 weeks and just use my OGX with argan oil now, absolutely 0 dandruff and scaling. I cleanse daily, wash my hair daily and moisurize after drying off from the shower with Dermacalm SOS, which has been my routine for years. \n\nSo now I'm sitting here, thinking, has it really just been a lack of vitamin C all this time? Could I have stopped this years ago? Was it just a chronic mild case of scurvy?\n\nI know the idea of scurvy sounds silly, not being a pirate and all, but this changed something. I don't know if it will last, if I'm cured, or what, but I will be continuing to supplement C for the foreseeable future. I'm a realist and know this is a limited study at this point, but it has been the most effective remedy I have used to date. If anyone has any similar experiences, I'd love to hear it, if not hopefully this helps someone else.",

    "body": "Here are 10 reasons why dip pens are the preferred medium for making range/dope cards, taking notes, signing bootlicker tickets/liability waivers, and other assorted range related things.\n\n\n1. Tradition. Dip pens were historically the pen of choice from the time of Carlos Hathcock signing the 2nd Amendment. Don't you wish we could go back to a simpler time when 30-06 was interesting and old range fudds had an actual excuse for missing beyond iron sights?\n\n2. Dip pens are uniquely American. Soviets couldn't afford glass, so they traditionally used pencils even up through the space race. Bri'ish used coal tar and orphan bones they spit out from between their teeth. Aussies, being upside down, wrote with paper on pens. The French couldn't shoot for shit so who cares. Asia used paint brushes. Germans didn't exist before WWI.\n\n3. More tactile feel and higher precision, less bleed aberration. You spent $4,000 on the best optic available (not bushnell) to maximize your drip so why wouldn't you use the best pen available too?\n\n5. QD color change. No pen cartridges, single pen tool, just a wipe and redip to go from light blue, pink, white, pink, light blue only in that order.\n\n6. Not like the other girls. Separate yourself from the Creedmoor man buns with a hyper masculinest and definitely not hipster 7\" twisted and ribbed 7\" glass rod, which doubles as a vape juice dropper, IPA straw, and ~~penis surrogate~~ quick dip lollypop\n\n7. Rollerballs are tacky classless shit for people who have American flag cerakote or shoot Savages\n\n8. Fountain pens are an option but have all of the drawbacks of people thinking you are a cheap asshole from 7 at first glance, and none of the amazing benefits of dipping pens\n\n\nIn conclusion, if you ain't dippin you ain't shootin and you can get right the fuck out of here.",

I recognized the username from all the reviews with beautiful photos she‚Äôs done, and knew from these reviews that she has great taste- so needless to say, I was super excited! We ended up having a lot in common and she has been a lovely friend to chat with throughout the past few months. \n\nNow onto the stuff!\n\nDeep Midnight - Halloween sample pack - DM is one of my top favorite brands so of course I‚Äôve been dying to try their new Halloween releases. As usual she knocked it out of the park with the trio ranging from cozy sweet gourmand to creepy, dank and mysterious atmospherics. \n\nBaphomet & Co - two bigass soaps like omg - So Baphomet & Co has been on my to-try list for ages, and the funny thing is the review trust piqued my interest was none other than batling‚Äôs review of the brand! The bars are super fragrant and even the unscented samples have that special smell that good quality soaps have. I‚Äôve been using one in the shower and it doesn‚Äôt dry out my reptile skin and fill my bathroom with this amazing scent. \n\nSolstice Scents - Maine Moon and Gibbon‚Äôs Mischief Night - Ok wow. I‚Äôm not even kidding when I say that ever since I unwrapped these I‚Äôve been wearing them nonstop. I‚Äôve never really tried atmospheric gourmands before. THANK YOU FOR PUTTING ME ON TO THIS. MM is like leather + popcorn + chocolate (that doesn‚Äôt turn plasticky) + spooky night air and GMN is cookies + popcorn + spooky school desk. I could write volumes about these. \n\nAjevie sample pack - opening this was like eating an entire Whitman‚Äôs sampler box except it‚Äôs perfume and there‚Äôs no gluey nougat and it‚Äôs actually good and I don‚Äôt get a stomachache after and...yeah you get my analogy? This was the most fun package to open since I had no idea what to expect and found some major surprise hits. Some notable faves are the weird yet addicting coal tar and pepper of Possets‚Äô LEM, the cozy sweet Astrid‚Äôs Sugared Musk, and the sweet honeyed wine of ZOMGSmells‚Äô Pyment (which btw I‚Äôm on my way to buy a FS because DANG). \n\nSomeone will have to tear me away from Maine Moon and Gibbon‚Äôs Mischief Night to properly spend time with each fragrance the way they deserve.

Which ones are you taking; One-a-day, Centrum, Equate, or maybe you just picked up some of Sam‚Äôs club‚Äôs ‚ÄúMembers Mark Complete?‚Äù Sounds like a real winner! Wait a second, it could be even worse. You might have gone and done the unthinkable, and you bought your children Flintstones vitamins. Tell me it‚Äôs not true.\n\nDid you know Pfizer owns ‚ÄúCentrum?‚Äù Did you know Bayer owns ‚ÄúOne-a-Day?‚Äù Walking into a nutritional nightmare is easy if you don‚Äôt know the ‚Äúlow down‚Äù on supplements. Dangerous supplements can reverse what you are trying to accomplish. Also, many multivitamins, especially the chewable ones, contain Aspartame, one of the leading causes of Fibromyalgia and IBS (irritable bowel syndrome).\n\nHave you really read the label, researched any of the synthetic additives, or checked out the ‚Äúother ingredients,‚Äù or did you just figure that was irrelevant? If you are guilty of taking any of the aforementioned supplements, it‚Äôs time to buy some liver, kidney, and colon detoxification, and you better educate yourself about those too, because ‚ÄúThe Man‚Äù wants you sick and dying, not avoiding toxic vitamin imposters that are NOT ABSORBABLE by the body. Dangerous, mind-blowing additives in your crappy vitamins that are listed as ‚Äúother ingredients‚Äù include: talc, dyes, sodium benzoate, methylcellulose, carnauba wax, silicon and/or titanium dioxide. In all of these cases, what you don‚Äôt know WILL hurt you!\n\nMost vitamins in supplements are petroleum extracts, coal tar derivatives, and chemically processed sugar (plus sometimes industrially processed fish oils), with other acids and industrial chemicals (such as formaldehyde) used to process them. Synthetic vitamins were originally developed because they cost less. Assuming the non-food product does not contain fish oils, most synthetic, petroleum-derived.\n\nIf your vitamins come in the form of gelatin capsules, you are more than likely consuming the skin, cartilage, connective tissues and bones of diseased animals. On top of that, if your vitamins contain the artificial sweeteners Aspartame, Acesulfame Potassium, Sucralose or Sorbitol, you could be developing artificial sweetener disease (cancer) and mutating your cells, your DNA, and passing that mutagenic DNA along to future generations.\n\nDon‚Äôt feel dumb if you did not know that synthetic B-12 comes from activated sewage sludge just don‚Äôt be a repeat offender! Your ‚Äúcorporate‚Äù made vitamins are made by pharmaceutical and chemical companies who also concocted chemotherapy. It‚Äôs just another angle to handle the threat of people getting healthy from nutritional information, and so you‚Äôve been deceived.\n\nEggs---\nOne large egg contains about 0.45mcg of vitamin B12, or about 19 percent of the recommended daily intake, according to the USDA National Nutrient Database. They are also abundant sources of vitamin A, as well as niacin, iron, pantothenic acid, sodium and selenium.\nSynthetic vitamin B-12, cyanocobalamin, is made from ground up toxic cow livers and activated sewage sludge. These cow livers are overloaded with steroids and antibiotics, and the pesticides the cow assimilates from eating GMO feed, and these cows are living in CAFO‚Äôs (confined animal feeding operations), where they often collapse and die slowly, while lying in their own ‚Äúsludge‚Äù or fecal matter. Synthetic vitamin B also comes from coal tar and petro-chemicals, known to depress the central nervous system and cause respiratory ailments.\n\nVitamins are not individual molecular compounds. Vitamins are natural biological complexes. Vitamins are living complexes which contribute to other higher living complexes ‚Äì like cell repair, collagen manufacture, and maintenance of blood circulation.\n\n**Most vitamins sold are not food‚Äìthey are synthetically processed petroleum and/or hydrogenated sugar extracts**‚Äìeven if they say ‚Äúnatural‚Äù on the label. They are not in the same chemical form or structural form as real vitamins are in foods; thus they are not natural for the human body. True natural food vitamins are superior to synthetic ones. Food vitamins are functionally superior to non-food vitamins as they tend to be preferentially absorbed and/or retained by the body. Isolated, non-food vitamins, even when not chemically different are only fractionated nutrients.\n\nEven though natural health professionals agree that humans should not try to consume petroleum derivatives or hydrogenated sugars, most seem to overlook this fact when vitamin supplementation is involved.\n\nMost non-food vitamins are isolated substances which are crystalline in structure. Vitamins naturally in food are not crystalline and never isolated. Vitamins found in any real food are chemically and structurally different from those commonly found in ‚Äònatural vitamin‚Äô formulas. Since they are different, we should consider non-food vitamins as vitamin analogues (imitations) and not actually vitamins.\n\nA vitamin is--\n\n‚Äúa working process consisting of the nutrient, enzymes, coenzymes, antioxidants, and trace minerals activators.‚Äù\n\n- Royal Lee ‚ÄúWhat Is a Vitamin?‚Äù Applied Trophology Aug 1956\n\nPolarized Light, A True Reflection\n\nThe difference between synthetic and natural vitamins becomes apparent when viewing their response to a beam of polarized light. The light when passing through a natural vitamin will always bend to the right due to it‚Äôs molecular rotation. Thus the letter ‚Äúd‚Äù (representing ‚Äúdextro‚Äù which means ‚Äúright‚Äù) often appears on labels. However, the same light ray when passing through a synthetic vitamin will split into two parts, one part bending to the right and the other to the left. Because the synthetic vitamin is half ‚Äúdextro‚Äù (right) and half ‚Äúlevo‚Äù (left), the letters ‚Äúdl‚Äù often appear on labels at the beginning of the synthetic name.\n\nA synthetic vitamin is like the image in a mirror. It looks like the real thing but doesn‚Äôt function like the real thing. Half of it will work in the body and the other half won‚Äôt work as well. Dr. Charles Schneider, Ph.D., professor of Chemistry, University of Cincinnati concluded wisely, ‚ÄúGet the vitamins that say natural. There is a difference. The ‚Äúdl‚Äù (synthetic) will be cheaper, but if you could figure it out per energy unit or per use, the natural one will be cheaper.‚Äù\n\nWhich would you rather have, the food in the mirror ‚Ä¶ or the real food?\n\nToxic Ingredients\n\ntoxic dyes\nChemical dyes in vitamins can be carcinogenic\nCheck the labels on your nutritional supplements ‚Äì do they list magnesium stearate or stearic acid as ingredients? ‚ÄúNatural‚Äú Flavours? Sodium Benzoate or Potassium Sorbate? Stearates have been shown to suppress the immune system.  Natural flavours is often used when the product contains MSG, or monosodium-glutamate, a known brain neurotoxin.  Sodium benzoate is carcinogenic.  Stearates are used in many capsules and tablets; ‚ÄúNatural‚Äù flavors in lots of protein drinks, and sodium benzoate as a preservative in many liquid vitamin supplements or juice drinks.\n\nIt is also common to find ingredients in vitamins and nutritional supplements that have been irradiated, fumigated or contaminated with pesticide residues.  In fact, up to 70% of raw materials that are imported into the US today are irradiated.  This irradiation process creates toxic radiation by-products, that remain in the ingredients that you ingest.\n\nThe Merriam-Webster dictionary defines an excipient as:  an usually inert substance (such as gum arabic or starch) that forms a vehicle (as for a drug).  The International Pharmaceutical Council of the Americas states that ‚Äúexcipients are substances other than the pharmacologically active ingredients which are included in the manufacturing process or are contained in a finished product.  In many products, excipients make up the bulk of the total dosage form.‚Äù\n\nExcipients are used in nutritional supplements and vitamins for many reasons, as fillers, lubricants, colors that liven up the product, preservatives, sweeteners, and  coatings and glazes that make it easier to swallow.  Many of the excipients, especially the lubricants, are used to make it easier and cheaper  for the company to manufacture.\n\nOne example is talc, a suspected carcinogen, that is used in many capsules for vitamins and other nutritional supplements today when they are manufactured with a high-speed encapsulator.  It makes the ingredients flow faster and therefore it is much cheaper to make when the talc is included.\n\nAlthough many doctors have been taught that food and non-food vitamins have the same chemical composition, this is simply untrue for most vitamins. As the chemical forms of food and synthetic nutrients are normally different. Its important to understand that since there is no mandated definition of the term ‚Äònatural‚Äô; just seeing that term on a label does not mean that the supplement contains only natural food substances. One of the best ways to tell whether or not a vitamin supplement contains natural vitamins as found in food is to know the chemical differences between food and non-food vitamins (sometimes called USP vitamins).",

Even if one were to take 3.2 times as much of the so-called natural, non-food, ascorbic acid than food vitamin C, although the antioxidant effects might be similar in vitro, the ascorbic acid still will not contain DHAA, nor will it ever have negative oxidative reductive potential (ORP). A simple in vitro study with a digital ORP meter demonstrated that a citrus food vitamin C has negative ORP, but that ascorbic acid had positive ORP.\n\nIt takes negative ORP to clean up oxidative damage, and since ascorbic acid has positive ORP (as well as positive redox potential, it can never replace food vitamin C no matter what the quantity! Furthermore, foods which are high in vitamin C tend to have high Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC, another test which measures the ability of foods and other compounds to subdue oxygen free radicals. A US government study which compared the in vivo effects of a high vitamin C food (containing 80 mg of vitamin C) compared to about 15.6 times as much isolated ascorbic acid (1250 mg) found that the vitamin C-containing food produced the greatest increase in blood antioxidant levels (it is believed that bioflavonoids and other food factors are responsible).\n\nPublished scientific research has concluded, ‚Äúnatural vitamins are nutritionally superior to synthetic ones‚Äù.\n\nFood vitamins are in the physiochemical forms which the body recognizes, generally are not crystalline in structure, contain food factors that affect bioavailability, and appear to have smaller particle sizes. This does not mean that non-food vitamins do not have any value (they clearly do), but it is important to understand that natural food complex vitamins have actually been shown to be better than isolated, non-food, vitamins.\n\nEach of the other synergists in the C complex has a separate function:\n\n‚Äì P factors for blood vessel strength,\n‚Äì J factors for oxygen-carrying capacity of red cells,\n‚Äì tyrosinase as an essential enzyme for enhancing white blood cell effectiveness.\n\nAscorbic acid is just the antioxidant outer shell ‚Äì the protector of all these other synergists so that they will be able to perform their individual functions.\n\nNo matter how much isolated ascorbic acid one takes orally it will never saturate plasma and/or tissue vitamin C levels significantly more than can be obtained by consuming sufficient vitamin C containing foods.\n-It will never have negative ORP, thus can never ‚Äòclean-up‚Äô oxidative damage like food vitamin C can.\n-It will never have the free radical fightin))g capacity of food vitamin C.\n-It will never contain DHAA (the other ‚Äòhalf‚Äô of vitamin C) or the promoting food factors.\n-It will never have the same effect on health issues, such as aging and cardiovascular disease as high vitamin C foods can.\n-It will not ever be utilized the way food vitamin C is.\n-It will always be a synthetic.\nreal-food-versus-vitamin-supplements\n\nLet‚Äôs take vitamin E as another example‚Äîthe body has a specific liver transport for the type of vitamin E found in food‚Äîit does not have this for the synthetic vitamin E forms (nor for the ‚Äònew‚Äô vitamin E analogues that are frequently marketed)‚Äîthus no amount of synthetic vitamin E can truly equal food vitamin E‚Äîthe human body actually tries to rid itself of synthetic vitamin E as quickly as possible. As another example, it should be understood that certain forms of vitamin analogues of B-6, D, and biotin have been shown to have almost no vitamin activity.\n\nWhat are the best sources of Food Vitamins?\n\nCarrots, yellow and green leafy vegetables, and turmeric contain natural betacarotene along with multiple carotenoids. Natural betacarotene was found to significantly decrease serum conjugated diene levels for children exposed to high levels of irradiation.\n\nMost fruits contain vitamin A, but the following fruits have a significant amount: Cantaloupes, Grapefruit, Guava, Mango, Papaya, Passionfruit Tomatoes, Watermelon. Vegetables: Amaranth Leaves, Bok Choy, Broccoli, Brussels Sprouts, Butternut Squash, Carrots, Chinese Broccoli, Chinese Cabbage, Kale\nBeef, legumes, cereal grains, yeast, and fish are significant natural food sources of vitamin B.\nThe vegetarian foods which are highest in natural pantothenate (B-5) are nutritional yeast, brown rice, peanuts, and broccoli. Specifically, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (nutritional yeast not brewers yeast) is one of the best natural sources of food pantothenate\nThe highest concentrations of folate (B- 9) exist in yeast and brocolli.\nPABA (B co-factor) is found in foods such as kidney, liver, molasses, fungal foods, spinach, and whole grains.\nVitamin B7 is generally produced in the intestine, in the presence of healthy intestinal flora. Cereals, pulses and legumes, vegetables, nuts and beef liver contain biotin. Rice bran, rice germ, barley, whole wheat and brown rice are rich sources of biotin. Vegetable sources include mushrooms and cauliflower, while walnuts, peanuts, peanut butter and almonds also contain this vitamin.\nWhile nutritional yeast is probably the best source of inositol (B co-factor), it is also found in fruits, lecithin, legumes, meats, milk, unrefined molasses, raisins, vegetables, and whole grains.\nPhosphatidyl-choline is the major delivery form of choline (B co-factor), and is naturally found in many foods such as beef liver, egg yolks, and soya. Specially grown nutritional yeast appears to be the best food form for supplements.\n\nVitamin C naturally occurs in fruits, (especially citrus fruits like oranges and limes) in two ascorbate forms with bioflavonoids. Whole food vitamin C is also found in potatoes, onions. Also, Black Currants, Breadfruit, Grapefruit, Guava, Kiwi, Lychee, Mango, Mulberries, Papaya, Passionfruit, Pineapple, Strawberries, Amaranth Leaves, Bok Choy, Broccoli, Brussels Sprouts, Butternut Squash, Green Pepper, Kale, Cod, Perch, Goat Milk.\n\nVitamin D is known as the ‚Äúsunshine vitamin‚Äù since it is manufactured by the body after being exposed to sunshine. Ten to fifteen minutes of good sunshine three times weekly is adequate to produce the body‚Äôs requirement of vitamin D. This means that we don‚Äôt need to obtain vitamin D from our diet unless we get very little sunlight. Mushrooms are a good source of Vitamin D.\n\nNatural vitamin E ‚Äúas found in foods is [d]-alpha tocopherol. Vitamin E content is highest in vegetable oils, also relatively high in avocados.\nDark leafy vegetables, as well as cabbage, appear to be the primary food source of vitamin K.\nFruits and vegetables shoppingThe bioavailability of food vitamins is better than that of most isolated USP vitamins, that they may have better effects on maintaining aspects of human health beyond traditional vitamin deficiency syndromes, and at least some seem to be preferentially retained by the human body. It is not always clear if these advantages are due to the physiochemical form of the vitamin, with the other food constituents that are naturally found with them, or some combination. Regardless, it seems logical to conclude that for purposes of maintaining normal health, natural vitamins are superior to synthetic ones. Unlike some synthetic vitamins, no natural vitamin has been found to not perform all of its natural functions. The truth is that only foods, or supplements composed of 100% foods, can be counted on as not containing non-food vitamin analogues. So the best way to build health is from foods or nutrients contained in foods.\n\n**Most vitamins cannot be made by the body**. They must be taken in as food. The best sources then are obviously whole foods, rich in vitamins. Because of soil depletion, mineral depletion, pesticides, air pollution, and erosion, it is common knowledge that foods grown in many of the world‚Äôs commercially farmed soils today have only a fraction of the nutrient value of 50 years ago.\n\n\nVitamins and minerals are not functionally separable. They make each other work. Example: vitamin D is necessary for the body to absorb calcium. Copper is necessary for vitamin C activity. And so on. Mineral deficiencies can cause vitamin deficiencies, and vice versa. So that is the other prime difference between whole food vitamins and synthetics: whole food vitamins contain within them many essential trace minerals necessary for their synergistic operation. Synthetic vitamins contain no trace minerals, relying on, and depleting, the body‚Äôs own mineral reserves.\n\nThe earth‚Äôs immune system is its soil. To be vital and capable of growing vital foods, **soil must be rich in both minerals and soil-based organisms** ‚Äì life forms. Healthy produce naturally resists insects. Insects are like bad bacteria in the body: they are attracted to diseased tissue, though they do not cause it.\n\nWhether or not we need supplementation is no longer an issue, except for one who is totally out of touch. The issue is what kind and how much.",

Male sperm count is less than 20% of what it was in 1929. (1981 University of Florida report, Natural vs. Synthetic) Infant mortality is up; birth defects are up.

Do they want people to take charge of their own health by natural inexpensive foods and supplements? Negative. A cure for cancer has been ‚Äúright around the corner‚Äù since Nixon.

In the text, Medical Mycology John Rippon (Ph.D., Mycology, University of Chicago) wrote, ‚ÄúThere are over 500 known species of yeast, all distinctly different.

This is to exclude other underlying conditions e.g. autoimmune.\n- Diet: Eat healthy (non-processed food) and experiment with an elimination diet, e.g., no sugar, no dairy, no meat. Reduce alcohol intake. Try to fast and limit calories. Include fermented foods and probiotics.\n- Cosmetics: Use coal tar shampoo, \nhypoallergenic soaps or soaps with zinc, sulfur, or Dead Sea salt. Check if ingredients in your cosmetics are Malassezia-free. Wash your skin with water mixed with lemon, bio apple cider vinegar solution, or water herbal extracts, e.g., green tea with licorice root. Dry your skin with a clean paper towel. You may also apply hyaluronic acid solution once a day (prepare the solution yourself and store it in the fridge due to short shelf-life). MCT should help. Use at least 99% bio MCT oil (C8/C10) with two drops of tea tree oil every day (wash it off after 30 minutes). You can also experiment by adding herbs reducing sebum production or antifungal properties e.g. licorice root, green tea.\n- Lifestyle: Sun exposure should help. Change the pillowcase at least once a week. Change your towels even more often and wash them at higher temperatures. Reduce stress through methods such as meditation, sauna, and hiking in nature. Sleep at least 7 hours per day. Shave your head completely with an electric shaver, not a blade. Install a water softener at home, if possible. Avoid hot water, as it increases sebum production.\n- Steroids: Use them only as a last line of defense.\n\nMost important: EXPERIMENT!\n",

I'm talking around 60% coverage, and it made me feel hideous when I was little. I was also overweight and had zits which didn't help either! Luckily light therapy and coal tar medication has really helped, Ive lost weight and cognitive behavioural therapy has taught me to be appreciative of what I have! So reddit, opinions would be awesomez!

Plant wastewaters and residual oil and wood chips saturated with organic compounds were directly discharged or disposed of in the Pine Street Canal wetland. During the 1960s and 1970s, an oil-like material was detected seeping from the wetland into Pine Street Canal, the turning basin, and Maltex Pond. The State detected high levels of organic compounds associated with coal tar at several locations while investigating the site for a then proposed highway. The State was concerned that construction would release organic compounds into the canal and possibly into Lake Champlain, the source of Burlington's drinking water.\n\nIt is amazing how few people know about the history of the barge canal and why you can‚Äôt build there.

I went there he gave me a sample of Promiseb which from what I read is just Hydrocorisone which I ALREADY FREAKING USED!!! So yeah I expect that to work really well.\n\nSeriously I don't think people who don't have this condition realize how good they have it. Being able to look in the mirror and not be digusted. Every god dam morning same old bs, redness, maybe some flakes if my body is feeling extra willing to scew me over. My confidence is sky freaking high with this with my skin falling off my face like a have a sun burn 24/7.\n\nEnough with me talking, here is my COMPLETE LIST OF EVERY THING. NOTHING IS GOING TO BE LEFT OFF OF FORGOTTEN. \n\nHydrocortisone 2.5%,\nKeto(crap)azole 2%,\nCiclopirox 1%,\nTretinoin 0.25%,\nDesonide 0.05% (Extra Garbage),\nCoal Tar Face Wash,\nTea Tree oil,\nSacylic acid 20%,\nAzealic Acid 10%,\nMCT C8 Oil (Not sure if this is just a bunch of bs but everyone swears by it, I sure don't),\nRubbing Alochol (Yeah I am desprate),\nGlycolic Acid 35%,\nZoryve 0.3% (Hyped up bs),\nDead Sea Salt,\nTooth Paste,\nSome stupid mosturizer,\nBurts Bees Deep Pore Scrub,\nApple Cider Vineagr,\nSea Salt Water,\nNizoral 1% Keto,\nSelsun Blue Medicated Selinum Sulfide,\nZinc Pyrithum 2% Bar of Soap,\nMalic Acid,\nMelting it off with excessive amounts of 20% Salcylic acid (nothing either),\nCutting it off with a sharp object (didn't go well and regrew red).\n\nIf anything I didn't mention feel free to tell me and i'll get my hopes up just to be let down again. If your wondering my doctor said he wouldn't prescribed me any orals, I asked. Idgaf about my liver when my face looks like trash 24/7 at least you cannot see my liver messed up since it is on this inside.\n\nYup, that is all. Nothing... nothing at all did anything. You can mark my words, if I ever even get to this point I AM NEVER HAVING CHILDREN I DON'T WANT ANYONE ELSE TO SUFFER WITH THIS. Not like anyone wants to date me anyways I look like trash 24/7 which probably explains why I haven't ever had a partner. I don't know what I did to be cursed with this but it must have been really bad. I'm sure you can tell by just reading all this I am done with everything it has me so upset it is literally a curse... ya know I have more to say but I'm already in tears so I might as well cap it here. I don't know why no one irl wants to help me but yeah idk sucks to be me I guess. Also I am not trying to harm myself or anything I am just really annoyed with this condition.

I know your derm won't prescribe orals but if you've tried everything else, your doc should ultimately go with your wishes and give you what you want.

I'm going through your post history and it seems like you're giving up after being dissatisfied after a week, sometimes a month even? With most prescriptions, you don't see results until 3-4 months of usage. \n\nHonestly, have you considered using ***less (but gentler)*** products? Just because your skin can handle a higher concentration doesn't mean it's better for your skin either. It's probably why your skin is so irritated on top of your seb derm and why you haven't seen any improvements. Glycolic acid 39%, salicylic acid 20%, and undiluted tea tree oil without a carrier oil? Oof. \n\nI'm asking this because we have a similar medical history. I've had seb derm/folliculitis for 10 years and have been prescribed/purchased everything on the market. I've even been on Accutane four times and while it temporarily \"cured\" me for a year, it always came back. Accutane may be option if you're *very* desperate, but be aware of permanent side effects. I have permanent dry eyes from the drug; my meibomian glands have atrophied so air conditioning, looking at monitors, and watching TV burns my eyes. \n\nAnyways, I had to stop using all of my prescribed seb derm steroids and shampoos because my skin never improved and I suffered from so much hair loss. Right now my skincare regimen is minimal, all about moisturization, and keeps my seb derm/folliculitis at bay.

I'm in my late 30s and suffered from seb derm for close to 20 years before I finally got my condition under control. For years I went through a cycle of going to a dermatologist, trying the latest product, watching the seb derm persist, getting frustrated... I have a bag full of products that supposedly help seb derm. \n\nI finally went to an amazing dermatologist roughly 6 months ago who put me on a new regime and the results were absolutely incredible. Everyone is different, but this worked wonders for me:  \n\n\n1) Firstly, stop using/do not use:  \n\\- Any kind of steroid on your face. They treat the symptoms of seb derm, but not the underlying cause, and after time I found they would actually irritate my skin rather than calm it  \n\\- Shampoos on your face. I would use Nizoral or head and shoulders or some kind of dandruff shampoo on my hair as well as my face and when I got out of the shower my skin would be redder and more irritated than it was before the shower   \n\n\n2) Secondly, no \"holistic\" treatment worked for me. I didn't try every holistic treatment, but I can tell you that neither apple cider vinegar nor salt water helped me   \n\n\n3) Finally, what the dermatologist prescribed:  \n\\- A gentle OTC skin cleanser to use every day in the shower. I use Cetaphil's Gentle Skin Cleanser   \n\\- 2% ketoconazole cream. This wasn't surprising as it's usually the first thing dermatologist's perscribe     \n\\- Pimecromlimus. I've never heard of this one, but let me tell you it's GREAT. HIGHLY RECOMMEND   \n\\- a Sodium Sulfacetamide - Sulfur face wash to use periodically instead of the gentle skin cleanser   \n\n\nThe point is to use the different medications **together** to really attack from multiple fronts. I used the sodium sulfur face wash in the shower, put the ketoconazole on after I got out, and then the Pimecromlimus on top of that. My skin was initially a bit irritated, but by day 2 or 3 the seb derm completely receded. Completely. I'd never experienced anything like it in the 20 years I had seb derm. I now periodically use the 3 to maintain.   \n\n\nI hope this helps!",

Your dark lord is ready to use and abuse them until you can‚Äôt see straight any more.\n\n&nbsp; \n\nPlease keep reporting my posts you swaggerless cretins. My dick only grows more veins every time that you do. Soon, my throbbing erection will wrap around the globe and blot out the sun over your houses. \n\n&nbsp; \n\n[Last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m3xb8r/strap_in_and_open_wide_titfuckers_im_about_to/) I fucking told you half-baked nimrods that there COULD be ways to derail this shit, and all I asked for in return for my hard work was for you dickwranglers to discuss that. I literally spent yesterday screaming at you festering cuntsores to do your own DD, and most of the responses I got were jackasses jizzing out emojis into the comment box, followed by ‚ÄúBUY HODL APE MOON ROFLMAO‚Äù and then smashing the send button deep into their cheeto-dust-encrusted fat rolls. At this point, you‚Äôre welcome to slam Batman and Joker figurines up your gaping fuckholes and let them duke it out in your duodenum. \n\n&nbsp; \n\nGod dammit, you diarrhea-encrusted grundlefucks. I‚Äôm so glad that Keith Gill (Peace Be Upon Him) decided to risk his life, safety, freedom, and fortune for your worthless flabby existences. I‚Äôm finding out more and more that you colostomy bags are fucking impossible to underestimate. If only your daddies had bothered to wear condoms, we wouldn‚Äôt be in this sloppy fucking mess. \n\n&nbsp; \n\nIf you Disney-raised pillow princesses are just gonna focus on the positives the whole time, you‚Äôre going to sink balls-deep into an echo chamber of bullshit. So here‚Äôs a dose of the real fucking world, you semen-glazed cupcakes. Mufasa dies. Anakin guts the fuck out of the younglings, chokes out his wife, and engineers the genocide of his entire order. And there could potentially be nefarious plans in the works, which, in my opinion, could prevent the beloved squeeze from squozeing if they're not identified and subverted.\n\n&nbsp; \n\n#AND, AS ALWAYS, NONE OF THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVICE. IF ANY OF YOU HUMAN PUBIC HAIRS YOU TAKE IT AS ADVICE TO BUY, HOLD, PUSSY OUT AND SELL, OR DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN YOUR OWN FUCKING RESEARCH, THEN I HOPE THAT THE MODEL S THAT ELON LAUNCHED INTO SPACE COMES SCREECHING BACK THROUGH THE STRATOSPHERE TO LAND ON YOUR FUCKING HOUSE. IF YOU CAN‚ÄôT DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH THEN THE ONLY WAY YOU DESERVE TO MAKE A LIVING IS BACK-ALLEY BLOWJOBS AT THE WORST TRUCK STOPS IN AMERICA.

A truly responsible investor identifies strategies to get around them. A truly responsible‚Ä¶well, judging by the number of children you stupid chunks of coal tar have abandoned with the windows up in your Jeep Compasses on hot days, there are maybe three responsible people scattered throughout the lot of you.\n\n&nbsp; \n\nThis is not bear DD you buttfuckers. This is a reality check. If you can anticipate your enemy‚Äôs plan beforehand, you can outmaneuver them, outguess them, and position your diamond dick squarely in front of their mouth so they choke on it when they are least expecting it. \n\n&nbsp; \n\nThis is also, as I‚Äôve warned before, not financial advice. I‚Äôm about to make a bunch of claims that I believe. Your job is to doubt that shit. Several brave bastards in the mezzanine took me on last thread, and one poster, /u/the_captain_slog, managed to flex their brass genitals so hard that I corrected one of my DD factors. Most of you idiots just decided to wrap your lips around my post while gagging on the tip and blindly swore up and down that I was telling you to hold or buy more. I can assure you that I‚Äôm not invested enough into any of your worthless futures as to leave subliminal messaging in one of my threads. \n\n&nbsp; \n\nNow after two of these posts I‚Äôm convinced that at least 90% of you are going to stare at it slackjawed while you pop the zits oozing on your face and shotgun a 2-liter of liquid diabeetus down your disgusting fucking gullets. Frankly I think your synapses would work better if your parents were only second cousins instead of first, but you have to play the hand that you were dealt. \n\n&nbsp; \n\n But, for just a moment, I‚Äôd like to talk to everyone here who‚Äôs not perpetually addled by high fructose corn syrup crystals forming in their bloodstream. I want you to slam your brains against the brick wall of these questions until you start leaking cerebrospinal fluid:\n\n* Why the fuck have the Melvins and Citrons of the world outsmarted retail in the past?\n\n* What do they know that retail doesn‚Äôt?\n \n* How much cheaper is it for them to break rules/laws and pay the fines than it is to comply with covering their shorts? \n\n&nbsp; \n\nSo now, you inglorious ganglia, I am opening the comment section to discussion. What possible things could happen to prevent the squeeze, and most importantly, **HOW CAN ITTY-BITTY RETAIL TRADERS THWART THIS BUTTFUCKERY?**  I‚Äôll start with a few of my own ideas, just to get the juices flowing for you prolapsed assholes. \n\n1. Uncle Sam could just step in, drop trou, and flop his massive patriot log down on the chessboard, scattering pieces to kingdom come.\n \n 1a. **SOLUTION:** start writing your fucking congresspeople. Go watch that hearing from a few weeks back. Dozens of representatives ripped Plotkin, Griffin, and ‚ÄúTaco Tuesday‚Äù Tenev a set of gaping new assholes. Reach out to them with an email and let them know how hard their inquiry made your nipples. \n\n\n2. The long bull hedgefunds, aka the UI‚Äôs (unknown investors) could take their profits early and vamanos, crashing this shit yet again and leaving retailers with their tiny $40 dicks in their hands.\n \n 2a. **SOLUTION:** I don‚Äôt think this is very likely to tank the price, because even if a whale exits, there are millions of retailers and other bull funds ready to take their fucking place. Y'all decide. \n3. Robinhood prohibits buying $GME allllll over again.\n\n 3a. **SOLUTION:** abort that shit like you aborted your last drunken mistake. If you‚Äôre too fucking pussy to leave RH right now you can always open accounts at other brokers to spread out the risk that one of them goes tits-up during the squeeze. \n\n4. The Yellowstone Caldera erupts, burying North America under a sea of lava and soot, and thankfully carrying me to the sweet embrace of the Valkyries, who will guide me to Valhalla, where I won‚Äôt have to hear any of you rectal abscesses bitch about GME ever again.\n\n 4a. **SOLUTION:** [HACK THE PLANET.](https://media2.giphy.com/media/14kdiJUblbWBXy/giphy.gif)\n\n&nbsp; \n\nThose are just some ideas for what retail could be up against. I‚Äôm not a fucking expert at anything except pleasuring your mother‚Äôs asshole, so don‚Äôt blindly follow what I‚Äôm fucking saying. Take your lazy, slobbery booger-hooks off of your shrunken fucking nanococks for just ten fucking seconds so you can go down in the comments section and talk it out with eachother. \n\n&nbsp; \n\nI know you butterschmucks have been sitting idle all day, popping your zits, scratching your asses, picking lint out of your navels and sniffing it, all while waiting for somebody with a bigger tubesteak than you to wing down from on high and save your asses. Well guess what. Nobody‚Äôs coming for you, because none of you assmasters fucking matter in the grand scheme of things. And at this point I‚Äôm fully aware that most of you will continue spamming emojis and viewing my instructions to do your own research as something entirely else, because you lack any and all conviction to think for yourselves. Your dongs are so small and weirdly square that the only thing you‚Äôre suitable to fuck is a wombat‚Äôs asshole, and if you shitkickers stay busy fucking wombats, that will probably result in a better economic outcome than any of you third-class dicknipples actually participating in the stock market. \n\n&nbsp; \n\nAll you have is me, and I fucking despise you. I‚Äôm willing to invest the bare minimum time into shitting my thoughts out just so you slime molds can witness how a vertebrate‚Äôs nervous system works. \n\n&nbsp; \n\nBut here my responsibility ends. I‚Äôm too busy pissing excellence, eating pussy, and motorboating titties to care about you troglodytes any more. And frankly, if you‚Äôre all just going to roll over and take it in the ass from these rich bastards, then we just as well should have voluntarily lost the cold war, because at least the pinko commies wouldn‚Äôt have put up with their manipulative fuckery. \n\n&nbsp; \n\n#Position: 16 shares at 192.63, steel cock at full mast, adamantine balls dangling proudly in the breeze, diamond pubes sharp enough to cleave molecular structures. \n\n&nbsp; \n\nTL;DR: since you cumrags are allergic to doing your own proper DD, I‚Äôm introducing you to compelling reasons why you should pull your fingers out of your hemorrhoid-encrusted dick garages, wait for your voices and testicles/ovaries to drop, and learn to take care of yourselves. Anything can go tits-up and if you have money involved it‚Äôs your full-time job to anticipate why so you can plan how to win. Wait, who the fuck am I kidding? None of you cross-eyed Teletubbies have won a single thing in your entire life, so you wouldn‚Äôt know what to do with victory if it jumped up and bit you in your sweat-encrusted taints. To think that your forefathers died on Normandy Beach so you could turn out like this‚Ä¶\n\n&nbsp; \n\nAs always, if you don‚Äôt grow the cojones to sign the shareholder letter then you don‚Äôt deserve to be a shareholder, because you‚Äôre willing to let a few Chad Thundercocks with giant positions ram you doggystyle and un-lubed while they dictate your future. I signed it, and my position is as tiny as my balls are Jovian. I‚Äôd rather jack off with 80-grit sandpaper than let somebody else dictate my future. \n\n&nbsp; \n\n#[MAKE SURE YOU'VE SIGNED IT TOO, YOU PRIMORDIAL FUCKS.]( https://www.stockholdersrights.com/)\n\n&nbsp; \n\nIn summation, I think your mothers spat the best part of you out into a dip cup at a frat party, and the optimal place for you on this planet is as far the fuck away from me as humanly possible so I don‚Äôt catch your stupidity. Go fuck yourselves with a rake, sideways. \nAnyway, I‚Äôm heading to the stonkforest to [buttfuck the rainbow bears into oblivion.]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgIIRO-VqUY) \n\n&nbsp; \n\nNow crawl out of your shitholes and start discussing amongst yourselves. Give your fucking awards to charity or use them to buy something, or maybe hire a dominatrix to beat the shit out of you like you deserve. No matter what, I don‚Äôt want them. Anyone who awards this post is getting a shirtless old man in their fucking inbox, a la Big Daddy Salvia. Fuck you all.\n\n&nbsp;  \n\nI'd like to see Andrew Mo Money try to get through THIS post on his livestream.",

The primary witness was a famous Broadway stage actor.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6fqwjd3y2y3e1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=33bc2e2eae97da6c5fb68f6783ca0294c7e53c4b\n\nBy Kevin J. Guhl\n\nAustin H. Clark, zoologist and marine biologist at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., declared in 1930 that modern steamships had destroyed the fables about sea serpents residing in American waters and beyond. It might be true that humankind's conquering of the oceans dispelled the old fears of ancient mariners who were tossed about the sea in rickety wooden boats. By the dawn of the 20th century, thousands of passengers were riding high on steel behemoths that could cross the Atlantic Ocean in mere days. But accounts of sea serpents still trickled out into the press during this era. In fact, a spectacular sighting occurred in 1911 aboard one of the world's largest ocean liners, operated by the White Star Line‚Äîthe same company whose hubris would be tragically tempered by the loss of its \"unsinkable\" Titanic less than a year later. And the primary witness was one of the most famous actors of his day.\n\nVictorian matinee idol Robert Hilliard, \"the handsomest man on the American stage\"‚Äîessentially the George Clooney of the 1870s‚Äîwas known for his sartorial appearance and performance in \"he man\" roles during his Broadway heyday. Hilliard was celebrated for his immaculate dress. A striking figure on Manhattan streets, he wore a white carnation in his lapel that matched the silver whiteness of his hair in later years.\n\n[Robert Hilliard, 1912](https://preview.redd.it/dpzs2wg13y3e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6a80af53a97fcbde1c71f7c3ed0c2c069c32b7a)\n\nHilliard's greatest success was his starring role in \"A Fool There Was,\" described contemporarily as \"a daring and realistic play that startled New Yorkers from their Lenten lethargy like a sudden explosion of dramatic dynamite.\" Hilliard began his run with the play at the Liberty Theatre on Broadway in March 1909 and continued to tour with the show for several years. Hilliard played the titular fool, who loses both his family and successful career as a Wall Street lawyer/diplomat when he succumbs to his lust for the (non-undead) \"vampire woman,\" a femme fatale who enjoys using her charms to seduce men and ruin their lives. American playwright Porter Emerson Browne based \"A Fool There Was\" on Rudyard Kipling's poem \"The Vampire,\" which was in turn based on a well-known 1897 painting, \"The Vampire,\" by Kipling's cousin, artist Sir Philip Burne-Jones. \"In making the vampire woman of 'A Fool There Was' a brunette, we followed Burne-Jones' painting exactly,\" Hilliard once mused. \"As a matter of fact blondes‚Äîthe real ones, not the peroxides‚Äîare the most dangerous type of womankind. There is ample scientific authority for this conclusion.\" Theda Bara portrayed the vamp in the 1915 movie version of \"A Fool There Was,\" one of the popular starlet's few surviving films, opposite Edward Jos√© as the fool.\n\n[A black and white reproduction of \\\\\"The Vampire\\\\\" \\(1897\\) by Philip Burne-Jones. The original painting is lost.](https://preview.redd.it/lffb77b53y3e1.png?width=531&format=png&auto=webp&s=5643a69a310934d146423649beb1cf73d9f2d8fd)\n\nHilliard traveled to London with the express purpose of attending a production of \"A Fool There Was\" in the spring of 1911. No sooner did he step foot on land than he learned that the British production had been shut down for good the previous night. Severely disappointed, Hillard headed for Liverpool and boarded the RMS Celtic for the trip back across the Atlantic Ocean toward New York City.\n\nThe massive ocean liner RMS Celtic was launched in 1901 by the White Star Line, the same company that would debut the doomed RMS Titanic in 1912. Celtic exceeded 20,000 tons and could accommodate nearly 3,000 passengers, eschewing speed in preference for luxury and size. Averaging 17 knots, Celtic traversed its assigned 3,000-mile route across the Atlantic Ocean between Liverpool and New York in about eight days. Built by the Harland & Wolff shipyard in Belfast, Ireland, as was Titanic, Celtic was briefly the largest the ship in the world until White Star launched RMS Cedric in 1902.\n\n[The RMS Celtic was briefly the largest steamship in the world. From the July 13, 1901 Philadelphia Inquirer.](https://preview.redd.it/bv2oyiv83y3e1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=779738791af4bad40d0eedeb7acfe3b69794e140)\n\nThe Celtic, carrying the deflated Hilliard on his return trip, pulled into port at New York on Sunday, June 4, 1911. That afternoon, reporters from the city's \"ultramarine\" press, including the Times and Sun, boarded at the ship's quarantine and headed for the smoking room to learn the latest gossip and news from the journey. It was here that a steward revealed the Celtic's surprising encounter with a \"monoplanic\" sea serpent at dawn Saturday morning, which Hilliard corroborated \"under duress.\" The actor begged that his statements not be printed since he disliked notoriety, a wish we only know about since The New York Times gleefully reported it.\n\nThe early-rising steward saw the strange sight off the Celtic's starboard bow and, instead of carrying the news to the bridge, ran to the rooms under his care and begged those within to come on deck and see it. This included Mr. Hilliard, who, in the actor's own words, per the Sun, had requested to be awoken \"if anything unusual occurred on shipboard or out in the illimitable ocean.\" Hilliard drew on his pajamas and went out on deck to join a mixture of fellow passengers and crew, where the supposed sea serpent was pointed out to him \"as the first great streaks of dawn appeared far off on the ocean's misty brim,\" said Hilliard.\n\n\"The sea serpent‚Äîwitnesses differ as to its length‚Äîwas sighted holding a bewhiskered, calf-like head ten feet above water. Behind, where the ears ought to have been, were two wings extending outward about ten feet, thus giving the saurian monster the appearance of an aeroplane skimming over the sea. The steward, in fact, described it as a monoplane sea serpent,\" wrote The New York Times. The serpent, according to Hilliard and the steward, was either pursuing a school of whales or keeping company with them. The steward claimed that the sea serpent turned a pair of \"large, mournful green eyes\" toward the spectators on the Celtic's deck. \"Then it passed on its monoplanic way, dipping up and down, just like that, but otherwise holding its head erect. Behind it appeared at intervals a dark-green body, moving through the water with a wiggly motion,\" according to the Times. Captain A.E.S. Hambleton did not enter the incident in the Celtic's log, unsurprisingly.\n\nThe New York Sun's article on the incident, written in a glaringly more absurd fashion, described the sea serpent as having a white beard that reminded Hilliard of King Lear. The monster was at least 200 feet long, with 20 \"convolutions\" showing above the ocean's surface, and rising from its back were two wings that were at least 100 feet from tip to tip, according to the Sun. An amateur aviator onboard remarked that the serpent reminded him of a hydroplane. As the Sun article also contained the jest that a four-masted \"Swiss Navy\" schooner had been dragged down to its demise when the leviathan dove, it is best to take their report with an ocean's worth of salt. Nevertheless, the Sun softened its outlandish claims, writing, \"The purser denied the story, declaring that the Celtic had not been chartered as a seeing-the-serpent yacht, but he admitted that there had been an unusually large Sunday school of whales noted off the starboard bow, or inshore, toward Amagansett \\[on Long Island‚ÄîEd.\\] early yesterday morning before anyone who had gone to bed was up. He could not account for the visions of those who had not gone to bed and who might have been holding royal flushes made up of marine monsters before the lights in the smoking room were extinguished.\"¬†\n\nSamuel A. Wood, a veteran reporter for the Sun and \"dean of the ultramarines,\" told his counterpart from the Times that, \"Sea serpent stories are rare at this port nowadays, but in the old days the men on sailing vessels saw many of them. Forty years ago, I wrote many of those stories, but as steam has replaced sail and romance departed from the seas, the sea serpents have evidently moved away from the steamship tracks.\" Wood's tenure might have been exaggerated here, as in 1906 the Times wrote that he had been \"recording the coming and going of the ships from New York for 20 years.\" That March, between 50 and 60 ship news reporters, past and present, had gathered to celebrate the 50-year-old Wood for his professional accomplishments. L.A. Southworth of The World preceded the presentation of a loving cup to the senior reporter by \"hazarding the guess that if Mr. Wood had not seen the Half Moon sail up the Hudson, he certainly had been at the launching of the old Peruvian bark Calisaya, with her renowned cargo of knotholes.\"\n\nThe ultramarine team gleaned some additional news tidbits from Hilliard in addition to the sea serpent sighting: Actress Grace Carlyle, a fellow passenger, had gone to London to study the play \"Passers-By\" by C. Haddon Chambers and would be the leading woman in the Broadway production, despite Carlyle keeping mum on the subject to reporters. (For the record, \"Passers-By\" ran at the Criterion Theatre on Broadway for 124 performances between September and December 1911, but it does not appear Carlyle was in the cast, with Louise Rutter as the female lead.) Also, Carlyle had been compelled to pay a $75 duty for bringing her Pomeranian dog onto the Celtic, and was \"rather pleased to be the first person taxed under the new tariff on all American animals brought back to America.\"\n\n[Grace Carlyle. 1917](https://preview.redd.it/voadr9mc3y3e1.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=12c86ef8fd07b9ea0bba86a91cfc5df39b5561b7)\n\nIn addition, Hilliard had won about $300 during the voyage betting against fellow passengers on the English Derby, accurately picking both the first and second horse. (This was some time before the sea serpent became visible.) Not content with those spoils, Hilliard won an additional $50 in wagers thanks to his quick thinking and ingenuity. The actor had worn his trademark boutonni√®re on his lapel every day of the trip until the last, when a flower could not be obtained. The passengers joked about it, and Hilliard bet he would have one on by 4 o'clock. Hilliard wired ahead to a valet to bring a fresh flower to the pier. The valet rushed onboard the newly arrived vessel and Hilliard placed the boutonni√®re in his lapel a minute before the clock struck 4, winning the bet.\n\nSea serpents were once enough of a going concern that when breaking the somber news of the Titanic's sinking on April 15, 1912, some newspapers clarified that the creatures were not the cause of the disaster. \"It is clear enough that the accident which has overtaken the 'Titanic' was due to an iceberg, either submerged or floating above water. When fifty or so years ago large vessels failed to reach their destination, it was quite common to attribute their loss to the machination of 'sea serpents'‚Äîmore or less mythical creatures of enormous size. There are plenty of people even today who believe in the existence of these fabulous animals,\" wrote the Manchester Courier. In pondering the myriad ways that ocean liners like the Titanic become lost at sea, an article in Tulsa World stated, \"The secrets of the sea have been investigated so well that no destructive agent is likely to exist which is not known to science. Collision with a whale would not damage a liner, though it would be bad for the whale. The sea serpent may be dismissed without comment.\"\n\n[THE GREAT SEA SERPENT AGAIN.‚ÄîCaptain J.F. Cox, master of the British ship \\\\\"Privateer,\\\\\" which arrived at Delaware on September 9 from London, says:‚Äî\\\\\"On August 5, 100 miles west of Brest \\(France\\), weather fine and clear, at 5 p.m., as I was walking the quarter-deck, looking to windward, I saw something black rise out of the water about twenty feet, in shape like an immense snake of 3 feet diameter. It was about 300 yards from the ship, coming towards us; it turned its head partly from us and went down with a great splash, after staying up about five seconds, but rose again three times at intervals of ten seconds, until it had turned completely from us, and was going from us with a great speed, and making the water boil all round it. I could see its eyes and shape perfectly. It was like a great eel or snake, but as black as coal tar, and appeared to be making great exertions to get away from the ship. I have seen many kinds of fish in five different oceans, but was never favoured with a sight of the great sea snake before.\\\\\"‚ÄîThe Illustrated Police News, Oct. 4, 1879](https://preview.redd.it/od55lpvf3y3e1.png?width=812&format=png&auto=webp&s=7457bd7cc329d03bbfbddf01ad3d6ca0c26e0dc3)\n\nAs an interesting aside, you might wonder what became of the White Star Line following the tragic loss of the RMS Titanic and several other vessels. Did it go out of business? Nope; it merged with its chief rival, the Cunard Line, in 1934, and Cunard was absorbed into the Carnival cruise line in 2005. The company that launched liners such as Titanic, Olympic, Oceanic, Britannic and Celtic lives on in the \"White Star Service\" that Carnival offers its passengers in the present day.\n\nAs bizarre and mismatched as a \"transmedium\" sea serpent with wings might sound, there were scattered reports of them following the 1911 encounter on the Celtic:\n\n\\-In February 1912, Miss Gertrude Green, a Maryland girl who won a trip to Bermuda in a publicity contest, returned on the Bermuda-Atlantic steamship Oceana with an amazing story. She and the four other Maryland girls who accompanied her on the voyage witnessed a weird creature rise up from the sea when the ship was about five miles out from Hamilton, Bermuda's capital city. The girls were so startled that they had trouble describing what they had seen to the Bermuda-Atlantic press agent, but all agreed that the monster of the deep had white wings and green eyes.\n\n\\-In September 1922, a dispatch from Constantinople stated that the Greek government had ordered an armed fleet to the Sea of Marmora to pursue a winged sea monster which had appeared off the Princes' Isles. The creature was first sighted in the Aegean Sea off the island of Negroponte (aka Euboea), where it frightened fishermen before passing unseen through the Dardanelles. Witnesses declared that the monster measured 40 feet \"and that its flappers alone would smash a ferry-boat.\" The passengers and crew of the Siri Sefain saw the serpent halfway between Pendik and Cartal, a station of the Anatolian railway in Turkey. There was a violent commotion on the surface of the otherwise tranquil sea, followed by the appearance of the vague form of an enormous winged monster. First the head and then the tail were seen. The Siri Sefain danced about in the disturbed waters \"like a toy ship\" until the monster dived and disappeared toward the islands. Naturalists, of course, believed the monster to be a whale.\n\n\\-A sea serpent with \"a set of large wings resembling those on an airplane\" was spotted on July 26, 1938 on Jefferies Bank, 35 miles northeast of Cape Ann, Massachusetts. The crew of the small fishing boat Giuseppe reported that a strange-looking black creature, 50 to 60 feet long with a head like a horse, broke the surface of the water several times that day within one-quarter of a mile from where they were fishing. Each time the serpent emerged, it opened its huge mouth wide, striking terror into the hearts of the fishermen. It also frightened the huge whales that were swimming in the vicinity, sending them scattering in all directions. The crew of the Giuseppe postulated that the monster was feeding on the shrimp that were abundant in the area. The sailors weren't able to offer a more complete description of the winged serpent, as they weren't particularly interested in getting too near it.\n\nThe White Star Line had a storied and tumultuous history, but who would have thought an encounter with a winged sea serpent was among those chapters? As for Hilliard, he is a reminder that even the most cherished celebrities can be forgotten in the passage of generations and time. But sea serpent legends are immortal, and the actor's brush with one‚Äîeven if it was the result of bleary eyes and perhaps a long night playing cards‚Äîbrings him back to top of mind for today's lovers of the strange.\n\n[Theda Bara in the 1915 film \\\\\"A Fool There Was\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/c4ijmynk3y3e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1939109338b6ae14490380d58f1191b24ad20dc9)\n\n",

Suddenly out of the blue I moved to London and over 20 years after last having psoriasis I ended up with a major case, all over my entire scalp, big ridges, flaking everywhere. Itchy as hell, the lot. Happy to say I‚Äôve managed to treat it, in part thanks to this sub, in less than 3 weeks. Here‚Äôs what helped:\n\n-Nizoral shampoo every other day. Before showering fully, wet the head then leave shampoo on for ten minutes. I found if I put the shampoo on in the shower I get bored and wash it off too quickly, so sitting with foamy hair and a towel on my shoulders for ten mins was way better and more effective for the shampoo\n\n-jojoba oil applied to wet hair with warm water, makes sure hair is conditioned after the nizoral, and is a natural moisturiser and anti fungal for the scalp \n\n-exorex coal tar lotion up to 3 times a day max. Leave in. Stinks but nostalgic of being a kid and at least there‚Äôs no nits this time! Got this from eBay\n\n-an emollient before bed or whenever the scalp is super dry to prevent itching\n\n-water filter for the shower. From eBay about a tenner. I think but can‚Äôt prove, that my psoriasis flare up came from dodgy London water seeing as that‚Äôs all that changed. My scalp definitely feels much better and cleaner water with less chlorine is better for the skin and hair anyway\n\nThis really helped me and I hope it can help someone else. I‚Äôm not a doctor but a sufferer. Honestly this flare up was baaaad, but this religious routine saved my arse and now my black T-shirts are in use again!!\n",

It was really crazy because when he shined a light in a certain way, I could see black flecks floating around. He said that was broken-off plaques that are now in my eyes... :(\n\nHe diagnosed me with blepharitis, with partial psoriatic and staphylococcal components. Apparently, the plaques had blocked the meibomian glands, located right under the eyelashes, that service the eyes, and created infection (most likely staph). Fortunately, the dead skin floating in my eyes wasn't causing any damage, but he wanted to treat the infection.\n\nHe gave me a topical antibiotic ointment that made my vision a bit blurry, but helped after the fifth day of using it. He also said that the main way to fight this is with \"eye hygiene\" by scrubbing the eyelashes with approved products (or even water) and keeping it free of plaques. The dermatologist gave me some really weak steroid cream that she advised to use with **EXTREME** caution not to get into the eyes, because it can cause permanent damage to eyesight (glaucoma, cataracts). The eyelids are also have the thinnest skin in your entire body, and if you know anything about steroid cream, they cause permanent deterioration of the dermal layer... and I do like not seeing light when I close my eyes!\n\nBoth doctors told me that this would probably become a recurring thing. So I made sure to stay on top of my biologics after that!!\n\nSorry you're going through this!! Go see your doctors and do your best! You got this! :)",

I never used to moisturize my face after washing it so my skin barrier was very damaged and I had horrible flares in my face and forehead, now my skin is glowing and is healthy, also I had severe hair loss in my eyebrows because of this but now my hair has grown back beautifully. For my scalp I bought a 3% coal tar shampoo that the dermatologist gave me and after 3 uses the patches, itching and hair loss were gone.  I also bought a scalp brush and it helps a lot with the flakes and oil, my hair looks so much healthy now. Let's hope I can stay free for at least 2 months!!

Slightly woody chypre, vetiver, and green fig.\n\n**One Giant Leap Perfume Oil:** Upon stepping onto the Lunar surface, Neil Armstrong uttered the famous statement: \"One small step for \\[a\\] man, one giant leap for Mankind.\" Possets' One Giant Leap jumps from fresh juicy lime to oakmoss by way of a delicious chocolate, a hint of spice, tobacco and light woody notes. Lime, chocolate, spice, slightly resinous, tobacco, sandalwood.\n\n**Beautiful View Perfume Oil:** Every astronaut who visited the Moon was awed by the view of the Earth. Unlike Armstrong's first words, Buzz Aldrin's first words are not well known. As he stepped onto the surface Aldrin said: \"Beautiful view, magnificent desolation.\" Beautiful View is an aquatic fragrance designed to express what is naturally beautiful to our planet. A combination of cedar, pine, oakmoss, sea salt, ambergris accord, lavender, and grapefruit results in a seductive fragrance that captures the beauty of nature: oceans, forests, flowers, and fruit. Cedar, pine, oakmoss, sea salt, ambergris accord, lavender, and grapefruit.\n\n**Magnificent Desolation Perfume Oil**: Buzz Aldrin's second phrase after he had set foot on the Moon was \"Magnificent Desolation.\" Posset's take on that phrase is a blend that combines the sweet essences of vanilla and orange with the spiciness of cinnamon and patchouli. The result is Magnificent only! No desolation here... vanilla, orange, patchouli, cinnamon.\n\n**LEM Perfume Oil:** LEM is the acronym of Lunar Excursion Module, the lunar lander used by the Apollo program. It was after the first Moon walk that it was discovered that the Moon has a smell! After Armstrong and Aldrin re-entered the LEM, they removed their helmets. To their surprise, the cabin smelled like the air after a fireworks display! It turns out that the moon dust that stuck to their space suits had a smell that was liberated by the oxygen of the crew cabin. A great article about this phenomenon can be read at Nasa's website here. Possets' interpretation combines sandalwood, burnt mitti attar, black pepper, a slight bit of coal tar and sweet Lychee. This definitely does not smell like the remnants of a fireworks show, but does explore the balance of sharp and soft, like moon dust itself. Sandalwood, burnt mitti attar, black pepper, coal tar, lychee.\n\n**Sea of Tranquility Perfume Oil**: The Sea of Tranquility or Mare Tranquillitatis was the chosen landing zone for the Lunar Module of Apollo 11. It was first named Mare Tranquillitatis in 1651 by 2 Italian astronomers. Like its name, this fragrance is a calming blend of vetiver, oakmoss, sandalwood, azalea blossom, and the slightest hint of lemon. A nicely balanced oil that can be comfortably worn on any occasion! The image is a gravitational map of the Sea of Tranquility. Azalea, vetiver, oakmoss, sandalwood, and a waft of lemon.",

I figured out that the likely culprit is my immune system reacting to the waste product of a common yeast which feeds on the sebaceous oil we all produce. Therefore-->impede the fungus' ability to proliferate in my scalp=eliminate symptoms of seb derm. Like any fungus it takes a little time to grow and establish. When it's well established it takes time to kill it, and for it to be shed, so be patient. When it's knocked back, there is some wiggle room to go a couple days without showering, but don't take it for granted, you must continue the regimen for life.\n\nThe regimen:\n\nRotate shampoos (each day use a different one), and apply the same conditioner, each time. That's it. 6 months free and clear. The shampoo details are important.\n\nSelson blue: medicated (selenium sulfide 1%), itchy dry scalp (pyrithrione zince 1%), and naturals (salicylic acid 3%).\n\nKetoconazole shampoo, and a coal tar shampoo.\n\nHead and shoulders conditioner (0.5% zinc)\n\nThe zinc compounds are a *highly* effective and long lasting fungicide. The conditioner is slightly  greasy but it sticks to the scalp and delivers the fungicide (zinc) throughout the day. \n\nIMPORTANT DETAILS: You HAVE to let the shampoo sit on your scalp for 5-10 minutes. It needs time to penetrate your sebaceous glands and skin in order for the fungicide to reach the fungus. It's embedded deep in the dead cells and glands in your skin. Suds up, rinse, suds up again, and don't wash it out until you're about to get out of the shower. None of these shampoos are effective if you don't use them properly. For BEARDS use the exact same technique. I did this with equal success and kept my lucious beard.\n\nFace: somewhat controversial it seems, but I've been putting hydrocortisone cream to spot treat problem areas on my face for almost 2 years, and it eliminated my facial sebderm. Wash/scrub with soapy water, pat dry, apply hydrocortisone cream. A little goes a long way.\n\nGood luck and don't be afraid to spend the money on all these shampoos at once, they last a long time and it was worth every single penny. My only regret is that I didn't do this earlier.",

    "body": "About me: 31/m with an oil slick for a face.\n\nI read somewhere that Sephora reformulated their moisturizer and it was a pretty good dupe for LaLa Retro. I have only tried Protini so I can't directly compare the two, but I recently started A-Passioni and wanted a heavier moisturizer for days so my face won't dry out. Previously I was using Clinique 72-hr moisture surge. \n\nIt is based on three types of oils:\n\n-Avocado Oil: Nourishes the skin.\n\n\n-Marula Oil: Repairs the skin.\n\n\n-Rose Hip Seed Oil: Softens the skin.\n\n\n\nIt received the \"clean\" rating at Sephora, which means it's free of sulfates SLS and SLES, parabens, formaldehydes, formaldehyde-releasing agents, phthalates, mineral oil, retinyl palmitate, oxybenzone, coal tar, hydroquinone, triclosan, and triclocarban, and contains less than one percent of synthetic fragrances. This product is also vegan, and comes in recycling packaging.\n\n**Full ingredients:**\n\n\nWater, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Isononyl Isononanoate, C10-18 Triglycerides, Decyl Oleate, Isostearyl Isostearate, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, Stearyl Heptanoate, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Glyceryl Stearate, Sorbitan Olivate, Stearyl Caprylate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Rosa Rubiginosa Seed Oil, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Squalane, Hydroxyacetophenone, Carbomer, Hydrogenated Rapeseed Oil, Fragrance, Tocopherol, Butylene Glycol, Gellan Gum, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, O-Cymen-5-Ol, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Polyacrylate, Polysorbate 60, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitan Isostearate, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid\n\n\n**Packaging:**\n\nIt unfortunately doesn't have innovative packaging as it comes in a twist-top jar. For $16 I'm not expecting much; the spatula I use for my YTTP night mask has been put to use in this jar instead of my fingers. \n[The jar](https://i.imgur.com/yCysZsGh.jpg)\n\n\n**Consistency:**\n\nThis is a whipped, thick cream. It absorbs nicely within 5 minutes or so. I'm not sure I'll be able to use this in the summer if it's warm without it making me sweat but it is definitely more hydrating than Clinique and doesn't create a film over my skin like 72hr moisture surge does, despite being a gel. A little goes a LONG way.  My skin feels very hydrated and plump. It does leave a slight shine just like any other moisturizing cream. I follow with a mattifying SPF and my skin looks absolutely great. \n\n**THE BAD:**\n\nIt has a scent. When I first opened it I actually gagged, it smelled like it had soured. However it comes sealed with a metallic lid like yogurt and part of the residual metallic scent was at the top. After using it, it smells like a cheap floral/rose scent. Strong enough it will definitely fill your nostrils but not so much that  anyone will smell it on you when you walk by, and the scent dissipates quickly. \n\nI don't have acne or breakout prone skin but this hasn't caused any issues for my skin whatsoever, and I haven't seen that mentioned in the reviews either. I will probably repurchase in the future until the next best thing, and save my money for better quality actives. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n",

    "body": "**Rathenau's Speech** \n\n\"Consider coal and steel. There is a place where they meet. The interface between coal and steel is coal-tar. Imagine coal, down in the earth, dead black, no light, the very substance of death. Death ancient, prehistoric, species *we will never see again*. Growing older, blacker, deeper, in layers of perpetual night. Above ground, the steel rolls out fiery, bright. But to make steel, the coal tars, darker and heavier, must be taken from the original coal. Earth's excrement, purged out for the ennoblement of shining steel. Passed over.   \n\"We thought of this as an industrial process. It was more. We passed over the coal-tars. A thousand different molecules waited in the preterite dung. This is the sign of revealing. Of unfolding. This is one meaning of mauve, the first new color on Earth, leaping to Earth's light from its grave miles and aeons below. There is the other meaning... the succession... I can't see that far yet...  \n\"But this is all the impersonation of life. The real movement is not from death to any rebirth. It is from death to death-transfigured. The best you can do is polymerize a few dead molecules. But polymerizing is not resurrection. I mean your IG, Generaldirektor.\"  \n\"*Our* IG, I should have thought,\" replies Smaragd with more that the usual ice and stiffness.   \n\"That's for you to work out. If you prefer to call this a liaison, do. I am here for as long as you need me. You don't have to listen. You think you'd rather hear about what you call 'life': the growing, organic Kartell. But it's only another illusion. A very clever robot. The more dynamic it seems to you, the more deep and dead, in reality, it grows. Look at the smokestacks, how they proliferate, fanning the wastes of original waste over greater and greater masses of city. Structurally, they are strongest in compression. A smokestack can survive any explosion‚Äîeven the shock wave from one of the new cosmic bombs\"‚Äîa bit of a murmur around the table at this‚Äî\"as you all must know. The persistence, then, of structures favoring death. Death converted into more death. Perfecting its reign, just as the buried coal grows denser, and overlaid with more strata‚Äîepoch on top of epoch, city on top of ruined city. This is the sign of Death the impersonator.  \n\"These signs are real. They are also symptoms of a process. The process follows the same form, the same structure. To apprehend it you will follow the signs. All talk of cause and effect is secular history, and secular history is a diversionary tactic. Useful to you, gentlemen, but no longer so to us here. If you want the truth‚ÄîI know I presume‚Äîyou must look into the technology of these matters. Even into the hearts of certain molecules‚Äîit is they after all which dictate temperatures, pressures, rates of flow, costs, profits, the shapes of towers...  \n\"You must ask two questions. First, what is the real nature of synthesis? And then: what is the real nature of control?  \n\"You think you know, you cling to your beliefs. But sooner or later you will have to let them go...\"  \nA silence, which prolongs itself. There is some shifting in the seats around the table, but the sets of little fingers stay in touch.   \n\"Herr Rathenau? Could you tell me one thing?\" It is Heinz Rippenstoss, the irrepressible Nazi wag and gadabout. The sitters begin to giggle, and Peter Sachsa to return to his room. \"Is God really Jewish?\"",

    "body": "**THE TABERNACLE OF THE LAMB & THE FOREIGN RECKONERS**\n\nPraise be to God for delivering his servant into the hands of His enemy, so that His enemy might hear the words of the Lord. Praise be to God for the efficacy of His grace in softening the hearts of both His servant and His enemy. Praise be to God for what limited reason he has permitted this servant. Praise be to God for the efficacy of that reason in delivering the heathenry of Ozark & Tenesi to Christ. In this hour, I pray for the salvation of the soul of Theodosius Hubert, dead of cholera in the summer of 2713 & alive in Christ for all eternity.\n\nI pray for my old enemy because it is only my time in his captivity which permitted me the opportunity to observe the faith of the hillfolk, and to whet my apologetics against the hardest stone the Adversary has yet provided. In some meagre way, I succeeded.  And I write to you now, Holy Father, hoping to convey some of what I have observed of religious praxis in the hills of Ozark and Tenesi, and my thoughts on shaping an apologetic program around this praxis.\n\nI say ‚Äúpraxis‚Äù and not ‚Äúdoctrine‚Äù because the hill faith consists substantially of the former and has precious little of the latter. Those Jesuits dispatched into these hills should not presume any kind of consistency. Near the borders of the Confederacy, the hill faith may resemble the Charismatic heresy; in the cosmopolitan markets of Memphis, it may be a half-evangelized, angelolatrous counterfeit of the Catholic faith; in the far East of Appalachia, near the borders of the Americanist Dominion, the ‚ÄúGadsdenists‚Äù of West Virginia resemble snake-handling idolaters of the American patriarchs more than any Christian faith.\n\nBut though I have heard the heathenry call out to the White Lamb, to the Burning Bush, to the Voice Which Thunders, to Jefferson, to the Snake Made Whole, and to an anarchy of angelic powers and principalities, the religious life of a holler always centers around the Revelation Garden, the Shine, the Family Bible, and the Tabernacle of the Lamb. Of those features, I first had occasion to observe the architecture of Ozark while being carried into the holler as prisoner, and during my stay, I would come to observe thse structures in much greater detail than the inner mysteries of the hill faith. I shall accordingly discuss Ozark sacred architecture before those mysteries promulgated within.\n\nWithin the curtain wall of each holler stand a number of low-slung and dour longhouses, each the home of a single family. With the exception of the shrine containing the family bible (which I will discuss later), these are secular spaces containing the bedding, food stores, and possessions of a single extended family: the patriarch, his wives and concubines, their daughters, and sons under the age of fourteen. In holler life, the wives and children are isolated, but their oppression has not dampened either their curiosity about outsiders or their attraction to the majesty of the church -- a fact which I first came to learn when carried past the families who stood at the doors of their longhouses and watched with fire-bright eyes as I was carried into the \"tater-ole\" beneath the Tabernacle.\n\nThat Tabernacle is built on a model identical to the longhouses: a sturdy frame of white oak logs, thrice as long in one dimension as the other, doors oriented inward toward the village commons. Like the longhouses, the Tabernacle is caulked against the wind and preserved from termites with a mat of coal tar, pine resin, and wool scraps, but is distinguished from the other longhouses by its decoration: elaborate scenes from mystagogic revelation painted in whitewash & coal tar & diverse pigments whose origins I can only guess.\n\nThose scenes, like the myths so prevalent in these hills, are often a confused and degraded retelling of Biblical stories or genuine history. To illustrate:\n\nAlong the eastern wall of the Hubert tabernacle was a depiction of the Descent of Pharaoh Bas-Pro, proceeding from the Revelation of the Coming End to the judgment of the American kings by the White Lamb, through his vision of the Blazing Star which led he and his people to the safety of Sheol, his contest of wits with Ol‚Äô Tom the Doubter, his emergence from Sheol, and his conquest of the usurper-kings of Memphis. The lesson of this story is a simple one: revelation will guide rightly; outsiders are ‚Äúken to knowth, n‚Äôain‚Äôt ken to wise‚Äù and will lead you to doubt your revelation; the world prior to the Event (and outside the holler) is corrupt and unsaved.\n\nThere is little to be had by challenging stories such as these. We know that the Pyramid of Pharoah Bas-Pro stands, and we can surmise that he was a man who lived around the time of the Judgment. His grandsons to perhaps the twentieth generation still hold high office in the Presbyterate of Memphis. But he was only a man, and if he was guided to the gates of Sheol by the Lord, it was the Lord -- not some pagan counterfeit -- who guided him. In these matters, setting the shattered faith of the hillfolk aright requires little more than convincing them that a man was merely a man.\n\nMy challengers among the belligerent faithful of Iowa might suggest that it is impossible to evangelize the holler without first tearing down the walls which protect it. But ours are not the only feet trodding this missionary ground: on my first night inside those walls, I met others.\n\nAn anecdote:\n\nAfter the brutality of the attack which had massacred Hauptmann Let-It-Be-Known‚Äôs company and taken me prisoner, my captors treated me almost gingerly: gabbling in the coarse Ozark tongue, they circled around me, fingering my cassock and examining my cross, retreating when I cried out & when I prayed & when I wept. The Presbyter, that great Ozark bear, eventually came to understand that I could make no sense of the Ozark language -- at the time, this author spoke only Latin, Iowan, and the Charlestonian dialect of Southron -- and sent for a translator.\n\nHe was a Motowner of perhaps thirty, dressed in the coarse woolen jumpsuit and hempen cowl of a postulant Engineer. The triskelion of the Mercedes Brethren hung around his neck. Swept up in a mania of grief & fear, I called out to be freed from the savages & wailed & made a general craven nuisance of myself. Undeterred, he tended to my scratches with a distillate of coal-tar, soothed my tears, told me that his name was Brother Manifold (if he had another, he never told me) and finally conveyed to me that Hubert‚Äôs men intended me no more harm than I had already come to, which much relieved my anxiety.\n\nDuring my captivity, I found much comfort in his educated company. It is by his argument to Presbyter Hubert‚Äôs men that I was freed from my bonds. It is by his argument that I came to observe the daily life of Presbyter Hubert‚Äôs holler. And it is the guidance of this heathen monk which inspired me to my apologetic program. I pray that by the grace of God he has since come to the church, for his mercy and patience in propounding his false doctrines to the Ozark serve as a model for my own program.\n\nThough largely illiterate, the peoples of the Ozark hills have a totemic respect for the power of the written word to preserve revelation for future generations. Blinded by vanity, the Church's ministers had not recognized that even benighted hillfolk understand the utility of the written word and call upon outsiders to educate their children. These ‚Äúreckoners‚Äù are as often foreigners as gifted hillfolk, carried from holler to holler by a system of endorsement and referral which even now I struggle to understand.\n\nBy attending to those practical and spiritual needs which the practice of the hill faith requires, and picking the unruly knot of false doctrine rather than attempting to sever it by the sword, we may yet win the souls of the hill folk for the holy mother church. For the home-church is not in its totality a Satanic replacement for the true faith, but the desperate confabulation of a laity hungry for wisdom and abandoned by its priesthood. Come as a postulant; come as a guide. Guard your flocks jealously, and welcome all who wish to descend from the hollers to join the community of Christ. Ascend to minister to the children of the hills. Cease to make war upon the Tenesi and the Ozark until that war is no longer futile.\n\nI say this knowing that, when the seeds of the true faith are planted, the coming harvest will be grim. In future letters, I shall discuss what I observed of the mysteries of Ozark, the anarchic cosmology of their gods & counterfeit angels, and speak to the Satanic corruption which shall someday justify the belligerence of the Iowan cardinals: the narcolatrous cult of Snake Made Whole.",

In peacetime, this can include service in defense of broader Christendom -- sometimes aiding the Ursulines against the Occultists, but also serving in more far-flung conflicts. Let-It-Be-Known serves in the Deitscher Guard, an honor guard detailed by the Hudsonia to the Pope, this being why his title is German. (His homiletic name may indicate that he's a convert, or it might be adopted solely for the duration of his service.)\n\n(2) Coal mines, being underground and full of expensive mining equipment, frequently still have working salvage. The Rust Cult tradition of sending Reckoners to coal country is less about the conversion of the heathenry (the Rust Cult, being only tepidly interested in prosthelytizing, only cares about conversions insofar as it secures better access to salvage) and more about potentially getting access to working bulldozers, generators, diesel engines, and other high-quality salvage found only in the hils.\n\n(3) Pharaoh Bas-Pro of Memphis is a widely attested but probably mythological figure from whom a wide variety of Ozark and Tenesi warlords claim descent.\n\n(4) Iowa and its cardinals are agitating for yet another crusade against Tenesi, largely out of Iowan political ambitions rather than any particular theological justification.",

I think that if you actually have dandruff it's pretty obvious because it comes with other issues as well (like smell, itching, greasiness) \n\nThis is what my sister in law, who is a hairdresser told me :) Also you may want to get a shampoo that is super, super moisturising and try that for a while. I don't know where you are but I use redken all soft. It won't clean your hair as well but it will nourish your scalp for a while. Always wash is twice, the first time giving yourself a really good rough scalp massage to loosen all the dead skin, second shampoo is for washing it all away.

    "body": "One of my favorite parts of the books is Seth Dickinson's alternate technological history. Falcrest is coded as an 18th/19th century society. In some ways Falcrest is extremely advanced for its time, while also not taking some technological leaps that happened in our world. It made me rethink my thoughts on the inevitability of certain technologies. Here, I've tried to list out the main areas of technology that Falcrest has developed, where they originated, and their future trajectories.\n\n* **Irrigation and water management**\n   * Falcrest is regularly hit by a rainy season from the Mother of Storms. They must have been able to built anti-flood systems, and been able to drain flooded land. I imagine them as the early modern Netherlands on steroids; they had to deal with a much worse flooding problem\n   * Their wheat and soybean farms probably need advanced irrigation systems\n* **Water and wind-powered machinery**\n   * We know they have waterwheels to power grain and soybean mills. They also use mills to make paper.\n   * I've always wondered whether Falcrest has a mechanized textile industry like industrial England. Throughout the books, I don't remember cheaply produced cloth being one of Falcrest's goods, they say they trade \"textiles\", but they never specify what kind. Maybe they're industrially produced cloth, or it's produced by hand-weavers. India produced luxury cotton cloth before England industrialized and shifted manufacturing facilities to Manchester. Without textile mills, maybe Falcrest still depends on hand-weavers in its colonies to make textiles\n   * I've never heard the books mention a steam engine. I've seen some speculation that the uranium mountain is a [natural nuclear reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_nuclear_fission_reactor), and its existence means that the Baru world is geologically very young. Maybe there aren't any fossil fuel deposits to power a steam engine?\n* **Ranged Weapons**\n   * Some historians theorize that Europe developed cannons to a greater extent than China because European castle walls could be destroyed by cannons, while chinese walls were extremely thick, so nobody invested R&D into wall-breaking cannons.\n   * Europe invented guns because as feudalism declined, their battles were usually between large infantry formations, while eastern cultures had to fight horse-riding nomads. Early guns were not accurate enough to reliably hit a horse archer, but they could hit a stationary group of soldiers standing close together.\n   * Early Chinese firearms were designed as incendiaries, to light people and buildings on fire, not to deliver a concussive impact.\n   * Falcrest isn't like europe, there weren't lots of warring kingdoms with fortified castles. Falcrest was a small country, and was attacked by Tu Maia horse warriors from the north and Oriati infantry from the south. It makes sense that they settled on the hwacha as the ideal weapon, hwachas can easily set things on fire and cause chaos in cavalry and infantry. They're especially useful during naval warfare.¬†\n   * I think Falcrest occasionally uses cannons, but the cannons are an Oriati weapon. Maybe the Oriati fight more opponents who live in walled fortresses, inspiring their development of cannons.\n   * Falcrest thinks pistols are a barbaric weapon, and their soldiers use crossbows as their handheld ranged weapon. But I think that if Falcrest has more wars with the Stakhi, they will adopt handheld firearms. Guns are better at piercing plate armor, especially if Falcrest trains formations of musket-firing infantry.\n   * The Elided Keep was described as being streaked with paint, to break up its outline. I was confused by this line, until I realized that this is [Dazzle Camouflage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dazzle_camouflage), a technique invented during the World Wars. Ships are painted with stripes to form an optical illusion, this makes it hard for enemy torpedoes and guns to calculate a firing trajectory.¬†I'm not sure if Dazzle works on a stationary building, but it's very cool that Falcrest has invented this\n* **Ships**\n   * Because Falcrest doesn't use cannons, their ships don't have to be as heavy. So they use clipper ships to move very quickly around the Ashen Sea.\n   * Their ships are copper-plated to keep out shipworms\n   * The study of ships led to many mathematical and physical discoveries, like \"dynamic instability\", described in Honesty Kabrir's letter\n* **Precision Manufacturing**\n   * Falcrest's clock-making industry suggests that they can easily make gears and other machine components with high precision. They have probably invented interchangeable parts.\n   * Their Levellest Floor suggests that they can grind level surfaces with something like the [Three-Plate Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatness_(manufacturing)).\n   * In *Traitor*, Baru calculated longitude using \"the sun and stars\". This suggests that Falcresti ships have a Harrison clock; otherwise, Baru would need to use the angle of the Moon in the sky(the lunar distances method). The [Harrison clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harrison) was one of the greatest early achievements in precision manufacturing, and opened the door to many new technologies\n   * Yawa's windup lobotomy equipment is amazingly precise; i'm not sure if real-world technology could create a programmable gear-based instrument good enough for a lobotomy\n   * I forgot where this is mentioned, but Yawa wore a mask that used a system of gears to modify her voice. I have no idea if this would work in real life. Another example of super-advanced gear technology, like the lobotomy equipment.\n   * Falcrest has wheel-lock lighters. I'm not sure if they got the idea from Oriati pistols or the Oriati got the idea from Falcrest\n* **Chemistry**\n   * They know how to create Greek Fire\n   * They can create diethyl ether\n   * If Ant Juice is meth(as theorized here: https://canmom.art/crit/baru/tyrant-9-brains), then Falcrest can use formic acid to create meth. Most of the other psychoactive drugs they use can be found naturally\n   * They probably synthesize chemicals for sterilizating their medical labs. In our world, carbolic acid was the first sterilization agent, synthesized from coal tar. If Baru's world doesn't have coal, I wonder if this blocks a lot of early chemical developments? A huge number of important compounds were discovered by messing with coal derivatives\n   * What happens when they run out of guano from Cauteria? In our world, there was a real concern that the industrial world would not be able to feed itself without nitrogen fertilizer. Then the Haber Process was invented. I'm sure Falcrest will eventually gain the chemical ability to perform the Haber Process. I wonder if the cryptarchs would see the food problem as an apocalyptic threat like the Kettling. Whichever technocrat solves it would be a hero\n   * Refrigerators?\n      * There's a line in *Tyrant* about salted butter from Falcrest being shipped across the Ashen Sea: \"The imported goods made everyone fat, Pinion said, and fond of salted butter.\" The Butterveldt has sometimes been described as a \"savanna\". How are they keeping the butter from melting? Maybe they melt it into ghee, but if they were, I think Seth Dickinson would call it ghee. It's possible that Falcrest has invented some kind of refrigerator. Ancient Iran had wind-cooling towers called [yakhchal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakhch%C4%81l) to store ice. An ice box with diethyl ether as a coolant was invented in the 1700s. I'm guessing Falcrest has enough chemical knowledge to make a small refrigerator. I'm not sure how they would make a refrigerator that can fit on a ship and have enough power for a large cargo of butter. Instead, they might use ice-boxes and super-fast clipper ships to transport butter.\n* **Medical Science**\n   * They have a decent understanding of the brain. This is the result of lobotomy experiments: destroying parts of the brain and observing what capabilities remain. Given their ability to automate lobotomies with windup mechanisms, I think their scientific understanding of the brain's architecture is as good or better than *The* Brain's knowledge.\n   * They also have studied operant conditioning very closely. Unlike BF Skinner, they were free to experiment on humans, not just animals, so they can take it to extremes unseen in our world. The Clarified are proof of this\n   * Microscopes?\n      * Throughout the books, I've never seen any mention of a microscope. This is a huge deal, because without one, the Falcresti can't observe cells, which prevents them from understanding a lot of biology.\n      * We would definitely know if Hesychast has observed a cell or seen one replicating. Falcrest believes in Lamarckian inheritance, and it took Darwinian theory a while to be accepted because Darwin couldn't sufficiently explain how traits are inherited. Once Falcrest starts observing cells, and using chemical dyes to mark cells and track them, it's only a matter of time before they discover DNA. I wonder how they'd have to change Incrasticism to fit DNA inheritance\n      * They have germ theory, but I wonder how much germ theory you can develop without ever seeing a germ. Their quarantine masks and ability to create and weaponize plagues without killing everyone in the lab suggests that they know how to sterilize equipment and block the spread of germs. Maybe they've invented the [Chamberland filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamberland_filter)?\n* **Math**\n   * They're very good with statistics. Baru brings up the Littler Law, which suggests that Falcrest is accustomed to working with Big Data; they must have been recording lots of financial information for a very long time to discover these sorts of patterns. They probably understand the idea of a random distribution, and can use statistical hypothesis testing, which is an inheritance from the ancient Cancrioth scholars. Many influential statisticians like Francis Galton, Karl Pearson, and R.A. Fisher were either all-out eugenicists or flirted with the idea. Galton's statistical discoveries came from his attempts to catalog physical and \"racial\" measurements across samples of humans, I'm sure Falcrest has done the same\n   * I think they have reached many of Isaac Newton's discoveries. Newton's Laws of motion probably existed before Falcrest, since Baru's mom taught her the Conservation of Momentum as part of the Taranoki tradition. If I had to guess, the Stakhiezchi probably discovered the laws of gravitation as part of their astronomy, and through their interactions with the Tu Maia that information travelled around the Ashen Sea. Falcrest probably also has calculus, it would help them aim their hwachas better.\n   * Trigonometry would be essential, for their naval operations\n   * Cryptography\n      * For short messages that need to be (relatively) quickly decrypted, they use scytales and [Vigenere ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher), as seen with Purity Cartone's message to Baru. I think these are what cryptarchs use to communicate when they're travelling.\n      * But for more important messages, they use hash functions. Depending on the complexity of the hash function, this would probably require large teams of human computers to efficiently calculate, since we normally use actual computers to calculate them. It's one reason why hash functions weren't widely used before the computer age.\n      * They also use rotor machines to encrypt messages(Baru's super-valuable incryptor). In the real world, these were invented sometime after world war 1, and the most famous one is the Enigma cipher machine, which could only be efficiently decrypted by Alan Turing's early computers. Our rotor machines use a combination of gears and electricity, Baru's must be purely mechanical\n      * Why would Falcrest use such advanced cryptography? In our world, cryptography advanced through arms races between warring european countries. During the world wars, the rival powers had \"black rooms\" to decrypt enemy communications. A lot of these communications were done through radio or telegrams, so they could be more easily intercepted; you didn't have to physically capture a piece of paper from an enemy spy. Falcrest doesn't have radio; the only long-distance communication we know of are Cancrioth frog-lamps; maybe they created a frog morse code signalling system that sent encrypted messages. I doubt that Falcrest's pre-revolutionary wars between the Tu Maia and Oriati spurred the advance of cryptography; these were more like raids than prolonged occupations, they wouldn't send a lot of paper messages back and forth. Maybe Falcrest had a lot of internal secret communications. Lapetiare's revolution could have invented secret codes to communicate between rebel cells.\n      * Another possibility is that hash functions were invented for data storage and retrieval, not for encryption. [This article ](https://spectrum.ieee.org/hans-peter-luhn-and-the-birth-of-the-hashing-algorithm)explains how early hashing functions helped to quickly scan databases of phone numbers. We know that Falcresti documents and identification papers come with numbers, stamps, and other symbols. If the entire population has identification papers, Falcresti archives must store millions of documents that need to be searched efficiently.\n      * This explains why their cryptography is so much better than our world's 1700s. Our computer and data storage revolution partly happened because of warfare, but I think the information demands of businesses and telecommunication systems also played a major role. Falcrest doesn't have information-hungry industries or a telecommunications system, but they do have a surveillance state and a complex bureaucracy. The mathematical techniques used by their archives could be repurposed for cryptography, and the cryptarchs are always looking for ways to break each other's ciphers. Their competition would keep yielding new advances in cryptography.\n   * What new discoveries await them? Kimbune's theorem. Baru understands *e* and *pi,* but she doesn't understand *i,* the imaginary number. But her description suggests that she has heard of it before. Falcrest may have proposed imaginary numbers, but like real-world mathematicians(including Lewis Carroll), it took a long time to accept their usefulness. I wonder what Falcrest would think of non-euclidean geometry(inspired by quaternions, another door opened by Kimbune's theorem), and Godel incompleteness. The Godel Incompleteness theorem might have implications on Incrasticism, it pokes a hole in the idea of a perfect system\n\n¬†\n\nI'm curious if any of these ideas have implications for Book 4; they could determine how the discoveries of the Lightning, radioactivity, and Kimbune's Theorem could change Falcrest's understanding of the world. Many of these discoveries, especially that of DNA, demonstrate that Incrasticism is not only evil, but objectively wrong. Of course, this wouldn't fix Falcrest, but I wonder if they would ignore or repress these ideas, or subtly shift Incrasticism to accommodate them.",

    "body": "Hi all,\n\nFor starters i wasn't able to add a photo to this post for some reason, so i'll just name everything instead.\n\nI have spent years, and A LOT of $$$ trying to find different products for my very complicated, and annoying needs for my body. After a lot of trial and error, i have finally found something that works for every need. Yay!\n\nI'm posting this in the hope that it will help someone find what they're looking for, and save some money. I'll be mentioning what purpose each product serves for me, and which others i've tried to use to fulfill that need prior but didn't work. \n\nDisclaimer: The products mentioned that did not work, simply did not work to fix/ fulfill that particular purpose that i attempted to use it for. It might work for you if your need/ skin is different than mine!\n\n**Shower**\n\n\\-Johnson's Head-To-Toe Baby Wash, Fragrance-Free: This is my general go-to body wash, usually my last step before getting out of the shower. It's gentle and gets the job done.\n\n\\-Tree Hut Firming Sugar Scrub (Coffee Bean): I know this one is controversial. This is a general exfoliator for me, pre-shaving, etc. I use this everywhere but my arms (because they're more sensitive).\n\n\\-FAB KP Bump Eraser: I use this predominantly on my arms. My KP is more active on my arms. I use it about 2-3 times a week. I don't find a need to use it more than that. I stick to using it when i see that it's needed. \n\n\\-Nizoral Dandruff Shampoo: This is a newer one in my life. I struggled with body acne on and off for YEARS. When i say i've tried everything, i've tried EVERYTHING. I saw a Reddit comment about using this as a mask for back acne, so i gave it a try, and boy was i missing out. I wet my hands and lightly lather some in my hands, then apply it where im breaking out on my body. I leave it on for about 30-45 minutes then i rinse it off. I have used it twice, and i already cannot live without it. It is like night and day. I've tried Neutrogena and CeraVe SA for this purpose and neither worked.\n\n**Moisturizers**\n\n\\-Nivea Essentially Enriched 48h 2x Almond Oil Body Lotion: This is honestly the best deep penetrating, moisturizing body lotion i have ever tried. I use this on a day to day basis, when my skin doesn't need any extra attention. I don't know what i was doing before i found this.\n\n\\-Organic Jojoba Oil: I love to mix it with the Nivea. I also enjoy using it on it's own but i try to do that at night to prevent any UV sensitivity that can be caused by oils. I have tried coconut oil in the past, and it usually just sits on my skin.\n\n\\-Amlactin Rapid Relief AH Therapy: This combined with KP Scrub have been the answer to my prayers for my arms. This has improved the overall texture and softness of my skin more than anything i have ever tried. I only use it at night because it contains AHAs. I also use it more frequently than i do the scrub, about 3-4 times a week. Works way better than CeraVe rough and bumpy skin lotion IMO.\n\n**Honorable Mentions**\n\nI get Psoriasis-like patches on the same exact spot on my arms when i go out in the sun, regardless of the mounts of sunscreen i use. Some times they bubble up and some times they look like Psoriasis patches. Could be sun-allergy or just Psoriasis. Depending on the state i use: \n\n\\-MG217 2% Coal Tar (only in the evening) and it helps dry it up.\n\n\\-Australian Gold Aloe Freezing Gel with Lidocaine: This helps when its inflamed.",

    "body": "(Translation by AishaChadTL: https://aishachad.github.io )\n\n-------\n\n# I: Rudeus, the Ex-Soldier\n\nI am Rudeus Greyrat.  \nPresently an umarried former soldier, and a mature, nice guy in the middle of regretting my life.  \n\n3 hours before, I am just a former soldier. But as it happened, one day out of nowhere there are divorce papers on my table. Later, I fought with my wife for my daughter‚Äôs custody, but I easily lost and thus became alone.  \n\nThere are no allies for me who stayed at home all day with my wartime PTSD as an excuse and was violent with my family. Even my sister Jane, who is a lawyer, allied with my wife. And the meat factory I worked at dared to kick me out the moment the court gave its verdict.  \n\nI exploded with half-madness and cried unseemingly at the last minute, but at the end most of my pay from the service got plundered for the settlement and I was left with a pitiful amount of cash and the house.  \n\nAlthough, I already spent that little cash on drink already‚Ä¶..  \n\n‚Äú........‚Äù  \n\nI am swaggering around the town with a bottle in my hand at the moment. My ears are still ringing with the words my wife said when she left the house.  \n\n‚ÄúIt can finally get some peace now‚Äù  \n\nI feel queasy remembering it. Who the hell do you think protected this country‚Äôs peace!  \n\n‚ÄúDamn it!‚Äù  \n\nWhen I threw the bottle cursing, an ugly-looking cat scuttered into a back ally and a kid with a skateboard stood wincing at me. He disappeared in a moment, but my head cooled down after seeing the kid.  \n\n‚ÄúHaa‚Ä¶.‚Äù  \n\nWhat should I do now‚Ä¶..no, know it in my mind. There‚Äôs no money left, so I should be searching for a job first. But how?  \n\nOf course by visiting the employment security office. I have skills. As far as driving is concerned I can handle cars, tanks, helicopters and even aeroplanes. I am good with a gun and explosives are in fact my specialty.  \n\nOnly if it‚Äôs not for my PTSD. I am a piece of junk now who becomes useless at the sound of an engine or a small explosion. The reason I am dropped by the meat processing factory is probably because I start shaking at just hearing a delivery truck.\n\n‚Äú..............haa‚Äù\n\nI am at a loss. At this point, I realized my life‚Äôs at a complete dead end.\n\n‚ÄúTch, seems like even the god abandoned me‚Äù\n\nFurthermore, it started to rain. The summer already ended and it‚Äôs about the time when it starts getting cold. The rain soaked the tanktop already threadbare from years of use and started chilling me to the bone without mercy.\n\n‚Äú.....If I can start over‚Äù\n\nWith those words unintentionally flowing out, I looked at the sky raining cats and dogs. There‚Äôs nothing to look at there except the coal tar sky.\n\n‚ÄúNn?‚Äù\n\nAnd the moment I thought that I suddenly noticed something in the corner of my sight.\n\n‚ÄúGiving you a second life‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs a billboard advertising for those who want to free themselves from their white-collar jobs and manage farms in the sticks. The moment I saw the board, my second life began.\n\n-----------\n\n# II: The Saint-Class Agricultural Advisor\n\n***Ex-soldier Rudeus Greyrat decided to go do farming in Kansas state and start his life over. While he did decide to start a new life, he doesn‚Äôt have the know-how for farming.***\n\n***He starts his battle against the PTSD that kicks in just by starting the combine and the eternal onslaught of pests and weeds. The one who appeared in the middle of this fight is the agricultural advisor Roxy Migurdia. In a blink of an eye, she taught Rudeus farming, and the graduation day is here***\n\n‚ÄúHats off, Rudy‚Ä¶... you pass‚Äù\n\nRoxy said while swaying her voluptuous breasts, looking at the grain field stretching to the horizon. That entire thing that spreads before her eyes is nothing but wheat, the golden-brown cash I grew from nothing.\n\nYou can see the ears of the wheat drooping heavily with grain even from afar. It is an admirable piece of farming.\n\n‚ÄúEh? But you haven‚Äôt looked at the other fields yet!‚Äù\n\nWhen I said that, Roxy shrugged with a forced expression.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need. The other fields also look like this right? If we are just going to look at it, it‚Äôs better to use that time to harvest‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAa, ok‚Äù\n\nI turned on the automatic combine‚Äôs engine and started harvesting. This second-hand combine I bought on Roxy‚Äôs advice is just about efficient enough but it‚Äôs easy to use and it‚Äôs now familiar to me as my own limbs. It took just a short time to complete the harvest.\n\nEven so, Roxy and I were drenched in sweat by the time it‚Äôs over.\n\n‚ÄúCongratulations. With this, you too are a splendid farmer now.‚Äù\n\nThe gorgeous woman proclaimed while drenched in sweat, pulling back her damp hair strands and placed a kiss on my cheek. In that moment, I felt an odd feeling stirring in my stomach. I know this feeling.\n\nThe feeling of accomplishing something.\n\nThe feeling I felt in Vietnam whenever we comrades hugged each other like mad after an operation‚Äôs success. For the first time since starting farming, I truly felt I took a step forward.\n\nThe next day, I cried at leaving Roxy who said she had nothing else to teach me. I truly learned a lot of things from her. Knowledge, experience, and skills. If she wasn‚Äôt there, I would have been probably still fighting with my PTSD.\n\nReally, more than all she cured my PTSD. I drove the combine. That‚Äôs all it took. But I no longer fear the sound of an engine‚Äôs revving. She did something my wife or daughter, my friends from the war, or the military doctors weren‚Äôt able to do.\n\nLet‚Äôs respect her. That glamorous and sexy golden-haired blonde, let‚Äôs respect her.\n\nI promised so to myself in my heart while looking at Roxy‚Äôs figure becoming smaller by the minute in the distance.\n\n------\n\n# III: The Kansas City Elf\n\n***Sylphiette is one of the street children that live in the slums of Kansas City. While searching through the garbage heap to find anything to sell like usual, she accidentally saw a group of hoodlums killing a police officer. She is then chased after by those people, having seen the face of the culprits.\nThe one who appeared in front of Sylphy while she is trying to escape is Rudeus Greyrat, who is trying to finalize a contract to sell the wheat. Rudeus took down those hoodlums in the blink of an eye and saved the girl***\n\n\nI aimed and threw apples in my hand at red shirts chasing the boy. The apples stuck the back of their heads splendidly and drenched the black suits with juices. The black suits started to run away with multiple ‚Äúfucks‚Äù thrown around, leaving the boy alone.\n\n‚ÄúHey, tell me, Why did you save me?‚Äù\n\nThe boy seems to be a street urchin, all skin and bones. He looks as if though he is an elf out of a fairy tale. When I thought that, I even feel like his ears are a little pointy too. But unfortunately, unlike the pristine elves, this one‚Äôs a little dirty.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because I was taught to be an ally for the weak in the school. Well, the school‚Äôs for teaching tactics to marines, although‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut won‚Äôt the people from before try to take revenge?‚Äù\n\nThey probably would won‚Äôt they? But that‚Äôs only if they are members of a proper mafia gang. If they are the kind that colludes with the police, my life would be in danger.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine. They killed a police officer. So, they will probably get taken revenge on by the state run gangs first‚Äù\n\nOf course, it‚Äôs not like I thought that far ahead before acting. If my brain‚Äôs that good I would not have let my daughter and wife leave me. When I started walking with those thoughts in my mind, the young boy followed me.\n\n‚ÄúWhat is it? Don‚Äôt follow me‚Äù  \n‚ÄúThey could kill me before they are caught by the police‚Ä¶.‚Äù  \n‚ÄúMaybe‚Äù  \n‚ÄúHey, give me shelter, even for a short time is fine‚Äù  \n\nWhat an audacious brat. I stretched my neck out on my own initiative but I can‚Äôt take more trouble on.\n\n‚ÄúHey, please, I am relying on you‚Ä¶.‚Äù\n\nBut when I see this boy I am reminded of my estranged daughter‚Äôs face. Despite being not looking the same at all‚Ä¶\n\n‚ÄúOkay, okay!‚Äù  \n‚ÄúReally!?‚Äù  \n‚ÄúBut you will have to help with my work in exchange for the shelter. It‚Äôs farming! It‚Äôs going to be as hard as marine training, you know!‚Äù  \n‚ÄúUnderstood! I will do it!‚Äù  \n\nWhen I said that, the boy‚Äôs face lit up. As I thought, a child‚Äôs smile is a good thing. Knowing that, why did I even those things to my family‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..shit.\n\n‚ÄúReminds me, I haven‚Äôt got your name. I am Rudeus‚Äù  \n‚ÄúSyl‚Ä¶.phy...‚Äù  \n‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that a nice name. Like the spirit of the winds‚Äù  \n\nWhen I said that Sylphy blushed and nodded with a quiet ‚Äúun‚Äù\n\n-------\n\n# IV: The Jamaican Hero\n\n***I am Rudeus Greyrat, a tough and cool-looking nice guy. I am employed as a home tutor for a lady from a good family after I retired from service with PTSD but this lady is still a wild horse.***  \n***I somehow got this wild horse under control and made it learn something, but while sailing on a luxury cruise, a big disaster. Naturally, it‚Äôs a shipwreck.***  \n***The tough me thought I at least have to save the lady and after swimming across the sea, an unfamiliar land. According to that fucking god who started appearing in my dreams since the VietCong time, seems like this is South America.***\n\nWhen I opened my eyes, there‚Äôs a man sitting in front me. I rose immediately, walked over the campfire and put a gun to his temple.\n\n‚ÄúWho are you! Do you intend to use as sacrifices for your god, do you!‚Äù  \n‚ÄúHey, hey, hey! Calm down!‚Äù  \n‚ÄúWhat did you do to us!‚Äù  \n‚ÄúI saved you! Did schools in your country teach you gift a bullet to people who saved you!?‚Äù  \n\nHearing that he saved us, I took my gun away even while doubting a bit. The god in my head mostly tells correct things. But there are also times when he says boring jokes while shrugging his shoulders. I have to keep it in mind.\n\nEmerald green hair, a red jewelled nose pierce, a vertically cutting scar on face, and obsidian black skin. And to round it off, the iconic duo of a radio-cassette player and a pair of maracas beside him. The different races taught by trainer Roxy during my time at military school floated up in my mind.  \nIt‚Äôs a Jamaican.\n\n‚ÄúWhat happened...‚Äù  \n‚ÄúYou people were collapsed in that beach over there, and I passed by, and dragged you up and made this fire to dry you. Meaning I saved you, very simple right?‚Äù  \n\nI see, it‚Äôs really simple. And when I am thinking that, Lady Eris opened her eyes. She was surprised at seeing the Jamaican first, but in the end it‚Äôs just a Jamaican. It‚Äôs not like he is the evil monster she was told in her childhood, so she interacted with a calm head.\n\n‚Äú......I am Eris, and this is Rudeus. Nice to meet you‚Äù  \n‚ÄúOy oy, isn‚Äôt this a better manners than the old man getting on in his years!‚Äù  \n‚ÄúPlease give your name too‚Äù  \n‚ÄúOkay, I am Ruijerd. A travelling musician. I make new songs while roaming around South America like this.‚Äù  \n\nSeems like this man is named Ruijerd. I thought he would named with something like a D or a J, seems like that isn‚Äôt the case.\n\n‚ÄúOk, I like the cut of your jib, lady, I will get you back to your hometown. On my beloved car, of course‚Äù\n\nWhen Eris informed him about the situation, he pointed his thumb towards his back. There‚Äôs an Italian car with a dully gleaming trident mark in the direction he is pointing at. A fairly antique one at that.\n\n‚ÄúIs it fine?‚Äù  \n‚ÄúYes, but don‚Äôt complain about the music in car. That‚Äôs my soul‚Äù  \n‚ÄúOf course‚Äù  \n\nWhile I am thinking things over, the conversation proceeded at it‚Äôs own pace and Eris got into the car with a victorious expression. Well, it can‚Äôt be helped if it turned out like this. Let‚Äôs just think about protecting Eris and getting her back home.\n\n‚ÄúBy the way, where are we now exactly?‚Äù  \n‚ÄúThis is Ushuaia, southernmost point of the continent‚Äù  \n‚ÄúAs, seems like our bad luck‚Äôs still going on‚Äù  \nThus, we set out on crossing South America on the guy‚Äôs car.",

On top of that, I‚Äôve struggled with other chronic fungal skin conditions like jock itch and athlete‚Äôs foot. Over the years, I‚Äôve tried everything‚Äîsteroids, prescription-strength ketoconazole shampoo (and plenty of other azole medications), salicylic acid, coal tar‚Äîyou name it.\n\nRecently, I decided to give topical niacinamide a shot. To my surprise, the seb derm on my face disappeared almost overnight. At first, I thought it was the niacinamide working its magic and even shared my success here. But after some trial and error, I realized it was the Zinc PCA in the solution. \n\nOnce I figured that out, I went out and got a shampoo with Zinc PCA (avoided Zinc pyrithione, just to be cautious). Within 48 hours, I saw a 90% reduction in dandruff. My scalp, which used to be red and flaky, is now almost totally clear. \n\nI‚Äôm beyond thrilled. The best part? Zinc PCA is incredibly safe and doesn‚Äôt carry the same risks of endocrine disruption that come with ketoconazole creams and shampoos. It‚Äôs not smelly and it‚Äôs really good for your skin! \n\nEver since I started using Zinc PCA, I don‚Äôt have to stress about my skin anymore. My seb derm, athlete‚Äôs foot, jock itch, dandruff are all very manageable now. If you haven‚Äôt tried it, I highly recommend giving it a shot. Personally, I use The Ordinary‚Äôs Niacinamide solution, which contains 1% Zinc PCA. There are also creams, moisturizers, and shampoos with it available.\n\nIf you‚Äôre wondering how it works, from what I can gather zinc reduces sebum production on your skin which malassezia yeast needs to grow. Zinc also has antimicrobial and antifungal properties, along with being anti-inflammatory. \n\nNOTE: This is not medical advice. I am not a doctor, I‚Äôm just sharing my personal experience. Always consult a healthcare professional before trying new treatments.\n\nBest of luck to you all! ",

I eventually learned that it was hereditary because my mother shares similar symptoms albeit milder. I started obsessing over how I could overcome it; I tried various diets and products but not to any avail. Cutting out dairy slightly helped but the problem was far from managed. A product called Prosacea, which contains sulfur, helped me initially but its effectiveness tapered off. \n\nI read that hard water aggravates the condition and that distilled water would help when washing the face. Low and behold, it was working and my symptoms began to improve. I still had some flaking and I found that coal tar did the trick. Moisturizers only seemed to exasperate the issue. I also experimented with different cleansers and I found that a cream cleanser was the best for me due to it being less harsh on my skin.\n\nI've been doing this routine for over 2 years now and I couldn't be happier with the results.  I've struggled with image issues for most of my life and containing this condition was a huge relief. I hope that by posting this I help out at least one person experiencing this.",

I sometimes get small breakouts of eczema but also from an external trigger like a bug bite\n\nI use OGX shampoo without conditioner and have long hair\n\nAs long I shower daily, my scalp feels good. A bit extra dandruff to be annoying but nothing serious. If I miss a shower in the morning, my scalp starts smelling and feeling funny by that night. If I miss 2 showers (a typical weekend) my scalp goes crazy. Hair starts shedding bad. It can takes weeks of daily showering to get the dandruff gone. It's extremely itchy and oily. It's worse on the sides and back of my head. My crown and hairline don't get it too bad. Little sores will start breaking out too and my scalp just feels sore. \n\nCoal tar shampoo helps. Ketoconozale makes it worse. Salyic Acid does nothing. Hydrogen peroxide seemed to help but I'm not sure. \n\n",

After doing IF for the past few weeks I feel the need to share on here how IF seems to be helping my psoriasis symptoms. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI started Keto December 3 and after a week of Keto I transitioned to 16:8, 18;6, up to 24 hour fasts, while still eating a generally low carb diet but I have been slowing adding fruit. I average a 20 hour fast most days but as long as I make it to at least 16 hours I am happy with that. My elbows, knees, leg, and scalp patches have improved significantly; aesthetically and decreased itch. Granted, I am still applying coal tar lotion on those patches...but I always have been and I have not seen it clear up this much before. I have just done some research on IF and psoriasis. Specifically on autophagy (the body recycling old cells) of leukocyte and neutrophils (the 2 common types of white blood cells linked to inflammation). I also looked up my medical history and have seen since 2009 (that's as far as my online chart goes) my white blood cell counts have been high. I am curious to see if I continue with IF until my next blood test, if I will see a decrease in the counts as well as continued relief of my psoriasis. Will be discussing this further with my doctor at my next physical. \n\nEdit: I‚Äôve done keto before without IF in the past and while there were improvements in my symptoms that I attribute to low carb eating..I believe IF has boosted my skins ability to clear up  even more when combined with keto. This is just what appears to be working for me and I hope it works for others too. ",

Then I started getting smart and tried getting desert into my daily routine - I was still within my carb limit but I was getting some sugar and lots of fibre (yoghurt and chia seeds). My psoriasis started getting worse again. After a very itchy, irritating flare I've actually gone full carnivore for the last 2 weeks and my psoriasis has nearly gone. Maybe 95% cleared, with no medication (well, I moisturise with nappy rash cream). Additional benefits have been that my hayfever has also nearly completely cleared up and I've lost 10 pounds. I eat once or twice a day, usually getting a minimum of 18 hours fasting. I haven't had any cancer scans, but everything feels fine - my next scan is April. Everyone says you have to do zero carb for at least 30 days to really see the benefits, so I'm still hopeful I might get complete remission eventually. It's a fairly hard diet to follow and it's definitely not for everyone, but the benefits for me mean I'm definitely going to stick to it for 3 months and then make a decision about whether to continue for good.",

    "body": "One of the most fascinating things I love about chemistry is the etymology of the words we use to describe chemicals. Chemists come from around the world and incorporate their own languages and culture into describing chemical theories. The word chemistry itself comes from the Arabic work al-kimiya (alchemy) which translates to \"black art\" possibly describing the Nile river valley.  \n\n\nSo how did we end up with the mess that is Phenolphthalein, something so common that plagues freshman titration labs? I went down a huge rabbit hole thinking it was a Greek root using opthalmos meaning \"eye\" or \"to see\", but I was way off. Working backwards we can find the roots.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe synthesis of phenolphthalein involves [the synthesis of phenol with phthalic anhydride](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Phenolphthalein_Synthesis.svg), so we know where the \"phenol\" part comes from, let's continue with -phthalein.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPhthalic anhydride was synthesized by [a catalyzed oxidation of naphthalene](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/V2O5OxNaphth.svg) and is named so because it is the anhydride of [phthalic acid](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Phthalic-acid-2D-skeletal.png), which is also derived from naphthalene. The -ine part of -phthalein comes from how chemists use it to describe alkaloidal and basic substances. We're almost there, we just have the messed up -phtha- part left! Who thought it was a good idea to put 4 consonants in a row?!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Naphthalene](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Naphthalene_numbering.svg) was discovered by distillation of coal tar and was the name given by John Kidd due to the substance being derived from naphtha. What is naphtha? It is a general name to describe any flammable liquid hydrocarbon mixture (this was when chemistry was still alchemy). This is where it gets muddy, but the general consensus is it's a Greek, Persian, Akkadian, Latin, Middle English bastard child of the original pronunciations of \"neft\", \"naft\" (meaning wet in Middle Persian), naptu, etc., which was translated to Greek as \"ŒΩŒ¨œÜŒ∏Œ±\" which, when put into Latin characters, is spelled \"naphtha\"(remember your Greek letters!).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo there we have it! If you got this far, thanks for reading! We did it! You can follow it backwards and see the combination of names to get to phenolphthalein. Now you can bug everyone with your useless, but cool, facts! Chemistry has a messy history that extends to earliest recorded history, and even beyond that, so when it may seem frustrating at times with these names that don't make sense, remember that chemistry is a globally connected science that transcends culture and time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease correct me if I made any errors and I will be sure to edit to have an accurate timeline and information!",

A hypochlorous acid skin spray or wound-treatment spray can also be very helpful (I only just discovered that one). \n\nBack in the day, a product called Clobetasol Propionate lotion (actually a clear liquid) always knocked mine out completely, sometimes for years.

    "body": "Bajaj Almond Drops Hair Oil is one of the most selling hair oil in the Indian Market. Why not, because it is made from almond oil which is beneficial for better immunity, a sharper brain, and healthy hair. But do this product, really has what it claims? What are the Ingredients? Is it worth using? Let‚Äôs find out.\n\nIngredient List of Bajaj Almond Drops Hair Oil -\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* LLP ‚Äì 76.8% \n* Mustard Oil including Sweet Almond Oil ‚Äì 21% \n* Perfume \n* Vit. E Acetate \n* TBHQ \n* CL 4700, CL 26100\n\n1. What is LLP? \n\nAccording to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_paraffin_(drug)#Health), LLP stands for Light liquid paraffin. It is a by-product of the petroleum industry and can contain cancer-causing hydrocarbons. This product has 76% of LLP. The reason is just to make it non-sticky. We understand that people don‚Äôt like sticky hairs, but this is absurd. Adding paraffin oil in a higher percentage can never add value to your hair.\n\n2. Sweet Almond Oil -\n\nIf you a look at the ingredients carefully, you will find that Bajaj Almond Drops Hair Oil has Sweet Almond Oil mixed with Mustard Oil. And, the overall percentage of Mustard Oil including Sweet Almond Oil is just 21%. That means, **Its main ingredient sweet almond oil is even less than 21%.** *Isn‚Äôt it a funny thing?* \n\n3. Perfume and Colors -\n\nThe brand has added perfume and two colors ‚Äì CL 4700, CL 26100.  \n\nAs per the data of [MadeSafe,](https://www.madesafe.org/hazard-list-3/)  Perfume is used as an umbrella term for dozens of different ingredients that make up a particular scent. Many common fragrance ingredients, like phthalates and synthetic musks, are toxic to human health.  \n\nAs per the data of [MadeSafe](https://www.madesafe.org/hazard-list-3/),  Artificial colors can be derived from coal tar, but are more commonly made from petroleum. A number of artificial colors, individually and in combination, have been associated with increased hyperactivity in children, including those with pre-existing hyperactivity and without. \n\n4. TBHQ -  TBHQ is another common additive in hair oils. TBHQ stands for ‚ÄòTertiary Butylhydroquinone‚Äô. It is mainly a Harsh Preservative used in Mineral Oils and Paraffin Oils. \n\n5. Vit. E Acetate ‚Äì The only safe ingredient - Vit. E Acetate is also known as Tocopheryl Acetate is a safe ingredient and a great antioxidant. It helps in conditioning the skin. It is the only good thing about this product. Source - Biodizionario \n\nIs it Good & Safe to Use? The Conclusion ‚Äì\n\nAlmond oil is naturally heavy in nature and as people love non-sticky hair oils, they have added LLP as a solution. It also contains potentially harmful preservatives, colors, and perfume.\n\nNow its your choice to choose whether the value for money products or continue using such products",

    "body": "Hi, /r/SkincareAddiction. I've searched this subreddit for information regarding seborrheic dermatitus and facial dandruff, but a lot of the posts are either centered around general seb derm (as in, seb derm of the body/scalp) or old. While I have gleaned a few new bits of information about the subject from those posts, I was hoping to get some updated help about this issue specifically, and to perhaps find some solidarity in other sufferers, as I've been hard-pressed to find people with my exact issue(s). \n\nShortly after puberty, I started developing some flaking dead skin around my nose and eyebrows, as well as scalp dandruff. As the years went on, it exploded into full blown awfulness. When I was around 16, I went to a dermatologist and was diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitus. I soon learned that my grandfather also suffered from it, but not to the degree that I do. \n\nOver the years, I've tried a slew of different techniques to try and combat it, though none have worked over an extended period:\n\n* I've used a variety of topicals prescribed by dermatologists\n* I've applied Head & Shoulders regular and medicated (the kind with selenium sulfide [note: I've also tried Selsun Blue]) directly to my face, left it on, and exfoliated afterwards, and that seemed to help for a while, but my skin quickly grew immune (I still use Head and Shoulders on my scalp, because it seems to work there, but it does not do a damned thing for anywhere else on my body)\n* I've tried products with coal tar, like T/Gel\n* I've tried products with salicylic acid\n* I ordered a Clarisonic-type rotating electronic scrub brush to exfoliate with \n* I've ordered exfoliating clothes (the Wonder Cloth, specifically) to try a less-harsh method of exfoliation\n\nMy current routine is as follows: \n\n> Before a shower, I apply ketoconazole (something that never really worked for me in the past, but I figured I'd try it again -- what's the harm?) shampoo to my face and leave it on for around 10 minutes. Then, either *in* the shower or before, I massage off the ketoconazole with a soft, warm, wet cloth, then apply Pond's Cold Cream and either use an exfoliating cloth or my electronic scrub brush to exfoliate away the thick layer of rough, dead skin. After, I splash off my face, then apply an emollient-based moisturizer. After that moisturizer has mostly absorbed, I hit my trouble spots (sides of noise, between brows, brows, forehead, tops of cheeks, chin, and hairline) with Vaseline. \n\nThis routine worked for a while, but within the last year, by the time I wake up in the morning, there's a fresh layer of thick, scaly, flaky dead skin all over my face. \n\nThis has become an absolute nightmare. \n\nAs someone who likes to wear makeup, I've had a LOT of trouble with it over the years, but lately, it feels like a battle. Even after applying a primer, I can't use liquid or cream foundations because they make the dry skin super obvious. I've switched back to mineral foundation, and though it works better for me, the dry skin is still visible in places. \n\nMy skin texture and coloration is a mess. Not only has the condition caused me to develop a rosacea-like redness, my freshly-cleaned skin is rough and has developed these tiny bumps all over. After applying mineral foundation, when I look in a mirror (especially in the light), it's super obvious.\n\nSorry for the long post. I wanted to make sure I was as thorough as possible. I'm so glad I found a forum to discuss this, as it's something I've been dealing with for years, and it's done quite the number on my self esteem.\n\n***TLDR:* Does anyone have any tips or general information about extreme seborrheic dermatitus? Is anyone suffering from this condition or a condition like this to this extreme? I feel very alone.**\n\nI've done a ton of research on it, but I can't seem to find anything that truly works for me. Please help. \n\nNote: I do suffer from symptoms on other parts of my body, as well, such as arms, ears (inside and out), and recently, my legs.\n\nAlso, I do apologize if anyone feels this post is redundant, but once again, I wasn't satisfied with any of the other related posts, but that might just be desperation talking at this point.",

        "body": "OK, I've been battling this for YEARS in the same places as you (mostly around my nose). I have found a few things that have helped a TON. In fact, since I started the beginner's routine here I haven't had a single issue on my face, only behind my ears.\n\n1) Sebhorrheic dermatitis LOOKS like dry skin, but it isn't! It is a build up of oils that irritates the crap out of your skin. Dry, flakey looking skin makes you think \"I needs moat moisturizers\" so you LOAD up on creams, lotions, ointments all to no avail. Because you're adding to the problem! I have found the cerave in the tub at night and the Cerave AM work well for me. I don't cake it on or slather it on either. Just a little. That's it. No ointments, thick creams or vaseline.\n\n2) Cleansing is critical! But gently‚Ä¶ the shampoos etc on your face are probably way too harsh and are over stimulating the oil causing the problem to get worse. I found that gently cleaning with something like cerave foaming cleaners works really well. Gently. Seriously, don't scrub your face raw, it only makes it worse. You don't need a lot of exfoliation, just a washcloth and mild scrub. If you need medication, you can get topical creams from your doctor.\n\n3) LET IT HEAL. My skin breaks out into red rashy ick, then as it heals it all flakes off into the grossest grossness ever. Don't pick, don't scrub until your face falls off, just the same gentle washcloth with mild cleanser. Follow with a moisturizer.\n\n4) Makeup application: if you're in the process of healing, wash your face with a washcloth, apply moisturizer right away and then apply your foundation IMMEDIATELY after the moisturizer. It helps the keep the foundation from sticking to all the dry stuff. If you're broken out and you have the open weeping type rashy looking outbreak, better to lay off of the cosmetics and let it rest.\n\n5) Make sure you aren't aggravating it with your cosmetics. I used to have more problems with my face with certain cosmetics and fragrances. I have to be carful which foundation etc I use. I now use the Ponds BB cream because its light coverage and doesn't irritate my skin.\n\nI hope that helps. Once you find a routine that helps it, you won't need to worry so much about the makeup application.",

When it was discovered I had seborrheic dermatitis, I was given a bar of ZNP soap and Cetaphil lotion. That worked for a while. As the years passed by, it spread from my chin to the outer corners of my mouth, my nose, eyebrows/forehead, and now finally its reached my ears. For years I have tried different skin care products and routines and borderline became a product junkie. Right now I use African Black Soap and I moisturize my face with a Pond's Dry Skin Cream/homemade shea butter mixture. It helps to keep the flakes at bay and my skin feeling moisturized.

Each time, it shows up above one eye on my eyelid and then around my mouth/nose/below my lip. Anyhow- I have been prescribed ketoconazol shampoo that I use every few washes, in between I use head and shoulders and I also was just prescribed Promiseb about 6-9 months ago for use during flare-ups. The combination seems to be working well but when I take a break from the shampoos, which I use on my face quickly during most showers, it flares up again. Right now I'm just trying to figure out how to cover the rash/redness/flaking with makeup so I can work and not be so self-conscious and also try to keep the pain at bay. I'm not sure why but this time my lower face is so raw and so painful, burning almost. Aside from this flare up I normally can keep it under control for 3+ months at a time.  I would definitely recommend the ketoconazole shampoo/ head and shoulders combo (also as a quick face wash in the shower) and the promiseb topical cream helps a lot too. I plan on buying the noble soap and cerave lotions ASAP! Any makeup or pain suggestions?",

I have a few small patches on my face - my current routine is just getting sun whenever possible, cerave, steroid creams. Just got some Argan oil to try, I've used rose hip oil in the past. Make up is a primer, concealer if the red patches are bad, bb cream. I switched from liquid foundation to bb cream a few months ago and my skin is better. I don't exfoliate, but with psoriasis you're supposed to avoid irritating or possibly breaking skin. Have you ever tried phototherapy? If it's more than your face it sounds like you might want to ask your derm for nontopical treatments. If you're dealing with such a thick layer of skin daily that sounds pretty serious. I'm not sure bout the bumps, but I've had perioral dermatitis, reaction to steroid creams on the face - could it be that?

I tried not using any face wash thinking it might be too irritating but cleaning the yeast and oil off your face is very important. I use Cetaphil Gentle face wash, and also used ketoconazole, and you need to finish with a really good moisturizer - I use CeraVe in the tub. Apply Vaselline on top to set it in (as you're doing now) and the shininess should diminish with your powder foundation. Gentle washing, and good moisturization is key!

    "body": "Hiya, I just joined this subreddit about an hour ago (yay insomnia!). It seems like the general concensus here is that mineral oil is good for your skin and generally harmless. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI have always used mineral oil to remove my eye makeup, but several months back, I was talking with a friend that also is a makeup artist (and a very good one at that), and she told me that using mineral oil to remove eye makeup is bad for your eyes. I'm trying to remember WHY she told me it was bad for your eyes.. it might have had something to do with vision, or that could just be a load of crock and I can't remember what she told me.  \n&nbsp;\n\nI was looking around online, and the closest thing I found that really disturbed me was from a post on the essentialdayspa forums (http://www.essentialdayspa.com/forum/viewthread.php?tid=9048)\n\nHere is what the post said (poster also said a MAC employee told them this years ago):  \n&nbsp;\n\n> \"I am not sure that this is true- a MAC employee told me this years ago (MAC does not use mineral oil).  \n> \n> &nbsp;\n> \n> Mineral oil in an eyecream or used to remove eye makeup (it really works) will eventually collect behind the eye and get stuck there. If you think of removing your eye out of the socket, inside the socket itself- that is where mineral oil ends up. Once it is there, it is stuck and cannot be removed. It has been linked to cataracts because it dissolves the natural \"film\" on your eyeball.\n> \n> &nbsp;\n> \n> Coal tar is also derived from petroleum. It is used in anti-dandruff shampoo (the kind that stinks) but also used in North America to pave roads and driveways. When applied to the skin, it shuts down cell production- essentially making new cells not being formed. It is recommended by dermatologists to treat scaly, flaky skin condtions (i.e.psoriasis) because stopping the skin cells temporarily remedies the problem. But in the long run, you are stopping new cells from being formated-is that good for the skin?  \n> \n> &nbsp;\n> \n> It is not hard to see the link to mineral oil and why it is falling out of popularity.   \n> &nbsp;\n> \n> \n> But again, just to be clear, this is coming form third party sources. I avoid mineral oil, mainly because I am oily.\"   \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIs.. there any possibility of this actually.. happening??? Can mineral oil get BEHIND your eyeball and build up there?? That's a horrifying concept. Please tell me this isn't true. I seriously think if it was true the people of this subreddit wouldn't be encouraging people to use mineral oil.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks for any help! I'll be sure to be back with more noob questions in the near future!\n",

You don't get cataracts from defects to the surface of the eye. Damage to the tissue on the surface of the eye is called keratitis and it can blind you, but it's not cataracts.",

Anything which inhibits or activates cell division is going to have to be regulated (as in like, sold as a drug regulated). And if this *really* inhibits cell production, what happens when you get a scratch? Do you just scab over forever? Nope, because that's just silly.\n\nAlso, mineral oil and petroleum jelly are chemically inert. It's used in molecular biology in a culture to prevent evaporation of the culture solution (ie does not inhibit bacterial growth (and remember that bacteria multiply via a process called binary fission)).\n\nI don't even know where this myth about cell division inhibition came from because the most oft quoted argument against petroleum products is that they are carcinogenic (and recall that cancer is basically cells which have no regulation in when they multiply). Untreated petroleum products are carcinogenic but treated and refined products are not (such as those used in cosmetics).",

The primary witness was a famous Broadway stage actor.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mxfl6s8vwx3e1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=c03eb5cf7cdc7d8a61a71958b9008124aa25faa2\n\nBy Kevin J. Guhl\n\nAustin H. Clark, zoologist and marine biologist at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., declared in 1930 that modern steamships had destroyed the fables about sea serpents residing in American waters and beyond. It might be true that humankind's conquering of the oceans dispelled the old fears of ancient mariners who were tossed about the sea in rickety wooden boats. By the dawn of the 20th century, thousands of passengers were riding high on steel behemoths that could cross the Atlantic Ocean in mere days. But accounts of sea serpents still trickled out into the press during this era. In fact, a spectacular sighting occurred in 1911 aboard one of the world's largest ocean liners, operated by the White Star Line‚Äîthe same company whose hubris would be tragically tempered by the loss of its \"unsinkable\" Titanic less than a year later. And the primary witness was one of the most famous actors of his day.\n\nVictorian matinee idol Robert Hilliard, \"the handsomest man on the American stage\"‚Äîessentially the George Clooney of the 1870s‚Äîwas known for his sartorial appearance and performance in \"he man\" roles during his Broadway heyday. Hilliard was celebrated for his immaculate dress. A striking figure on Manhattan streets, he wore a white carnation in his lapel that matched the silver whiteness of his hair in later years.\n\n[Robert Hilliard, 1912](https://preview.redd.it/oqufz60ywx3e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=e35f41b98438ccde54bea1e61d86088f2cd02f10)\n\nHilliard's greatest success was his starring role in \"A Fool There Was,\" described contemporarily as \"a daring and realistic play that startled New Yorkers from their Lenten lethargy like a sudden explosion of dramatic dynamite.\" Hilliard began his run with the play at the Liberty Theatre on Broadway in March 1909 and continued to tour with the show for several years. Hilliard played the titular fool, who loses both his family and successful career as a Wall Street lawyer/diplomat when he succumbs to his lust for the (non-undead) \"vampire woman,\" a femme fatale who enjoys using her charms to seduce men and ruin their lives. American playwright Porter Emerson Browne based \"A Fool There Was\" on Rudyard Kipling's poem \"The Vampire,\" which was in turn based on a well-known 1897 painting, \"The Vampire,\" by Kipling's cousin, artist Sir Philip Burne-Jones. \"In making the vampire woman of 'A Fool There Was' a brunette, we followed Burne-Jones' painting exactly,\" Hilliard once mused. \"As a matter of fact blondes‚Äîthe real ones, not the peroxides‚Äîare the most dangerous type of womankind. There is ample scientific authority for this conclusion.\" Theda Bara portrayed the vamp in the 1915 movie version of \"A Fool There Was,\" one of the popular starlet's few surviving films, opposite Edward Jos√© as the fool.\n\n[A black and white reproduction of \\\\\"The Vampire\\\\\" \\(1897\\) by Philip Burne-Jones. The original painting is lost.](https://preview.redd.it/mz7q2z46xx3e1.png?width=531&format=png&auto=webp&s=313833bd2b6d7a653bc61581fd00d9fce48d3087)\n\nHilliard traveled to London with the express purpose of attending a production of \"A Fool There Was\" in the spring of 1911. No sooner did he step foot on land than he learned that the British production had been shut down for good the previous night. Severely disappointed, Hillard headed for Liverpool and boarded the RMS Celtic for the trip back across the Atlantic Ocean toward New York City.\n\nThe massive ocean liner RMS Celtic was launched in 1901 by the White Star Line, the same company that would debut the doomed RMS Titanic in 1912. Celtic exceeded 20,000 tons and could accommodate nearly 3,000 passengers, eschewing speed in preference for luxury and size. Averaging 17 knots, Celtic traversed its assigned 3,000-mile route across the Atlantic Ocean between Liverpool and New York in about eight days. Built by the Harland & Wolff shipyard in Belfast, Ireland, as was Titanic, Celtic was briefly the largest the ship in the world until White Star launched RMS Cedric in 1902.\n\n[The RMS Celtic was briefly the largest steamship in the world. From the July 13, 1901 Philadelphia Inquirer.](https://preview.redd.it/kdoq9nhbxx3e1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ced44421ddb492c910fa7150bd8067cd0eb5f1e)\n\nThe Celtic, carrying the deflated Hilliard on his return trip, pulled into port at New York on Sunday, June 4, 1911. That afternoon, reporters from the city's \"ultramarine\" press, including the Times and Sun, boarded at the ship's quarantine and headed for the smoking room to learn the latest gossip and news from the journey. It was here that a steward revealed the Celtic's surprising encounter with a \"monoplanic\" sea serpent at dawn Saturday morning, which Hilliard corroborated \"under duress.\" The actor begged that his statements not be printed since he disliked notoriety, a wish we only know about since The New York Times gleefully reported it.\n\nThe early-rising steward saw the strange sight off the Celtic's starboard bow and, instead of carrying the news to the bridge, ran to the rooms under his care and begged those within to come on deck and see it. This included Mr. Hilliard, who, in the actor's own words, per the Sun, had requested to be awoken \"if anything unusual occurred on shipboard or out in the illimitable ocean.\" Hilliard drew on his pajamas and went out on deck to join a mixture of fellow passengers and crew, where the supposed sea serpent was pointed out to him \"as the first great streaks of dawn appeared far off on the ocean's misty brim,\" said Hilliard.\n\n\"The sea serpent‚Äîwitnesses differ as to its length‚Äîwas sighted holding a bewhiskered, calf-like head ten feet above water. Behind, where the ears ought to have been, were two wings extending outward about ten feet, thus giving the saurian monster the appearance of an aeroplane skimming over the sea. The steward, in fact, described it as a monoplane sea serpent,\" wrote The New York Times. The serpent, according to Hilliard and the steward, was either pursuing a school of whales or keeping company with them. The steward claimed that the sea serpent turned a pair of \"large, mournful green eyes\" toward the spectators on the Celtic's deck. \"Then it passed on its monoplanic way, dipping up and down, just like that, but otherwise holding its head erect. Behind it appeared at intervals a dark-green body, moving through the water with a wiggly motion,\" according to the Times. Captain A.E.S. Hambleton did not enter the incident in the Celtic's log, unsurprisingly.\n\nThe New York Sun's article on the incident, written in a glaringly more absurd fashion, described the sea serpent as having a white beard that reminded Hilliard of King Lear. The monster was at least 200 feet long, with 20 \"convolutions\" showing above the ocean's surface, and rising from its back were two wings that were at least 100 feet from tip to tip, according to the Sun. An amateur aviator onboard remarked that the serpent reminded him of a hydroplane. As the Sun article also contained the jest that a four-masted \"Swiss Navy\" schooner had been dragged down to its demise when the leviathan dove, it is best to take their report with an ocean's worth of salt. Nevertheless, the Sun softened its outlandish claims, writing, \"The purser denied the story, declaring that the Celtic had not been chartered as a seeing-the-serpent yacht, but he admitted that there had been an unusually large Sunday school of whales noted off the starboard bow, or inshore, toward Amagansett \\[on Long Island‚ÄîEd.\\] early yesterday morning before anyone who had gone to bed was up. He could not account for the visions of those who had not gone to bed and who might have been holding royal flushes made up of marine monsters before the lights in the smoking room were extinguished.\"¬†\n\nSamuel A. Wood, a veteran reporter for the Sun and \"dean of the ultramarines,\" told his counterpart from the Times that, \"Sea serpent stories are rare at this port nowadays, but in the old days the men on sailing vessels saw many of them. Forty years ago, I wrote many of those stories, but as steam has replaced sail and romance departed from the seas, the sea serpents have evidently moved away from the steamship tracks.\" Wood's tenure might have been exaggerated here, as in 1906 the Times wrote that he had been \"recording the coming and going of the ships from New York for 20 years.\" That March, between 50 and 60 ship news reporters, past and present, had gathered to celebrate the 50-year-old Wood for his professional accomplishments. L.A. Southworth of The World preceded the presentation of a loving cup to the senior reporter by \"hazarding the guess that if Mr. Wood had not seen the Half Moon sail up the Hudson, he certainly had been at the launching of the old Peruvian bark Calisaya, with her renowned cargo of knotholes.\"\n\nThe ultramarine team gleaned some additional news tidbits from Hilliard in addition to the sea serpent sighting: Actress Grace Carlyle, a fellow passenger, had gone to London to study the play \"Passers-By\" by C. Haddon Chambers and would be the leading woman in the Broadway production, despite Carlyle keeping mum on the subject to reporters. (For the record, \"Passers-By\" ran at the Criterion Theatre on Broadway for 124 performances between September and December 1911, but it does not appear Carlyle was in the cast, with Louise Rutter as the female lead.) Also, Carlyle had been compelled to pay a $75 duty for bringing her Pomeranian dog onto the Celtic, and was \"rather pleased to be the first person taxed under the new tariff on all American animals brought back to America.\"\n\n[Grace Carlyle. 1917](https://preview.redd.it/ez8kigofxx3e1.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cbf5e0da85d643d38006eda5ca8ca9912923169)\n\nIn addition, Hilliard had won about $300 during the voyage betting against fellow passengers on the English Derby, accurately picking both the first and second horse. (This was some time before the sea serpent became visible.) Not content with those spoils, Hilliard won an additional $50 in wagers thanks to his quick thinking and ingenuity. The actor had worn his trademark boutonni√®re on his lapel every day of the trip until the last, when a flower could not be obtained. The passengers joked about it, and Hilliard bet he would have one on by 4 o'clock. Hilliard wired ahead to a valet to bring a fresh flower to the pier. The valet rushed onboard the newly arrived vessel and Hilliard placed the boutonni√®re in his lapel a minute before the clock struck 4, winning the bet.\n\nSea serpents were once enough of a going concern that when breaking the somber news of the Titanic's sinking on April 15, 1912, some newspapers clarified that the creatures were not the cause of the disaster. \"It is clear enough that the accident which has overtaken the 'Titanic' was due to an iceberg, either submerged or floating above water. When fifty or so years ago large vessels failed to reach their destination, it was quite common to attribute their loss to the machination of 'sea serpents'‚Äîmore or less mythical creatures of enormous size. There are plenty of people even today who believe in the existence of these fabulous animals,\" wrote the Manchester Courier. In pondering the myriad ways that ocean liners like the Titanic become lost at sea, an article in Tulsa World stated, \"The secrets of the sea have been investigated so well that no destructive agent is likely to exist which is not known to science. Collision with a whale would not damage a liner, though it would be bad for the whale. The sea serpent may be dismissed without comment.\"\n\n[THE GREAT SEA SERPENT AGAIN.‚ÄîCaptain J.F. Cox, master of the British ship \\\\\"Privateer,\\\\\" which arrived at Delaware on September 9 from London, says:‚Äî\\\\\"On August 5, 100 miles west of Brest \\(France\\), weather fine and clear, at 5 p.m., as I was walking the quarter-deck, looking to windward, I saw something black rise out of the water about twenty feet, in shape like an immense snake of 3 feet diameter. It was about 300 yards from the ship, coming towards us; it turned its head partly from us and went down with a great splash, after staying up about five seconds, but rose again three times at intervals of ten seconds, until it had turned completely from us, and was going from us with a great speed, and making the water boil all round it. I could see its eyes and shape perfectly. It was like a great eel or snake, but as black as coal tar, and appeared to be making great exertions to get away from the ship. I have seen many kinds of fish in five different oceans, but was never favoured with a sight of the great sea snake before.\\\\\"‚ÄîThe Illustrated Police News, Oct. 4, 1879](https://preview.redd.it/8jaryyhjxx3e1.png?width=812&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f4b0de75128936c97ddf26c08eab222a3023255)\n\nAs an interesting aside, you might wonder what became of the White Star Line following the tragic loss of the RMS Titanic and several other vessels. Did it go out of business? Nope; it merged with its chief rival, the Cunard Line, in 1934, and Cunard was absorbed into the Carnival cruise line in 2005. The company that launched liners such as Titanic, Olympic, Oceanic, Britannic and Celtic lives on in the \"White Star Service\" that Carnival offers its passengers in the present day.\n\nAs bizarre and mismatched as a \"transmedium\" sea serpent with wings might sound, there were scattered reports of them following the 1911 encounter on the Celtic:\n\n\\-In February 1912, Miss Gertrude Green, a Maryland girl who won a trip to Bermuda in a publicity contest, returned on the Bermuda-Atlantic steamship Oceana with an amazing story. She and the four other Maryland girls who accompanied her on the voyage witnessed a weird creature rise up from the sea when the ship was about five miles out from Hamilton, Bermuda's capital city. The girls were so startled that they had trouble describing what they had seen to the Bermuda-Atlantic press agent, but all agreed that the monster of the deep had white wings and green eyes.\n\n\\-In September 1922, a dispatch from Constantinople stated that the Greek government had ordered an armed fleet to the Sea of Marmora to pursue a winged sea monster which had appeared off the Princes' Isles. The creature was first sighted in the Aegean Sea off the island of Negroponte (aka Euboea), where it frightened fishermen before passing unseen through the Dardanelles. Witnesses declared that the monster measured 40 feet \"and that its flappers alone would smash a ferry-boat.\" The passengers and crew of the Siri Sefain saw the serpent halfway between Pendik and Cartal, a station of the Anatolian railway in Turkey. There was a violent commotion on the surface of the otherwise tranquil sea, followed by the appearance of the vague form of an enormous winged monster. First the head and then the tail were seen. The Siri Sefain danced about in the disturbed waters \"like a toy ship\" until the monster dived and disappeared toward the islands. Naturalists, of course, believed the monster to be a whale.\n\n\\-A sea serpent with \"a set of large wings resembling those on an airplane\" was spotted on July 26, 1938 on Jefferies Bank, 35 miles northeast of Cape Ann, Massachusetts. The crew of the small fishing boat Giuseppe reported that a strange-looking black creature, 50 to 60 feet long with a head like a horse, broke the surface of the water several times that day within one-quarter of a mile from where they were fishing. Each time the serpent emerged, it opened its huge mouth wide, striking terror into the hearts of the fishermen. It also frightened the huge whales that were swimming in the vicinity, sending them scattering in all directions. The crew of the Giuseppe postulated that the monster was feeding on the shrimp that were abundant in the area. The sailors weren't able to offer a more complete description of the winged serpent, as they weren't particularly interested in getting too near it.\n\nThe White Star Line had a storied and tumultuous history, but who would have thought an encounter with a winged sea serpent was among those chapters? As for Hilliard, he is a reminder that even the most cherished celebrities can be forgotten in the passage of generations and time. But sea serpent legends are immortal, and the actor's brush with one‚Äîeven if it was the result of bleary eyes and perhaps a long night playing cards‚Äîbrings him back to top of mind for today's lovers of the strange.\n\n[Theda Bara in the 1915 film \\\\\"A Fool There Was\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/fmhty3ttxx3e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=e869505f61b29702f097db24bf4b791ec6bf0458)\n\n",
