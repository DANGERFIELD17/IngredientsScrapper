    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

    "body": "Edits: Tried to fix some formatting issues. \n\n—\n\nHi everyone! \n\n[In my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/?st=JIATDG0T&sh=d905c745), I talked at length about the skin condition of rosacea -- what it is, the subtypes, what the causes are, the foundations in treatment (cleansing and moisturizing), as well as treatments and beneficial ingredients. This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

I always have very dry lips, despite drinking plenty of water and using a combo of Laniege lip mask and aquaphor lip ointment. I LOVE lipstick and it makes me really sad that my lips are constantly peeling despite my best efforts. (1) Is this a rosacea thing?

I have also incorporated the  **Be Minimalist's AA & TXA serums since 20/02/2021**  into my routine,so they are being reviewed here while the CTM+sunscreen products have gained my trust enough to be holy grail(s)! \n[You can fill yourself in regarding my skin type and concerns by reading this](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/lmjcxq/look_what_arrived_in_the_mail_today_upcoming_post/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and consider the routine to be nothing greater than anecdotal evidence :)\n\nPS: The length of the post might make it look like I accidently published a scientific paper on the Internet but I have compensated for that by using the '🐳' emoji as pointers because nothing emotes joy like a whale mindlessly sprouting water into the ocean :P\n\n🔹 **MORNING ROUTINE** 🔹\n\n🐳 Cleanser:  **Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel**\n\n   \n   🐳Toner:  **DermaFique All Important Skin Toner**\n\n\n   🐳Serum: **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%**\n   \n\n   🐳Serum:  **Estee Lauder Advanced Night             Repair**\n\n\n   🐳Moisturizer:  **Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**\n   \n\n    🐳Sunscreen :  **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++**\n\n\n\n🔹 **NIGHT ROUTINE** 🔹\n\n    \n   🐳Cleanser :  **Cera Ve Salicylic Acid Cleanser**\n\n   \n  🐳Toner:  **DermaFique All Important Skin Toner**\n\n\n   🐳Serum:  **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA**\n\n\n   🐳Serum:  **Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair**\n\n    \n    🐳Moisturizer:  **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion**\n\n    \n    🐳Replaying that moment when I called my class teacher 'mummy' in the 7th grade before wrapping up the day is a cult ritual.\n\n\n\n\n🔵 **CLEANSER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water (Aqua), Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Cocoglucoside, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Chloride, Ceteareth-60 Myristyl Glycol, Glycol Palmitate, Glycerin, Peg-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Propylele Glycol, Sorbic Acid, Disodium Edta, Fragrance, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract.\n\n🐳 **Application** : Just like how *normal* people apply a face wash. Normal is the operative word here because ain't nobody washing their face like actors in a commercial,that's clearly abnormal.\n\n🐳 **What works** : This was recommended by my dermat after a bout of eczema 2 years back and I absolutely swear by it. It's gentle,glides like a dream and doesn't make you feel taut. My ideal cleanser traits  basically match my romantic relationship requirements oof.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't**  : You can't rely solely on this to remove every last trace of makeup. Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n🐳 **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\n🐳 **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ✨ *manifestion* ✨ and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured. [I brought mine from this one.](https://instagram.com/_vivanka_chennai?igshid=5brie36vc4w2)\n\n\n\n🔵 **TONER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **DermaFique All Important Toner** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260\n\n🐳 **Application** : I got this transferred into a mist spray bottle because I quite enjoy the feeling of being spring irrigated. So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\n🐳 **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\n🔵 **SERUM** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (⚠️ensure the dropper doesn't touch your face⚠️) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n🐳 **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\n🐳 **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\n🔵 **MOISTURIZER** 🔵\n\n🔹**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice; Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\n🐳 **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\n🔹 **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\n🐳 **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔵 **SUNSCREEN** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\n🐳 **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\n🐳 **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\n🐳 **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you! Rest your eyes for a bit,it did endure quite a bit of a strain with this one :P",

    "body": "Tl;dr: I'm concerned that my fancy new hairdresser is a waste of time and money. \n\nLast summer, I bleached my naturally dark brown hair yellow and then dyed it ginger. \n\nThen dyed it pink. \n\nThen dyed it red. \n\nThen dyed it black. \n\nAs a result of all that, I had to reduce the length of it from bra wire to shoulder - a necessary evil but my goal is now to leave it to grow out naturally and get my nice long natural hair back. Even longer, preferably. \n\nI found a hairdresser in my city who specialises in long hair. His entire schtick is long hair: growing it, maintaining it, etc. He was trained by this late great world renowned long hair specialist called George Michael. It all sounded perfect.\n\nThe cut was fine, but he said something that made me sceptical: \n\n*Hair should all be one length with no shorter fringe or layers because otherwise it 'focuses' on trying to even out the different lengths.* \n\nIs this true? It sounds like nonsense to me. \n\nThe second thing that made me doubtful was the shampoo he recommended I use contains sodium laureth sulfate. \n\nI shelled out for this three step set of products (George Michael brand) that he insists on his clients using. It wasn't cheap at around £70 for the set, so I expected them to be full of good things and stupidly didn't bother checking what was in them until a few weeks later when I noticed my hair was feeling dry - in my defence, his website claimed the shampoo was 'free of detergents' so I assumed there wouldn't be any SLS! \n\nThe ingredients are as follows:\n\n*Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, PEG 80 Sorbitan Laurate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Disodium Lauroampodiacetate, PEG 150 Distearate, Sodium Laureth 13 Carboxylate, Citric Acid, Gylcol Stearate (and other ingredients), Propylparaben, Diazolidinyl Urea, Mathylparaben, Propylene Glycol, Color (FD&C Red#33 & D&C Orange #4) and Fragrance*\n\nI thought SLS was meant to be a big no no for maintaining healthy hair, especially if it's wavy which mine is. \n\nAs for the rest of the ingredients, I have no idea whether they're bad or good. Sodium trideceth sulfate sounds like it could be similarly drying but I wouldn't know. \n\nThis whole thing has left me doubtful of his advice. I'm meant to be going back to see him at the end of the month but I currently feel like he's taking me for a ride with these expensive products. He has loads of good testimonials so I feel stupid for doubting him. What do you guys think? \n\n(P.S. Sorry for the essay!)",

Also only apply shampoo on the roots and nowhere else.\n\n>Hair should all be one length with no shorter fringe or layers because otherwise it 'focuses' on trying to even out the different lengths.\n\nSince its harder to always cut layered hair equally much I'd say thats decent advise. It's easier to maintain healthy hair when it's all one length as you can easily always cut a tiny bit off the ends  meanwhile with layers it's hard to get every piece. Also long hair will thin out at the ends by default so no reason to make it worse with layers. Weird wording though.\n\n\nOverall I believe fancy hairdressers are a waste of money and so is a lot of the fancy hair products. You can literally use any shampoo and it will be alright, the only actual difference is conditioners as professional ones (which you can buy for cheap on amazon) are higher concentrated. Hairdressers will always charge you extra for products and will try to sell a certain line of products. Personally I'd recommend to just buy L'Oréal professionals or redken from amazon, you can get a saloon grade shampoo and conditioner for $30 and it will legit last for ages.\nOtherwise, if you want to grow your hair long, ANY hairdresser can cut your ends from time to time, and that's all you need.\nNo hair product can change the speed at which hair grows, or how well it does, the only thing you can do is use lots of conditioner and get regular trims to keep the ends healthy and with no breakage. And you know, don't use heat and use a tangle teaser brush.",

I've yet to hear an argument from any of them on how the length of a strand in relation to others is known by the follicle.  The obsession with boar bristle brushes mean his advice was really only considering straight hair, and the product range is incredibly limited. It is so very rigid in the ideals, which just match the founders personal ideals for women's hair.\n\nI think the George Michael affiliated salons or stylists are loved because they will generally not over-trim hair beyond the minimum and time is meant to be spent on snipping off individual splits throughout the hair. They are also gentle in their drying technique etc to accommodate extreme length. \n\nHowever, I think the one size fits all approach massively lets them down. If you don't get on with the products, their ramge doesn't have alternatives for you and those ingredients look more stripping than I'd expect from a company built on the idea of handling hair like fine silk!\n\nI think what your hair needs is too different to what George Michael's system is willing to provide.",

If not that's okay too as long as your scalp is healthy \n\nAnd most importantly!: get a baby trim every 2 to 3 months to avoid split ends.\n\nFor someone with previously bleached hair I would suggest trying a biotin supplement at over 10,000 mgs a day, which is often twice the suggested dose for actual results. \n\nYou want to have a nice haircut while growing it out and you can absolutely have pretty and long hair that is layered and or has bangs \n\nThis guy's sounds like I would pass on him and his philosophy",

        "body": "So, here's my 2 cents.\n\nWe cannot really tell you what the hairdresser meant because for one since you did not fully understand what he told you, it could be that it was paraphrased wrong to begin with. Secondly you need to ask him to explain. It is important to build a relationship with your hairdresser/stylist, where you can feel comfortable to ask him questions about your hair or what he is teaching you. \n\nSLS is not necessarily bad, it is bad to people who have an allergy or irritation. It is one of the ingredients that can really cleanse the hair. Some SLS free products are not effective cleansers or may dry the hair more than an SLS shampoo does. The whole composition of the shampoo is important as there are ingredients that in low dosages can do tremendous work. So using SLS is not a no-no to maintain healthy hair, this is something some people came up with because a lot of SLS shampoos happen to be drying, or they are using the wrong one for their hair.\n\nThe shampoo you shared has nothing special to cost $70 though. Since this stylist seems to have this own routine or methods to grow hair, it could be the reason why he pushes this technique. After all, if you do not use what he suggests he might not be able to get the results he wants or expects for your hair. Know that whenever you go to a branded store, like Paul Mitchelle Salon, Wella Salon, Deva Curl salon etc...all these type of salons have their products and will most likely suggest you products in their product line. It is easier to not get that only if you go to a salon that isn't affiliated with a single hair care brand.",

        "body": "As far as the no fringe/ layers, no the hair isn't \"focusing\" but visually you and others will \"focus\" on the other lengths. In addition it sounds like you put your hair through a absolute torture series with the chemicals so it might still be thinner on the ends. If your density on the ends isn't as thick as it should be keeping it all one length would infact help it look longer and fuller. However.... the shampoo and conditioner ect. making your hair feel dry should not happen. SLS is not the devil depending on what other ingredients are involved however it is a cheaper and harsher surfactant. If your hair is not reacting well to the product and considering the ingredients, it is probably not the correct products for you. If you haven't used much of it I would see if the salon has a return or exchange policy for products ( some salons do considering amount of usage). Kevin Murphy or Davines or Aveda are amazing wonderful brands that I've seen envoke wonderful improvements to hair, you might check some of those brands out. It seems like this hairdresser has gotten sucked into a product/ brand culture which I've seen happen a lot in the industry ( kinda cult like ). I doubt the stylist is purposely trying to divert you from your goal, but you should find someone who makes you feel comfortable, understood and informed. ( sorry for the novel ) *hairdresser*",

It can be a good thing to use every once in a while to remove product and hard water buildup, especially if you use products with silicones. I use a SLS-free chelating shampoo to remove hard water buildup. I think the best thing you can do to grow your hair long is reduce physical stress on your hair from styling and to get to know ingredients. It takes time and some scientific literacy definitely helps but in the end, it’s worth it. Finding the right balance of moisture and protein in products will help to keep your hair manageable while it grows.\n\nI use to obsess about keeping my hair long and wanted to only use “natural products.” I have fine, porous, low density hair that’s a mix of 2a - 2c textures. I used apple cider vinegar and baking soda to wash for almost 10 years, brushed with a boar bristle brush and applied straight jojoba to the ends daily. It was a mess and didn’t grow at all due to the breakage that I had no idea I was causing. Now I use a variety of products based off their ingredients and my hair is the healthiest it’s ever been. It grows at least 1/2” a month which is pretty common. Different things work for everyone so I’m not gonna say that you should or shouldn’t use specific products based off my own experience but learning ingredients will help you avoid wasting time and money.\n\nThe only universal hair truth I believe in is don’t buy hair care products from Amazon and Ebay. There’s just too much counterfeit product out there and their quality control is nonexistent.",

But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/​Vinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only.

Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles.

I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember.

I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above.

I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

    "body": "Hi all!  \n\n\nI am back with another skin conditions post. This one is on perioral dermatitis.   \n\n\nAdmittedly, when I began researching this, I knew zilch about PD except that it was acne-like breakouts around the mouth,  and as I began to research it, it seems that there isn't a whole lot that is known about it. Fortunately, it is a highly treatable condition that seems to overlap to a degree with rosacea (earning it the earlier name  of \"steroid rosacea\") and even seborrheic dermatitis.  \n\n\n**As always, please feel free to correct or inform me of anything wrong, and also feel free to post/discuss what helps your PD.**\n\n# What is Perioral Dermatitis\n\nPerioral dermatitis (PD) is a chronic, recurrant inflammatory disease that most commonly occurs in the perioral region of the face (the area around the mouth). It can also affect the area around the nose, and in roughly 20&#37; of cases, it can manifest around the eyes (though it goes by another name if around the eyes: peri-orificial dermatitis).   \n\n\nIt afflicts around 1&#37; of the population of the United States, particularly those with fair skin, and predominately occurs in women between 18-45, with 20s and 30s having peak incidence.   \n\n\nIt presents as small, red, tender, sometimes itchy bumps that can flake and burn. While commonly mistaken for acne, it is distinct from acne in that it only presents in specific locations, spares the small area around the lips, and lacks pustules (whiteheads).\n\n# Causes of Perioral Dermatitis\n\nThe causes of perioral dermatitis are unclear. It is a relatively \"young\" disease that was only first described as a distinct condition in 1964. It is first and foremost an inflammatory condition, and is aggravated by ingredients and habits that can create inflammation either in the skin or in the body. \n\nWhile I was researching PD, the one constant that showed up again and again is that it is aggravated by corticosteroid use -- both topical and inhaled. To specify, that means not just creams like kenalog, triamcinolone, and over-the-counter hydrocortisone, but also asthma inhalers (including Advair, Flovent, and ProAir aka Albuterol) and nasal allergy mists like Beconase, Flonase, Nasonex, Omnaris, and Veramyst. \n\nLess commonly, but still a factor to consider are hormones, where monthly shifts can put the condition into overdrive. More frustrating is that oral contraceptives can worsen PD in some. \n\nOther causes can be fluoridated toothpaste, high SPF value sunscreens¹, sunscreens with the filters zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, the ingredient \"isopropyl myristate,\" improperly removing makeup or sleeping in makeup, occlusive ointments (Vaseline, Aquaphor, and oils, for example), heavy creams with occlusive ingredients, and cold creams (wipe-off cleansing creams that leave a residue, like Pond's). In one case, a woman's favorite lip balm (containing the ingredient propyl gallate) caused her PD.⁶\n\n# Treatment\n\nPD can look like many other conditions, such as acne, angular cheilitis, rosacea, or seborrheic dermatitis, and requires treatment of a professional due to the inflammatory nature of the condition. \n\nThe most important thing for anyone suffering from PD is to discontinue steroid use - whether cold-turkey or weened off with the management of a healthcare professional. While topical steroids can seem to improve the condition, they frequently create a rebound effect, which can make the condition worse. \n\nOnce steroids are removed, the skin will get worse before getting better. This is the toughest part of PD for most people. Topical antibiotics or topical immunosuppresants (such as Pimecrolimus or Elidel) are frequently prescribed due to their tremendously  helpful anti-inflammatory effects on PD, and azelaic acid can prove useful in some cases. In very severe cases, oral antibiotics can be prescribed in addition to topicals. \n\nWhile healing from PD, the skin should not be cleansed with any cleanser, and makeup and skincare products should be avoided completely until the condition resolves. And no matter how tempting, PD should never be scrubbed, as this worsens the inflammation. \n\nOnce treated, it is encouraged to use liquid or gel sunscreens as well as soap-free cleansers that do not dry out the skin, as TEWL (trans-epidermal water loss) is significant in people who suffer from PD.\n\n# Long-Term Care\n\nSome people have PD once in their lives, while others may combat it on and off for several years. If you fall into the latter, it is important to try to avoid triggers that can cause the condition to reoccur (particularly steroid use). That means cleansing your skin each day with gentle cleansers, always removing makeup (removing it with a wipe does *NOT* count - you need to cleanse it away thoroughly with an oil cleanser that rinses cleanly), and using light products, particularly around the areas typically affected. \n\nPrescriptions like azelaic acid and over-the-counter .1&#37; adapalene (Differin)² may  also help to manage the condition in the long-term. \n\nI've put together a list below of some cleansers and moisturizers that are recommended for people suffering from PD. Again, like with my rosacea list, this is not a be-all-end-all list.

        "body": "I’ve been diagnosed with Peri-orbital Dermatitis by my dermatologist. I’ve had it for at least 10 years. Peri-orbital means it presents around my eyes, nose and mouth. My worst flare ups cover all three areas, my most frequent flare ups present just around my nostrils. \n\nYes, you’re correct that causes are basically unknown. Successful treatments can vary wildly. \n\n(personally, I’m convinced it has a fungal element, specially related to candida imbalance. That’s just my opinion. I have used OTC topicalS and been prescribed anti-fungal topicals and pills, none of that worked. I believe it is related to gut microbiome health. Our skin is a direct reflection of what’s going on intrinsically in our bodies) \n\nI want chime in here about Zinc Oxide. You mention it as a possible cause. I want others out here to know that high concentration Zinc Oxide Cream is the ONLY thing that stops my flare ups. So if you have PD, I recommend patch testing a high ZO cream on one or two of the papules and see if it helps you. Incidentally, I’ve found recently that micronized ZO particles actually work faster for my than larger particles. So I stopped using Desitin Max strength and started using Neutrogena Sheer Zinc for face with 22% ZO. It stops my flare ups completely in a matter of a day or so, versus 4+ days with the Desitin. \n\nI’ll list below everything I’ve tried in case it’s helpful. The other product I find helpful is daily probiotic pills containing Lactobacillus Acidophilus. I get less flare ups when I take daily probiotics. \n\nDIDN’T WORK: \nAntibacterial Rx creams, I believe I had both Erythromycin and Dapsone. OTC antifungal creams, clotrimazole, miconazole and terbinafine. I also had an oral Rx for Lamisil, it was generic and I can’t recall the generic name. OTC topical steroids, hydrocortisone. Violet extract. Cutting out SLS from from my toothpaste and hair products. (I never cleansed with SLS, always either soap or oil) Changing my diet to an acne safe diet. Getting sun. Staying out of sun. Sulphur washes. Leaving it alone.",

I had no idea what perioral dermatitis was and assumed all this redness was broken capillaries from a Clarisonic. \n\nIt wasn’t until I went to a dermatologist and asked her about it that she said it looked like perioral dermatitis. I was prescribed Finacea and in one month the results have been astounding. Redness has significantly reduced and no closed comedones or inflamed pimples anywhere. Again mine wasn’t severe but for anyone who has it I think azelaic acid is a great choice. \n\nI should point out I never use steroids, I’m 30F and I think this was due to over moisturizing after over exfoliating. I also think the occlusive nature of aquaphor made it much worse. My routine now consists of nothing but cleanser, moisturizer and Finacea. Drastic change from what I was doing before. \n\nThank you for taking the time to post this very informative breakdown of perioral dermatitis.",

First, if I want to take off any light makeup I rub it all over my dry face and it melts makeup off, then I add water it it and cleanse. Second way, I use it as a regular cleanser taking a pump in palm adding water to it and rubbing it all over my face, washing it off with water\n\n**10/10. Excellent. No notes. HG**. Already on 6th bottle. **WRP Forever**.\n\nIngredients AQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN, SODIUM METHYL COCOYL TAURATE, COCO-BETAINE, SODIUM COCOYL ISETHIONATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, PCA, PPG-5-CETETH-20, PEG-100 STEARATE, PEG-150 PENTAERYTHRITYL TETRASTEARATE, PEG-6 CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC GLYCERIDES, PEG-30 DIPOLYHYDROXYSTEARATE, CI 77891 / TITANIUM DIOXIDE, ASPARTIC ACID, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, CARBOMER, GLYCOL DISTEARATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, GLYCERYL OLEATE, GLYCINE, TRIDECETH-6, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, THREONINE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, SALICYLIC ACID, SODIUM PCA, SODIUM LACTATE, ARGININE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SERINE, SODIUM BENZOATE, VALINE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, PROLINE, ISOLEUCINE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, ALANINE, PHENYLALANINE, COCONUT ACID, COCO-GLUCOSIDE, CHLORPHENESIN, DISODIUM EDTA, HYDROXYETHYL UREA, CITRIC ACID, HYDROXYETHYL ACRYLATE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE COPOLYMER, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, HISTIDINE, ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, POLYQUATERNIUM-53, POLYQUATERNIUM-39, POLYSORBATE 60, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZOIC ACID\n\n**CeraVe** **Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser (4% Benzyl Peroxide)**\n\nTexture: Translucent lotion-y texture, It’s runnier than the Cream to foam cleanser. Foams up well on wet face.\n\nApplication: It’s a wash off BP product. I use it 2x a week. I apply on face, neck and underarms. I leave it on for 5min and wash it off with water. I think it works better this way. If I leave it on for too long it does dry out my skin.\n\nI use it as a body wash too. It helped me with active acne on my face and back. I find it Better than other BP bodywashes and facewashes I tried. It doesn’t strip my skin. I do use a thick moisturiser after this.\n\n**9/10**. I cut one point for the packaging; It leaked on a flight once. **WRP**\n\nIngredients BENZOYL PEROXIDE 4%\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENTS: WATER, GLYCERIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, COCAMIDOPROPYL HYDROXYSULTAINE, SODIUM C14-16 OLEFIN SULFONATE, XANTHAN GUM, POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, NIACINAMIDE, GLYCOLIC ACID, SODIUM CHLORIDE, SODIUM CITRATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, PROPANEDIOL, CITRIC ACID, TETRASODIUM EDTA, DIETHYLHEXYL SODIUM SULFOSUCCINATE, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZOIC ACID\n\n*Category 2: Serum*\n\n**CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum**\n\nTexture: Off-white runny lotion texture. Spreads easily. Not sticky, layers well under other products in my routine. No added fragrance.\n\nApplication: I started with using it twice a week and built up to every day. I use the sandwich method and layer between essence and a moisturizer. I don’t like it. It didn’t do anything for me. I noticed no difference in my skin except a slight smoothing effect. I find it to be a non-offensive beginner retinol.\n\n**5/10**. Excellent packaging. All Retinol products should come in a pump like this. **WNRP**\n\nIngredients: AQUA/WATER/EAU, PROPANEDIOL, [DIMETHICONE](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/dimethicone), CETEARYL ETHYLHEXANOATE, NIACINAMIDE, AMMONIUM POLYACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE, DIPOTASSIUM GLYCYRRHIZATE, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, DIMETHICONOL, LECITHIN, SODIUM CITRATE, RETINOL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, ALCOHOL, ISOPROPYL MYRISTATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, CITRIC ACID, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\n*Category 3: Moisturizers*\n\n**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturising Lotion**\n\nTexture: Super light gel cream texture. Applies like a dream on my skin. No noticeable fragrance.\n\nApplication: I apply it after Hada Labo lotion. Used it throughout summer, great stand alone moisturizer. It was the only niacinamide product I was using at the time. I don’t like it for colder weather as my skin becomes drier. Excellent in hot weather at night. Helps oil control and the usual niacinamide things. It might feel heavy if you have super oily skin.\n\n**10/10.** No Nonsense night moisturizer in a pump bottle!!! **WRP**.\n\nIngredients : AQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, NIACINAMIDE, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, [DIMETHICONE](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/dimethicone), CETEARETH-20, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, POLYGLYCERYL-3 DIISOSTEARATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\n**CeraVe Moisturizing Cream (White Tub)**\n\nTexture: Thick and gooey. The only CeraVe product that has a strange plastic/fevicol smell. The brand says there is no added fragrance so maybe it's just me. \n\nApplication: Applies smooth. Feels super super heavy on my face. I could just feel it sitting heavy on my skin. It didn’t give me any CCs. I used the rest of the tub as a body moisturizer. Great as a body moisturizer.\n\n**4/10.** The tub packaging too is disappointing. **WNRP.**\n\nIngredients: AQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETYL ALCOHOL, CETEARETH-20, [PETROLATUM](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/petrolatum), POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, [DIMETHICONE](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/dimethicone), BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, TOCOPHEROL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\nSorry for any mistakes.

    "body": "I did a [first impressions](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/fc7lcw/regimen_lab_skincare_first_impressions_ingredient/) on the Regimen skincare kit I got almost 3 months ago. \n\nI got a little overexcited (blame my ADHD) but after using them for like 2 months and 3 weeks or so, I have a better idea about how they worked out for me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*My skin type:* Dehydrated, **SUPER dry** skin. I mean, **REALLY dry.** Already had dry skin but with tret every other day, it's crazy, crazy dry. I can't do regular tret either, gotta be microsphere. \n\n*Climate:* Dry, desert Cali. Not too cool but not disgustingly hot as of yet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, let me eat my words. I figured out that my skin does best with many different hydrating AND nourishing/fatty layers. Trying to simplify my routine made my skin drier and drier and I found myself missing my old products. Anyways.\n\n\\------------------------------------------\n\n# LEVEL Serum\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Propanediol, Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Betaine, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tranexamic acid, NAG, Alpha Arbutin, Undecylenoyl Phenylalanine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Hexanediol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizinate, Tetrahydrodiferuloylmethane, Hexylresorcinol, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Salix Alba Bark Extract, Salix Nigra (Willow) Bark Extract, Dimethylmethoxy Chromanol, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** Light, liquidy, slightly gel-like. Has a \"glycol\" feel rather than completely water-like. I think people who have never felt the raw glycols before describe it as something slightly \"oily\". Dimethyl isosorbide also feels similar to glycols, but much lighter and not sticky like them. Absorbs quickly. Non-sticky. Layers well with others. \n\n**COLOR:** Pale yellow-tinted transparent gel.\n\n**SCENT:** None.\n\n**RESULTS:** Light texture/pore refinement. Noticeable, but not hugely so. \n\nI am ***extremely*** prone to dark spots. I only get breakouts on my chin. The PIE/PIH that gets left over from acne are only on my chin. The other spots are from sun damage. Aaaand, as you can see from the before and after pictures, my dark spots have actually gotten slightly worse, and more numerous. It's easier to tell irl than in pictures. \n\n[Before/After pics](https://imgur.com/a/SAWwCqK)\n\nI feel like I haven't given it enough time to see real results since I used it for less than 3 months. 3 months is the standard time you should give skin-brightening products time to work. But from the results I can glean from this limited time, I am not super impressed. \n\nHowever, I'm willing to give it another try if it comes out for $35 instead of $45, because I *mostly blame the switch to a new sunscreen* on my spots darkening/getting more dark spots. \n\nI know many people love the Purito centella sunscreen, but it just is not protective enough for my skin type. I am super diligent about sun protection, and the 99% of the sun I get is from commuting in the car once or twice a week (\\~20 min) and sitting in front of windows for meals. I have blackout curtains in my room and only exercise during the night. \n\nSorry for the rant, but I'm honestly kind of upset that the progress on my dark spots that I worked so hard on for years have been reversed a little. \n\nAnyways, the ingredient list is absolutely fantastic. It's definitely a much better deal than Skinceuticals' 3% tranexamic + 5% niacinamide serum. So perhaps if I use a better sunscreen and give it longer, LEVEL may work better for me. \n\n**PRICE:** *$35-45 /30ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** Maybe. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# VITAMIN X Serum\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Propanediol, Ascorbic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Propylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Acetyl Zingerone, Glycerin, Hexanediol, Tocopherol, Epigallocatechin Gallate, Ferulic Acid, Resveratrol, Genistein, Glutathione, Quercetin, Silymarin, Hesperidin Methyl Chalcone, Dimethylmethoxy Chromanol, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol, Citric Acid.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** Also has a \"glycol feel\". Lightweight, absorbs quickly. Feels like I should use it after watery toners, but since it's vitamin C, I used it before anything else. \n\n**COLOR:** Orange tinted transparent gel. It did not change color the entire time I have had it, but I can't be sure of course, because of the original color. I imagine I will only be able to tell once it oxidizes heavily and turns brownish. \n\n**SCENT:** None.\n\n**RESULTS:** Light texture refinement. Like the LEVEL serum, I started out only using it once a day. Then I switched to using it twice a day after about almost a month in or so. \n\nGave my skin a subtle, soft glow. \n\nCompared to the Timeless Vitamin C serum, I just didn't see nearly as much texture/pore refinement and glow factor. I have the type of skin that sees zero results from ascorbic acid derivatives (SAP, MAP, etc).\n\nA bit disappointing on the visual results department, but perhaps other people may like it for all the other antioxidants loaded in this serum that may be protecting the skin without visual refinement. \n\nI was still happily using it up, BUT, I had to stop several days ago. I noticed that it was suddenly filled with tons of little grains??? \n\nI'm not sure if you can [**see it in the pictures**](https://imgur.com/a/PkTvttF), but it almost seems like the vitamin C in the serum spontaneously changed back to powder form.\n\nWhat the hell happened? Stability issue? I am not sure. \n\nAmbitious little serum, but it didn't work out for me in practice.\n\nI'm testing out Maelove Glow Maker at the moment, and so far Timeless is winning out but since it's only been a very short time, we'll see. Am planning to try a Skinceuticals sample next. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$50-60 / 30ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** No. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# WAVE Serum\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Betaine, Glycerin, Urea, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Saccharide Isomerate, Sodium PCA, Sodium Lactate, Sorbitol, Lactic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Pectin, Proline, Serine, Arginine, Glucose, Fructose, Maltose, Trehalose, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Chloride, Allantoin, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** A thin gel. Thicker and heavier-feeling than LEVEL & VITAMIN X. Absorbs a little slower. Still lightweight.  \n\n**COLOR:** A slightly cloudy, transparent.\n\n**SCENT:** None.\n\n**RESULTS:** It has a ton of beneficial ingredients, and was pretty hydrating. But for some reason, I found myself reaching for this less than my other, more watery hydrating essences/toners. \n\nIt may just be my personal preference, but I've been more into thinner, watery layers more than thicker ones as of late. \n\nFelt similar to Hada Labo Premium lotion but a little less hydrating? I still quite enjoyed using it. \n\nThis would be plenty of hydration for most people probably, but I have exceptionally dry skin, and this by itself was not enough to really plump out my skin. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$40-50 / 30ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** Maybe, if it was cheaper. Urea in serum form is a really rare find. But I can probably get a similar effect with a couple of different serums and a urea moisturizer combined for cheaper. If my skin wasn't so darn dehydrated and dry, this would be a fantastic all-in-one sort of convenient step for me since it really has every humectant your skin can use/has naturally. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TABULA RASA Cleanser\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Betaine, Propanediol, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate (and) Aqua (and) PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Acrylates Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium EDTA, Phenylpropanol, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic acid, Citric Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexylglycerin.* \n\n**TEXTURE:** A fluid gel. It doesn't foam up a whoooole lot, but the ideal amount foams up to a thick, luxurious feeling foam if you keep rubbing. It has more \"slip\" than Sunday Riley's Ceramic Slip cleanser if you've used that before. (If you use too little, it fails to foam.)\n\nIt feels really similar to my drugstore HG cleanser, Garnier SkinActive Gentle Sulfate-Free Cleanser initially. But that one doesn't create nice, thick feeling foam. That one cleans well but foams out to very small, non-substantial foam. \n\n**COLOR:** A opaque, white gel. \n\n**SCENT:** A strong, glue-like smell? No masking fragrance. \n\n**RESULTS:** I'm not always a gel-cleanser type of gal, but I actually really enjoy using this cleanser. It really *does* feel MOIST after washing, like my initial assessment. I personally have not used a cleanser with that sort of after-feel before. As a dry-skinned person, I *really* like that!\n\nIt didn't end up drying me out. I found it a really nice, hydrating second cleanser. The only issue was the strong smell, but I have a sensitive nose. I prefer it to smell a little weird than it be loaded with fragrance, personally. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$17-20 /100ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** Yes, I really like this cleanser and would not mind having it on my sink if it came in pretty packaging! I can find other cleansers that can do the job just fine, but if it was pretty and maybe came in a bigger size, I can definitely see myself repurchasing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# C.R.E.A.M.\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Squalane, Capric/Caprylic Triglycerides, Propanediol, Glycerin, Glyceryl Glucoside, Isosorbide Dicaprylate, Phospholipids, Ursolic Acid, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Ceramide NP, Ceramide EOP, Bisabolol, Isoamyl Laurate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Cholesterol, Stearic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Tocopherol, Dimethoxymethyl Chromanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** Picture of texture [here](https://imgur.com/EhE4aHM). A *very* thick, nourishing cream. A little hard to spread. Layered well with other things, cosmetically elegant.\n\n**COLOR:** White, opaque. \n\n**SCENT:** None. \n\n**RESULTS:** I have this MIGHTY NEED to try out as many ceramide/pseudo-ceramide/barrier repair creams as I can get my hands on. So I was REALLY excited to try this cream out. \n\nThis cream was really moisturizing and felt protective on the skin. However, I had to use quite a lot to moisturize my skin. So I ran out of it pretty fast. \n\nIt felt really good, but it failed to keep my skin completely flake-free under sunscreen & makeup and throughout the night by itself. \n\nBut **please** keep in mind that I have *incredibly* dry skin; My skin is an asshole and it's not enough to merely slug life with Vaseline/Aquaphor/CeraVe Healing ointment. It needs lots of humectants and lots of FATS & occlusives to keep it from feeling tight. (I have eczema-prone body skin as well and go through moisturizers by the bucketloads..)\n\nNone of these creams *by themselves* can prevent me from waking up to skin tighter-feeling than I'd like despite *slathering* them on: CeraVe cream & First Aid Beauty UR creams - *way* too light & matte, Atopalm MLE, Zeroid Intensive, Zeroid Oint-Cream (almost!), Real Barrier Extreme, Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Cream, La Roche Posay Lipikar AP+ Baume, Udderly Smooth, etc. \n\nI have to layer multiple of these on in order to wake up to moisturized skin. The only ones applied by themselves that give me the same results as layering multiple on are Aveeno eczema therapy cream & Ceradan barrier repair cream so far.\n\n(I have a big review post coming up sometime in the future on all these but it's gonna take a while.\\^)\n\nI've seen other reviews saying how much this C.R.E.A.M. has helped their dry skin, so I think it should work well for most folks. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$45-55 / 50ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** No, unless somehow they come out with an actual bucket-sized option for cheap lmao. \n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\nHope that helps! I had a lot of fun trying this kit. The company's customer service was incredibly helpful and nice. I hope they can tweak and improve on some things and their actual release goes well!",

Haha. I tried a bunch of the zeroid products (oint cream, soothing cream, and 5% urea cream) and the oint-cream is my favorite for night time, urea for day, and the soothing cream is alright but has a stickier consistency that I don’t like as much. Would repurchase the other 2 probably but none of them made me go WOW. \n\nMeanwhile I’m still hoarding the tiny sample of the skinceuticals cream I got and it’s been my go-to whenever I get a random dry patch. So I might just have to pull the trigger on that...\n\nThank you for the great review!",

    "body": "I am always on the lookout for a mild shampoo which will not cause hairfall as I shampoo my hair thrice a week. I've been using The Body Shop Strawberry Clearly Glossing Shampoo for the past couple of years without any complaints. However, with the lockdown all theTBS stores I know of were closed and I could not get my hands on this particular one even from their website, so I decided to try out something else. I chose the Vilvah Goat Milk Shampoo instead. And below is my experience of using the product.\n\nHair type and basic hair care routine- Female-28. I have type 1C hair, with moderately oily scalp and normal strands. Since I live in a highly polluted city, my scalp and the hair shafts become greasy if I go too long without a shampoo. I do not oil my hair except for the three winter-months, and that too not very regularly. I don't have a dandruff issue, and have shoulder length, non-chemically treated hair which I let air-dry. The only hair related problem I face is the occasional increase in hairfall ( I don't sleep well and take a lot of stress) and the coarseness of the hair making it look frizzy. You can literally thread a needle with a  strand of my hair.\n\nIngredients: Aqua, jasmine flower water, goatmilk, disodium cocoyl glutamate, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, sodium Lauryl sarcosinate, xanthan gum, hydrolyzed pea protein, potassium sorbate and sodium benzonate, Lemon peel oil, Jasmine oil, Peru Balsam oil, Ethylene Glycol Mono Stearate, sodium gluconate.\nThe shampoo claims to be pH balanced, I haven't tested it, it also claims to contain Ecocert approved safe preservatives.\n\nProduct details- I got the 500ml bottle which comes with a pump dispenser and is made of steel. It retails for Rs. 1380, but I paid around 1200 including shipping because I got it on a discount and directly from their website. \nThe texture is slightly wobbly and pearly white in colour with a strong jasmine fragrance.\n\nMy experience with the product- I used it along with TBS Rainforest conditioner/ Plum olive and macadamia conditioner. It adequately cleansed my scalp and worked really well with both the conditioners. It lathers pretty well even with hard water. My needle-point ends were softer, and frizz was tamed for at least a couple of days. My hair was glossy, glossier than when I used TBS shampoo, and it did not cause additional hair fall.\nThe strong jasmine smell was a bother because I simply don't like floral aroma in my products, but it does not last long in my hair. \n\nMy verdict on the product-  I feel it's a bit overpriced even for the quantity and the eco-friendly packaging, and I couldn't really find any reliable source/study to justify it's liberal use of jasmine water and oil. It did work for my hair and I will repurchase if I do not find a more inexpensive alternative in the mild everyday- use kind of shampoo category.\n\nPS- this is the first review I've posted in the sub, I don't know if I've missed anything. I really wanted to include a photo but could not figure out how to do it from my phone, my laptop has conked out.",

For the past month or so I've tried cutting down on my use of silicones and sulfates (only use a sulfate shampoo once a week or so because my hair feels too gross without it), but overall my hair feels worse than before. About a month ago I bought some natures gate products, because I really like how they're relatively inexpensive and also vegan/cruelty free. \n\nFor anyone who's curious: \n\nThis is the ingredients list for the shampoo I've been using: Water, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, sodium cocoyl isethionate, disodium cocoamphodiacetate, lauryl glucoside, glycerin, chamomilla recutita (matricaria) flower extract, panthenol, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, borago officinalis (borage) seed oil, tocopherol, ascorbic acid, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, equisetum arvense (horsetail) leaf extract, geranium maculatum (geranium) extract, salvia officinalis (sage) leaf extract, mimosa tenuiflora (mimosa) bark extract, ascorbyl palmitate, polysorbate 20, leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium hydroxide, phenoxyethanol, glyceryl undecylenate, citric acid, fragrance (parfum)*\nMade in the USA from globally sourced materials.\n* Phthalate free\nNo - sodium lauryl/laureth/coco sulfates, phthalates, butylene glycol, artificial colors.\n\nAnd this is the ingredients list for the conditioner - Water, Glycerin (Vegetable Derived), Stearyl Alcohol (Vegetable Derived), Cetyl Alcohol (Vegetable Derived), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Vegetable Derived), Benzyl Alcohol, Stearalkonium Chloride (Vegetable Derived), Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis (Borage) Seed Oil, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Hordeum Vulgare (Barley) Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Fruit Extract, Viola Tricolor (Pansy) Extract, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hydroxyethylcellulose (Plant Derived), Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Fragrance*.\n*Phthalate free.\n\nMy hair feels straw-like even in the shower, there's no slip unless it's absolutely coated in conditioner and then as soon as it rinses out it feels gross again. I also feel like my hair is falling out more often (if I pull at the tips, long strands will start coming out in the shower). I don't really know what to do. I feel like my hair gets buildup pretty easily because when I've tried cowashing with thick shampoos or have put oil in my hair it always feels really weighed down and greasy the next day. I also have a lot of problems with an itchy, flaky scalp. \n\nI was thinking that using a conditioner with water soluble silicones would be the best compromise - all the benefits of silicones but without the buildup. \n\nDoes anyone have any product recommendations? *I've also been looking for a heat protectant spray* that contains water soluble silicones, since I usually straighten my hair a bit to get rid of the really weirdly shaped waves. I've started using a bit of salt spray in my hair as well (not that often), but I feel like it's been drying out my ends. I considered mixing a bit of conditioner or oil (I've heard jojoba is closest to the scalp sebum) into the mix to make it less damaging, but I have no idea what the salt is doing to my hair with or without silicones. On one hand, it seems like silicones would protect my hair from the salt penetrating it too much. But on the other, it would also prevent the moisturizing ingredients from penetrating my hair, so it seems like a catch-22. I do think I need silicones though, because my hair just doesn't seem to be doing too great without them.   \n\nI'm sorry for such a long post! But if anyone could help me, that would be wonderful.

You might want to find a protein free conditioner to use and only use the protein one once every couple of weeks.\n\nAlso salt spray will just dry out your strands and make your hair feel coarse. I'm not sure why you are using salt spray if your straighten your hair. It's more likely to make it wavy and crazy.\n\nIf you use heat I'd maybe get a silicone heat spray/serum and just use it on the parts you straighten. Silicone WILL wash out if you don't use it in every single product and it will help to protect your hair from heat.\n\nWhen not using heat. Use an oil on your ends to keep them soft.\n\nHope that helps :)",

    "body": "Hey guys. Balea MED Ultra Sensitive Waschgel is a very famous product among people who has very sensitive and dry skin. They all swore that this product is their holy grail and a must in their routine. I have a **combination-oily acne prone skin, suffered fungal acne** and still is, but decided to give this product a try. The product is gel-textured and really nice on your skin. It has no fragrance, which is essential in my everyday routine. It should left my skin hydrated but unfortunately this product does not agree with my skin. My skin doesn't like it very much because somehow after rinsing off the cleanser, my skin feels a bit tight and a bit itchy. I believe this is due to the ingredients in the product that can aggravate fungal acne.\n\nHere are the ingredients:\n\nAQUA, GLYCERIN, COCAMIDOPROPYL HYDROXYSULTAINE, METHYLPROPANEDIOL, SODIUM ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, SODIUM CHLORIDE, PANTHENOL, BISABOLOL, SODIUM COCOAMPHOACETATE, POLYGLYCERYL-4 CAPRATE, COCO-GLUCOSIDE, **~~GLYCERYL OLEATE~~**, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, **~~SODIUM METHYL COCOYL TAURATE~~**, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, CITRIC ACID, **~~HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE~~**, TOCOPHEROL.\n\nThe bolded and strikedthrough ingredients may be the culprit behind the aggravation of fungal acne. Until now I can't stop scratching cheeks and forehead lightly. URGH\n\nThese are my honest review, like always you guys should take it with a grain of salt. I'm not against this product, it's just that my skin hates it.\n\nDifferent people have different reaction to different products. Find one that suits you.\n\nIf you still haven't found your holy grail, don't worry. Be thankful for the journey of finding them, because you will learn a lot, not only about which ingredient is good or bad, but also discovering about yourself and building your mental strength :)\n\n(No worries tho, I've given the cleanser to my boyfriend who has combination dry skin, and his skin is loving it, so it's a win-win situation here)",

I use one pump, twice a day, and when it comes in contact with water, it generates just the right amount of beautiful foam.  It is super easy to rinse off, nothing lingers behind.  My skin feels refreshed and clean but not dried out.\n\n**Results:**  I fell in love.  This is my holy grail cleanser, hands down.  It helps my skin retain moisture and cleanses without aggravating redness.  And a huge bonus for me is that it smells like lavender, but I know that isn't for everyone.\n\n**Packaging:**  Standard plastic bottle and pump.  Nothing remarkable in that aspect.\n\n**Repurchase?**  Already did!  I've had a bottle on stand-by since July because I kept thinking I'd run out faster than I actually did.  This stuff lasts *forever*.",

I Shampoo/Condition my hair 2-3 times a week and dried with a T-shirt. Everything was going great until a week ago where I noticed my hair didn't feel the same anymore. I don't know how to describe it, but it almost feels rough and in need of conditioner? and my ends feel drier that normal. I am not sure whats happening my first thought was damage since I've been growing it out for almost a year without a trim or a cut. Now i'm starting to think that there is some sort of build up?

I am also highly sensitive to its relatives (cocamide DEA, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, anything with synthesized coconut). Lots of shampoo/soap brands you find in stores have these ingredients.\n\nIt’s been two months since I switched to hand soaps without *synthetic* coconut derivatives and my hands have never been so…healthy looking before. (I use Dr. Bronners soap now and feel great)\n\nCheck your hand soap ingredient list for these chemicals if you suffer from dyshidrosis (eczema on hands) and, if you can, see an allergist to confirm whether or not it is these ingredients that you are reacting to.\n\n** Don’t switch to new products without knowing what your skin can and cannot handle (I now know what soap I can use, my skin doesn’t react to Dr. Bronner’s liquid Castile soap - it has natural coconut oil, no synthetic coconut anything, and ingredient list has nothing i’m allergic to). Remember, what works for me may not work for you.\n\nIve been put on steroids (oral and topical) and yet I still had flareups due to using products I was unknowingly allergic to. Now that i eliminated this one thing I feel significantly better (i don’t think of “offing” myself anymore lol…)\n\nHope this helps!\n\nEdit: spelling. Also would like to add that these synthetic, coconut derived products were also in products marketed as sulfate free/vegan/paraben free/fragrance free, so keep that in mind as well!",

I shaved the underside and deep conditioned with every wash it because it was all broken off, started washing my hair less (once every 3 or 4 days now), stopped using heat products, get haircuts every 8-10 weeks, and  tried buying better shampoos/conditioners for my hair.\n\n\nAt that time, I bought an olive oil shampoo/conditioner pair from Regis Designline and it seemed to work well. I've used it for a year now and my hair seems tired of it, so I tried purchasing some new ones after asking my hair dresser for a suggestion. I've tried Healthy Sexy Hair Soy Moisturizing Shampoo ( which is supposedly sulfate free and has argon oil in it) and also Paul Mitchell's Super Skinny line. Healthy Sexy Hair made my hair feel strawlike and Paul Mitchell's made it oily within a day, and feels almost waxy when it's drying. \n\n\nI've never dyed or permed my hair and have med-course and straight-wavy hair. I'm half Cambodian, half white, so I'm wondering if my hair chemistry is different from what they make products for. When doing at home masks, my hair seems to like olive oil. Since trying these shampoos, my hair has gotten frizzier, I've noticed new split ends that weren't there before, and is more tangled.

There are lots of wavy girls over there that could help you out.  \n\n\nEdit: I forgot to say to keep away from sulfates and silicones for sure. Sulfates are harsh and damaging. Silicones coat your hair and keep moisture from it, and without heavy cleaners like Sulfates, silicones cause gross build up on your hair.",

In that time I haven't had to buy more of it very often because I'd bought it in bulk. Now I'm getting low on my last bottle and go to search where to buy more, and turns out they went out of business a while ago and I hadn't noticed :/\n\nSo I'm looking for a replacement! My hair is:\n\n1.\tShort\n2.\tThin\n3.\tStraight\n4.\tNot very dense\n5.\tI just did the strand of hair in a cup of water test from the wiki, and it sank almost immediately, so I guess that means it's pretty porous\n6.\tPretty oily, so I shampoo every few days (schedule and sweat depending) and will usually cowash with [Kirkland Signature Moisture Conditioner](https://www.costco.com/kirkland-signature-moisture-conditioner-33.8-fl-oz.product.100375352.html) in between\n\nI've used typical grocery store shampoos (Old Spice, Axe, Dove for Men, Head & Shoulders, etc.) in the past and a lot of them have been too harsh, making my hair really frizzy and drying out my scalp, kicking oil production into overdrive, which is something I'd definitely like to avoid. I figure something with similar ingredients, or ingredients that do the same thing would be best, but I have no idea where to look. They are:\n\n>Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Lauryl Glucoside, Glycerin, Cannabis Sativa Seed Oil, Panthenol, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis (Borage) Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil, Tocopherol, Ascorbic Acid, Ruscus Aculeatus (Butcher’s Broom) Root Extract, Pimenta Dioica (Allspice) Fruit Extract, Pilocarpus Pennatifolius (Jaborandi) Leaf Extract, Silybum Marianum (Milk Thistle) Seed Extract, Sambucus Nigra (Elder) Flower Extract, Chrysanthemum Sinense Flower Extract, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Polysorbate 20, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Glyceryl Undecylenate, Citric Acid, Fragrance (Phthalate free), Caramel\n\nThis list is what I see on my bottle. They must've reformulated at some point before going under because it's different from what's listed in the link.\n\nSo yeah, that's where I'm at right now. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!",

    "body": "I've been using Formulate shampoo and conditioner for about 10 weeks now and I'd like to share my thoughts with you wonderful people who have taught me so much! I was so curious about these before I bought them, but I couldn’t find many reviews from people who follow CGM or have curly/wavy hair.\n\nAbout my hair: I have type 2 (ranging from a-c in different places on my head), fine, medium porosity, protein loving hair that is a bit longer than shoulder length. It has light bleach damage on the bottom 1/4 of it. \n\nAbout my routine: I live in Phoenix, AZ where it is very hot and very dry most of the time. I have pretty hard water, so I switch between using this shampoo and using a light chelating shampoo (Bb Sunday shampoo). I shampoo then condition and STC upside down. I detangle with a wetbrush and drizzle rinse out the conditioner, then using a TON of water, I scrunch in a defining cream, usually AG Re:coil, then glaze and scrunch in Harry's gel. I pixie diffuse to 80% dry and root clip, then SOTC once 100% dry.\n\nFormulate review: I started with the 8oz. size of both shampoo and conditioner (ingredients listed below).  I set my preferences to be no dyes, no anti-brass, silicone free (all formulate products are sulfate and paraben free). There are options to make them vegan and gluten free, but I did not select those.\n\nThe hair concerns I chose for them to base the ingredients off of were number one curl definition (lol wavy probs) followed by improve scalp health, prevent thinning, volumize and anti-frizz. For scent I chose Tidal for my first round (described as Ocean, Sage, Lily and Musk). \n\nI wasn’t really expecting to be that blown away by these. I've tried function of beauty and really didn't like it. I was considering Prose, and got these instead as a way to talk myself out of spending Prose money and I am SO GLAD I DID. I never knew I could love a shampoo and conditioner, I'm not a brand loyal person and almost never get the same thing twice because I like to experiment, but I will not be straying from these anytime soon. The shampoo is A GAME CHANGER. It has so much slip and is so hydrating I could honestly detangle my hair with just the shampoo in it. It feels so good and lathers well, leaves my scalp feeling actually clean. It has a weird consistency, there's a jelly-like substance mixed into a more traditional shampoo-like substance, but it doesn't really bother me at all when I'm using it. The conditioner is similarly amazing - so much slip, super moisturizing. It gives me such good definition, I mean better than most curl definers, that I started drizzle rinsing, something I’ve never done before, to leave some of it in even though it's not meant to be a leave in. It is shocking how much definition and clumping action it gives my hair!! \n\nLike most CGM users, and because I use my chelating shampoo every fourth wash day or so, I went through the conditioner faster than the shampoo and am now on my second bottle. I've sized up so now my conditioner will be 16oz. and my shampoo will be 8oz. I AM IN LOVE. I switched to a new scent because Tidal smells a bit too much like a man for my personal preference. I set my scent level to medium and I will say it does linger, not overpoweringly, but your hair will smell faintly like it even on day 2. \n\nMy formula does contain a little protein in both the shampoo and conditioner. My hair loves protein, so that's cool with me! Plus I feel it helps balance out the moisture. I suspect it's part of the reason I get such good definition from these. If you are considering trying Formulate, I cannot recommend it highly enough and truly feel it is worth every penny. In the past I've tried TGIN, Jessicurl, DevaCurl (pre-scandal) and As I Am, and nothing compares to Formulate, including products from my pre-CGM days.\nPackaging is really nice, although I wish they would offer the sustainable option to just get refills every month instead of new plastic bottles. I love the ease with which you can make edits to formula and cadence and bottle size. Having access to the formulation chemist and technician so you can talk to them if you have concerns or want changes instead of a call-center type of person is a really nice touch. The website has this awesome feature where it will tell you what every single ingredient is and why it’s there, which is so nice if you’re trying to learn more about hair care ingredients. \nI will say they put a weird amount of emphasis on whether you are a “him or a her” in their hair quiz and that’s just so dumb in my opinion. Hair has no gender, I can’t imagine why they need to know this, and they should have more options than the binary if it’s that important to them. Also it’s really hard even once you have an account to circumvent the stupid quiz and just login. Like way more annoying than it needs to be. These are my only complaints though. \n\n\nTL;DR: Very highly recommend these, worth every penny imo!!\n\nIngredients in my shampoo: Purified Water, Coconut-Derived Cleanser, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Diglycerin, Cocamide MIPA, At Dawn(scent), Methyl Gluceth-20, Guar Gum, Coconut-Derived Cleanser, Polyquaternium-7, Polyglycerol-2 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-6 Caprylate, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate, Polyglyceryl-4 Cocoate, Polyglyceryl-6 Ricinoleate, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Argan Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Propanediol, Phenylpropanol, Panthenyl Hydroxypropyl Steardimonium Chloride, Sesame Seed Oil, p-Anisic Acid, Levulinic Acid, Vegetable Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Lactic Acid, Sodium Lactate, Carbamide, Starch Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Saw Palmetto, Sweet Almond Oil, Avocado Oil, Vitamin C, Beta-Sitosterol, Hemp Seed Oil, Vitamin E, Citrus Fruit Acid, Pumpkin Seed Oil, Broccoli Seed Oil, Aloe Vera\n\nIngredients in my condiitoner: Purified Water, Polyquaternium-7, Diglycerin, At Dawn(scent), Polyquaternium-32, Lecithin, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Oilseed Turnip, Butyl Stearate, Polyquaternium-37, Mineral Oil, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, Polyglycerol-2 Laurate, Acetamide MEA, Sesame Seed Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Propanediol, Phenylpropanol, Argan Oil, Methyl Gluceth-20, Keratin Oil, Vitamin B5, Sweet Almond Oil, Cocoyl Hydrolyzed Collagen, Avocado Oil, Oleoyl Sarcosine, Lanolin Alcohol, Panthenyl Hydroxypropyl Steardimonium Chloride, Coconut-Derived Cleanser, Saw Palmetto, Guar Gum, p-Anisic Acid, Levulinic Acid, Vegetable Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Lactic Acid, Sodium Lactate, Carbamide, Starch Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Vitamin C, Hemp Seed Oil, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitol, Beta-Sitosterol, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Polysorbate 80, Vitamin E, Jojoba Seed Oil, Linoleic Acid, Wheat Germ Oil, Wheat Germ Acid, Cocoyl Sarcosine, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acids, Vitamin E, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Aloe Vera, Broccoli Seed Oil, Pumpkin Seed Oil, Citrus Fruit Acid\n\nEdit: formatting",

I don't know how to describe it, but it almost feels rough and in need of conditioner? and my ends feel drier that normal. I am not sure whats happening my first thought was damage since I've been growing it out for almost a year without a trim or a cut. Now i'm starting to think that there is some sort of build up? What do you guys think? I have thick wavy/curly hair. Also, how do you know if your hair is moisturized? I always thought soft silky elastic hair = moisturized which is why I am writing this post because it no longer feels soft and silky, it feels rough.\n\nHeres the Shampoo  https://www.makeupalley.com/product/showreview.asp/ItemId=133656/Kirkland-Moisture-Shampoo/Unlisted-Brand/Hair \n\nIngredients: water sodium cocoyl isethionate cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine methyl isethionate disodium cocoyl glutamate sodium lauryl sulfoacetate decyl glecoside ammonium cocoyl isethionate divinyldimethicond/dimethicone copolymer disodium laureth sulfosuccinate helianthus annus (sunflower) seed oil lycium barbarum fruit extract aloe barbadensis leaf extract camellia sinesis leaf extract cucumis sativus (cucumber) fruit extract persea gratissima (avocado) fruit extract punica granatum extract melanin vitis vinifera (grape) seed extract glycol disterate glycerin fragrance quaternium-91 sodium cocoyl glutamate peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate amodimethicone panthenol polyquaternium-10 ppg-3 benzyl ether myristate chlorphenesin methyl gluceth-20 guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride c11-15 pareth-7 laureth-9 phospholipids hydrolyzed vegetable protein pg-propyl silanetriol c12-13 pareth-23 c12-13 pareth-3 trisodium ethylenediamine disuccinate trideceth-12 superoxide dismutase sodium ascorbyl phosphate tocopheryl acetate methylchloroisothiazolinone methylisothiazolinone\n\nConditioner: http://www.makeupalley.com/product/showreview.asp/ItemId=133657/KIRKLAND-MOISTURE-CONDITIONER/Unlisted-Brand/Hair\n\nIngredients: water cyclopentasiloxane cetearyl alcohol stearyl alcohol cetrimonium chloride behentrimonium methosulfate helianthus annus (sunflower) seed oil lycium barbarum fruit extract aloe barbadensis leaf extract camellia sinesis leaf extract cucumis sativus (cucumber) fruit extract persea gratissima (avocado) fruit extract punica granatum extract melanin vitis vinifera (grape) seed extract helianthus annus (sunflower) seed extract glycereth-26 dimethiconol divinyldimethicone/dimethicone copolymer fragrance gluconolactone cetrimonium bromide panthenol ppg-3 benzyl ether myristate jojoba esters quaternium-91 amodimethicone hydroxyethylcelloulose cetrimonium methosulfate sodium benzoate c11-15 pareth-7 peg-45m laureth-9 aminomethly propanol glycerin butyrospermum parkii ( shea butter) c12-13 pareth-23 c12-13 pareth-3 cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride (sunscreens) trideceth-12 citric acid ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate sodium ascorbyl phosphate butylene glycol hydrolyed soy protein tocopheryl acetate (vitamin e) hydrolyzed vegatable protein pg-propyl silanetriol\n\nedit: Some more info, My hair is just above shoulder length, when i get in the shower i use a wide tooth comb to get rid of knots then i soak my hair with warm water then lather the shampoo all over scalp and from root to end then rinse then i take a huge blob of Conditioner and use it the same way and leave it in for 1-2 minutes then rinse with cold water.\n\nThanks for the help!

    "body": "After using C&C's Morning Burst face wash for a decade, I found they had changed the formula when I went to buy a new bottle. I'm specifically mad because they added salicylic acid and I have a sensitivity to it. It is VERY hard to find a drugstore face wash without salicylic acid in it lol.\n\nAnyway, when I was on my mission to find a face wash with a similar formula to the old one, I wasn't able to find a summary of how the formula changed. I assume it's out there somewhere, but I didn't see it. So, if you're like me and want to know what they changed, here are the two ingredients lists:\n\nC&C Morning Burst OLD FORMULA (taken from the back label of my last physical bottle I had)-\n\nWater,\nSodium Laureth Sulfate,\nGlycerin,\nAcrylates Copolymer,\nCocamidopropyl Betaine,\nFragrance,\nPhenoxyethenol,\nSodium Hydroxide,\nMenthyl Lactate,\nMannitol,\nCellulose,\nDisodium EDTA,\nMethylparaben,\nMenthol,\nPropylparaben,\nEthylparaben,\nSodium Ascorbyl Phosphate,\nTocopheryl Acetate,\nHydroxypropyl Methylcellulose,\nCucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract,\nRetinyl Palmitate,\nPanax Ginseng Root Extract,\nZingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract,\nAcrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer,\nTriethyl Citrate,\nCitrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract,\nCitric Acid,\nIron Oxides,\nTitanium Dioxide,\nMica,\nTalc\n\nC&C Morning Burst NEW FORMULA (taken from C&C website)-\n\nWater,\nSodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate,\nCocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine,\nSorbitol,\nSodium Hydrolyzed Potato Starch Dodecenylsuccinate,\nAcrylates Crosspolymer-4,\nSodium Ascorbyl Phosphate,\nTocopheryl Acetate,\nMannitol,\nCellulose,\nHydroxypropyl Methylcellulose,\nIron Oxides,\nSodium Hydroxide,\nCitric Acid,\nDisodium EDTA,\nSalicylic Acid,\nMenthol,\nFragrance\n\nHere is a summary of the changes:\n\nWhat they added-\n\nSodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate,\nCocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine,\nSorbitol,\nSodium Hydrolyzed Potato Starch- Dodecenylsuccinate,\nAcrylates Crosspolymer-4,\nSalicylic Acid\n\nWhat they removed-\n\nSodium Laureth Sulfate,\nGlycerin,\nAcrylates Copolymer,\nCocamidopropyl Betaine,\nPhenoxyethenol,\nMenthyl Lactate,\nMethylparaben,\nPropylparaben,\nEthylparaben,\nCucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract,\nRetinyl Palmitate,\nPanax Ginseng Root Extract,\nZingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract,\nAcrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer,\nTriethyl Citrate,\nCitrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract,\nTitanium Dioxide,\nMica,\nTalc\n\nI'm not a chemist so I'm not going to claim any of these changes to be good or bad or whatever, but if you found the new Morning Burst formula isn't working for you anymore, I think it's good to examine the ingredients lists.\n\nI will note that the first 5 ingredients (excluding water) in the new formula are all new additions, and that the first 4 ingredients in the old formula were all removed.\n\nSo, did I find a replacement? Maybe. Neutrogena's Deep Clean Invigorating Foaming Scrub's first 2 ingredients are the same as C&C MB's old formula (Glycerin and Sodium Laureth Sulfate). It also has the little exfoliating bits that I love, and NO salicylic acid. I haven't tried it yet, so this isn't an official recommendation, but the ingredients are giving me hope.\n\n(EDIT: After 3 weeks of using this new face wash, I do recommend the Neutrogena wash as a replacement specifically for C&C's Morning Burst. It has been working very well for me, personally.)\n\n(Side note: I'm not being paid by Neutrogena lol. I used this product's full government name because Neutrogena also has a product of a similar name with different ingredients. They were right next to each other at the store when I went. If in doubt, check the formula!)\n\nI hope that compiling this info is helpful for at least 1 person out there!",

I posted this in the Daily Questions thread yesterday, but hope I'll get more visibility this way. \n\nIs/was anyone else a fan of the [Skinfix foaming oil cleanser from before their brand overhaul and move to Sephora](https://www.influenster.com/reviews/skinfix-foaming-oil-cleanser-34oz)? This is my absolute favorite second cleanser — I love the super-creamy, rich, dense foam and the barely-there scent, and it leaves my skin feeling so clean but never dry or tight. (I have very dehydrated, combination skin.) But with Skinfix's brand overhaul a year or two ago, it seems they've not only updated the packaging, but [reformulated it as well](https://www.sephora.com/product/barrier-foaming-oil-cleanser-P442836). I've been subsisting on a panic-driven eBay haul of the original version ever since but will soon be down to my last bottle. Sad.\n\nHere are their relative ingredients lists (looks like they mainly took out most of the fruit extracts, which might not be so bad?):\n\n**Original:** Water/Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Jojoba Oil/Macadamia Seed Oil Esters, Squalene, Panthenol, Betaine, Phytosteryl Macadamiate, Phytosterols, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Hydrolyzed Chondrus Crispus Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Rose Extract, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Extract, Jasminum Officinale (Jasmine) Flower/Leaf Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Extract, Rubus Ideaus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract, Cucumis Melo (Melon) Fruit Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Cananga Odorata Flower Extract, Hydroxypropyl Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Benzoic Acid, Phenoxyethanol.\n\n**New (Barrier+) version:** Water/Eau/Aqua, Glycerin, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Glycol Distearate, Betaine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Gluconolactone, Jojoba Oil/Macadamia Seed Oil Esters, Squalene, Phytosteryl Macadamiate, Phytosterols, Tocopherol, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Hydroxypropyl Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Propanediol, Xanthan Gum, Coconut Acid, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Chloride, Benzoic Acid, Sodium Benzoate.\n\nHas anyone used both versions — or just the new one — and are you willing to share your thoughts? I'll probably end up purchasing the new version anyway, just to try it, but I'd love to have some insight beforehand, if possible! \n(I'd also appreciate any recs for similar cleansers from folks who've used the old one before!)",

I worry about long term damage. \n\nI’ve tried to find a soap based product, but just about everything online is about all natural, “chemical free”, and essential oils, which isn’t what I’m going for here.  At this point, I’d burn tires in my front yard if it meant clean, non greasy hair without patches of eczema on my scalp. \n\nShould I stick with the Free & Clear and just condition the hell out of it?

        "body": "I don't have any specific product recommendations, but I'll weigh in a bit about solid shampoo options.  There are two basic \"shampoo bars\" that you can find, and sometimes it's hard to tell the difference between them without examining the ingredients. The first would be a sydnet bar, which is made of synthetic detergents melted or pressed into bar form. They're made by big companies but many small crafters/soapmakers are jumping into making them.  Most commonly they use  Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate and Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate PLUS one other sufactant. The third surfacant is your wildcard and can vary depending on the maker.  The sydnet bars are pH 5.5ish, just like regular shampoo. \n\nThe second type is the true bar soap. Some people swear by bar soap for their hair, but at a pH of 11+, it can be really damaging to your hair and requires an acid rinse afterward (usually apple cider vinegar) to return your hair to the normal pH of around 5.5.  And, not all bar soap is created equal, too. When making bar soap there's something called superfat, which is the amount of unreacted oil (to lye) left in the bar. The unreacted oil helps to ensure that when used it doesn't strip absolutely all the oil off your skin or hair. For hair use, it's usually recommended that you find a high superfat soap. Most are superfated 6-8% for body use but you want higher superfat when you wash your hair. Perosnally, I think bar soap is awful for your hair regarless of the formula, but to each their own.\n\nI think your best bet might be to find a small manufacture/artisan soapmaker who makes the sydent types and already uses or is willing to make a batch without Coco Betaine.  ALTERNATIVELY you \\*can\\* make it yourself!  You can buy all the ingredients and make your own.  If you want to go that route, let me know and I can point you in the right direction.",

I've been living in Korea for 2 years and since then I've tried many new (especially Korean) facial products. In the beginning of 2014, my routine was:\nCleanse: Cetaphil | Toner: Etude House Malgem Smoother | Essence: Innisfree Soybean Energy Essence | Lotion: Cetaphil Lotion | Bb cream: The Face Shop Power Perfection BB Cream. Sometimes the occasional sheet mask or mud mask (usually Innisfree).\n\nThis worked until a certain extent, when I started breaking out some and when I switched products in summer, I started breaking out a lot (using mostly highly fragranced Laneige/Iope products). It worsened dramatically when I started eating a lot of ice cream (anyone knows Korean Bingsoo? I ate that every day in summer...), yoghurt and milk. I have a history of being allergic to milk when I was younger, so cutting that out was the first thing I did. After that, I stopped the usage of any fancy face products, except for an oil cleanser (Body Shop), face cleanser (La Roche Posy Toleriane Dermo Cleanser) and moisturizer (Cetaphil Lotion during the day and Cetaphil Cream during the night), and the occasional usage of BB cream (Hanskin Super Magic BB Cream). \nI should also add that my face is *normal-dry*: mostly normal in summer and dry in winter.\n\nSince then, I have tried introducing many products. I will include a list of products that didn't work for me, including their ingredient lists.\n\n**Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion** (gave me closed comedones and a pimple): *Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Disodium Succinate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxyethycellulose, Methylparaben, PPG-10 Methyl Glucose Ether, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Succinic Acid*\n\n**Innisfree Eco Safety No Sebum Sunblock** (gave me closed comedones on my cheeks over the course of 2 weeks): *Cyclopentasiloxane, Water, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Methyl Methacrylate

I'm still looking for a sunscreen that doesn't break me out (I didn't include all) and I just want my face to feel nice. Even though the Cetaphil works, it doesn't make my skin feel the best. I loved the feeling of the Hada Labo, but that didn't work for me in the end. If someone had a certain method of comparing the ingredients in some kind of way, or someone with the same experiences as me, I would love to hear from you!!",

    "body": "I shaved for the first time with shaving soap. I got some Classic Brand Premium Shaving Soap Citrus Basil and shaved with it and my mach 3 (because my DE hadn't come in yet) last Wednesday. On Thursday my lips started to chap and become irritated along with the area under my lips where the soul patch usually is. Friday morning my right eye was getting all swollen and puffy. By Saturday morning it was almost swollen shut. I went to the doctor Saturday afternoon. Once I told her about the change in shaving soap she gave me a shot of benadryl and told me to use OTC allergy medicine and if that doesn't work by Monday use the prescription for steroids. \n\nI am wondering if anyone has had a similar reaction to soaps. I am not historically allergy prone. This is the first thing I have had any sort of bad reaction to. There are 2 ingredients that are derived from coconuts. While that could be it but I use coconut milk a lot for curry (sometimes licking the lid of the can) I have eaten raw coconut and often use coconut oil for cooking. Including coming in contact with my skin. Could it be that I not have a reaction from eating coconut but have a fairly severe one when is on the face?\n\nHere is the ingredient list:\n\n* Kosher Vegetable Glycerin\n* Sodium Cocoate (from coconut)\n* Sodium Stearate (Stearic Acid)\n* Propylene Glycol (Coconut)\n* Sorbitol\n* Deionized water\n* Bentonite Clay\n\nFragrance, Coloring:\n\n* FDA Red 40 and/or Yellow 5 and/or Blue 1\n* Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine\n* Titanium dixoide.\n\nIf you see any other allergens in there let me know. Thanks in advance.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the input and advice. I am happy to learn that people have had similar reactions to stuff. I did have another soap on order already and it came in last Friday along with my DE razor which I really wanted to try it but I figured I shouldn't shave. \n\nI tried the new soap last night with the same treatment I did last Wednesday (mach 3 WTG and XTG passes) and there was no reaction this morning. Looks like I will stick to the samples like LG suggested for a while till I find a soap that clicks!",

I know I tried their Coconut Lime one time; I had no reaction to it myself.  Definitely check out the links in LG's post below.  I can personally recommend Kell's Original and Honeybee as very good soaps, and QED.  I do not favor The Shave Den's soap (but love their aftershave milk and splash).\n\nI myself recently had a *very* bad reaction to Ogalla Bay Rum aftershave splash.  I had seen it recommended many times here on W_E and added a bottle to my latest order of shaving gear.  I shaved one night, everything was going great, used my alum block, rinsed, shook the bottle of Ogalla, splashed some on my hands, and slapped my face.  I instantly knew something was wrong.  It felt like I had lit a match to my face and the alcohol in the bay rum was burning off.  I waited a few seconds to see if the sensation would die down but as I looked into the mirror I could see the upper parts of my cheeks turning steamed lobster red.  I reached for the nearest soap at hand, my Proraso preshave soap and went to town, washing my face three times in quick succession.  The burning sensation went down somewhat, and I applied some straight jojoba oil.  My face was still irritated but I could sleep.  I didn't shave the next day and could tell my cheeks were still a bit red.  I might try unloading this bottle of Ogalla on [/r/Shave_Bazaar](/r/Shave_Bazaar) but I will definitely put a warning as to my experience with it!",

    "body": "Purple shampoo never toned well for me, so I've been on the hunt for purple conditioners that function effectively and are CGM-approved. There are not many in the recommended products list, and adding semi-permanent dye to my conditioners, as the guide recommended worked very badly (I had color in it months later!). So I went on a search for approved conditioners and this is what I found!\n\n*My hair:* Definitely wavy and not curly, relatively fine, color-treated but weirdly protein sensitive despite that (????), naturally dry, high porosity, long. My coloration isn't dramatic - I basically go from a dark blonde to having honey-colored highlights. \n\n**Pura d'Or ColorHarmony Purple Conditioner** - This one is nicely pigmented - I can leave it on 3-5 minutes and be toned, though I usually leave it 7-10 - and moisturizing. My hair generally feels nice and soft afterwards. It has glycerin, though not high on the list; regardless it works best for me if I use it within the 30-60 dewpoint range. It has some protein, but not too much - my hair has never gotten strawlike after it as long as I moisturize adequately. I really recommend it. \n\n*Ingredients**:*  Decolorized Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice\\*, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract\\*, Glycerin\\*, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetearyl Alcohol (1-Hexadecanol, 1-Octadecanol), Colocasia (Taro) Esculenta\\*, Biotin, Avena Sativa (Oat) Bran Extract\\*, Citrus Aurantium (Orange) Peel Extract\\*, Ethylhexyl Olivate, Squalane, Bambusa (Bamboo) Vulgaris\\*, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil\\*, Keratin, Biotin, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Saponins, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Zinc Sulfate, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower Oil\\*, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil\\*, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Oil\\*, Xylityl Sesquicaprylate, Citric Acid, Ext. Violet 2 (CI 60730). \n\n**dHue Cool Blonde Conditioner -** This one is less pigmented - reports are that it doesn't tone well for certain people - and has more protein; overall I enjoy it less and find it more drying, but I have it in my arsenal because it's glycerin free and I need it for \\~30 and 60+ dewpoints. I've kind of just worked out how to use it - every 2nd or 3rd wash, leaving it in for 10 minutes, followed by a moisturizing, protein-free conditioner (so I condition twice overall *on top of* a leave-in). With that in mind, it works perfectly fine; it tones decently and my hair still looks nice. \n\n*Ingredients:*  Water/Aqua/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Distearyldimonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Silk Amino Acids, Hydrolyzed Silk, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance (Pa\u001drfum), Citric Acid, CI 60730, Acid Violet 43 (Ext. Violet 2). \n\n**Note on the Shampoos:** The shampoos associated with these conditioners have questionable ingredients for CGM and are pretty drying. I do find they're good clarifying shampoos every month or two, but wouldn't personally use them on a regular basis since my hair is already dry.\n\nHope this helps!",

It is color treated (because I have some greys) and I rarely use heat to style. The one upside it that is tends to be very soft (except when I pick the wrong product and dry it out). \n\nI am getting so turned around and confused with all the hair care advice I read. I am currently using [HairStory](https://www.hairstory.com/products/new-wash/) and it is going alright, but that s\\*&t is expensive. I made the mistake of using a leave-in that came in an Ipsy bag ( [FoxyBae Magic Daily Leave In Hair Mask - 12-in-1](https://www.foxybae.com/products/12-in-1-magic-daily-leave-in-hair-mask)). It was good the first time I used it but now my hair is feeling a bit grubby (so I guess I need to use a clarifying shampoo). I like to wash my hair ever other day, but on day two I always have to wear it in a ponytail. I'm tired of fighting it every day and spending a fortune on stuff that never seems to work. \n\nI have tried CG method, untold products for decades, products for curly hair, products for wavy hair, products for fine hair...). If I don't wash my hair frequently my scalp itches, so I have never managed more than three days. It takes my hair a long time to air dry, so I hate washing it because I have to go to work with wet hair or sleep with wet hair. \n\nI just want my hair to be moisture/protein balanced and not weighed down. I don't like complicated hair routines and prefer to use little or no product outside of shampoo and conditioner. I occasionally use [L'anza Bounce Up Spray](https://www.ulta.com/healing-oil-bounce-up-spray?productId=xlsImpprod18041073) and that seems to be magic. I have [Olaplex](https://olaplex.com/) 3 and it worked great the first time and has had diminishing returns since. I also have Olaplex 6 and it feels heavy in my hair. \n\nI tried that hair in water test and it never sunk despite leaving it in the cup for over an hour; however, I hear that this test may not be that helpful.

        "body": "I have long, fine hair too, and I totally feel your pain on how long air drying takes! I’ve never tried Hairstory, but I like the Verb Ghost line a lot. I’ve use the shampoo and conditioner for about six months, and I’ve tried the hair mask and oil from the same line. The Ghost hair mask is very light, so if you felt weighed down by others, definitely try that one. I use the oil sparingly at night any time my ends feel dry and I always wake up to super soft hair. I bought one of those [shampoo brush things](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074ZDXFL6?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share) for a scalp massage while shampooing and that feels nice and I think my roots are less greasy for longer. Good luck with your search!",

They are based on individual ingredients rather than **any negative effects the final product may have.** The way ingredients interact in a formulation can influence their potential impact, and the presence of a specific ingredient does not automatically equate to harm when used in a product. It's always crucial to do your own research, consider the product as a whole, and keep in mind that personal reactions can vary greatly. When making decisions about personal care products, it is recommended to consult with healthcare professionals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Brief**: This baby shampoo has gentle cleansing agents like Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate and Sodium Laurylglucosides Hydroxypropylsulfonate. However, the presence of Pyrithione Zinc signifies the shampoo is aimed at treating specific scalp conditions, such as cradle cap. It's important to use this only under a healthcare professional's advice for infants. The formula also includes Apple Extract, known for its antioxidant properties, and Panthenol, beneficial for skin hydration. Despite the inclusion of Phenoxyethanol as a preservative, it's typically safe in concentrations below 1%. Always perform a patch test to monitor possible allergic reactions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients:** Pyrithione Zinc, Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Sodium Laurylglucosides Hydroxypropylsulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Acrylates Copolymer, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Chloride, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Panthenol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Typical ingredients description and side effects\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Sodium Hydroxide\n   * Sodium hydroxide, also known as caustic soda or lye, is a strong alkaline compound that is sometimes used in the manufacturing process of personal care products, including baby lotions. It is used to adjust the pH of the formulation to ensure stability and efficacy. However, it is important to note that sodium hydroxide itself is not typically listed as an active ingredient in baby lotions, but rather used in very small amounts for pH adjustment purposes.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Sodium hydroxide, if present in higher concentrations, can cause skin irritation in some individuals. This may manifest as redness, itching, burning sensation, or rash. It is important to discontinue use if your baby experiences any of these symptoms and consult a healthcare professional.\n      * Eye Irritation: Direct contact of baby lotion containing sodium hydroxide with the eyes can cause mild to moderate eye irritation. It is crucial to avoid contact with the eyes and rinse thoroughly with water if accidental exposure occurs.\n      * Chemical Burns: Sodium hydroxide is a caustic substance and can cause chemical burns if used undiluted or in high concentrations. However, in properly formulated baby lotions, the concentration of sodium hydroxide is typically low and safe for use.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Zinc Pyrithione\n   * Zinc Pyrithione is a coordination complex of zinc that's primarily used as an antifungal and antibacterial agent. It's often found in products like dandruff shampoos, certain types of soap, and some skin care products due to its ability to treat seborrheic dermatitis, an inflammatory skin disorder that causes flaky, scaly patches on the skin. In baby shampoo, Zinc Pyrithione would likely be used to help manage cradle cap (a form of seborrheic dermatitis in infants) or other minor skin conditions. However, it's worth noting that not all baby shampoos will contain this ingredient, as its use will depend on the specific formulation of the product.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Some individuals may experience skin irritation, including redness, itching, or a rash, particularly if they have sensitive skin.\n      * Allergic Reactions: While rare, allergic reactions can occur. Symptoms might include severe redness, itching, hives, or swelling. In extreme cases, difficulty breathing could occur, which requires immediate medical attention.\n      * Eye Irritation: If a product with Zinc Pyrithione gets into the eyes, it can cause redness, watering, and irritation.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 6\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Phenoxyethanol\n   * Phenoxyethanol is used as a preservative in cosmetic products and also as a stabilizer in perfumes and soaps. Exposure to phenoxyethanol has been linked to reactions ranging from eczema to severe, life-threatening allergic reactions. Infant oral exposure to phenoxyethanol can acutely affect nervous system function.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: In some cases, phenoxyethanol can cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction, presenting as redness, itching, or a rash. Babies have sensitive skin and may be more susceptible to such reactions.\n      * Allergic Reactions: Though less common, some people may experience an allergic reaction to phenoxyethanol, which could result in symptoms like hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing.\n      * Eczema: It is also a common allergic reaction to skin exposure of products containing one percent or more phenoxyethanol. Reactions only occur in the area of application and eczema subsides after avoidance of the product causing irritation.\n      * Acute nervous system effects (infants): In 2008, the FDA warned consumers not to purchase Mommy’s Bliss Nipple Cream. Phenoxyethanol, found in the cream, was depressing the central nervous system and causing vomiting and diarrhea in breast feeding infants. Symptoms of a depressed nervous system include a decrease in infant’s appetite, difficulty waking the infant, limpness of extremities and change in skin color. There is no known health risk to the mother.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe grading system used by EWG in the Skin Deep database is as follows:\n\n1 to 2: Low hazard\n\n3 to 6: Moderate hazard\n\n7 to 10: High hazard",

    "body": "Below is a list I have compiled of all of the chemicals used in industrial manufacturing of everything from food to hygiene products that are derived from coconut and/or palm. There are a lot of products on the market that contain a lot of chemicals, many of which have by now become familiar sights in ingredients lists. There are an awful lot of them derived from coconut and palm exclusively, but there are also a lot of them that can be derived from other sources. There isn't any regulation currently in place (at least in the United States, that I am aware of) that requires manufacturers to disclose the source of their chemicals, which can lead to a lot of companies falsely claiming that their products are coconut and/or palm free, when they are just the opposite. Some of the chemicals you will see are things like Vitamin A-palmitate. This one in particular can be tricky as it can be found naturally in beef fat, or it can be derived from coconut or palm plants. You see it a lot in milk, particularly milk that is 2% or less milk fat, which would make you think that it is derived from beef fat, but when you start digging, you find out that it is far more readily available (and therefore cheaper for dairies to buy in the quantities they use) to acquire a palm derived version. Now, devil's advocate here, it may be simply that the dairies do not actually know that they are adding a palm derived product into their milk, as they are likely going through a bulk supplier.\n\nI have also come to realize that there are a lot of companies who advertise things as being coconut and/or palm free and are completely unaware that the chemicals they use come from those sources.

I'd like to be able to use something else though because I know all the sulfates are probably really harsh on my curls.\n\nIngredients: Aqua/Water/Eau, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Piroctone Olamine, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Panthenol, Sodium Benzoate, Polysorbate 20, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Gluconate, Dimethicone Propyl PGBetaine, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium Salicylate, Salix Alba Bark Extract/Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Parfum/Fragrance, Linalool, Limonene, Betula Alba Bark Extract, Zingiber Officinale Root Oil/Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Citronellol, Citral, Isopropyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, sr-Spider Polypeptide-1, 1,2- Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n-\n\nPANTENE NUTRIENT BLENDS COMPLETE CURL CARE SHAMPOO - Made me unbearably itchy, red and flaky. The worst of the bunch.\n\nIngredients: Water, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Fragrance, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Polyquaternium-10, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Salicylate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Acrylates Copolymer, Panthenol, Panthenyl Ethyl Ether, Histidine, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil\n\n-\n\nBRIOGEO SCALP REVIVAL MICRO-EXFOLIATING SHAMPOO - This one feels pretty good, but sometimes it leaves my hair feeling too \"squeaky clean\" and I'm not sure if I should be exfoliating my scalp every wash day. \n\nIngredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate*, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil*, Glyceryl Stearate*, Glycerin*, Microcrystalline Cellulose*, Cocamidopropyl Betaine*, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate*, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate*, Hydrogenated Castor Oil*, Lithium Magnesium Sodium Silicate, Panthenol, Xylitylglucoside*, Charcoal Powder*, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil*, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil*, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil*, Mentha Viridis (Spearmint) Leaf Oil*, Anhydroxylitol*, Bisabolol, Menthyl Lactate*, Xylitol*, Polyquaternium-7, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Fragrance (Parfum), Citric Acid*, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n-\n\nBRIOGEO BLOSSOM & BLOOM VOLUMIZING SHAMPOO (which I guess was recently discontinued?) - Feels pretty good as well, some itchiness.\n\nIngredients: Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate*, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine*, Lauramidopropyl Betaine*, Glycerin*, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate*, Polysorbate 80*, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate*, Soyamidopropyldimethylamine Oxide*, Maltodextrin*, Biotin, Panthenol, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate*, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Citrus Tangerina (Tangerine) Peel Oil, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Mentha Viridis (Spearmint) Leaf Oil, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil, Sodium C14-18 Olefin Sulfonate*, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate*, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate*, Polyquaternium-7, Polyquaternium-71, Fragrance, Citric Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid\n\n-\n\nBRIOGEO CURL CHARISMA SHAMPOO - Moderate itchiness on my scalp and also just way too heavy for my hair.\n\nIngredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Lauramidopropyl Betaine*, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate*, Glycerin*, Glycol Distearate*, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine*, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter*, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract*, Rice Amino Acids*, Lactobacillus/Tomato Fruit Ferment Extract*, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil*, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil*, Acanthus Mollis Leaf Extract*, Tocopheryl Acetate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice*, Keratin Amino Acids*, Coconut Acid*, Hydrolyzed Quinoa*, Sodium Hyaluronate*, Acyl Coenzyme A Desaturase*, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil*, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil*, Polyquaternium-71, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate*, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Isethionate, Polyquaternium-7, Anhydroxylitol*, Xylitylglucoside*, Xylitol*, Fragrance (Parfum), Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol",

I’m happy to keep using that as my shampoo but I’ve been trying to work out what the ingredient that seems to make my scalp angry is so I can avoid it in other products, and I’m starting to think it could be polyquaternium 10 (or polyquaternium in general). The body shop shampoo doesn’t have it in, but I’ve tried the only curls cleanser & umberto giannini scalp restore and got really itchy both times - and they both have polyquaternium 10 in! It could just be complete coincidence though obviously! I’ve also found I get slightly itchy with boots extra firm mousse which has polyquaternium 16. \n\nI’ve also found that my hair feels instantly dry (as in not wet, not as in straw like) to the touch soon as the water isn’t on it when I’m washing it as if there is a film on it and that doesn’t happen with the body shop shampoo either. \n\nI could be completely off the mark here but I’ve never seen anyone else have the same issue!",

So I bought Smooth Hydration Argan Oil & Shea Butter shampoo, conditioner, and the curl enhancing yogurt. \n\nI love the smell, I love the texture, and I love my curls! My only problem is that the yogurt does not enhance my second day curls, and I'm noticing more frizz than when I previously co-washed with Tresseme products. \n\nUnfortunately, I can't get the \"Search ingredients - what do they do? Are they bad for my hair?\" link on the sidebar to work, and \"Search for product reviews, ingredients, etc\" does not have this particular formula. Has anyone else tried these products?

        "body": "Unfortunately, that \"Wonderful CG Friendly Drugstore Product List\" isn't so wonderful anymore.  I don't think it's been updated for a while.  Two of those Organix products you listed have Dimethicone, which is a silicone.  Can't tell if the shampoo is ok but I have checked a few Organix shampoos at my local drugstore and I found a few with sulfates.  \n\nYes to Carrots Nourishing Shampoo is also listed there but has sulfates.  I found out after I've been using it for almost 2 months :(.  The YTC conditioner is ok though. There is also a Garnier Fructis that I made the mistake of buying but thankfully I verified the ingredients before using it.  \n\nThat \"search ingredients\" link is sadly another site that hasn't been maintained for a while :(\n\nIf you need product recommendations, try the pinned post at the top of this subreddit and scroll towards the bottom for the product recommendations.  There is also a product recommendation link at the sidebar in /r/haircarescience.  But before you buy, google the ingredients just in case the manufacturer changed ingredients",

There's a lot of misinfo on personal care products because some people infer \"literally contains gluten\" from company statements such as \"no gluten ingredients but we don't test/guarantee GF status.\"\n\nThere are a few reasons why this statement on a non-food isn't alarming:\n\n* GF label laws are specific to foods so companies may be hesitant to make these claims because they do not know how it might be enforced. Those labeling GF may not be doing any testing or supplier verification knowing this. \n* amount that you might ingest is a lot smaller than food - 21 ppm in a bread is worse than 21 ppm in a lotion or facewash\n* ingredients are typically synthetic or very highly processed so CC unlikely \n* plants less likely to have large amounts of gluten/oats in them, so in-plant CC less likely than food\n\nThis [US study](https://academic.oup.com/jaoac/article-abstract/99/3/586/5657997?redirectedFrom=fulltext) tested a bunch of personal care products. Of those that had detectable gluten, all had gluten ingredients like wheat germ oil or hydrolyzed wheat protein. \n\nGiven the above things, a product without gluten ingredients should be safe.",

    "body": "I've worn my ring for more than 2 years while doing dishes, taking a shower, cleaning the house with various cleaners.....  I don't use much for caustic cleaners or things that leave a lot of residue due to the number of pets we have so I rarely have to worry about damaging the ring and only occasionally take it off first.\n\nSomehow while giving the fluffy husky a bath I rather severely burnt my finger.  I don't have anything that can focus well enough to take a pic and my husband has not been interested in helping with his amazing quality phone camera.  The dog shampoo had not arrived yet so I used plain unscented dawn dish soap to get the worst dirt off and then human moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.  The problem happened before I applied the new dog specific after bath coat conditioner for helping her excess fluff slide out and that was a spray I didn't really get on myself so everything I used was the same as I have repeatedly in other situations.  \n\n\nInitially I thought the flexible plastic brush with it's hand strap and finger loop were merely pushing the bulky ring into my finger.  I have very small hands and this is the widest and sharpest edged ring I've ever worn.  So I assumed despite trying to keep my finger farther back and avoid pushing on the ring the occasional times it did were the reason for the mild discomfort and red line on the back of my finger.  \n\n\nThe next morning that red line was a huge raised red welt in a strip as wide a the ring with larger areas that matched the spacing of the electrodes.  I decided it was most definitely not just from the ring digging in.  I moved my ring to my other hand.  It's continued to work as normal.  By evening I had 3 large blisters that broke and scabbed over.  While those healed during the next several days little itchy blisters appeared along the edges of the still large raised red welt across the back of my finger.  I heal fast so it was slightly concerning that this wound showed practically no sign of improving.  \n\n\nFinally over a week later new blisters stopped forming, the raised area suddenly went down practically overnight, and the damaged skin is peeling off.  I've always had a tendency to find ways to burn myself while cooking, fireworks(even sparklers), and once I melted some fine copper wire strands to the side of my finger in a rewiring oopsy on a low voltage device.  I'm pretty sure I have never managed to get a burn this severe.    \n\n\nUnfortunately I can't really tell you what the catalyst was given I've used all the same products in other situations and rinsed each one off thoroughly before the next.  The only unique thing in this incident was dog fur.  Doing dishes for hours, taking long showers with soaps, scrubbing the dogs with dry shampoo spray or wipes, wiping off the kitchen counters with mild chlorine based disinfectant (not at all similar to bleach), dusting with pledge, and mopping the floor with an oura ring on has not resulted in any problems.    \n\n\nMaybe soap covered dog fur can short out an oura ring?  Don't know but of all the things you do while wearing an oura ring apparently don't wash the dog. :P   \n\n\n  \n\n\nShampoo and conditioner used:  \n OGX coconut milk nourishing shampoo- Active Ingredients: Aqua (Water); Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate;  Cocamidopropyl Betaine; Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine; Parfum; Glycol  Distearate; Dimethicone Copolyol; Cetyl Alcohol; Cocamide DEA; Guar  Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride; Polyquaternium-11; DMDM Hydantoin;  Panthenol; Silk Amino Acids; Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Extract; Albumen;  Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil; Hydrolyzed Milk Protein; Tocopheryl  Acetate (Vitamin E); Coumarin \n\n&#x200B;\n\nogx coconut milk conditioner- Water (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride,  Glycerin, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit  Extract, Glycol Stearate, Glycol Distearate, Ceteareth-20, Isopropyl  Alcohol, Dimethicone, Cyclotetrasiloxane, Citric Acid,  Cyclopentasiloxane, Panthenol, Ovum (Egg Powder), Propylene Glycol,  Tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, Methylchloroisothiazolinone,  Methylisothiazolinone, Fragrance (Parfum).",

Perhaps, in my sleep, the sensors twisted toward the top of my finger where the delicate skin is as opposed to staying positioned underneath on the palm side my hand.\n\n I seem to recall when I initially received the ring that the literature stated to keep the sensors on the under side of your hand.

    "body": "# Recommended Product Ingredients\n\n​I always have clients review their hair care routine with me during appointments, which helps me recommend better products for their needs. The most common issue people share is experiencing a loss of effectiveness in their products over time. This results from a need to balance cleaning your hair with moisturizing it. Below I've provided a guide to help balance your hair care routine based on the recommendations I usually give my clients, complete with a list of the most effective ingredients for each category. I purposely left non-detergents (soaps) off of the list because they use oils to remove contaminants, which I've found does not clean hair as well.  (This is the full blog but if you want to screenshot the ingredient lists the post is a bit better organized on my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-recommended-product-ingredients.html))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Surfactant Cleanser **Definition:** Surfactant cleansers are detergents or cleaning agents. They work by surrounding and lifting residue off of the hair strand so water can rinse it away. On a product's ingredient list you generally see them listed towards the top. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Detoxes, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used by all hair types. Helpful for oily hair. See [How Often Should I Shampoo?](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html) ​for frequency.\\*\\*Ingredients:\\*\\*​\n\n* Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n* Sodium cocoyl isethionate \n* Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n* Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate \n* Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n* Sodium lauroyl glutamate \n* Sodium cocoyl glutamate \n* Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate \n* Ammonium lauryl sulfate ​\n* Ammonium laureth sulfate\n* Sodium polystyrene sulfonate\n* Cocamidopropyl betaine\n* Coco betaine\n* Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine\n* Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n* Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n* Sodium lauroamphoacetate\n* Sodium sulfosuccinate\n* Cocamidopropyl betaine\n* Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n* Sodium lauryl sulfate \\*\n\n*\\* Sodium lauryl sulfate is not recommended for daily use.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Non Surfactant Cleanser **Definition:** This cleaning agent does not completely lift oil and grease off of the hair strand, meaning it does not fully remove them. Doing so lightly cleanses your hair while also retaining moisture (i.e. conditioning it). It is not recommended for use with silicones, mineral oil or petroleum products because these ingredients deposit a [residue](https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/493588) under the hair's cuticle that require a surfactant cleanser to remove. I usually suggest using a clarifying shampoo once a month with this type of cleanser. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Detoxes, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used by all hair types. Helpful for dry hair. See [How Often Should I Shampoo?](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html) ​for frequency.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil\n* Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil\n* Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil\n* Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil\n* Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Detox **Definition:** While similar to the Cleanser category, the Detox category is stronger. These cleansing agents remove product build up and help with demineralization of the hair. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used once a month by all hair types. Helpful for oily hair.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Disodium EDTA (Ethylamine Diamine Tetraacetic Acid)\n* Pentasoidum Pentetate\n* Sodium phytate\n* Phytic acid\n* Citric acid (needs large enough quantity to be effective)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Humectants **Definition:** T​his ingredient helps retain moisture from water by attracting it to the hair strand in humid climate conditions. However, in dry weather humectants have the opposite effect and will transfer moisture from your hair into the atmosphere. This can leave your hair dehydrated, which may not be what you want depending on its current state.*Tip: Humectants are complementary to silicones and plant oils.* **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** Can be used daily by all hair types. Helpful for dry hair. Using a detox once a month is recommended with this category.\\*\\*Ingredients:\\*\\**Hydrolyzed Proteins*\n\n* Hydrolyzed Elastin, silk, keratin, collagen \n* Peptides (wheat, oat, soy...)\n* Amino acids (wheat, oat, soy) or glycine, alanine, proline, etc.\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (source of protein, i.e. keratin, silk, rice, soy)\n* Cocoyl hydrolyzed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (source of protein)\n* Potassium cocoyl hydrolyzed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (source of protein)\n* Hydrolyzed oat flour\n\n*For Use In Humid Weather​*\n\n* Vegetable glycerin\n* ​Sorbitol\n\n*Plant Gels*\n\n* Panthenol\n* Flax Seed Gel\n* Okra Gel\n* Aloe Vera\n* Hydroxyethylcellulose\n* Pectin\n* Xanthan Gum\n* Guar Gum\n* Marshmallow Root\n* Slippery Elm​\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Soluble Silicones **Definition:** This ingredient coats the hair shaft to lock in moisture, reduce frizz, add slip, and give hair the coveted soft and silky feel. Soluble silicones can be washed out with non surfactant cleansers. **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** Can be used daily by all hair types. Using a detox once a month is recommended with this category. \n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Any silicone with PEG as a prefix\n* Bis-peg/ppg-16/16 peg/ppg-16/16 (This is an emulsifier - not for shine or lubrication)\n* Cyclomethicone\n* Dimethicone copolyol\n* DEA PG-Propyl PEG/PPG-18/21 Dimethicone\n* Dimethicone PEG-8 Phosphate\n* Dimethicone-PG Diethylmonium Chloride\n* Hydrolyzed Silk PG-Propyl Methylsilanediol Crosspolymer\n* Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n* Hydrolyzed Wheat protein/hydroxypropyl polysiloxane and cystine/silicone co-polymers\n* Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Silanetriol\n* Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol\n* Lauryl methicone copolyol\n* PEG-40/PPG-8 Methylaminopropyl/Hydropropyl Dimethicone Copolymer\n* PEG/PPG-14/4 Dimethicone\n* PEG/PPG-20/15 Dimethicone\n* PEG-12 Dimethicone\n* PEG/PPG-20/15 Dimethicone\n* PPG-8 Methylaminopropyl, Hydroxypropyl Dimethicone Copolymer\n* PEG-7 Amodimethicone\n* PEG-8 Disteramonium Chloride PG-Dimethicone\n* PEG-33 (and) PEG-8 Dimethicone (and) PEG-14\n* Silanetriol\n* Silicone Quaternium-8\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Plant Oils **Definition:** This ingredient is used to retain moisture, condition hair, protect from damage and minimize dryness. **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** Can be used daily by all hair types. Helpful for dry hair.  **Ingredients:**\n\n* Coconut (Cocos Nucifera) Oil \n* Sunflower (Helianthus Annuus) Seed Oil\n* Olive (Olea Europaea) Oil\n* Argan (Argania Spinosa) Oil\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Preservatives **Definition:** Additives that prevent spoilage. Most consumer products contain preservatives because without them any water-based solution will eventually grow mold or bacteria. **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** A routine is not applicable for this category since it's included in most products, but pay attention to whether your products cause scalp irritation. That could be a sign to switch to, or alternate with, preservative free options.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Sodium Benzoate\n* Potassium Sorbate \n* Benzoic acid\n* Dehydroacetic acid\n\n*​Sources:* [*Cationic Compounds in Cosmetics*](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/search?q=surfactants)*, Science-y Hair Blog*[*Detergents Which Remove: Silicone*](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2016/05/detergents-which-remove-silicones.html)*, Science-y Hair Blog​*[*Essentials of Hair Care Often Neglected: Hair Cleansing*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3002407/)*, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)*[*Glycerin and Humidity*](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2015/02/glycerin-and-humidity.html)*, Science-y Hair Blog*[*Film Forming Humectants - What They Are And Why You Need Them*](http://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2014/07/film-forming-humectants-what-they-are.html)*, Science-y Hair Blog*",

For the past month or so I've tried cutting down on my use of silicones and sulfates (only use a sulfate shampoo once a week or so because my hair feels too gross without it), but overall my hair feels worse than before. About a month ago I bought some natures gate products, because I really like how they're relatively inexpensive and also vegan/cruelty free. \n\nFor anyone who's curious: \n\nThis is the ingredients list for the shampoo I've been using: Water, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, sodium cocoyl isethionate, disodium cocoamphodiacetate, lauryl glucoside, glycerin, chamomilla recutita (matricaria) flower extract, panthenol, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, borago officinalis (borage) seed oil, tocopherol, ascorbic acid, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, equisetum arvense (horsetail) leaf extract, geranium maculatum (geranium) extract, salvia officinalis (sage) leaf extract, mimosa tenuiflora (mimosa) bark extract, ascorbyl palmitate, polysorbate 20, leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium hydroxide, phenoxyethanol, glyceryl undecylenate, citric acid, fragrance (parfum)*\nMade in the USA from globally sourced materials.\n* Phthalate free\nNo - sodium lauryl/laureth/coco sulfates, phthalates, butylene glycol, artificial colors.\n\nAnd this is the ingredients list for the conditioner - Water, Glycerin (Vegetable Derived), Stearyl Alcohol (Vegetable Derived), Cetyl Alcohol (Vegetable Derived), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Vegetable Derived), Benzyl Alcohol, Stearalkonium Chloride (Vegetable Derived), Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis (Borage) Seed Oil, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Hordeum Vulgare (Barley) Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Fruit Extract, Viola Tricolor (Pansy) Extract, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hydroxyethylcellulose (Plant Derived), Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Fragrance*.\n*Phthalate free.\n\nMy hair feels straw-like even in the shower, there's no slip unless it's absolutely coated in conditioner and then as soon as it rinses out it feels gross again. I also feel like my hair is falling out more often (if I pull at the tips, long strands will start coming out in the shower). I don't really know what to do. I feel like my hair gets buildup pretty easily because when I've tried cowashing with thick shampoos or have put oil in my hair it always feels really weighed down and greasy the next day. I also have some issues with an itchy, flaky scalp. \n\nI was thinking that using a conditioner with water soluble silicones would be the best compromise - all the benefits of silicones but without the buildup. \n\nDoes anyone have any product recommendations? *I've also been looking for a heat protectant spray* that contains water soluble silicones, since I usually straighten my hair a bit to get rid of the really weirdly shaped waves. I've started using a bit of salt spray in my hair as well (not that often), but I feel like it's been drying out my ends. I considered mixing a bit of conditioner or oil (I've heard jojoba is closest to the scalp sebum) into the mix to make it less damaging, but I have no idea what the salt is doing to my hair with or without silicones. On one hand, it seems like silicones would protect my hair from the salt penetrating it too much. But on the other, it would also prevent the moisturizing ingredients from penetrating my hair, so it seems like a catch-22. I do think I need silicones though, because my hair just doesn't seem to be doing too great without them.   \n\nI'm sorry for such a long post! But if anyone could help me, that would be wonderful.

If you’re trying to recreate that effect, I’d look for a lightweight clarifying shampoo like: Redken Amino Mint Scalp Shampoo, Kenra Clarifying Shampoo, or Pureology Clarify Shampoo.\n\nThen for conditioner, you need a silicone-containing conditioner that also includes panthenol, hydrolyzed proteins, and a polyquaternium or two for slip. Try the Redken All Soft Conditioner, seems pretty similar to what you’re looking for. \n\nGood luck with your search!",

    "body": "Hi! So Neutrogena has a new cleanser with salycilic, glycolic acid and PHA. As far as i know it has %0,5 salicylic acid, %2 glycolic acid and %2 PHA. I think it is a special version for my country. It is similar to this: [https://www.neutrogena.com/products/skincare/stubborn-texture-acne-cleanser-for-textured-skin/6819307.html](https://www.neutrogena.com/products/skincare/stubborn-texture-acne-cleanser-for-textured-skin/6819307.html) But this one has different ingredients and also doesn't have sls.\n\nThese are the ingredients:\n\nWater, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Sorbitol, Glycolic Acid, Gluconolactone, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Sodium chloride, Potassium Acrylates Copolymer, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Sodium bicarbonate\n\nLately i've been getting acne on my beard area. i was growing my hair for a year. because of the pimples in my beard area i got a haircut. after that for the last week it had calmed down (i think it was because of the coconut oil in my hair products btw). after i start using this cleanser new acne started coming out again in the same area.\n\ni use cerave in the tub as a moisturizer and la roche posay spf50 as a sunscreen. also i was using cerave foaming face wash until a couple of days ago. Should i stop using this neutrogena cleanser and come back to cerave or keep continuing with it?",

You can try to incorporate the cleanser slowly to you routing. Try to use it twice a week, then every other day etc. If you still get issues - just switch back",

Nevertheless, I do believe it can still be an effective addition to a hair loss treatment. \n\nAnyway, after lots of research and filtering, I settled to only these 2 shampoos. I won't mention the brand names but will write the ingredients of each to avoid bias. And judging from their ingredients, I would love to hear your thoughts which shampoo would yield a better result. By result, I mean nourishing and strenghtening hair, increasing exsisting hair thickness, improving circulation and maybe even blocking some of the scalp DHT. \n\n\nShampoo No 1 \n\nDecolorized aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf juice*, sodium laurylglucosides hydroxypropylsulfonate, hydroxypropyl bis-hydroxyethyl dimonium chloride, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, sodium cocoamphoacetate, polyquaternium-73, cocamide mipa, melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) leaf oil*, argania spinosa (argan) kernel oil*, biotin (vitamin H), nigella sativa (black cumin) seed oil*, cymbopogon flexuosus (lemongrass) oil*, emblica officinalis (amla) oil*, grateloupia elliptica (red Korean seaweed) extract, urtica dioica (nettle) leaf extract*, serenoa serrulata (saw palmetto) extract*, cedrus atlantica (cedarwood) bark oil*, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf oil*, salvia sclarea (clary sage) oil*, polygonum multiflorum (he shou wu) root extract*, citrus limon (lemon) peel oil*, citrus grandis (grapefruit) seed extract*, hibiscus sabdariffa (hibiscus) flower extract*, nicotinic acid (niacin)*, cucurbita pepo (pumpkin) seed oil*, prunus africana (pygeum) bark extract*, zinc pyrithione, tocopherol (vitamin E)*, soy isoflavone**, beta-sitosterol, camellia sinensis (green tea) leaf extract*, xylitol sesquicaprylate, lactobacillus ferment, salix nigra (willow) bark extract*, citric acid. \n\n\n\n\n\nShampoo No 2\n\nAqua, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Coco-Glucoside, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Lactate, Vegetable Glycerin, Aroma Natural (Orange), Behenamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Fulvic Acid, Betaine, Lactic Acid, Caffeine, L-arginine, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Benzyl Alcohol.\n\n\nFirst one has lots of interesting and hair health promoting and nourishing ingredients.

They are based on individual ingredients rather than **any negative effects the final product may have.** The way ingredients interact in a formulation can influence their potential impact, and the presence of a specific ingredient does not automatically equate to harm when used in a product. It's always crucial to do your own research, consider the product as a whole, and keep in mind that personal reactions can vary greatly. When making decisions about personal care products, it is recommended to consult with healthcare professionals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Brief**: I believe this product stands as one of the top baby shampoo options available at a reasonable price. It has obtained the EWG's certification for safety compliance, containing only a single moderate hazard ingredient. While there are reports from the EWG associating Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice with potential carcinogenic risks, it's worth noting that most commercial aloe vera products, including skincare and topical applications, utilize the clear gel from within the aloe vera leaf, excluding the outer part containing aloin. Manufacturers typically employ processes that remove aloin to undetectable levels. However, parents who harbor concerns regarding the presence of Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice may opt for alternative products. Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Sodium Laurylglucosides Hydroxypropylsulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice\\*, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil\\*, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil\\*, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Fruit Extract\\*, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract\\*, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract\\*, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Sodium Chloride, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Dehydroacetic Acid, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Citric Acid \\*Organic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Typical ingredients description and side effects\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice\n   * Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice is widely used in skincare products, including baby shampoos, due to its soothing, hydrating, and anti-inflammatory properties. It is generally considered safe for topical use.\n   * However, it's worth noting that certain parts of the aloe vera plant contain a compound called aloin, which has been linked to potential carcinogenic effects when ingested in large amounts. Most commercial aloe vera products, including skincare products and topical applications, are made from the clear gel found inside the aloe vera leaf, not the outer part of the leaf where aloin is found. The process used to prepare aloe vera for commercial use generally removes aloin to non-detectable levels.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Aloe vera is usually soothing, but some individuals may experience skin irritation or allergic reactions, such as redness, rash, burning or itching sensations, especially with frequent use.\n      * Allergic Reactions: Rarely, some individuals may have a more severe allergic reaction to aloe vera. This could result in symptoms like swelling, severe redness, or difficulty breathing.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe grading system used by EWG in the Skin Deep database is as follows:\n\n1 to 2: Low hazard\n\n3 to 6: Moderate hazard\n\n7 to 10: High hazard",

    "body": "I want to start CG because I believe my hair health will benefit, but I have a concern about a reaction I have to a particular shampoo. I want to understand why so I can avoid that happening again when I get new CG approved products.\n\nShampoo disaster- In August 2019 I unintentionally tried a CG approved shampoo according to isitcg: Soapbox Coconut Oil Shampoo (see ingredients  below). The first two times were okay, but every time since then my hair has a terrible reaction. It makes my hair ridiculously tangled and matted, almost gummy? Yet simultaneously dry as straw at the bottom? No amount of conditioner helps. It makes it terribly difficult to brush/comb and consequently I lose a bunch of hair. \n\nWhy might this have happened? It is very confusing and makes me very nervous to switch to a CG shampoo, despite the non-CG one I am currently using causing some other smaller issues.  \n\nSomeone else suggested maybe my hair doesn’t like coconut oil, but I’ve always used products with it since 2012. They also said it sounds like protein overload, which it does sound like that, but the Soapbox shampoo does not have protein as far as I can tell...?  \n\nFor context, I think I have 2A-2B wavy hair that has low porosity at the top and maybe medium at the bottom. I have very thick, fine hair that gets very frizzy in humidity. Where I live has 90% humidity most of the time. It basically doesn’t grow beyond my shoulders and just breaks off. It’s very prone to oil and grease at the top, but always dry at the bottom. Products cause nasty build up at the top, and sometimes are absorbed a little at the bottom and it is gross. It takes at least 2.5 hours to air dry, usually closer to 4. I live in a mostly hot, very humid climate. CG approved shampoo I unintentionally used in the past had a lot of protein and glycerin in it. Sometimes glycerin was the second ingredient.\n\n\nSoapbox Coconut Shampoo Ingredients:\n\nWater (Aqua), Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Cetrimonium Chloride, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Panthenol, Polyquaternium-11, Polyquaternium-7, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe) Leaf Juice, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol",

I’ve never had an allergic reaction.\n\nI FINALLY, at 26, have found a hair color that really suits me and I love! I’ve been fake blonde forever but I can’t keep up with it. My color is definitely copper. \n\nThe hair dye itself, I asked the salon about. They said it’s very gentle and has never caused an allergic reaction. Despite that, after a few days I got a BAD one and had to go to urgent care. Eyes swollen nearly shut, itching and burning, hives and swelling all over my ears, cheeks and eyes. \n\nNo reaction on my scalp or neck aside from hives on my actual forehead along my hairline. You’d think a hair product allergy would hurt my scalp and neck too?\n\nI am no stranger to allergic reactions to weird things. Never to hair dye or hair products before, but mystery hives and swelling on my eyes isn’t abnormal. Always wondered why it’s always my eyes? \n\nI’ve tried two copper toning conditioners since the original incident (it wasn’t originally clear that the hair dye had done it) and both escalated things and did the same thing to me! I ended up in urgent care again with my ears, eye lids and cheeks so swollen and messed up. So bad. So much pain. I eventually did spot tests on both arms with these products: NO REACTIONS?! \n\nBased on starting and stopping the conditioners to test things, it’s 100% the conditioners causing this. When I stop using them it clears. Start again and the hives and swelling trickle right back. They must contain the same ingredient(s) the original dye had that my body can’t handle. I wear a silk cap with my hair up and out of my face at night, silk pillow cases, detergent is cleared, no new products besides those. It’s definitely the dye and conditioners. \n\nI was on every allergy med under the sun. Both trips to urgent care and they gave me prednisone. Steroids were the only thing that actually put a dent in this thing. \n\nI’m at a complete loss here and need some help. I’ve used Copper Overtone and Copper Keracolor. Neither use PPD as an ingredient and also I’ve never had a reaction to hair color before. Had every color in the past. What could be this mystery ingredient that’s doing this to my eyes and face!? I’d love to work around this and keep my copper color with some kind of alternative product, but I can’t figure out what could be causing it. It’d also be really tough to get this color out of my hair so keeping it is worlds easier than taking it all out and going blonde again. \n\nI’m allergic to nickel and that’s it! Very sensitive skin though.\n\nThank you!!!

That sawmill mills longleaf pine. now, when the winds shift direction it blows in the pollen spores from the milling of the longleaf pine and gives you a reaction.\n\nThe pollen enters your nose, and (most people people have a deviated septum) the pollen gets stuck due to the deviation and possible large turbines in the nose. now the pollen has nowhere to go because it's stuck. It makes its way to the eyes because it a portal of entry. now its inside the sinus cavity, entering the nose and getting into your eyes. One side might always be worse than the other side.\n\nI've done 8 years of research on this. maybe I can point you in a direction or the type of doctor who would know your problem. I was a medical mystery until I did my own scientific  research. ( I have a master degree- MS in climate change and public health, and a BSN.)\n\nYou might not be allergic to the product you are using, but based on where you reside and what pollutants/allergens are present in the air, the chemical reaction between the product you are using and whatever in in the air is creating the mysterious allergy on your forehead/hairline because your skin is sensitive.\n\nDoctors only treat primary issues and not secondary. they also do not take into account things that could be the culprit based on where you live.

Without a clear diagnosis/ diagnoses it is difficult to say which ingredients are likely culprits for these symptoms.\n\nI have highlighted some potentially problematic ingredients. In acne vulgaris some struggle with depositing silicones such as dimethicone and cyclomethicone. Caprylic/ capric triglycerides are AKA fractionated coconut oil, tocopherol is AKA vitamin E. PEG- prefix means water soluble, so clogging ingredients may be much less of a problem in a cleanser format compared with a leave on one.\n\nDrying alcohol and butylene/ propylene glycols are known irritants, skin barrier disruptors and penetration enhancers. Fragrance is an irritant and the second most common topical allergen after nickel.\n\nAny preservative - including the much maligned parabens - is an issue for someone somewhere. I *think* sorbic acid and/ or potassium sorbate cause flushing for some but that would need double checking.\n\nPhysical/ all mineral sunscreens are recommended over chemical sunscreens in reactive skin. I rate [Derma-e Antioxidant Natural Sunscreen SPF 30 body] (http://dermae.com/product/343/Antioxidant-Natural-Sunscreen-SPF-30-Body-Lotion.html) (identical to the face version which claims oil-free status). This has no silicones nor drying alcohol, does have 1% green tea extract, a little sodium ascorbyl phosphate (form of vitamin C useful in acne), caprylic/ capric triglycerides, a little of a fatty alcohol.\n\nCleansers ... totally different tack would be a micellar water, the gentlest ingredients wise is [Bioderma Sensibio H2O] (http://www.bioderma.com/en/our-products/sensibio/h2o) which has none of the regular preservatives, one glycol way down the ingredients list. Even if you don't love micellar cleansing waters it might help you with the elimination process, or they can be used as a second cleanse after an emulsifying oil.\n\nFoaming cleanser wise I rate Simple Kind to Skin Refreshing Wash Gel which has a short ingredients list, is pH appropriate and is ridiculously gentle (use it on my full body). It is based on cocoamidopropyl betaine which someone suggested is coconut-based in your other thread. There is no link between this surfactant and the potentially comedogenic oil, it has been completely transformed chemically.",

That makes it excellent for both curls and color, but it may not be enough for you in terms of cleaning your hair and scalp.\n\nThe Love for Hue and Curl Defining shampoos are actually pretty similar in that they both use very mild detergents. This would be good for both color and curls and sufficient for cleansing unless you have a lot of buildup or certain scalp conditions. It would be a little harsher on hair than the kinky moves, but a lot of people can't cowash.\n\nIf you can't cowash, try alternating cowashing with low poo (both the curl defining and love for hue shampoos are low poos). That will help keep your color fresh and your curls moisturized.",

There’s also perfume/fragrance which is risky for sensitive skin.\n\n\nThis could he a hit or miss for you. If you do buy it, make sure you patch test (*like on next to the hairline on the side of your face or next to your lip*) For a couple days to see how your sensitive skin reacts.

Your hair is wavy so if you wanted to go CG method you could. I put both of these in and the shampoo is approved with caution (meaning some ingredients might not work for everyone but if it works for you keep using it) and the conditioner was not approved based on the inclusion of Isododecane which is not a silicone but it is insoluble in water and can act as one in the sense that it can prevent your hair from getting “real” moisture.\n\nOverall that being the only unapproved ingredient tells me these are probably alright to be using and shouldn’t damage your hair or dry it out. If you notice any product buildup or your roots being more oily than normal you can use a clarifying treatment and if your hair seems like it’s still not getting moisturized from the shaft down you could try getting a deep conditioning mask to do once or twice a week. If all else fails you could just switch to a new shampoo and conditioner after you use these up.",

Honey, glycerin, HA, & snail mucin fall under that category.\n\nHumectants (If i remember correctly) can be tricky if you: live in a dry environment or use it on a dry face bc it won't have moisture to draw from. I'm guessing it's fine in your cleanser bc you rinse it off right away but your sunscreen doesnt seem to have any so maybe look for humectant- free products to hydrate your skin? Green tea, aloe, rose, etc might be better nourishing ingredients to look for? \n\nEdit: also for whenever you can find a good moisturizer, I hear vanicream's cleanser is really gentle!

    "body": "My wife and I were giving my daughter a bath when I accidentally shot quite a bit of Beauty Counter's \"Baby Gentle All Over Wash\" directly into her eye. Her pediatrician told me not to worry, but I'm still concerned because it's hard to convey how much and how directly this got into her eye. Instead of coming out of the container in slow globs like I was expecting, this came out as a thin, forceful projectile stream. I can easily shoot this stuff ten feet across the room. It hit her directly in the eye and formed a pool over her entire eye socket. We quickly rinsed all of the exterior soap away, and she even voluntarily opened her eye as we were pouring water over it (though I'm not sure how much this actually flushed). Her eye was red and puffy for a bit afterward.\n\nHere's a current picture of her eye taken about an hour after it happened: http://imgur.com/a/1V2MiOd\n\nI'll edit this post to add a link to the product ingredients. \n\nShould we be concerned that a large amount of this soap may have went directly into her eye?\n\nEDIT: Here's a link to product, although our packaging is partially in French for some reason: https://www.beautycounter.com/product/baby-gentle-all-over-wash\n\nAnd here's the full list of ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau, Decyl Glucoside, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Gluconolactone, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Chloride",

Summary of Cat incl. pre-existing health condition.   \nB. My Question regarding current Poisoning - \"What action can be taken now?\"  \nC. Long timeline of Events   \nD. Ingredients in \"Everyone for Everybody\" Soap.  \n\n\nThank you for taking time out of your day to look this over and offer any help.  \n\n\nA. Summary of Cat   \n\n\nI recently was given this white with black spots female. She seems about 5-7 years old. She is very shy and I named her Shyla. She is a house cat that retreats and stays in my room which is warm and secure. At first she would sleep under the bed so I put a blanket down there. Now she primarily sleeps on my bed or a comfy chair in my room. Sometimes she will still retreat to under the bed if there is a loud noise in the house. I have taken her for 1 brief walk on a harness. She walked around a bit but wasn't very exploratory and didn't seem thrilled with the harness. I'm going to find a better one. She enjoys canned salmon juice, her hard food I was given (complete essentials or something), cooked chicken, a little bit of milk, a little bit of egg, really enjoys canned cat soft food ex. chicken, turkey, lamb. She sleeps most of the day with moments of activity. She is most active in the late evening and early morning. She will follow me around the house and enjoys chasing a shoe lace recently. She mostly enjoys being petted or brushed.  \n\n\nPre-existing health condition: Her left eye is discharging slowly some gunk when she sleeps that dries below it. I clean it off twice a day. Her right eye does as well but not as much. It doesn't seem very concerning but obviously is indicative of something. The person who gave me the cat included an antibiotic that was out of date. I'm not really a fan of drugs on humans or animals so I am reluctant to purchase more and plan on taking care of her with good food, activity, rest and plenty of water.\n\nB. Question\n\nI'm not near a vet for at least 16 hours and I am wondering if it is safe to continue feeding her water with a straw/container. I'm also wondering if 2% cow milk may help? What safe action can be taken? She doesn't seem like she's in terrible shape (ex. NO puking or drooling or moaning/crying or discombobulation) but she's obviously suffering and is very lethargic. Her right eye is specifically affected as she is attempting to clean it by wetting the limb above her paw and rubbing it from time to time. She does seem to be a little unsettled as in she is changing positions a little more often than she normally does.   \n\n\nC. Timeline\n\nLong Timeline  \n\\- Day 1: Evening 8PM. During the bath she was not that uncomfortable but did not enjoy the experience and was glad to be dried off. \n\n  \n\\-She began licking herself and shortly after, about 15-20 minutes following the bath she was visibly \"low energy\". \n\n  \n\\- I researched quickly and discovered essential oils can harm and be toxic to a cat.\n\n  \n\\- I noted she DID NOT exhibit any difficulties walking, jumping, moving around and still does not almost 24hrs later. Though she is slow to move but has demonstrated she is capable of moving fast if she wants/needs to. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- She had a normal bowl movement about 40 minutes after the bath, it was about time for her to have one judging by her schedule. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- About 20-30 minutes following the bowl movement she began to hide under the bed as she does from time to time (if someone makes a loud noise in the house).  \n\n\n\\- I called her out from under the bed but she would return back under the bed shortly after.  \n\n\n\\- Day 2 At about 6AM in the morning after the towels had been washed and dried I decided to wash her again in the sink with warm water thoroughly to rinse any residue off of her coat. She responded about the same, not pleased with the experience and trying to leave but not freaking out. A little meow-crying.  \n\n\n\\- I rested with her on the bed and noticed about 4-5 hours following the wash around 1PM she was not opening her eyes normally. Specifically the right one. She would open them at moments but appeared very tired. She would lick her paw and try to brush her right eye at times. I used a tissue and water to wipe her eyelid and around her eye gently.  \n\n\n\\- Day 2 5PM: I gave her two small sips of water with a straw from a container. She has a bowl of water which she has not been drinking from since the bath. She also has canned salmon juice and her typical hard food in two separate containers which she smells and does not eat.  \n\n\n\\- 6PM: Following the water she seemed to be slightly more alert and moved around a bit more. May have been just chance timing.  \n\n\nD.

        "body": "Sodium hydroxide is used to control the pH. It’s used in very tiny amounts: the cleanser is tested during production, and if needed, sodium hydroxide is added to bring the product to the correct pH level. It isn’t necessarily used, but if there’s any chance that it might be, it has to be listed on the label by law. It’s very common and perfectly safe. If the US version isn’t using that, it’s using some other alkali for the same purpose.\n\nYou can see that right next to sodium hydroxide is citric acid; that’s used for exactly the same purpose, but in the other direction — if the product turns out to be too alkaline during manufacture, citric acid will be added to bring it to the desired pH level. Again, common and safe. Those ingredients are very far down in the list, which means there’s very little of them in the bottle, because ingredients are always listed in order: there’s less of those pH adjusters than of ceramides, which make up a tiny proportion of the formula.",

The pure form of vitamin C is also a lot more irritating than its derivatives.

    "body": "Hey! So I read/skimmed through the guidebook in the highlighted section of the reddit page but I'm a tad confused on some things (terminologies and budget wise stuff).\n\nSo, I've been trying to get into caring for my hair a bit more. I have tried for the past 3-ish years (after a relaxer treatment I had) to keep my hair as healthy as possible. It's basically one of the only things that gives me a confidence boost. My hair is currently at waist length and I'm not quite sure if its \"healthy\". Over the years its been really difficult to care for or in general deal with and with its current length its been really overwhelming. I usually don't mind caring for it and I don't really want to cut it as its really important to me.\n\nand thus why I'm here! I'm currently on a budget but I have a few items already (I'm not sure how to use them or when and everywhere I go I get a different answer), I don't care much about the styling as much as I care about it being healthy (for example I have gone and box braided it multiple times before - my hair is 3A I'm pretty sure with varying types in a few spots like behind my ears and I think it can be classified as fine hair).\n\n  \nthe items I have currently are: (I'll include the ingredients since its not a popular brand worldwide)   \n\n\n\\- shampoo 1: Aqua, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Potassium Laureth-4 Carboxylate, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate, Polyquaternium-10, PEG-150 Distearate, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Parfum, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Coumarin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool.\n\n  \n\\- shampoo 2: Aqua, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Behenamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Lactic Acid, PPG-3 Caprylyl Ether, Hydrolyzed Pearl, Phenoxyethanol, Parfum, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Coumarin, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool.\n\n\n\n\\- hair mask: Aqua, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil (Almond Oil), Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil (Argan Oil), Glycerin, Pearl Powder, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Cetearyl Glucoside, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Sodium PCA, Proline, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Sodium Lactate, Sorbic Acid, Citric Acid, Parfum, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Coumarin, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool.\n\n  \n\\- Conditioner: Aqua, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, PPG-3 Caprylyl Ether, Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Pearl, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Cetearyl Glucoside, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Sodium PCA, Proline, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Sodium Lactate, Sorbic Acid, Citric Acid, Parfum, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Coumarin, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool.\n\n\n\n\\- Leave-in cream: Aqua, Cetyl Alcohol, Dioleoylethyl Hydroxyethylmonium Methosulfate, Stearyl Alcohol, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Parfum, Potassium Sorbate, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Hydroxycitronellal, Limonene.\n\n  \nit might be worth noting I do have a detangling spray but I rarely use it  \nI don't exactly have any oils as Ive never known how to use them unlike the hair mask (I usually put it on wet hair and let it sit for 30mins - an hour with a cap on)\n\n  \nI do have other shampoos like head and shoulders and dollar store shampoos ofc but I also have a \"final wash shampoo\" which I'm not too sure what to do with: Aqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Parfum, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Polyquaternium-10, Potassium Sorbate, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Coumarin, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool.\n\n  \nI don't exactly know what I need more let alone how to use what I already have. I do know I should get my ends trimmed soon but I want to try and keep as much of the length as possible/repair the hair. Please if anyone can help me figure out what to do or how to fix this please help.",

I react to a lot of fragrances and they have some very nice gentle to dry skin products. The toner you picked is one I have gone through a lot of bottles of since I moved to Germany.\n\nIt also looks like you’ve found a couple options I missed where they’re fragrance free, so uh, thanks.",

    "body": "Female, 29, 5'1\", 135lbs, white, currently taking a daily multivitamin, folic acid supplement, and probiotic supplement\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are trying to conceive after a few months of prep and working off of my anti-anxiety/anti-depression meds. Over the last few days, I've thought of some questions regarding the use of some OTC meds and topical skincare products. I left a message for my doctor with these questions a few days ago, but they are (understandably) overwhelmed, so I haven't heard back. Obviously this isn't an urgent issue, but I would like to get some input so I can plan accordingly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Allergy Meds. I used to take Allegra every day, but I stopped taking it when we began trying to conceive, as I know it is not safe. Unfortunately, my allergies have SKYROCKETED since I've stopped. It's been pretty miserable. I've taken benadryl at bed time, but it isn't much of an option during the day due to drowsiness. Are there any pregnancy-safe allergy medications that I can try?\n2. Pain management. I know that the only \"safe\" pain medication recommened during pregnancy is acetaminophen, so that is what I have been using to manage headaches or muscle soreness. Unfortunately, it's just not doing much to help. Are there any other pregnancy-safe medications that I can try instead? Or is tylenol my only option?\n3. Differin. This is a topical skincare treatment that I use for acne. The packaging says to ask your doctor before use during pregnancy. Is this safe to continue? The listed ingredients are -- Active ingredient: Adapalene 0.1% (retinoid) Inactive ingredients: carbomer 940, edetate disodium, methylparaben, poloxamer 182, propylene glycol, purified water and sodium hydroxide. May contain hydrochloric acid to adjust pH. \"\n4. AHA Exfoliation Pads. Another daily topical skincare treatment for acne. Not sure on this one, I just want to make sure it is safe. The listed ingredients are -- Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral \n5. Facial Cleanser. Same as above, used daily, just want to be sure it is safe to continue. Listed ingredients are --  Aqua / Water / Eau, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Peg-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, Niacinamide, Peg-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl, Taurate, Propylene Glycol, Ceramide Np, Ceramide Ap, Ceramide Eop, Carbomer, Methylparaben, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Disodium Edta, Propylparaben, Citric Acid, Tetrasodium Edta, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan Gum \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance for anyone who wants to help me figure this out. And big thanks to all the medical professionals that make this subreddit possible, it is a great resource!",
