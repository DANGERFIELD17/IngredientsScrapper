I've heard that there is a GoFundMe set up for her that is selling t-shirts, but I haven't looked for it. (My daughter wasn't on this bus and ahe didn't take this video.)",

Just call the resource officer. I looked up to give them their final warning. As I looked down a pencil hit the top of my head. Easily could’ve been my eye. I picked up the phone and asked for the resource officer then went to the rear of the class so the student’s backs were to me. I sat there quietly waiting. Finally both of those little shits tried giving me a look. The resource officer came in and I pointed at them and said, “They’re done. Take them away.” Which he did. When I returned to the front of the room I asked them if anyone else wanted to be escorted out. \nCould have heard a pin drop. \nThat was the last day I ever subbed. \nFuck those little bastards.",

Every single day, at least once, he will tell me that I stink and smell of b.o( body odour).\n\nWhen we met I showered every day, applied regular deodorant in the morning, brushed my teeth three times a day. Now I am so paranoid about smelling bad that I shower at least twice a day, I apply new industrial strength deodorant every few hours (I have a reminder on my phone), perfume, and I brush my teeth anytime I eat or drink something that isn’t water.\n\nI feel like I’m going crazy. I didn’t think I smelled bad in the beginning and I don’t think I smell bad now but I obviously smell bad to him right? Im that weirdo that keeps “sneakily” smelling their own armpits. I have been to the doctor and he has said there is nothing medically wrong. It has honestly gotten to the point where I literally shove my arm pit in friends and families faces asking if I smell bad, they all say I don’t smell like b.o. at all, one friend even said I smelled too clean like a lush store.\n\nI am getting so paranoid. He won’t cuddle or anything when he says I smell. I really don’t know what more I can do?\n\nUpdate - so unexpected edit. I waited for him to make a comment this morning so I could talk to him. It was less than an hour after waking up that he said “god you stink” I had already showered and put on deodorant. I snapped and asked what exactly was he smelling because, at this point I’m one of the cleanest people on the planet and if I still smell bad to him then we should just break up.\n\nHe got all panicked and upset, I eventually got out of him that this is what he father always said to his mother. Apparently his father told him that is was a sure fire technique to have a woman never leave you because “she will feel too low to cheat, will love only you, and will always be clean”.\n\nNeedless to say, his father is wrong. He’s packing his things and moving out of my house today\n\n#Reminder: I am not the Original OP.",

The look on everyones face when I say I'm working at Walmart....\n\nTo me work is work and you do whatever you have to do to support your family. I haven't worked retail since the 90s . Back then I did a lot of shitty jobs like magazine sales, door to door cookware sales, door to door long distance phone service  sales, sold knock off perfume in parking lots. I've been working since I was 14 in 1993 with the exception of 9 months laid off in 2013.\n\nI got laid off in March and am on unemployment. I've made massive lifestyle changes and the only debt I have is student loan and mortgage with escrow. I am still $2k short a month with unemployment and it's coming out of my very limited savings. I am working part time as to still get my unemployment and have time to look for a job. I will make an extra $322/week working at Walmart. After taxes that will almost cover food for the month and will lower what I'm taking from savings. \n\nI've been a single parent for over 20 years. I have 2 kids at home that I'm fully supporting. I can't just sit here applying for jobs with no one calling me and just hope, I'd rather just figure shit out in the mean time n do what I gotta do. Ive already been through my network, nothing. I'm tapping into other people's networks, still nothing.\n\nI have a MBA and 24 years in my field. Ironically I just finished my first 2 days at Walmart and I got 2 interview requests (after deleting 14 years of experience fr9m ny resume). I'm super happy about it. I've applied to 200 jobs since January (got WARN notice) and i had 1 legit interview.\n\nDon't be too good to hustle n do what you have to do, whatever that may be. Yes all the negativity made me cry and made me want to just blow off my first day but I put my big girl panties on, said fuck the haters and went to work.\n\nI have to give my one friend/former coworker props because her immediate reaction was \" I'm so proud of you!\" I used to be her manager. She is the only person in my life that didn't make me feel like a POS. I'm not ashamed I'm working at Walmart so I'm going to keep telling people.\n\nThat is all.\n\n****ETA I'm a woman, mom****",

Cologne is more diluted with alcohol and evaporates faster, releasing scent quicker and lasting less time.\n\nWhere you put the scent on your body also affects how fast it burns off. Basically, warms spots on your body like your wrists or neck are hot and are usually where you'd put perfume due to its lower alcohol %, which causes it to burn off slower. If you put cologne there, it will evaporate VERY quickly, and put out a crazy strong scent over a short period of time.

I started a new office job 3 months ago, and everything was fine until (let's call her) \"Karen\" started her crusade against Max -> This isn’t Max, but here’s an idea of how [he’d look](https://www.gentube.app/create-together?showCreate=1&setPrompts=See%20Max%20on%20duty.,%20See%20Max%20running%20and%20playing.&_cid=ja,r,dog&autoCreate=1&imageId=jn7fn0g94ebs6aqr3zg8b56k4n73gvcn&_cid=ja,r,dogs2) on the job.\n\nIt started small. She'd loudly announce \"pets aren't allowed in the office\" every time she saw us. I explained repeatedly that Max is a service dog, not a pet, and showed her his documentation. She then started telling everyone I was \"obviously faking\" because I \"look too young to be disabled.\"\n\nThings escalated fast. She'd try to \"test\" Max by dropping food near him (he's trained to ignore it). She reported me to HR weekly. But the worst part? She started purposely wearing strong perfume and spraying air freshener around my desk, which triggers my condition. Max alerted 3 times in one day because of this.\n\nThe final straw? I found out she was taking photos of me and Max and posting them in a Facebook group about \"fake service dogs,\" asking for ways to \"expose\" me. She included my full name and workplace.\n\nI took screenshots and went to HR. They fired her on the spot for harassment and creating a hostile work environment. Now my inbox is flooded with messages from her friends and family saying I'm TA for \"getting a mother of 3 fired over a dog\" and that I \"should have just worked from home if I'm so sick.\"\n\nHere's the thing - I actually feel horrible that she lost her job. Her kids aren't at fault here. But she literally put my life at risk with the perfume stunts, and doxxing me online was scary.",

Now I am so paranoid about smelling bad that I shower at least twice a day, I apply new industrial strength deodorant every few hours (I have a reminder on my phone), perfume,  and I brush my teeth anytime I eat or drink something that isn’t water. \n\nI feel like I’m going crazy. I didn’t think I smelled bad in the beginning and I don’t think I smell bad now but I obviously smell bad to him right? Im that weirdo that keeps “sneakily” smelling their own armpits. I have been to the doctor and he has said there is nothing medically wrong. It has honestly gotten to the point where I literally shove my arm pit in friends and families faces asking if I smell bad, they all say I don’t smell like b.o. at all, one friend even said I smelled too clean like a lush store. \n\nI am getting so paranoid. He won’t cuddle or anything when he says I smell. I really don’t know what more I can do?\n\nUpdate  - so unexpected edit. I waited for him to make a comment this morning so I could talk to him. It was less than an hour after waking up that he said “god you stink” I had already showered and put on deodorant. \nI snapped and asked what exactly was he smelling because, at this point I’m one of the cleanest people on the planet and if I still smell bad to him then we should just break up. \n\nHe got all  panicked and upset, I eventually got out of him that this is what he father always said to his mother. Apparently his father told him that is was a sure fire technique to have a woman never leave you because “she will feel too low to cheat, will love only you, and will always be clean”.\n\nNeedless to say, his father is wrong. He’s packing his things and moving out of my house today.",

The mysteries of human attraction are that smell is hugely important to compatibility, it tells your partner whether you fit together in ways we can't start to understand, pheromones, immunity, whatever. It might just be that chemically you aren't a match, in spite of looks, personalities, senses of humour, sex drive, your body smells like it doesn't suit his body, so if you smell of *anything* apart from artificial chemicals he doesn't like it. I love the way my wife smells, she says I never smell bad, even when I can smell myself. That to me is a chemistry that works. By contrast my brother went out with a girl at university, she was really sharp, funny, great looking and so into my brother. He broke up with her and when, incredulously I asked why, he shamefacedly said that in the morning she smelt like our mum. I understood. You can't have your girlfriend smell like mum.

I hope now that he’s aware of what he did, and how very WRONG it is, he gets some help. He probably needs therapy of some kind after growing up with that kind of an example of marriage. As for you, OP, you dodged a damn bullet. Imagine twenty years down the line, the other manipulative and abusive tactics he would have used thinking it was okay because that’s what his father did. I encourage you to talk to someone, there may have been other things he had done that effected your self worth or actions that you just don’t realize yet. I applaud you for splitting with him! You don’t need that trash, and if you want to stay in a relationship it is going to be because there is mutual respect and love, not because you feel as though no one else will love you.

I personally recommend a body scent like perfume or cologne (or even a new deodorant) over an object like a scented candle so that you can take the scent with you wherever you go in your travels, rather than only being able to smell it in your hotel room.",

We both lived with our parents so it was going to be our first real multi-day alone time with each other.  We were going to hike, and camp, and bike and of course that's what we told our families.  What we were actually planning to do was spend entire days having loud uninhibited sex in a tent out in the mountains far from civilization till we were both too sore to walk.  We were in love, and passionate about each other, and this cemented our bond powerfully.\n\nIt... it was a wonderful trip. She had just bought a vanilla-scented perfume that she wore every day of the trip and it was just heavenly.  I would purposely let her walk in front of me just to breathe it in. Fall was just starting  and the leaves were red and brown and green and purple and every shade in between.  We had the mountains completely to ourselves, we didn't see another person the entire time.  Each night the temperature would drop and every single star in the universe would seem to come out.  Inside our tent, we'd snuggle naked in our 2 person sleeping bag, comfortably warm and spooning, the scent of her vanilla perfume wafting off her neck and lulling me  into the deepest most peaceful sleep I may possibly ever have in my life.\n\nTime passed and we broke up. No, not mutual, she broke up with me, and I was devastated. Years it took to get over her.\n\nTo this day the smell of vanilla stirs up a mix of love, and lust, and heartbreak in me.  Sometimes it floods me with wonderful memories, other times it puts me in a sad melancholy that I can't break out of for days.\n\nScents should come with a warning: 'Effects can be powerful and last a lifetime. Use with caution.\"",

Smoke is not \"a smell\" but particles and it's harder to remove \"solids\" from something than actual gasses. This example is therefore not so good. You can smell these solids also if they reside on other furniture for instance - this won't happen to gases (following text).\n\n Rotting food contains very highly concentrated bacterial gaseous products so it takes more substance (air) to dilute them but it's not really *stinking more*. Think of a fart (Eli5 right?): Stinks extremely but vanishes very fast because it's mainly composed of sulfur gasses and not very highly concentrated (and by the way is also a bacterial gaseous product from your guts)\n\nAnother counterargument is the [flower common lilac](https://www.gardenia.net/plant-variety/syringa-vulgaris-common-lilac). Also good smelling but too much of it and it will last for several days in your flat, especially in times of blooming.\n\nEverything is a matter of concentration",

        "body": "There’s a few reasons behind this. A lot of other commentators have stated that it’s often due to humans having an evolutionary advantage to detecting bad (see: indicate danger) odours, but this manifests in several ways:\n1. We detect bad odours with much greater sensitivity. H2S, an odorant that is representative of bad food, can be detected by humans in the parts-per-billion or even parts-per-trillion range.\n2. Because they are dangerous odorants, our nose’s physiology means we are less likely to “adapt” to the odour than other odours. Your sense of smell constantly adapts to odours so that they don’t overwhelm you, but bad odours are hardwired to adapt slower.\n3. Once a signal about an odour reaches the brain, the brain chooses to either “habituate” to the odour, or not. And because of the advantage, you guessed it, the brain usually does not make you habituate to a bad odour (that is until you have multiple exposures that have been positive experiences for you).\n\nThat being said, I’ve seen other commentators say that bad smells and “good” smells last about the same time. That’s not true. Depending on the heaviness, size, shape, and volatility of the odour chemical, you get different effects. Some odours can be “sticky” thanks to their shape and linger around, meanwhile others dissipate quickly. As an example, a bad or “warning” odour is the smell of ozone. It’s distinct and our brain is hardwired to be concerned. However, ozone tends to dissipate far faster than the (arguably) less dangerous H2S, and so you smell it for less time. If you want a nicer example of how odours spread, but or grow yourself some jonquil daffodils. Jonquils have a very powerful odour, but the chemical is very dense, so in a fairly big room you may smell it intensely close to the flower, or not at all at another side of the room. Compare that to an aerosolised odour which is designed to spread around- you’ll experience that odour at roughly the same intensity within the room.\n\nI could go into stuff like how you haven’t habituated to certain odours because of environmental experience, or how certain odorants constantly degrade into different odorants and thus perpetuate further smells, but I hope these general concepts help 😀.",

My kitchen will smell like bacon for a day or so after cooking some because of bacon grease settling on surfaces, and that is an amazing smell. My scrap for compost container smells terrible, so it is kept sealed. At times it has not been sealed, so I have walked into the kitchen to a terrible odor. Reseal it, and minutes later the smell is gone, because their isn't anything out in the open continually releasing odors.  \n\n\nAs many others have written, you may have the impression that the bad smells linger longer, because we focus on negative stimuli more than neutral or positive.

    "body": "Throwaway account for anonymity.\n\nI (31F) married my soon to be ex-husband (M33) in 2018.  My in-laws never liked me and made it clear.  STBX insisted that they're just putting up a tough exterior and they'll grow to love me.  \n\nTo show how evil they are, one time I joined them for dinner and brought a cake I'd made (because I was always raised to be a gracious guest).  When I stepped into the kitchen and offered the cake to his mother as a thank you for inviting me, she took the plate over to the garbage bin, dumped it in, and handed me the plate back.  When I told my husband what she did, he confronted her and all of a sudden the crocodile tears started and she claimed she grabbed the plate but didn't get a good grip, I let go to quickly, and it fell to the floor, so of course it had to be thrown away.  My SIL \"confirmed\" that was what happened.\n\nMy STBX owned his own business and they called me a gold-digger behind his back.  Of course they insisted on a pre-nup, which I didn't care about because I never thought my marriage would end and it would appease them and may allow them to finally treat me kindly. Nope.  His business failed once covid hit.  We went through his savings and my own trying to keep it afloat.  I refused to go into debt to keep it going, so he closed it down.\n\nIn 2022, he was suffering from really bad depression because he lost his business and couldn't find new work.  He suggested we move to his hometown, closer to his family, so he had a larger support network.  Against my best judgement we did.\n\nHe wanted to only work part time while he tried to restart his business, so I became the main breadwinner.  And as with most wives, I became the person in charge of buying gifts.  Stupid ol' me thought buying them thoughtful, expensive gifts would finally make them see I wanted to be accepted by them.  Gifts to us were a \"couples gift\" but clearly for my STBX only.\n\nEvery holiday was spent with them.  Monthly dinners with the whole family.  After a year, I realised that if I ever tried to talk or join a conversation, everyone would go quiet, so I just stopped talking when I visited.\n\nIn early December they finalized plans for Christmas.  A few days later my STBX said his family decided they didn't want me to join them for Christmas Eve Dinner and Christmas Lunch because I ruin the family vibe.  I replied, \"Fine, we'll do our own thing instead.\"  My STBX sheepishly looked away and said he was still going to go.\n\nI was livid and so disappointed in him.  That was the moment I knew my marriage was over.\n\nSo I returned the presents I had bought for his family.  In their place, I got one pair of novelty business socks for FIL, a supermarket brand bottle of shampoo for MIL, the nastiest perfume I could find at the dollar store for SIL.  The most expensive gift was a large rawhide bone for BIL and his wife's chihuahua (too big for it to get its jaw around, rendering it useless).  \n\nI saved about $600 to put on a deposit for a new apartment.\n\nMy husband come home from Christmas lunch telling me I humiliated him and embarrassed him in front of his family.  I asked him why would he think I'd buy nice gifts for people who clearly don't like me and don't want me around?\n\nServed divorce papers last week.  Remember how he was supposed to be a millionaire by now so we had that pre-nup?  STBX is not eligible for any of my savings (it was required to keep separate accounts) or alimony.  He doesn't have money for rent and auto insurance.  Not my problem anymore.\n\nSome of my friends and family and on my side and proud that I went out in a blaze of glory.  Others are telling me I was being way too petty, which isn't really like me.  So, AITA?",

Hr offered to buy me a coffee I thought wtf why NOT!  It turned out he had just gone through a nasty divorce and wanted a little fun. \n\nWe talked for HOURS!

I found out he had custody of his ONE YEAR OLD GIRL .  \n\nWe shut the restaurant down,  so he invited me to his place for more coffee I thought what the heck why not I was single for the first time in my adult life! We talked on his front porch until 3 am 😆♥️ when he realized he had to be at  work at 6am! \n\nAlmost 13 years later our neither of us is looking for anything serious has turned into the best thing either of us ever did. \n\nWe got a double rainbow on our wedding day.

I have over 400 bottles at this point, I take great pride in my collection, and I use it. I’m also happy to give people decants (samples) of most of my bottles, let them sample a spray or two, give some bottles as gifts, etc. \n\nWhat I have a HUGE fucking issue with is my 17 year old niece coming into my home under the guise of walking my dog, decanting bottles on her own and SELLING THE SAMPLES to her little friends. She thinks that because I have so many bottles, I wouldn’t notice some missing or getting massive dents in them. Well little miss entrepreneur failed to realize that her “private” Instagram wasn’t “friends only” or whatever and I saw each and every fucking story with each price and sample she had.\n\nI tallied that shit up and got a pretty good estimate based on cost per ounce. Thankfully she mostly picked the “Tiktok famous” perfumes like Bianco Latte and Escapade Gourmand and didn’t go for the most rare, niche perfumes. She did snatch an entire 2.5 oz bottle of Baccarat Rouge, though, which runs $300+ at most retailers, as well as full bottles of perfumes you can get at Sephora. Like Marc Jacobs Daisy, Burberry Her Elixir, Flowerbomb, etc. \n\nPetty or not, I printed out the entire list of what she’d taken, price estimate, and handed it off to my sister (her mom). I said that I expect to be paid back, in full. And of course her fucking sneaky little ass is never allowed in my home again. My sister got super pissy with me going on about how my niece is just a kid, kids make mistakes, etc. I said yes, kids make mistakes, and this is a GREAT way for my niece to learn from hers.\n\nTheir argument is that now the money she was going to use for a car has to go towards paying me back. I don’t care. She is lucky that I have no interest in involving the police, small claims, or any of that. But AITA, because she IS a teenager?",

But “reduce how much I gift them,” is absolutely enabling them and proving you don’t have any desire to inflict real consequences. The money your niece made from stealing from you more than covers her losing out on dogwalking. Oh no, she’ll feel it real hard in…. 5-6 months. \n\nYour sister isn’t willing to torpedo your relationship, because you’ve outright said you’re *not* going to torpedo it. Oh no, she might notice 5 years from now that you gave $5 less per kid for each holiday. But you still gave her money. You’re still giving gifts. You’re the one actively trying to placate her by continuing those gestures and asking for money. It’s essentially putting yourself more in the red in your relationship with them.\n\nYou say your sister is willing to ruin the relationship? Then call that bluff. Ruin it. Not reduction in gifts, not one child can’t come in the house unsupervised. No Contact Until You’re Paid. No gifts, no supervision. nothing. That is genuinely the bare minimum of consequences. Anything short of cutting off all cash flow into a family that stole from you is active permission from them to steal from you again in a thief’s eyes. Period. I’m not going to suggest you go to the cops, but seriously. Please be realistic about how you are TA to yourself if you’re just going to “skim a little bit off from future gifts” \nThat’s not recouping losses. They’re not owed gifts or payments, or anything, particularly after stealing. You are not getting money back by reducing gifts. You’re just hemorrhaging money to them a LITTLE less slowly, and leaving the door for the other children to learn from your mom and big sister that you can be their next payday too.",

You meet someone and if they smell good you automatically *think* that they have great hygiene ect. Also, who doesn't like to be arround good smelling ppl, right? \n\nSo, no matter how low of a self-esteem you have, go buy a nice and ***long smelling*** perfume and maybe that helps. Btw, I don't really think ppl are ugly, no matter how you look, there's still something about you that's attractive and handsome, but if you personally think that you are ugly (trust me I know how that feels), maybe try to boost yourself by being extra picky when it comes to your own hygiene/smell and maybe you will recieve some compliments\n (compliments about your smell is the best type of compliments, bc you can affect it, but you can't change your appearance)\n\n\nBtw, I'm not talking about any Pheromones, I'm talking about like a good Cologne or you know, a smell that makes you want to be arround that person. Also, I'm not saying that it's either smelling bad or smelling good, it's just most of the time ppl smell like nothing, dont worry, that's ok too ¯\\_༼ •́ ͜ʖ •̀ ༽_/¯",

But there's now been such an over saturation of sex being used to sell that it's everywhere.\n\nAdverts - those perfume adverts for one. Why the hell does a perfume require two half naked people in bed and the man smelling the pillow as the girl struts off? Another example, in the UK, an advert for being bikini body ready was removed from the Underground for being too sexy. It was on a massive wall on the station platform.\n\nTV - Too Hot to Handle is my bugbear for this one right now. A bunch of sexy adults being told not to have sex for a cash prize and acting like it's the worst thing in the world. Also, reality tv in general has become about sexiness. The Kardashians, for one.\n\nMusic - The sheer number of inappropriate music videos is scary, not to mention the performances on stage.\n\nThe extent of sexualisation is profound. So much so that I think we as a Western culture have become used to it. I have a friend from Sri Lanka. When he came to the UK, he said that there was so much sexualisation that he was initially overwhelmed and was looking for sex everywhere.\n\nI really hope that in the future, we realise that we've exploited ourselves and our youth. I hope there's time to change.\n\nEdit: Holy shit this blew up, and holy shit my first awards! Thanks Redditors!\n\nWow, this one is divisive. A couple of points.\n\n1. Yes, genocide, war, slavery are definitely worse then this. But as a modern Western generation, we did not perpetuate these things. I am speaking as someone who has seen a buildup of these factors.\n\n2. Calling me prude or boomer doesn't give an actual point.",

Holy fuck I’m running. \n\nThat Too Hot To Handle show sounds robustly stupid. I see a message from it saying that sex is something that no person, or even a “hot” person can or should live without. Imagine all the horrible messages that’s sending to teens who do nothing but compare themselves to others. And yes. It’s media. There’s nothing stopping curious teens from seeing this shit. \n\nUltimately, I see my sexuality as a personal aspect of my life which is to be kept between myself and my partners. I just don’t want to engage in casual sex related conversations with people. I don’t want to openly talk about sex to just anybody, I think that’s why I value it and love it in my life.

    "body": "\nI work at a boutique. We sell clothes and perfume and candles, that kind of stuff. So last week, we were rearranging racks for a sale and my boss tells me to move some pants around.\n\n I go over to this rack of culottes that NO ONE ever looks at because they’re ridiculous, I don’t even know why they’re on the floor during winter. I start flipping through them to see what sizes there are and I spot something small and brown on one of the pants. Sometimes we’ll put a rack of clothes on the sidewalk if the weather is nice, but that hasn’t been for at least a month. So I just think, damn truly no one looks at these pants, how has this leaf been on here so long. I look at it for maybe one second and just brush my hand at it— you know, to get this 𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘧  off. And immediately I know, THAT IS NOT A LEAF. \n\nSo naturally, I just start screaming. This thing falls on the floor and starts making tiny screechy noises. I bolt to the other side of the store at this point because that one episode of The Office absolutely terrified me. In the process, I knock over a mannequin and dent the crap out of the wood floor. There are a few customers in the store and one of them just keeps yelling WHAT’S GOING ON?! WHAT WHAT WHAT IS IT?! Our little old 70 year old customer sees this tiny winged rat on the floor and starts walking towards it, I still don’t understand what she wanted to do. So I’m yelling for her to move away because uhh RABIES, dude. \n\nThis bat just takes off, flying all over the place. Cue all the customers (except the 70 y/o) running in opposite directions, one knocking over a jewelry display and another taking down the curtain to a fitting room. I start yelling for my boss because this was not covered in my training. She comes running carrying two doormats. Looking back, I have no idea what she was planning to do with those. I grab a shoe box as if I’m somehow going to get high enough to catch it. \n\nThe bat finally flew to the back of the store and crawled into the gap above our air conditioning vent. All the customers but the 70 year old left, props to her. She actually said “I didn’t think I was gonna go on an adventure today.” That was pretty cute. Thankfully, the bat was caught and released the next day. But yeah, in hindsight, I really wish I’d taken the extra few seconds to register what I was looking at so I could’ve avoided sending everyone into a complete panic and breaking a bunch of stuff. And also avoided touching a bat, even if it was a little bit cute.\n\nTL;DR Touched what I thought was a leaf, ended up sending my workplace into a batshit crazy panic.\n\nEdit: HOLY CRAP. I did not expect this to be so popular. I literally posted this at 4 am because I saw a bat sweatshirt in a thrifting sub and I was like huh I bet Reddit would like to hear about that. Thanks for the awards!\n\nEdit 2: IM SORRY, I added some line breaks. Also I’m going to call my doctor about getting a rabies shot. Yikes!",

At that time I didn't know that the rabies thing with bats was a huge MYTH. I put on gloves and grabbed a towel and gently placed the bat in a box. I didn't know what to do, it was bleeding from it's wing but was alive. I searched around to see if anyone could help it; I ended up finding a lady who lived an hour from me who took care of bats in her home and worked with a society. She took the bat and gave me a little package full of info on bats. In there I read about all the miss information out there about bats. I love bats now! \n\nhttps://batworld.org/myths_facts_page/\n(All bats do not carry rabies.\nAll mammals can contract and carry rabies, however bats are not asymptomatic carriers of the disease. In reality, bats contract rabies far less than other animals. Less than 1/2 of 1% of all bats may contract the disease. A variety of wild animals (rabies vector species) can catch rabies, including foxes, skunks, raccoons, coyotes and bats. Cats and dogs and even livestock can also contract rabies.)\n\nAbout a day later I found out the little feller had to have his  wing amputated. He is now living his days in a sanctuary with other bats who can't be released into the wild. \n\nI hope this doesn't get drowned out and that as funny as this story is these little creatures are so misunderstood and are really beneficial to have around. No mosquitoes 😛\n\nEddit: spelling and added info.",

    "body": "\nI F26 been with my fiancè for 3 years. We both work and we both share rent and other expenses. But My fiancè is currently looking for a new job. He lost his old job 3 months ago. My family lives 30min away and although it's been difficult this year I decided to get my brother (who has a chronic condition and struggled a lot lately and was in the hospital for a few days for anemia) the one thing he's been wanting for some time. I got him an Xbox that cost me 300$. He was so happy and I'm glad I was able to cheer him up during those times.\n\nMy fiancè received a few gifts from his family. But he wasn't happy with any of them. I got him a perfume and he liked it.\n\nWe were visiting my family and we had dinner with them. My fiancè looked at the Xbox I got for my brother and didn't stop talking about it. My parents noticed, I told him to stop complaining about what he got/didn't get this year. That made them uncomfortable especially since they've been dealing with my brother's health issues and needed to relax.\n\nWe got home and my fiancè took something from the closet and left for about an hour.\n\nI was asleep when he came back. In the morning I was surprised to find my brother's Xbox in the closet. I woke him and asked him about it. Turned out He dropped me off drove back to my family's house and exchanged the gift his aunt gave him (a 14$ fancy pen) with my brother's xbox. He said that my brother was happy to exchange gifts. I was so mad I told him this wasn't for him and he basically took something that is not his. Not to mention a pen for an Xbox, that's ridiculous.\nHe told me that maybe I shouldn't have spent 300 while trying to pay for rent. I told him as long as I can pay rent that's not a problem. And that he needs to find a job if he thinks my money isn't enough. I called my mom and I found out that they didn't actually exchange gifts. My fiancè pressured my brother into giving him his Xbox. I was livid and so mad I told him to take the Xbox back to my brother but he said it was between him and my brother but I insisted. He refused so I ended up taking it myself. My fiancè argued when I took it and said that I was pressuring him and treating him poorly and have no respect for his feelings. I told him he was wrong to make my brother give him his gift and causing him stress and ruining his joy. I apologized to my brother and my parents and I felt awful because of how my fiancè behaved. My fiancè isn't talking to me saying that I have no consideration for his feelings and not understanding how he feels not having money to buy himself the things he likes.\n\nI'm surprised because he has never done anything like this before. I get that he's struggling with finding a job but this is not an excuse.",

They were used as diplomatic gifts or treasured as heirlooms, and many of them found their way into royal tombs or imperial collections, both in antiquity and later. Their rarity also encouraged imitations in both glass and pottery. \n\n[src](http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/257557)",

Last month my dad's wife got mad at my dad for keeping so many of mom's things or things that symbolized their marriage. He kept her engagement and wedding ring in a box, his own on a chain around his neck, my mom's postcard collection that she started as a kid, her favorite stuffy, a bottle of her perfume, her keychain, her passport holder, cooking and baking books she used to experiment with and a locket she wore all the time. My brother (20m) and I got her jewelry and other items she had. They were shared between us after mom died and they're at our aunts house for safe keeping.\n\nMy dad's wife said she wanted all that stuff gone and the wedding photos and any couple photos of them and any family photos had to be put away if mom was in them. But the rest had to go. My dad fought back for like a day and then they started throwing all the stuff in garbage bags and they were brought out to the trash. When they weren't looking I took all of it and brought it to my aunts to keep it safe.\n\nIt took two days for my dad's wife to realize the trash was empty and then she and my dad realized I had taken the stuff. My dad's wife went crazy and said they were in the trash for a reason. I told her I wasn't letting my mom's stuff go like that. She said it doesn't need to be in her house and I said it wasn't anymore and she wouldn't need to see it. She said it was nothing but bad memories and they didn't need to be in her and dad's marriage. I told her she didn't need to worry and they weren't dad's anymore. Dad told me to just give the stuff back to them and they'd deal with it and I refused. His wife said she wasn't allowing that kind of disrespect in her house and dad said it'd be dealt with.\n\nThey asked a few people if they had them and all said no. Including my brother (20m) who let them know he thought they were both disgusting and he didn't want to talk to them again. When that didn't work my dad tried to convince me again and he failed. He said I was making it worse. My dad's wife told me she's my stepmother and more deserving of respect. I said she'll never be my stepmother, she'll never be my family, she's just my dad's insecure second wife who'll never be good enough to be seen as family by me or my brother. I told her I'm not giving them back.\n\nShe tried to get the police involved and accused me of stealing but they brushed her off because I live in the house and took them from the trash so... she said I'm a thief and the most disrespectful kind there is. She asked was doing this worth hurting my relationship with them and I told her I didn't care about having a relationship with her to begin with. I told her she was nothing to me and to stop acting like she has some kind of real authority over me. I told her I was willing to accept whatever consequences they gave because I would be leaving asap and nothing she said or did would stop me. My dad stopped her from taking everything I own as leverage but he's still applying pressure.\n\nIt's been annoying to deal with but could be way worse. But I came here to find out from outside parties if they think I'm wrong for what I'm doing. AITA?",

They aren’t in their house or in their face. However this wasn’t about that it was always ever about her trying to take the place of your mum and erase that she ever was. That’s why she is going to the extent of trying to get the stuff back to destroy it. I’m so sorry and glad you at least have your brother. As a widow with kids myself what your dads done and allowed to be done is the worst betrayal and failure a parents could do.\n\n If it was me I’d be getting out that house asap and never seeing or talking to him again in my life. I’d be letting him know the moment your out, “not to worry he taught you how easy it was to throw family away and erase all trace of them from your life like they were rubbish. That you will be doing just that for him as you no longer have a father.

At first it’s good and we start communicating better.  \n\nAbout three months ago she starts going to extra sessions for “self care”. Alone.\n\nAround this time our couples sessions that happen with all three of us together (about three months ago) become much more one sided with me being the “bad guy” and the two of them kind of teaming up on me.\n\nShe starts telling her friends about “Danny” and how great he is for her “self care” but if her friends seem interested in making an appointment she says “he only does couples” or “he’s not taking new clients”which I think is weird because we have normally referred to him as “Dr. Soandso” and now he is suddenly “Danny”.  (I don’t know if he is actually not taking new clients.)\n\nAround the time they started teaming up on me in the sessions (about three months ago) was around the last time my wife and I were intimate.\n\nThere have been a couple of other weird coincidences that I thought were puzzling, but three nights ago my wife said she had an emergency with her sister and had to go see her right away.  She went to the bathroom and showered and put on perfume and left.  It was about 9;30 at night and that seemed REALLY odd to me.\n\nAbout a half hour later I tracked her iPhone and the location showed up as his office.\n\nWhen she came home 3 hours later, I asked how her sister was and she kind of gave a weird “oh you know Jenny, drama queen” kind of answer.\n\nI think I’m going to confront them in the session this Thursday.",

You're allowed to have your own accounts, you're just not allowed to lie about them in court. She still may be entitled to half, depending on where they live and other variables. Now if he  started spending it on frivolous things or giving the money away to drain their accounts out of spite or malice, then yea she could definitely sue him for her share. - [This was in response to a query as to the legality of putting aside some money. Also brought up by u/GBAPSDANN and u/Shirobon-] \n\nu/YourTherapistSays - Only that she lied about a session - not objective in the sense that they’re having an affair. \nWe obviously don’t have all the facts here - were individual sessions offered to OP as well? Is it possible OP is abusive and therapist is working with the spouse to create a safety plan for leaving? A stretch given the provided info but also not uncommon.

They were going to marriage counseling, but the psychiatrist was also treating the wife because she was having a hard time with it all. The psychiatrist put the wife on antidepressants, and then abruptly took her off them without weaning them down. So, no surprise, my mom's friend went off the deep end. The next thing you know, the divorce is going through and the psychiatrist is dating the husband. \n\nI wish there was a happy ending, but there is not. My mom's friend went after the psychiatrist legally, but never got anywhere. The husband is still with the psychiatrist. My mom's friend has 3 sons, so she has to deal with seeing that woman at every event in her kids' lives. Her ex husband's family is very large, and she has no other family but her mother. She's basically been pushed out of her own life. \n\nBe smart about how you confront them. I wouldn't do it until you have evidence. I would talk to a lawyer first too.",

I abided by the custody agreement because I had no choice in the matter. My mom loves us both but she dotes on my brother like he farts perfume. \n\nMy dad kept the house. He had to buy my mom out. It was an old house built in 1953. It had old wiring and was really less than suitable for modern life. What it did have though was a huge yard that was great growing up. \n\nMy dad passed away during COVID. He left everything equally between my brother and I. I wanted the house. I told my brother that we should tear it down and put in infill housing like that neighborhood is zoned for. He just wanted money. I bought out his half of the house at the market value. It was sold as a teardown. He took the money and bought a car and went on a vacation. He still has money left. \n\nThen I had the house demolished and built a fourplex. Each unit has three bedrooms, 2 and a half bathrooms, a small yard, and a garage. I kept one unit for myself  and rent each of the other units for $2,000 a month. My mortgage is $1,800 a month for the entire thing. So basically I live free and bank $4,000 a month. \n\nMy brother is pissed that I didn't give him a unit to live in for him since it was his home too. I actually offered to sell him one at cost and he said no. \n\nI'm lost. I offered him a partnership, I paid a fair price, I offered to sell him a unit, I did everything to try and be fair. He thinks I tricked him because I get \"free\" money every month. \n\nOur mom said she would be cutting me out of her will and giving everything to him if I didn't give him a unit or the income from one. I agreed that was fair and said that I would no longer feel the need to contribute to her upkeep or retirement when the time came. \n\nI am being bombarded by the two of them but I took the risks. I took on the debt. This is my money now. ",

Let me guess: when you were kids, he'd eat his treats quickly, then demand that you share yours with him. And your mother forced you to do it, because \"faaaamily\".  \n  \n\n\nYou both got equal shares of the house. There was no trick. Your brother wanted the money and he got it. He wanted to spend it on a car and a vacation, and that's what he did. Meanwhile you chose to invest it (and probably a boatload more of your own money + labor) into something that could generate value in the long term. He didn't invest a cent into that, nor lifted a finger to contribute, yet he feels entitled to the benefits?  This isn't \"free\" money, it's the profit from your investment, risk and hard work.  \n\n\n\n\nYour answer to him and to your mother (who is enabling this shitty behavior) was perfect. Stick to those boundaries. And do not, under any circumstances, let either of them move into one of your units. They won't pay rent and you won't be able to get them out.  \n\n\n\n\nEdited to add: you should expect your mother to leave everything to your brother regardless of what you do. Keep that in mind when deciding whether and how much to contribute to her upkeep. Ask yourself this: if she has an inheritance to leave, why does she need you to support her? Is it because she's already giving her money to her Golden Child?",

It had terrible fuel economy, it was so bad that it wasn't acceptable even during the days of cheap gas and V8s in every driveway.  Sure you could fuel it on perfume or olive oil or tequila, but the cheapest thing you could put in it was gas, and it was expensive to do that.  \n2. The jet engine accelerated extremely slowly, so even though it had a lot of power on paper, the car wasn't terribly fast.  \n3.  The car put out a lot of bad exhaust fumes.  It burned lots of gas, so it put out a lot of CO2.  Because it burned very hot, it also put out nastier stuff like NOx compounds.  There is no way this kind of car would have passed muster as emission standards started up.",

    "body": "I (27M) live alone. My brother (21M) and his girlfriend (19F) still live with our parents as they can't afford a place of their own. His gf is currently pregnant with him in 4 months.\n\nMy brother asked to bring his girlfriend for dinner in order to catch up and I said sure, why not. However the moment she entered my house she started complaining about the smell of the steak I was making and said just the smell alone makes her nauseous and she can't eat this. I tried to suggest an alternative, but she was dead set on Chinese food and ended up sending my brother to the nearest mall in order to get her some. I thought that would be the end of it, but after going to the bathroom and coming back, I caught her throwing my unfinished steak into the garbage. I asked her what the hell she was doing and said the smell was so strong she thought she'd end up throwing up on the floor and she needed to get rid of it and then started spraying a perfume from her purse in my kitchen. I was beyond furious at this point and sent her back to the living room and after my brother came back from the mall, I kicked both of them out with their Chinese food.\n\nMy brother tried to convince me to let them back and that I could make something else for the two of us and his gf was pretty much sobbing at this point, but I was dead set on kicking them both out. However my parents ended up being mad at me for apparently causing so much distress to my brother's pregnant gf. I told them that she literally threw away our dinner, but they said that I shouldn't have yelled at her or kicked them out as she's still just a teenager who's now getting influenced by her pregnancy hormones and that my outburst also caused problems in their relationship as she ended up sending my brother to sleep on the couch that night (even tho he literally defended her as well against me, so I have no clue how this is my fault).\n\nAITA for apparently not having enough tact to deal with a pregnant teenager ?\n\nEdit: Spelling.",

Then it seemed over time the amount of cigarette smoke I had to smell on a given day became less and less (obviously also tied with the indoor bans). Things were great for years. Every once in a while you'd get a whiff of a cigarette but it wasn't everywhere.\n\nNow here we are, and it feels like I can't go to any public gathering place without smelling weed.\n\nAt the park? Weed.\n\nAt the beach? Weed.\n\nGoing to an outdoor music event? Weed.\n\nIt's disgusting and annoying, and frankly I'm sick of it. I hope all you potheads are happy that you are ruining the public spaces by making them more trashy.\n\nEDIT:\n\n1. I don't care if people are smoking weed in their homes, or off to the side somewhere.\n\n2. I don't live in NYC. I clearly stated that.\n\n3. Just because I don't mention a million other bad smells doesn't mean I don't think they aren't also bad. I also don't think weed is the WORST smell out there.\n\n4. Just because there are other bad things in the world, doesn't mean it's wrong to be annoyed by lesser things.\n\n5. I never said I was \"mad\". Honestly some people's reactions to this post are much more aggressive to me than I actually care about the topic.\n\n6. I don't care enough to go and \"confront\" people. In my experiences I just walk to another spot. I never said \"my day was ruined\".\n\n7. People who think perfume/body spray is the ultimate \"gotcha\", I don't wear any. I hate them even more than weed, because I get an instant headache if a person's perfume is too strong.",

I laughed because I didn’t think he was being serious but he told me he was. I said yes and he asked how many times.\n\nI told him idk. Sometimes once. Maybe none. \n\nHe said he’s concerned because I don’t poop at our house and that it’s not healthy. He wanted me to see a doctor. \n\nI told him I poop at home all the time. Sometimes with him in the next room. \n\nHe said (and I quote) “you’re lying because I’ll go in right after you and it doesn’t smell and there isn’t even a skid mark.”\n\nI am losing it at this point, trying to stop myself laughing. I reminded him I haven’t had a gall bladder since I was 14. I told him I was so self conscious pooping at school I learned tricks to not make it as bad. I would put down toilet paper to help reduce the chance of a skid mark and even spray perfume (now I just use poo pourri). \n\nThat night I didn’t do anything to cover up the smell and he said he was sorry he just got concerned, but it was still sweet and no doubt uncomfortable for him to being it up. \n\nToday I got a text from him. \n\n*the skid mark trick works.

    "body": "This happened earlier today.\n\nA quick horror story for background:\n\nI got a vasectomy a few years back. They doped me with valium then asked if a female student doctor could watch the procedure. To me doctors are genderless/asexual so I didn’t care. The problem was, the doctor doing the procedure had never done it before. They had somebody showing them the ropes.\n\nLong story short I heard a lot of things like “No, that’s not it…no, not that either…it’s behind that…”. Eventually I heard “No, that was the artery…ok, now get some sponges…ok more sponges. Nurse! We are going to need more gauss…wow that is a lot of blood…”.\n\nThey burnt and burnt and burnt my balls trying to stop the bleeding. The whole room smelled of roasted scrotum. On a side note, a man should never know what his burning scrotum smells like. It is unforgettable. Strangely, it smelled exactly what you would expect it to smell like. I had cleaned it obsessively, but when cooked it released a very strong ‘parfum de scrotum’ mixed with rancid bacon. Anyway, they called in a third doctor to come and stop the bloodbath and fix me up.\n\nBack to present day three years later:\n\nI have a hard lump where I was abused in the botched vasectomy. I manned up and got my doctor to check it and she sent me off for an ultrasound, just in case.\n\nI turn up at the ultrasound place, wearing a mask like a civilized human being. I get called in and make polite chitchat with the female radiographer. She looks at my chart, pauses and asks “Are you OK with me doing this?”.\n\nI am duly confused, I say “It is your job isn’t it?”. I guess she wondered if I wanted a man to do it, but I really didn’t care. She gives me an odd look and shrugs and we continue.\n\nI disrobe, holding my tool out of the way, I expose myself. Then she says “So, how are Renee and Ellie?” asking after my wife and child by name. I look over and her mask has fallen down a bit and I realise it is my good friend’s wife. By this stage, it’s a bit late to change my mind or to offer for her to get some other person to do this. She puts the ice-cold lube on my junk and starts going to town trying to find the lump, apparently sometimes they can move. She was very professional and…thorough.\n\nBecause you are going to ask, no I did not bar up. In fact, the cold, awkwardness and stress had quite the opposite effect. I could swear I have never seem him retreat like that. One can’t exactly begin fluffing it during the procedure. I think I would have preferred a boner. FML.\n\nMaking chitchat with my friend’s wife exploring my lubed balls while I held my temporarily micro-penis out the way is not something I wish to do again.\n\nWe finish up, but the horror does not end there. She is doing stuff on the ultrasound machine, saving photos etc I think. Meanwhile, my bits are drowned in lube. I stand there going to town on myself with paper towel, having to ask her to pass me more and more as I try to regain some dignity. I still left with a slippery taint but didn’t want to spend any longer doing that than the eternity I had already done so.\n\nI’m not the sort to be overly haunted by this and I am certain she is not either, but the horrified reactions I got from this story earlier show that many people feel otherwise. You know the funny thing is, I just had a heart ultrasound and it was a different mate's wife that did that.\n\nSo, that was my day. How was yours?\n\nTL:DR - Had a botched vasectomy. Had a lump. Got lump on balls scanned by a radiologist. Did not recognise she was my good friend's wife until it was too late. Lube, fondling, micro-penis and shame ensued.\n\n<edit for PSAs>\n\n- Gents, check your balls, now, before you forget. If I can cowboy up and have this done, you can get a stranger to do it if you notice anything.\n\n- I posted this on the day it happened, so will be a few days until I hear anything back. Thanks to those asking if I am ok. I assume it is just scar tissue or something from the messy op. Always smart to check though.\n\n- For everybody going off the idea of a vasectomy, I had a terrible one and it still didn't hurt and it was still effective. Even the near-worse case scenario is not that bad. I had to get painkilling redone 8 times, so had 8 semi-numbed injections. It was not that bad.\n\n- Regarding losing sleep over this at 3am. It is only my typos in this post that will keep me awake at night. Rest assured that I loath myself.\n\n- Regarding suing, no harm was done. At least that I am aware of. It was messy and did not go to plan, but got the end result. You can't sue for something being gross and unsettling.",

The other side took forever, so long in fact that the anesthetic started to wear off. I told the doctor that I was feeling it and he said he was almost done, but it got worse until I shouted that he had to stop. He gave me another shot in the balls and kept going. Then it wore off again, and I had to get yet another shot. Finally he finished and showed me up. He never said anything about the operation or why it took so long. \n\n15 years later my wife wanted more kids, and convinced me to get the vasectomy reversed. During the reversal operation the left side went really fast like before, but the right took a really long time and I told the doctor that this is exactly what happened before and they had to give me additional shots of painkillers. He asked me if I had any childhood surgeries, and I told him that I had a hernia operation as a baby but did not remember it. He told me I didn't have an intact vas deferens in my right testicle, it was calcified and not cut and burned like the other one. He said they likely damaged it during the hernia operation, and that my first vasectomy doc couldn't find it and was just hunting around in there.",

I went without breakfast and hurried out to the car, just to realize that I locked the house with both house and car keys inside. I had to break a window to get my keys. Then, driving a little too fast, I got a speeding ticket.\nLater, about three blocks from the store, I had a flat tire. When I got to the store there was a bunch of people waiting for me to open up. I opened and started waiting on these people, and all the time the darn phone was ringing off the hook.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Then I had to break a roll of nickels against the cash register drawer to make change, and they spilled all over the floor. I got down on my hands and knees to pick up the nickels; the phone was still ringing. When I came up I cracked my head on the open cash drawer, which made me stagger back against a showcase with bunch of perfume bottles on it...all of them hit the floor and broke.\nMeanwhile, the phone is still ringing with no let up, and I finally got to answer it.\n\nIt was your wife. She wanted to know how to use a rectal thermometer...and, honest mister, all I did was tell her!",

I believe in taking care of myself, and a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack, I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a water activated gel cleanser. Then a honey almond body scrub. And on the face, an exfoliating gel scrub. Then apply an herb mint facial mask, which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion. There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me. Only an entity, something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our life styles are probably comparable, I simply am not there.",

She likes to talk during breakfast, I prefer reading the news on my phone, looking at twitter or scrolling through reddit. She likes to cook breakfast and make different stuff, I'm happy with coffee and some cookies. She wakes up and immediately turns on the lights, I do everything in the dark most of the time. Her alarm is loud and has scared the fuck out of me many times, my alarm is a sound of birds in a beach. Her phone is always with sound, mine is always on vibration. She never looks at her phone, I always have it near me or in my hand.\n\nBut if she wakes up at 8am and I'm cuddling her, she'll stay in bed for hours with me so I can sleep a little longer. She makes sure to not to make any loud sounds or turn on lights if I'm sleeping there. She makes me breakfast and doesn't talk to me until I've eaten and read my morning news. She's changed her alarm so that it is not that loud and I don't wake up in shock. She understands my morning routing is being an antisocial sloth, and she loves me despite being so different from me. And I return the favour by adapting my habits so that I don't disturb her when she goes to sleep at 10pm and I stay up until 1am.\n\nShe's amazing and I'm really in love with her.",

She begged even said would clean the whole house because it would be June before she’s would be home again and we simply texted no. She didn’t reply \n\nShe left this morning and we got multiple texts for my in laws belittling us for using our child as a cash grab, my husband simply replied it was our rules and no one deserves special treatment than told his family they were on a time out and blocked them\n\nSince than my family and our friends have told us we were wrong because she is a broke collage student and they would have understood if we looked the other way once.

He agrees so she shows up with her boyfriend, goodbye middle seat ☹️\n\nOk, I'm not entitled to an empty middle seat, so no big deal.

They found one of Thea's special compression bras. Thea has been doing theater ever since she was little. The compression bra looks like a tank top and she uses it if she is playing a boy or a young girl and has to flatten her chest to better look the part.\n\nTheir mom found it and threw it away.\n\nWe didn't realize this until Thea was packing her theater bag for play practice and realized it was missing. This is not great because she's starring as Viola in her school's production of \"Twelfth Night.\"   \n\nThea buys most of her theater stuff like makeup and costumes and the bra was pretty expensive, $50. \n\nI told my sister she needed to pay us back so we can replace it.  My sister refuses because she says she isn't doing well financially and how dare I demand a homeless woman pay for her boys being boys. Not to mention, she doesn't think it's appropriate for her to have something like that.\n\nOur mom, who has always been soft on Judy, thinks we're being too harsh since she's a single mom who doesn't have a home right now.  I just want my daughter's stuff replaced, is that too much to ask? AITA?\n\nEdit: To answer some frequently asked questions:\n\n-Why won't my mom take them in? She lives in a retirement community that doesn't allow anyone under the age of 65. I'm not sure if temporary stays are ok, but if she let them live with her then she runs the risk of getting evicted.\n\n-I don't know how much damage was done to the bra itself. Thea's room was pretty trashed. We're talking clothes left on the floor, spilled perfume, and messing with a display shelf full of some of her old Disney dolls. \n\n-All I know is that Judy saw the boys messing with the bra, thought it was another kind of breast binder, and threw it away. \n\n-We got locks installed for Thea's room, along with our son and my husband's \"man cave\" after we found out the boys messed with his stuff.\n\n-Why did I let them in? I've hosted other family and friends during previous hurricanes and never ran into this problem, maybe someone's kids got into Thea's costumes but no harm no foul. I've always been raised to help others, especially family, in their time of need, but this has me wanting to set up boundaries now. \n\n-Judy and her kids are going to have to find a new place to stay. I'm just waiting for my hubby to come home from work. We may need one of his friends for backup just in case.\n\nEdit 2: \n-I can't believe I forgot this. The boys are 8 and 6. ",

They invade your daughter's room, take her stuff, complain about your parenting and then pull a sob story. If you are in a bad place and dependent on someone else's charity, then don't abuse their hospitality. You won't get the bra or money back so please make your daughter's loss good as it was your choice not her's to offer hospitability.

    "body": "I became a renter for the first time in my mid 30's, pretty late in life.  Before that, I'd been on the other side of things.  I'm a landlord and developer, which I realize doesn't endear me to most readers, but in my partial defence, I've built everything that I own, and with my own hands for the first few years.  \n \nI started doing painting, finishing carpentry/millwork/cabinetmaking to make money during university, and when I graduated I had saved up enough to get horribly into debt at an extremely high interest rate which I had to build my way out of.  The first place I lived in after the dorm was a dangerously neglected warehouse that I had just bought, and ended up reconstructing into a fourplex - I lived there for the next 10 years while subsequently getting into new greenfield rental developments.\n \nJust before COVID I ended up selling that first place I had built, and the buyer wanted me out so they could raise the rent to market.  This was to be my first time getting \"evicted,\" but the pain was numbed by the sale price during that huge market runup.  I also thought it might be tricky to navigate being a tenant in a building that I had built and owned for years.  \n  \nI decided to treat myself by renting a condo downtown - a huge step up from my previous 1 bedroom that was chosen for its ROI rather than owner-occupancy appeal.  \n \nI spent around 3 months looking at dozens of places and built up a good sense of the rental market as my pride insisted I get the best deal possible.  \n  \nI quickly learned that the market that had been so favourable to me The Landlord was extremely difficult for me The Tenant.  I got incredibly lucky when I took a chance and viewed a condo on craigslist that had no photos in the listing, never a good sign.  \n \nIt turned out the lack of photos was not an attempt to cover up, but simply the inability of the owner to work a digital camera (he did not have a smartphone.)    \n  \nIt was perfect - 2005ish building, floor to ceiling glass, high floor with 270 degree views, A/C, open layout, well priced.  The only problem?  Very worn out, shabby 2005ish kitchen and bathroom, and the reddest looking cherry wood flooring you could imagine.  Horrible cheap honey coloured fake wood veneer cabinets, gloss black appliances.  Brushed aluminum finish everywhere, lots of frosted glass on the light fixtures.  A simpler time.\n \nThe landlord seemed like he would be pretty hands-off, and my application pitch was that if he was okay with it, I would take care of maintenance myself and just e-transfer him rent every month and not bother him.  He loved the sound of that.    He said he had bought a house in the suburbs and wanted to keep this condo for rental income for about 10 years until he retired - there are pretty strong tenant rights where I live, so long as he didn't sell there were no \"no fault\" eviction options.  We signed the tenancy agreement, paid the deposit and moved in.  The last time I saw him was during the move-in inspection, after which he exclaimed “If you treat this place well, I promise you can stay here as long as you want!”  Big, firm, job-interview winning boomer handshake, and he was gone.  \n\n \nWe loved the new place – a complete change from the “up and coming” part of town we had just left, 400 feet above the street.  The absolutely horrible kitchen, bathrooms and floors haunted me, but I had a plan and it was only a matter of time.    \n  \nOne of my carpentry/millwork subs did a lot of retail tenant improvement as well as... model homes and apartments for much bigger developers.  When you are building a 30 story highrise, you typically spend a few hundred grand to several million mocking up a unit in a retail showroom somewhere offsite to help you collect deposits.  After the building sells out?  That stuff gets either junked or sold on craigslist.  When I was doing single digit unit buildings, I had bought a number of new old stock appliances, cabinets, flooring etc out of a marketing manager's garage for cash...  \n \nA few months later and it's the summer of 2020 and COVID is in full swing, and my carpenter emails me - one of his clients is cancelling their project, and since they are ghosting him on his draw, he is taking down their display unit.  The drawings show an almost exact match to my unit in terms of dimensions.  \n\nThe spec sheet is jaw-dropping:  almost 20' of Snaidero cabinets, gloss white with champagne bronze hardware, Sub Zero/Wolf appliance package, white marble counters and back splash, Kallista faucets...  easily $100,000+  retail not including install.  Oh, and 1200 square feet of herringbone light oak planks if I don't mind pulling them up myself.  How much does he want?  $10k cash.  \n  \nWell, my jobsite is shut down for the foreseeable future, the government is making 75% of my payroll and I don't have anything to do except stare at my awful kitchen all day.  \n  \nAfter about 3 hours with my measuring tape and pencil, I ask my carpenter if he is willing to join my bubble for $40/hr cash for a few weekends.  \nHe is.  \n  \nOne last step - email my landlord and ask if he doesn't mind me doing a complete renovation on his condo.  Crucially, I conclude the offer with \"I'll undertake to return it to move-in condition before I leave.\"  \n \nNot surprisingly, he accepts.  \"That's okay, do whatever you want, we love having you as a tenant.\"  \n \nTime to go to work.  I get the old kitchen out in about 2 days, hampered by my need to work quietly as I'm doing this without permits (not like they are doing inspections anyways, but still..).  A side effect of this slow pace (and my wife's current obsession with Marie Kondo) is that everything is removed intact, and carefully taped and labelled.  Taking out the old kitchen does indeed spark joy.  \n  \nThe old floating cherry wood floor comes up in a morning, also tagged and labelled and bundled in the order it was removed.  \n \nThe carpenter comes over, and he gets the \"new\" kitchen installed in less than 2 days while I lay down the floor.  The floor actually ended up taking me a week, mainly because I had to make the end cuts at my storage unit across town, since I definitely couldn't run a mitre saw with everyone at home during lockdown.  \n \nAfter just under 2 weeks, I had effectively a brand new, ultra high end condo for just under $12,000 out of pocket.  \n \nAt this point I'm sure everyone reading this is facepalming as they wonder why on earth I'm proud of renovating someone else's condo at my cost - it did make sense at the time, as I was under the impression I'd be there for a good 10 years - plus the fact I was paying about $500/month under market at move-in, and more like $1500/month under market in the current condition.  \n  \nThere are a variety of economic and market conditions and segments where it makes more financial sense to rent than it does to buy.  For example, my monthly rent would not have even covered the interest portion of a mortgage, let alone condo fees, insurance, taxes and the opportunity cost of the downpayment.  In other words, it was cheaper to rent the condo than it was to rent the money that I would need to buy the condo.  Also, as a builder, cash is a critical tool, and the more cash I can hold onto, the bigger I can build. \n  \nWith my 1 year lease, and the fact I had lots of free time, it didn't seem like such a reckless move.  And who can say no to a $2000 kitchen faucet.  Filling a glass of water feels like working the bolt on a well-oiled Holland & Holland rifle.   Worst case I could probably get most of it back by selling just the appliances if something unexpected happened.  \n \nWhich it did.  \n  \nI had undertaken all this after evaluating all the possibilities and weighing the risk of putting time and money into a place I don't own.  I had failed to consider one important detail - the wife.  \n \nBy the spring of 2023 the upgrades had, in my opinion, paid for themselves after nearly 36 months of use.  I hadn't seen the landlord since I moved in and he hadn't been in touch since approving my renovation except for the monthly confirmation he'd accepted my rent transfer - so naturally I began to get concerned when by the end of the first week of May, he hadn't deposited my rent.  \n \nTwo emails went unanswered, until there was a knock on the door.  I opened up and was hit with a wall of flowery perfume, which perfectly matched the wall of floral print and red heels standing in my doorway.    \n \nThe landlord had contracted COVID (in 2023!) and sent his wife to collect the rent.  I get out my phone to cancel the transfer and go into my office to look for my chequebook.  I come back to find her (still in her heels!!) standing in the middle of the living room spinning like a technicolour top.  \n \n\"Oh wow, this looks fabulous!  I heard you were doing some renos but I never thought it would look like this!  Is that a Sub ZERO fridge?\"  She opens the fridge.  My fridge.  \n  \n\"I looove the floors.. and are these custom cabinets?\"  \n \nShe turns the kitchen faucet on and off probably 6 times.  \n \nIt took days to air out the smell of perfume after she left.  \nSeveral hours later my wife came home, and given the lingering smell in the apartment, I'd already briefed her on who had stopped by.  \n“Fuck.  I can tell by the smell she's seeing dollar signs.”  \n \nSure enough, 3 weeks later I get a call from a realtor who wants to schedule the photographer to take listing photos as the landlords are selling.  \n \nOf course the landlord, who has now recovered from his COVID, will not take my calls and won't respond to my emails.    \n \nI'm upset that he doesn't have the courage to admit what he is doing, my wife is upset because she doesn't want to move, and I'm feeling embarrassed that I trusted this guy... I'm not really losing much since we've lived there for 3 years and paid tens of thousands less than market rent during that time... but it still stings.  \n \nEven in the slow market the place sells in 3 weeks and yes, the new owners want to move in.  They give me the required 3 month's notice and pay the 1 month rent compensation.  I note that the listing has advertised “Exquisitely renovated with top of the line appliances, cabinets and built-ins.  No expense spared.”    \nMy first instinct was to at least contact the realtor and suggest he check with the landlord about what was included with the apartment, and what was being represented, but the description in the listing infuriated my wife to such an extent that we agreed to let them do their own due diligence.    \n \nI think you can all guess where this is going.  \n  \nThis time it only took 3 days to pull the \"new\" kitchen out and put the \"old\" kitchen back in.  Same with the floors - turns out you can lay 1000 square feet of flooring in about 2 hours if it's all pre-cut and labelled.  But, some of the T&G was a bit loose so I made sure to glue that bitch down to the concrete nice and tight to make sure it doesn't creak or pop.  It's exceptionally cheap so it's going to splinter and separate if it ever needs to come back up...  \n \nThe old Home Depot Glacier Bay $49 kitchen faucet unfortunately started leaking when I put it back in, so I treated the new owners to a brand new replacement (now $60).  The new one leaked as well, but not much, and only when it was on.\n  \nI re-watched the move-in inspection video to refresh my memory and made sure everything was exactly as it was when I moved in, right down to a few small holes in the drywall - I had also forgotten that the old oven control board was fried which meant it kept shutting off every 10 minutes.  \n \nMy wife and I debated leaving a wireless camera up on the wall to capture the new owner's delight at how faithfully we upheld our tenancy agreement as unfortunately we moved out about a week before their planned move in date but there was/is (still?) a reasonable chance of getting sued so we opted not to, as intent is half the battle.\n \nI don't actually know what happened since I've ignored the dozens of phone calls from the landlord and the new owners, and just sent them a registered letter with my tenancy agreement, move-in inspection video on DVD and a copy of the email exchange with the landlord from 2020 where he allowed me to renovate the condo provided I put everything back the way it was when I moved in.  \n   \nI did get a text from the realtor calling me a petty, vindictive asshole and that I'm lucky I'm not getting sued (implying that my landlord probably IS getting sued, and furthermore, one or all of them has looked into suing me and were advised against it.) \n  \nThe concierge recently told me that nobody has moved into the condo yet which presents another intoxicating possibility - because the new owners evicted us for their personal use, according to the tenancy law, if they fail to move in within 6 months they owe me a full year's rent as compensation for a fraudulent eviction.    \n \nI still haven't bought a place, I ended up unfortunately having to pay a fair bit more in rent to move upstairs in the same building, with a different layout but thankfully much nicer finishings.  I have an alert set for the building that tells me if a unit gets listed – I'm ready to make an offer if there is a fixer upper that comes up for sale -  I even have a kitchen that might just fit.",

His punishment by a local German commander was to give him a book of the German language and tasked him with learning the language. This would later save his life. \n\nDuring WWII, he was in the French Resistance and was sent to several camps including Buchenwald. Towards the end of the war he is sent marching Northwest with Nazi soldiers. Unaware that he speaks German, he overhears their plan to kill their prisoners. My great grandfather and the prisoners managed to run away to escape their fate. He eventually is saved when he meets up with the Allies.",

She was a scrawny little nerd from Minnesota, and she was a total sweetheart. She didn't really have many friends, she seemed to prefer to be alone. She was never really a victim of bullying or anything, despite her nerdiness, she was far too adorable and kind to be picked on, the kind of person you couldn't pick on or hate if you tried. Nobody really paid her any mind. Anyway, she was scrawny, about 5 feet tall, and always wore a giant multi pocket backpack that was packed full. Her backpack was like three times the width of her, I could never understand how she wore that thing. She carried her clarinet case in one hand, and her lunchbox in the other. \n\nFreshman year, it's the last week of school. We're on a shortened schedule. I was a bad kid. A friend had just given me some weed, and another friend and I had been in the bathroom smoking it before witnessing the glory of nerd girl. We emerge from the girl's room, high as kites. The bell rings. I glance to my right and see nerd girl. The bell has rung and this primal need to get the fuck to class lights up in her eye and she starts to run. But wait! Her shoe was untied. She didn't realize she was standing on a lace. \n\nShe picked up her other foot... And faceplanted. Hard. Her clarinet case flew in my direction, her lunchbox in the other. Backpack slid up to her head. She was spread eagle, face down, her shit all over the place, *and I was fucking laughing.* I can't help it, I even laugh when my kid gets hurt, its horribly inappropriate and I wish I could control it better and I am most certainly going to Hell. The fact that I was high just exacerbated my laughter. My friend whacked me in the side and called me an asshole, and then laughed too. I felt horrible. I was in tears from laughter, and already a couple other female students had rushed over to help nerd girl. I never saw her again after that.",

I thought this was only a thing in Finland. Turns out, the county I live in works with a charity that provides these boxes for all expecting moms. \n\nI was pretty stoked about this, so I made a post on Instagram showing it off. \n\nMy stepmom messaged me and told me I should take down the post a few days later. She said it was in bad taste because a lot of new moms don’t get this perk. She pointed out that her daughter, my stepsister, has been very upset by this.\n\nMy stepsister did reach out, but her response was something like, “wow, I had my son, all the hospital sent me was some maxi pads and a bill. :angryfaceemoji:”\n\nI didn’t down the post because I want to highlight the work that charity was doing. Especially for women in my area who may not be aware of the baby boxes and could really need it.\n\nMy stepsister sent me a DM telling me to take the post down. She said it’s unfair she has to struggle with a special needs baby while the other moms can gloat about how being a new mom is awesome. She said that she never got a free box or clothes or perfume like my cousin and everyone stopped caring one she had her son while me, my cousin and all our other relatives “get all the attention.” \n\nRight now, I’m leaning towards keeping the post up. I don’t live in the same state as my stepfamily but am aware of social programs designed to help parents with special needs kids. That or my stepsister get help or get counseling. But maybe that’s not the best move. AITA? \n\nI just need an outside opinion because the lack of sleep is affecting my judgement making. ",

    "body": "\nThe title sounds literally awful- and i feel awful. My (17 F) sister (veronica, 19 F) accidentally got pregnant. I think having a little niece or nephew would be nice but whatever Veronica wants to do is fine by me.\nShe decided to keep it and my parents are beyond ecstatic. Veronica and i aren’t close , she was barely home growing up and my parents both left for work at 6 am and got back just in time for dinner. I basically raised my little siblings ( K, 11 M) (M, 14 F )and  (C, 13F) . Me and my little siblings are really close and spend most of our time together but Veronica always relied on friends. Veronica tries her best to disturb peace in the family, causing fights with my sisters over little things like spraying too much perfume or commenting on their looks, but whenever we fight with her she threatens to abort her child as if we are going to drop to our knees and beg her not to.\n\nMy parents protect her in every fight and thinks she can do no wrong because she is “blessing them with their first grand baby”.\n\nOver the past few weeks i’ve been working hard to buy a gift for C, just an expensive perfume she wants which was about $110 , (expensive, i know) but she was really wanting it. Not even two days into her having it her and Veronica got into a fight over god knows what, Veronica took the perfume and a few of her other belongings and threw them off the balcony. This pissed me off so much , because not only did i spend so much on that but also that was C’s stuff that she valued. C was crying while M was consoling her. Veronica was staring at her with a smirk on her face as if she was proud of being a fully grown adult and destroying a barely teenager’s stuff.\n\nI went absolutely crazy on Veronica essentially telling her to go fuck herself. She started saying “i dare u to hit me! I’ll get rid of this baby, I don’t give a fuck” i was confused as this had nothing to do with her kid and i said “ I don’t care what happens to that thing, you’d be an awful mother anyways” .My parents came to her rescue and told me to either get over myself or move out. So i said “okay” and went to my boyfriend’s house. I’ve been getting calls and texts from my parents and Veronica telling me to come back and talk this out , also saying i’m an awful person for saying this to my poor sister. I feel bad but my boyfriend is telling me that they are treating me like shit and he doesn’t think i should go back there unless i really want to. So AITA",

Imagine a Tesla that you could fill the auxiliary tank with cheap corn oil, booze, diesel,  E-85, gasoline, Motor oil, what have you.  The turbine would be hooked to a generator and spin at the optimum speed for power and efficiency. The turbine could be as small as a shoebox, leaving room for noise and heat attenuation. Also, the turbine could be used for cabin heat while the generator is spinning, reducing the electrical draw needed for heat, contributing to further range and efficiency.  The same could be said for a Rotary motor, except you would have to settle just for Gasoline /e-85.",

There was also a concern that a turbine would last way too long, which is true. Corporations wanted customers to buy a new car every five years or so \"planned obsolescence\" was a real thing that affected design decisions.\n\nThe fifty that were first produced were doled out to customers from varied locations and backgrounds. The people who absolutely loved them were those who lived in the far north where it snowed heavily, and the cold was a major concern.\n\nSome people had to park outside in the bitter cold, but let's just restrict ourselves to people who would put their new turbine car inside a garage. Few people have heated garages, so even inside a garage, lets think about a car in Minnesota that is at zero degrees F. A regular car would have a hard time starting, and even after it did start, it might take five minutes to fully warm up.\n\nThe comfort of the passengers is an understandable concern, but even if the passengers are bundled up in parkas, a warm engine means that the windows will remain defrosted while you drive. This is not a trivial concern, since a fogging-window on an extremely cold day can lead to a car wreck.\n\nThe turbine here would easily start in the absolute coldest weather, and then it would warm the cabin and windshield defogger in less than half a minute. Whether that feature is important to you or not, the people in the far north said that they would gladly give up a few MPG to get that.\n\nAnother major difference was that a turbine could be reasonably expected to last MANY more years than a conventional piston engine...while costing less to make. The automatic transmission would then be the most frequently-rebuilt item in that situation.\n\nIf the technology at the time allowed a turbine to be built that was half the size, the fuel consumption might have been equal.

I would imagine the oil industry is partly responsible as to maintain power and control over the fossil fuel age.

But, they did flirt with buses.\n\nPutting a turbine on an electric is the best case.  The difficulties in starting procedure and throttle changes go away entirely.\n\nHere's a [30kw electric output turbine running](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYOH-Ep4d9I).  Let me repeat- that's not mechanical shaft hp, but electric output from an integrated generator.  That's big, but not too bad.  Now 30kw= 40hp, which isn't enough to accelerate on, but the AVERAGE power consumption of a Tesla is ~18kw.  So, yes, that could power a sedan if you could fit it.  Not quite a van or truck going 85mph though\n\nCapstone is currently targeting 42% electrical efficiency.   Most gasoline engines are ~20%.  The 3rd-gen Prius is 38.5% efficiency though.  But... a turbine is SO MUCH COOLER",

    "body": "They started innocently enough.\n\n*Don’t forget your keys* read the first message, scrawled on a sticky note in loopy letters. It had been left on my fridge door.\n   \nIt immediately grabbed my attention because at the time I lived alone, I had no memory of writing it, and the handwriting didn’t match mine or anyone I knew. I was slightly perturbed, but wasn’t sure how to react. In the end I just tossed the note and went to work.\n\nThe second note came a few days later, left on my kitchen counter. The sticky note was pink this time but still had the same distinctive loopy handwriting. \n\n*Make sure to pack a lunch today.*\n\nAgain, I was unsettled. Now, any normal person might have reported this to the police, but during that time I was going through a major depressive spell. I had moved to a new city away from my friends and family, and had started a new job that I quickly realized I hated and didn’t nearly pay enough. Home was lonely and work was soul crushing. I had trouble enough getting out of bed each morning, let alone filing a report that I am sure the police would not take seriously. Even more stressed, I crumpled up the note. However, I ended up packing a small lunch for myself. Usually I didn’t bother to put in the effort and just ate cafeteria food, but against my better judgment I fulfilled the wishes of the note.\n   \nThat day the cafeteria was closed. The main cafeteria fridge had broken overnight and many of the frozen lunches inside had gone bad. Management thought it would be better to shut it down for the day. A feeling of unease settled in my stomach after learning the news. It was as if the note had predicted it.\n   \nThe notes continued throughout the following weeks. They would typically show up on random days, no more than three notes to a day. They were all left in obvious places in my apartment, all on sticky notes, and in that unfamiliar loopy handwriting. They began to grow more prophetic. \n   \n*Take I-80 today. There will be a bad accident on your way home.*\n\n*Janet is going to offer you some cookies at the office. Politely decline. They will give you food poisoning.*\n\n*Marie has been on a diet. Compliment her on her weight loss. She’ll end up thinking well of you.*\n\nOf course, I tested the notes to see if they were accurate. Every time I ignored their advice, whatever it warned against came true. One day a note said to pack an umbrella, and I purposely didn’t. It was forecasted to be sunny that day so any normal person wouldn’t think to pack one, but sure enough I got soaked that evening walking to my car.\n\n I was incredibly curious about the notes. There were so many questions I had about them, and those unanswered questions kept festering in my head. I tried writing notes back in return and leaving them out, but never got a response. I’d speak out loud and ask questions as if (or in case) the note writer could somehow hear me, but this only made me feel foolish. I’d occasionally make a surprise visit home at odd hours, just to see if I could catch the note writer leaving their notes. Of course, I never caught them. I tried installing cameras in my apartment, even making sure all of the cameras were completely hidden,  but the next day I found every single one of the camera’s insides completely torn out and placed on the kitchen table with a single note next to them reading:\n   \n*Never do that again.*\n\nThe notes stopped coming after that, which made me deeply regretful. I had grown accustomed to the notes. I had begun to rely on them even. They had significantly improved my way of life over the last few months both mentally, financially, and socially. I had actually started making friends at the office thanks to their advice, and for the first time in my life I was even a bit popular. My managers, who before the notes didn’t pay much interest in me, now valued my presence and would ask for my opinion on projects. It was no secret I was on my way to a promotion. Could I still do that without the notes? \n\nI also valued the notes as a friend, as weird as that sounds. Or more like a guardian angel. Wherever they were from, they were always protecting me. Without them, the future was suddenly unknown, dangerous. Every time some mild annoyance popped up from that point, from bad traffic to stressful work situations and even a minor paper cut, I thought about how this all probably could have been avoided if I still had the notes.\n\nThe next week, a bright green sticky note appeared on my bathroom mirror.\n\n*Don’t forget to call Mom today. It is her birthday.*\n\nI nearly cried. I decided to sack my investigation and just accept things as they were. Slowly, the fog of my depressive spell began to lift and I could feel myself returning to how I used to be. My confidence rose and for the first time in a while I felt in equilibrium with my life. I went out, cracked jokes, and even managed to clean up my apartment.\n\nI also managed to get a girlfriend somehow. Her name was Amanda. I met her at a pub when I was out with my buddies. The best part of all this is that for some reason, she seemed to actually be into me. She was gorgeous, (way out of my league really) with long Auburn hair that reached down to her back with soft brown eyes. Her laugh was lovely and the lemon scented perfume she liked to wear was intoxicating. She was the type of girl you could chat with for hours and never run out of things to talk about. The relationship was still new so I was trying not to plan our whole future together in my head, but she was so lovable it was hard not to. \n\nAt some point I briefly thought about telling her about the notes. I’ve always wanted to tell someone about it but never really had anyone to tell up until now. I decided not to however, afraid she might think I was crazy. There was no point so early in the relationship making her think I was a loon. Plus I was afraid the notes might stop again. If whoever was leaving them clearly didn’t want me looking into them, how would they react if I shared what was happening with somebody?  So at the moment I kept it to myself.\n\nAmanda had a hobby of cooking and had invited me to her house on Saterday for, in her words, “the best fucking spagetti you’ll ever eat”. I was pumped since this was the first time I would actually visit her house.\n\nI was in a good mood that evening as I was getting ready for the date. I hummed to myself happily thinking about how lovely this was going to be, and went downstairs to grab my keys. On the kitchen counter was a new hot pink sticky note. I picked it up instinctively.\n\n*KILL YOUR GIRLFRIEND.*\n\nMy brain stopped for a moment. I read it once, twice, a third time, the words flashing in my brain but hitting an error every time. I set the note down and gulped, feeling nauseous. Anxiously, I went to my car and started driving. I tried not to think about the note but the words kept circling in my mind. Kill your girlfriend. The notes have never failed me before, and they were always in my best interest as far as I knew... which was admittedly not much. Maybe they were wrong this time? Maybe it wasn’t meant to be taken literally? “Kill” could be a synonym for “break up”, right? My mind kept trying to make up poor excuses the whole way there. By the time I arrived I was a sweaty mess and not a lick calmer. \n  \nI pulled down my sun visor to check my face and a bright green sticky note fluttered out. I went cold. The notes had never appeared outside my house before. Hands shaking, I picked up the note and read it.\n\n*KILL AMANDA. TAKE THE GUN FROM YOUR GLOVEBOX AND SHOOT HER.*\n\nI looked at my glovebox wide eyed. I did indeed keep a handgun in my glovebox for safety purposes. I wanted to puke, to believe this wasn’t happening. Again, I ignored the note and walked up to Amanda’s house, trying to shake the message from my mind.\nShe answered the door almost immediately after I rang the doorbell.\n \n“Hey what’s up!” She said with a bright smile, but when she saw my face the smile dropped.\n   \n“You ok Gary, what’s wrong?” She said in concern.\n  \n“Nothing.” I lied, trying to force a smile. “Well, actually I think I have a bit of a stomach ache...”\n   \n“Come in, come in,” she said, ushering me in. The inside of her house was cute and homely, and she fretted over me worriedly as she led me over to her kitchen table. She then took my hand and rubbed it comfortingly.\n   \n“If you’re not feeling up to spaghetti, we can always have it another time. Don’t worry about it. Do you want any antacids or something?”\n   \nI smiled. The way she was so concerned for me over a simple stomach ache made me fall in love with her all over again. My heart panged with both love and guilt. The aroma of cooked spaghetti was also extremely strong, and even though she said it was fine I knew it would probably be a bummer for her to pack away all that spaghetti after just making it.\n   \n“I’m fine sweety. I probably have a stomach ache because I haven't eaten much today. I was looking forward so much for your spaghetti.”\n   \nHer smile returned again. I always loved how fast she smiled at things.\n   \n“Well then Mr. Hungry, let me grab you a bowl!”\n   \nShe left for the kitchen. I reclined back and sighed, sticking my hands in my pockets. I felt a crinkle of paper. Shit. *Shit.* I pulled the paper out of my right pocket.\n   \n*TAKE YOUR CHAIR AND BASH HER HEAD IN*\n\nI had a hard time controlling my breathing as I stuffed the note back in my right pocket. I also felt paper in my left pocket, and against my mind screaming for me not to, I pulled it out, realizing that it was actually two notes crinked together. Shakily, I unwrinkled the first note.\n   \n*DO NOT EAT THE SPAGHETTI. DRUGGED*\n   \n“What’s that Gary?” Asked Amanda behind me.\n   \nI nearly jumped out of my skin. I stuffed the notes back in my left pocket. \n   \n“Oh, j-just some note from work I forgot was in my pocket is all!” I said in a weird voice.\n   \nShe frowned, looked like she wanted to say something, but then thought better of it. \n   \n“Here Babe”, she said gently, handing me a bowl of spaghetti. It looked heavenly. I wanted to puke. \n   \nShe sat next to me with her own bowl. She rested her head in her hands and looked at me excitedly, expectantly. I stared at her blankly.\n   \n“Well, take a bite silly!” She said, gesturing towards my bowl.\n   \n“I-I uh, I’m so s-sorry. I really need to use your bathroom.”\n   \nI jumped up and started looking for her bathroom. She jumped up after me, looking confused.\n   \n“Gary? What’s wrong? You’ve been acting weird.”\n   \nWhen I found the right door, I went in and locked the door behind me. She kept knocking and knocking.\n   \n“Gary? Gary! Seriously, what’s wrong with you? Is the stomach ache that bad? Talk to me Gary, please!”\n  \n I backed up and against the bathroom wall, then sank down to the floor. I pulled out the two notes from my left pocket again, this time reading the second note. My heart sank.\n   \n*SHE IS NOT AMANDA.*",

The demon is violent and orders to kill the girl, even though that’s surely not needed. When Gary leaves Amanda’s house one way or another, he will be hesitant to make new (girl)friends and will stay inside his home more. \n\nOne night, Gary will find a pen inside his eyelid.",

He’s been letting me smell his wrists with all his new cologne. \n\nToday I let him smell a new perfume I have and he said it smells so good and that he’s gonna bring me a small decanted bottle from his collection (he says it’s a unisex one). I told him if he does that, I’ll give him my number and he clicked his fingers at me and said “done deal.”\n\nEdit 1: WOW! I woke up this morning to my humble post of 1,000 likes to this with so many little awards. I am humbled❤️ thanks for all the messages and replies, I’m going through them now. Also.. silver!!🥰\n\nEdit 2: Will absolutely update you all when if I see him outside of work haha\n\nEdit 3: This post was honestly to get people to see that it is possible to meet people who aren’t online and to start being chatty with someone. I don’t think the postman and I will have some kinda of amazing love story but it sure as hell is a funny story to tell my nieces and nephews one day.

Some mama cats will reject their kitten(s) if they can sense that the baby is too sick to make it or will get the other kittens sick? It can also happen with moms that are too young or are sick themselves. More details for my fellow nerds in the comments if you wanna learn more. Spay those kitties!\n\n\nTrigger Warning: >!Cheating!<\n\n\n\n[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/101ryo5/i_think_my_28_husband_29_cheated_on_nye_while_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n\nI think my (28) husband (29) cheated on NYE while I had the flu\n\n\nWe have two kids. Over the past week each of our kids were sick and since I spend the most time with them; I caught it. They were over it by the time I got symptoms.  It so happened I got the flu starting Friday night so my weekend plans were halted; I wasn't going out anyway but still.\n\n\nMy 2 yr old tested positive for the flu Friday and I started showing signs the same day. \n\n\nHes literally never here already but also couldn't *not* go into work and I was supposed to accompany him.\n\n\nAnyway; im sick at home with two sick kids. All of us have fevers and he goes out. Yes it's his job but still. \n\n\n10 o clock i sent a text saying I would be asleep by 12 so happy new year. I got a reply.\n\n\nSomeone called me and woke me up at almost one. I text him to make sure he was okay. Then dosed off. Ended up calling him around 3am to check on him and he claimed he was following my SIL home.\n\n\n5 comes around I ask if he's okay. He claims irritation. \n\n\nAt 630 I text a bunch of question marks because he hasn't answered my last message. He said he was too drunk and had to chill for a bit before driving. \n\n\nWhen he strolls in at 730. He heads straight to the bathroom and washes his face. He said some people spilled liquor all over his new sweater and shoes and he was *super mad* about it. \n\n\nTold me how he stopped at the only open place to get some ice....to sober up. Okay.\n\n\nWhen he went to sleep; I smelled his shirt. It was dry AND it didn't smell anything like alcohol. In fact, the bottom smelled like vagina *shrugs*  and his shoes were squeaky clean. \n\n\nSo I woke him up. Like you left me home sick with the flu, with sick kids to lay up with a woman? He acted like I was tripping or making it up. \"Who said that?\" \n\n\nI said that. \n\n\nWe haven't spoken since. Just small words here and there. We just got into a really petty argument because I said everyone was getting on my nerves because while I'm sick as a dog; my kids are better and bothering me and he's no help at all. I can't even recover properly because I can't rest. \n\n\nHe said the feeling was mutual and I told him he was welcome to leave. So he did which is fine by me honestly because I'm no dummy. But he was supposed to cut our sons hair and also I'm *still* really sick. I dont want to be dealing with this right now at all. My feelings aren't hurt at the thought of him cheating either. I actually don't care about that part. I guess he saw me being sick as the perfect opportunity.\n\n\nI'm just extra annoyed but he's trying to spin this like I'm upset about not being able to go out for the new year which couldn't be further from the truth, I had no intention on going out *anyway*.\n\n\nEdit: I went and reread our messages and I have the times wrong. \n\n\nI sent out the first message at 10:13- that wished him a happy New Year and let him know I'd be asleep before 12. And told him to be careful. \n\n\nAt 1:20- I sent out a message telling him I had a fever and that my sister was looking for him. (That's who woke me up) He responded.\n\n\nAt 4am: I sent a \"you good?\" \nNo response. Note: we live in a smallish city. Everything shuts down at 2 and the after hours close at 3:30.\n\n\nAt 6:16- I sent the question marks. \n\n\nHe responded and said he was about to be on his way. And he came in at 7:30 ish.\n\n\nAlso; I didn't mention that his sweater also smelled like perfume because he *was* out but I'm a bartender. If I spill liquor on my clothes, my clothes smell like liquor and whatever smell good I had on the next day, and especially in the next few hours. \n\n\nI dont think im controlling for trying to make sure he didn't get into a drunk car accident/arrested/hurt.\n\n\n*In the comments:*\n\n\n>Sounds like this relationship was down the drain before NYE started.\n\n\nOP: No not really down the drain exactly. He is breaking into an industry that requires him to be away from home more and I'm trying to be understanding of that.\n\n\nTypically we are a bit more communicative than this post shows, we've done couples courses and counseling and couples focused parenting classes and learned a few tricks. I just don't feel like he's being truthful. We've been together a very long time even though we are youngish (12 years)\n\n\n>I would just ask him outright and check his phone...the vagina smell is what gets me\n\n\nOP: Me too. It literally smells like vagina. Like he had sex with his clothes still on. I dont even know else to explain it. Like he didn't pull his shirt all of the way up.\n\n\nThis has never been an issue for us so I don't even know how to go about asking. I've never went through his phone in all of our years together and thinking about it, whatever would have been in there is likely deleted by now.\n\n\n>You woke up, smelt his collar and then immediately got mad. His reaction was to also get mad and then happily leave no explanation. You are telling me it went from a happy communicative relationship to this in the matter of a couple minutes?\n\n\nOP: Not exactly. I felt like his story was a lie. I smelt the entire shirt. A first for me too. It was just all of these things added together that made me take a pause and check his shirt AND shoes.\n\n\nAny time either of us has had an issue, we have no issue talking about it. I know it sounds wild. Shit it's wild to me too. I promise you, all of this is completely left field. I've never even suspected him of cheating before, its just never been an issue.\n\n\n>Well I mean, if you don't even care that he cheated... ?\n\n\nOP: Idk how to explain it. It's not that I wouldn't be hurt or sad, I would its just I have other shit to focus on than the hurt I'd feel. Like obviously cheating is fucked up but what is getting me the most is the fact that he was just okay with leaving me sick as hell, with two sick as hell kids and his focus was getting his dick wet instead of coming home to give a helping hand. I have never been this sick in my life. I can't even focus on the part that hurts; just the fact that its pissing me off and that he's acting like the only reason I have questions is because I didn't get to party.\n\n\nAlso the fact that I know that if he is cheating; there's nothing I can do to change it. It happened. And I'll leave. No bargaining.\n\n\n\n\n[Update the next day](https://www.reddit.com/user/Pretty_Chicken9053/comments/102h303/update_here_about_cheating_husband/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n\nupdate here about cheating husband\n\n\n[Update] My husband cheated on NYE\n\n\nI dont know how to link my last post but its on my page. And it was deleted from the sub I was on.\n\n\nI'm not going to lie some of those comments are whew! Jesus christ. \n\n\nSome questions:\n\n\nYes. You can get tested for the flu. \n\n\n\"You're controlling\"\n\n\nI mean ok. Let's go with that.\n\n\nHe works in the music industry. So its not uncommon for him to be away from home. Its not strange (to me) that he goes out without me because it's a part of his job. We actually almost never go out together but we usually bring in NYE together. I didn't care about him working because it was supposed to be work. But again; things shut down here pretty early, he's never come in later than 4 and that's not often at ALL. \n\n\nThere was someone who said his clothes wouldn't still smell like liquor. Let's go with that, why would his clothes be completely dry?? He also had on white btw. \n\n\nMe saying I don't care about the cheating. It's not that I wouldn't Care, i guess I worded that bad. I *would* care. I'm not a robot. I just have other shit to worry about in this moment. I can't even begin to worry about the pain I *might* feel. Yes cheating is disrespectful, in regular circumstances. In my circumstances it's EXTRA disrespectful to me because we are so damn sick. Like damn. You care so little about me that you'd cheat NOW? \n\n\nMentions of me being a single mom: isn't typical but we have communicated about it over the last few weeks. The division of labor isn't fair. So he had been making sure he's home to help with homework/bedtime/play time more. So I've been trying to be understanding of his work I guess. \n\n\nHe cut back hours at his regular job as well so I didn't exactly suspect anything. \n\n\nOk to the update:\n\n\nThank you to the redditor that told me exactly what to look for. And thanks for the well wishes. I definitely am starting to feel better a bit but not by much.\n\n\nSorry if this is everywhere; \n\n\nHe DID cheat and I'm glad I'm not crazy. With some girl named Valerie (he had her name under his mom's!). Didn't ask many questions about who she is because idc about her. She knows he's married he knows he's married. \n\n\nI asked straight up to see his phone. And apparently she's someone that comes into his regular job. He has invited her to come to events I didn't go to (couldn't go to). She danced on him and she made him hard apparently and it went from there. \nTheir text are soooo cringy I mean think high schoolers.\n\n\nFrom the things I *have* been to, she was also there. She told him I was really pretty and asked if I'd be open to a threesome. He told her he'd convince me. It came up a few times. \n\n\nThey literally talk about me and my kids like she's an old friend. All I can do is laugh yall. Seriously. \n\n\nHe wrote her and told her I suspect something and she told him to delete their pics (didn't find those). \nNYE was their first night physically having sex but there was an obvious build up to it. \n\n\nThey had sex in his car. Well his mom's car because his car is in the shop and he doesn't like to drive mine (thank god).\n\n\nWhen I checked the time; he *was* on the phone with her when he pulled up.\n\n\nHe's an idiot and I'm embarrassed. I know who she is. I've never met her but I found her. She isn't my focus though. I feel bad that her self esteem is so low that she'd be willing to be a secret. Its not like he's rich. \n\n\nI didn't find anything else about anyone else. But who knows.\n\n\nFor him, I can't even look at him. He won't leave because apparently we can work it out. *eye roll*  I'm so disgusted. He didn't even shower after. He just laid in the bed I paid for and passed out. \nHe washed his face, got undressed and went to sleep. \n\n\nI feel nauseous at the thought of him coming to kiss me and my kids after they did God knows what.\n\n\nHe knows cheating is a big fuck no for me, I've always said if he gets the urge to cheat; just leave because I WILL find out and I'm not nice and forgiving for shit like this. \n\n\nI even opened the door for him to tell me the truth. Of course he didn't mean for it to go that far, it was *just* conversations and then he got drunk. \n\n\nThat this is the *first* time he has ever cheated but I can't believe that so I won't. But I'm not going to cry about it. I didn't yell. I didn't cry. I just said \"OK\". And asked him to leave. \n\n\nI have been with him and only him since I was 16 years old. He pursued me. When things got rocky and I wanted to leave, he did the work to keep *me*. He wanted ME. I've given him all of my 20s.  I can't tell if I'm hurt though honestly, I'm more-or-less irritated and disgusted. I genuinely don't even have time to think about it too much. \n\n\nHe said it was a mistake lol I can't do anything but laugh. I should make a mistake similar I guess. And not to be cocky, but I'm not an ugly woman. I have a very nice body, my personality is amazing! Im funny as hell, im an amazing mom, and I know that I am a great wife.  Im not lacking suitors at *all* This isn't on me.. and i won't delude myself into thinking I could've done anything different. \n\n\nI want him to leave. He cheated. It's done and it happened. To the redditor that said I'm ruining my marriage, *I* didn't ruin my marriage. He did. Especially because he's a horrible liar. I grew up with him. I know when shit isn't right.\n\n\nEdit: thank yall so much for all of the love. And well wishes. I love everyone for all of the advice and praise. I appreciate yall so much. He has agreed to leave to his mom's house thankfully. But get this....after I feel better. He's gonna stay to help with me and the kids.\n\n\n*In the comments:*\n\n\nMy point exactly. It was cheating before it became physical. He just got sloppy on NYE because he thought I'd be asleep or too out of it, not thinking that I also have sick kids who are getting up as well. It was such a long conscious decision.\n\n\nExactly where I am in my thoughts. He's disgusting. He has to go. The level of disrespect he's shown to me; I'll never ever get over. He's a fool if he thinks otherwise.\n\n\n>I’m sorry you’re going through this right now. On the flip side I’m super glad to hear you know your worth and that you’re more deserving. You didn’t even give him the reaction he probably thought would happen lmao! Good for you! In his moms car too damn that’s Ew. He’s a fucker.\n\n\nOP: Yes. And I've definitely made up my mind to tell his mama to make sure gets her car professionally detailed. Thank you!\n\n\n*I'm flairing this concluded as OOP has said several times that cheating is a deal breaker for her and she's done.*\n\n\n**Reminder that I am not the original poster.

The nerve of someone to take advantage of the sick woman’s delirium he was counting on (whatever even happened to “in sickness and in health”, am I right) means it was definitely thought out. Though he seems to be be drunk enough he didn’t think to change his clothes or pick a better lie, he definitely did some planning (especially with the changing her name in his phone). I’ve been on Reddit long enough to see that there are commenters who would probably find some way to put the blame on OOP, who’s just coping, and will likely feel the backlash of his actions when her mind is clearer without physical illness.

This takes a toll on their health, both mentally and physically. They just become exhausted. Again, another great reason to spay and also to *not* support breeders. \n\n\nThe mom could be sick, which can also be the result of having too many litters. Pregnancy and giving birth are draining. The babies are taking a ton of nutrients from the mom and, especially if she is not getting proper care and enough food, this can affect her health (this happensa lot with cats that were living on the street). There are other common pregnancy and birth related issues, such as uterine or milk duct infections. If mom is sick, she isn't going to feel up to caring for her babies properly. \n\n\nIf a kitten, or sometimes even a whole litter, is born sick, the mother can sense it. She might reject this kitten, even move it away from the others, in order to keep the rest of the kittens safe and healthy. She might reject an entire litter if they're sick to keep herself healthy or simply because she knows there's nothing she can do for them.",

I stayed with a relative, who said that I could help myself to any of the items in a drawer in their guest bathroom.  It contained those little hotel-sized shampoos, conditioner, and soap.  It also had a bunch of those little vials given out as perfume samplers.  They were clearly very old.  But I thought, \"well, no one's using these, so I might as well try one.\"  They were probably well over five years old, but a test waft of one of them smelled pleasant enough.  I put on a few tiny dabs for the funeral.  \n\nWell, every time someone sat next to me, they started sneezing.  After this happened a couple of times to my brother, he stifled a laugh and whispered, \"I don't know why, but I can't sit next to you without sneezing.\"  He had to scoot over a few feet and I sat at bit off to the side during the eulogy.  After the funeral, I found a restroom and washed the areas where I'd dabbed the fragrance.  No problem.  But it did lighten the mood afterward when my family members were trying to figure out why they kept sneezing near me (the scent wasn't actually that strong, so at first they guessed I'd been near a cat and triggered an allergy common in the family).  I explained that no, it wasn't a cat but almost certainly from the old perfume I wore.  They still tease me about it at family gatherings.",

Like, I notice your question isn't 'would it be ok if I asked a woman the name of her perfume?'. It was 'would you be offended by the *compliment*.' Ask yourself honestly, what would you hope to gain out of the compliment? Getting the name of the perfume sounds like post-hoc rationalizing for why you'd be bringing it up with her.",

Just said “wow you’re super handsome” and kept walking lol. \n\nBlew me away and put me in such a good mood. I rode a high the rest of the day… maybe even the week. Still think about it all the time, which is kinda crazy lol. \n\nNow, my favorite thing to do is to compliment people randomly.  I do it a few times a day (if I’m out and around other people). I’ve never had a bad response. It’s always usually genuine surprise and happiness. People need to hear good things about them. I’ll compliment men and women equally, on their looks, their clothes, their perfume, their hair… anything. I’ll compliment couples “omg you guys are the most beautiful couple I’ve ever seen”. Almost always in passing, and never in a creepy way. I’ve had people not react really, but that’s the worst, never a negative reaction. And I’m not exaggerating when I say it’s like 99.9% a reaction of overwhelming joy. It’s my favorite thing to do. Makes people feel good and costs me nothing. A lot of my friends do it too now because they see me do it all the time. \n\nBut you have to be unassuming about it. Can’t make it seem like you’re trying to hit on them or sell them something, or get their attention or something lol. Just has to be a genuine compliment, wanting nothing in return.\n\nIn your case, it’s gonna be pretty much the same. You love their perfume scent and want to know what it is. “Excuse me, sorry if this is kinda weird lol, but your perfume smells amazing! Would you mind telling me what it is??” They’re gonna feel great with the compliment, not feel threatened, and be happy to pass on the advice.",

r/relationship_advice\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n[**Original**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/osefz6/me_25m_my_father_55m_had_an_affair_with_my/) _- July 27, 2021_\n\nMy mom died 4 years ago from cancer and me and my fiancee used to go his place for dinner nothing unusual about that he was a lonely but lately his mood had improved and I was about to find out why.\n\nSo yeah my dad invited us over to dinner and then after dinner they told me they needed to talk to me which was odd to her dad we needed to tell you something.\n\nTurns out they have had a sexual relationship for over 3 months and me being a moron asked how many times I was starting to hyperventilate at that point and they were both reluctant to share that.\n\nI eventually got the full story won't write that here painful enough and feel stupid for asking I walked out and left them both and told dad you want her you can keep her you are both finished with me and told my fiancee to give me the keys to my apartment, she was crying as she was struggeling to get the key of her chain I did it for her gave her other keys back and told her I would pack her things and she could come over and pick it up when I was finished.\n\nHer mom came over and picked up her things (she actually sent her mom to do it) I let her in and she had gotten the full story and was so sorry for everything and hoped I would get through this.\n\nMy dad and I guess ex-fiancee now has been texting and calling me for the last week not responded or answered any of their calls and my dad even called the cops because he was worried I might hurt myself oh jeez thanks for the concern for my mental health dad maybe you should have considered that before fucking my fiancee..\n\nSo I get two officers at my door who told me they had recieved a call from my dad worried I might harm myself I told the officer I was not suicidal and explained what had happened and they both looked disgusted and apologized for bothering me and what I was going through.\n\nThe look of pity from the officers made me feel worse I felt just ashamed having to tell these two guys that not sure why I felt shame but I did.\n\nAnyways dad wants me to talk to him I have no idea what to do here I have no other family no aunts or uncles and now no fiancee either anymore.\n\nI have kept busy by going to the gym and trying to live my life as normally as possible my fiancee has moved back with her parents but she is apperantly still in contact with my dad since dad keeps texting me that she is worried about me, apperantly I am the asshole here since he feels that I should not treat her this way.\n\nSo yeah I am the asshole here apperantly I mean what do I even do here I have ended it with her clearly but then there is my dad who is now trying to \"fix\" things and wants me to forgive her.\n\nI honestly just want them both to leave me alone\n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n\n[**Update 1**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/owd7hx/update_me_25m_my_father_55m_had_an_affair_with_my/) _- August 2, 2021_\n \n\nHey everybody thanks for all the messages and advice I did not expect this post to blow up as much as it did but I just wanted to post an update on how things stand.\n\nFirst of all I am doing okay in fact I have slept well these last few nights and had support from some unexpected places.\n\nMany of you wanted me to go public and tell everyone well I did not have to my now ex-fiancee took care of that for me she told her best friend exspecting sympathy, instead she raged at her and now most of her friends and mine are now fully aware of what has happened.\n\nHer best friend called me and we spoke for over an hour apperantly whatever angry thought I may have had regarding my now ex-fiancee was nothing to what her and her friends subjected her too.\n\nThey have completely cut her off and they even asked her if she slept with any of their fathers.\n\nHer bestfriend also told me that she still believes I will forgive her and that she wants me back (not happening) and seems to be a little shall we say unstable right now, she seems like a total wreck.\n\nI also spoke to her parents and told them to give her time and don't kick her out I honestly despite what she did don't want her to do anything stupid, her parents are probably more pissed at her than I am.\n\nI also met dad we spoke in person and honestly the reason we spoke is that I wanted to pick up some things from home I had a friend of mine with me just incase I felt the urge to punch him.\n\nHe made no attempt at small talk and my friend was walking very close by me like was exspecting me to attack him and was ready to restrain me if it happened.\n\nSo that's the update GF is a nervous wreck dumped by all her friend, her BFF and I have become good friends (no we are not sleeping together or anything like that) but she has supported me and we have kept talking on the phone, she had been cheated on herself but she could not even begin to imagine what I went through.\n\nHonestly I feel okay my dad I have cut off completely after I got my some of my moms things including her wedding ring, I am taking this I told him he did not argue and you can have this and gave him my enagement ring (not exspensive and honestly I did not know what I was gonna do with it anyways).\n\nHe just looked at me and and now finally it dawned upon him just how badly he had messed up I also told him to stop telling her that I may forgive her you are messing with her head and she needs to realize it's over, he said he would not contact her again I told him I did not care if he did or not.\n\nI got in the car and left and felt a lot better.\n\nSo that's the update folks I may have gone too far with the ring business but honestly if he wants her then the can marry her.\n\nI have had great support from many people including here and ready to move the hell on.\n\nBut if you have any questions I can try to answer if anyting is unclear.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[**Final Update**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/prom6g/final_update_me_25m_my_father_55m_had_an_affair/) _- September 20, 2021_\n \n\nHi just decided to post one final update since I have been bombarded with questions on how I'm doing and if anything has happened.\n\nI am doing okay my dad and my ex-fiancee have not contacted me at all and have left me alone.\n\nI have had moments were I felt lonely and angry but I had people who have been there for me.\n\nMy ex-fiancees BFF and I have gotten close and we decided to go on a trip me and her, we are not together but we have gotten close.\n\nDad and my ex-fiancee like many predicted have been talking and someone spotted them together in town, I kind of suspected it would happen.\n\nIt honestly does not bother me they deserve eachother and just thankful I found out before I married her.\n\nMore people have found out what happened now, dad and her have lost a huge part of their social circle, so I guess with many disgusted with them both, they found eachother misery loves company after all.\n\nI also made it clear to my other friends if they wanna contact her and talk to her that also does not bother me I don't wanna control anyone, or make anyone feel they have to stay away from her because of me.\n\nI am not gonna be a vindictive asshole that only hurts me in the long run.\n\nSo to summarize I am doing okay, still seeing a therapist and have gotten close to my ex-fiancees former best friend.\n\nI do get depressed and feel anger and lonely sometimes but I have learned to deal with it.\n\nI spent and entire weekend cleaning my apartment to get my ex-fiancees perfume smell out of my apartment since that was a big trigger for me and decided to buy a new bed and a new couch and redecorated a bit.\n\nSold the old bed and my old couch and honestly it feels like a new apartment, a fresh start if you will.\n\nThanks to everybody for your advice, concerns and comments they helped alot and needed to vent about it.",

Try essential oils”, “if you have menstrual issues, seek out natural/alternative medicine”, “periods shouldn’t have any negative side effects (moodiness, cramps, etc) at all and should be less than five days”.............I’m considering complaining to the teachers, because the “facts” she’s spreading are complete bullshit.

On my last visit with her, my Mum said to take the perfumes home with me as there had been a lot of thefts in the facility. I opened up her small train case, and they were all gone! There's more to this story, but it still upsets me even eight years later😭. Now, with that said,  for those of you looking for a vintage favourite or even something more current,   I've been going to a site called \"Surrender to Chance\".  I've found so many vintage as well as modern frags from different perfume and indie houses. They're available in different sizes, and the prices are fair. If you're really lucky, you might be able to find a bottle of your favourite perfume!  I've also bought some dupes of my favourite 80s fragrances like \"Uninhibited by Cher,\" \"Quelques Fleurs,\" and \"Lauren\" from The Fragrance Shop online.",

    "body": "My (34m) good friend (27m) is on the spectrum. I don’t know if how I’m speaking about this will come across as offensive, but he’s on the less severe side of things. He’s verbal and can read social cues decently well. The only “tells” are his stims (he rocks almost constantly if he’s sitting still, a few verbal stims, etc.) and his aversion of a few sensory related things. \n\nIt’s not something he shares with a lot of people. He got a diagnosis later in life since his parents just thought he was a weird kid while he was growing up. Him confiding in me about this didn’t change anything between us, but some of the stories he has shared broke my heart a little and have made me feel more protective of him.\n\nDue to the AC going out in his apartment and not being able to be fixed for a few days, he came to stay with my wife and I. He can’t sleep unless it’s on silk sheets, so I ran out and bought some the day he asked to sleep over. I wanted him to be as comfortable as possible - sensory issues aren’t simple requests, they’re genuine needs. My wife was already a little annoyed by that and pointed out I hadn’t done that for any of our other guests.\n\nThen halfway through his second day with us, he pulled me aside and asked me to fix whatever smell was going on in the house, that it was hurting his head and really bothering him. After some investigation on our part, we figured out it was the perfume my wife was wearing. I politely asked my wife if she would go get changed/shower so that my friend could enjoy dinner with us. She not only refused, but she tried kicking my friend out for being high maintenance. I put an end to that quickly. \n\nI realize she’s not clued in on his needs, but he is a guest in our home all the same. His diagnosis is his to share, and his alone. I have refused to budge on any of the issues. According to an email he got, the AC in the building should be back up and running again tomorrow. My wife booked a hotel for the night and is insisting that one of them - either herself or my friend - go and stay there for the night. My friend is clearly distraught over this and I just can’t send him off on his own when he’s clearly upset after all that’s happened.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: I bought the sheets instead of asking him to bring his from home because I wanted them for future use. This would allow any future guests to decide between the \"normal\" sheets and the silk ones. We never know who around us has sensory issues, or who might just want some nice sheets to sleep on for the night while they were guests in our home. I don't need to know the medical or diagnostic information of my guests in order to accommodate their needs.\n\nEDIT 2: I get the picture and accept my judgement, guys. Can we please stop the 'bad autistic person' stories going on in the top comment thread, tho?",

You might not have to explain the full diagnosis just the needs. She may have even been sympathetic and helpful.\n\n2. If you got the go ahead, then you ask your friend what his additional needs are and take your wife through them as to whether they can be accommodated. If there are hard “no” responses that cannot be worked around then you tell your friend and he knows if he chooses to stay anyway it’s his choice.\n\n3.

    "body": "My first day of RTO after being fully remote for 8 years! I am a supervisor, my team is spread throughout the country, never met any of them face to face, and we are not customer forward facing. Love back to the office grind 😍\n\nFirst, my day starts with sharing a parking space with a “parking pal”! So if you get there before your parking pal, you obviously leave before them. So, you need to awkwardly ask them to move their car so you can leave (you nose up or back up to a brick wall, so there’s no way around it). I share mine with a SES, really fun 😍😍😍 and it’s a 10 minute walk to the office where I need to be let in by someone because they’re “updating” the swipe card system, convenient 😍😍\n\nI’m a supervisor! I usually do monthly check ins over teams with the people I supervise just to see how things are going and we generally just BS. I also do our mid year calls and end of year review calls. Not to mention when things pop up, people need to just vent or chat, etc I get zero privacy due to being in a cubicle farm 😍😍😍\n\nOh it’s super hot in the office. Windows don’t open, probably because I’d jump out. Love sweating at my desk 😍😍 I had a nice standing desk at home with a treadmill underneath where I’d walk and rarely sit, if I did it was on a yoga ball.  Flat butt here I come 😍😍\n\nWater?! Oh, it’s a federal building so there’s legionella! Yum Yum 😍😍\n\nSlow internet! Really great. The one application I mainly work in took over 10 minutes to refresh 😍😍😍 efficient!!\n\nOh there was a shooting on the same block a week or so ago 😍😍 \n\nNot to mention lack of office etiquette! Speaker phones, people filing their nails, strong perfume, and stinky expired food in the fridge 😍🥰\n\nAnd to rub salt into my gaping wound, my team of almost 80 people spread throughout the country, only my supervisor (who lives in a different state and different time zone) and I are the lucky ones to secure an office cubicle 😍😍😍 \n\nI’m an efficient government employee 😍😍 love it here! Also, excuse my overuse of the heart eye emojis. I’m a millennial holding on by a thread and use dark humor to cope, the 😍😍 are holding me back from probably being thrown into a padded room. Stay efficient everyone!",

My team is scattered across multiple states. My family has one vehicle, so I ride the bus to and from work in a town where buses are not the preferred method. Yesterday I witnessed a dog fight on the bus! But more often it’s just the bus smell of pee and weed that highlights the RTO journey. While at the office, I keep an eye out for the office cockroaches who prefer to roam the walls in the 5th floor halls of my building. Sometimes I see more cockroaches than people during the day because I literally work with no one in my office. Loving my long commutes to sit in a gross building to do the same thing I did at home while missing out on that morning and evening time with my kids. Totally worth it!",

    "body": "Ok, so I’m the coworker that encouraged him to post this, unfortunately your account has to be 7days old to post here, so I gifted him an alt i made for a joke about a month ago. \n\n\n\nThis story is about 12 years old. I told it to one of my coworkers yesterday and he said i should share it to Reddit, today he again nudged me so here we are having drinks before the 4 day weekend and my writing is complete. So first time here and hi y’all. Sorry if there are typos! I included a TLDR at the end. \n\nIn college, I met the woman who I thought was my one. We dated for about 2 years and had a big ass wedding after a 10 month engagement, her family was pretty well to do in a small southern town. We were both continuing our educations and I was also working to support us. I was pursuing a masters in engineering while she was finishing her doctorate in anthropology. \n\nOver the summer an opportunity came up for her to make some extra money going as an aid on a religious studies trip to Jamaica. I didn’t hesitate when she asked me about it, I mean, she was going to get to visit Jamaica and get paid for it, I saw no downside other than missing her being at home for 6 weeks. \n\nLittle did I know at the time, but she had been fucking the professor(he had hung out with us, smoked my weed and drank my fucking beer I considered him a friend) who arranged the trip for a couple months and it was a get away for them to bang all over the island. I, clueless and happy went about the weeks while she was gone taking extra shifts so I could match what she made in our account and surprise her. What a dipshit, right? \n\nOne of the students from the trip actually seeked me out to clue me in. I didn’t believe him until I started looking for evidence on my own. I broke down and checked her texts while she was sleeping and nothing was there. There were a few VMs so I decided to listen and there it was, a message from that giant asshole saying how exciting it was that I almost caught them. I opened up her laptop and hit the emails after that, it was piles and piles of shit, making fun of me for not knowing, fucking in our bed and laughing about it. There was so much and I was so heartbroken. \n\nStill too hurt to take any action, I was lost. I had no idea what to do, so I sat on it for a couple weeks and acted as normally as I could, I noticed everything now, I felt SO stupid for not seeing it before. So many signs. One stuck out in particular. \n\nI noticed that our stash of homemade weed lube (if you’ve never tried it, I highly recommend giving it a go) was going down even though we weren’t having sex. It was obvious they were also using the fruits of my labor to get off more effectively. This really pissed me off. Like unreasonably so, Hulk fucking mad. It finally all hit me. I was a goddamn joke to these assholes and they were using the lube I made and fucking in my bed. I didn’t hurt anymore, I just wanted to make them hurt. \n\nSo, while she was “studying at the library” I made a new batch of lube. I put enough weed in it for it to smell like normal, but I also added some poison ivy from our backyard to the mixture, and after refilling the spray bottle we used for application, I waited. \n\nA few days go by and I’m working extra so i can be out of the house more, and bam, bait taken. That night after she goes to sleep my plan goes into action. I sneak her phone away and delete my contact, while replacing his phone number in his contact as mine. I go to bed but can’t sleep because it feels like I’m 5 and tomorrow is Christmas. \n\nDawn arrives and she’s in the shower. I get a text. \n\n*im super itchy are you ok?*\n\nNow Lord, now is my time. \n\n*look, I thought it had cleared up but I guess i had a flare up. I’m sorry, but I’ve got herpes, and I guess you do now too*\n\nI heard this bitch squeak in the shower. I’m covering my mouth damn near losing it. \n\nI went on to tell her that it was time to end things now, a new semester was about to start and I kind of have a little crush on another T/A. I wanted her mad, this is a woman that never got told no growing up, and never had to deal with rejection. Let alone from a balding dude in his 50s with herpes. \n\nWhen she got out of the shower it was obvious she had been crying but i could see the anger in her eyes. I could see how uncomfortable she was squirming at the table drinking coffee and mulling the situation over. Another little nudge is what she needed. The reply she got to her pages and pages of anger and sadness was: “thanks for the good times, but can you keep this a secret between us, I don’t want to ruin my chances with anyone else” she’s flush with anger now, just seething, she gathered her keys and headed out the door without even saying goodbye...\n\nI knew where she was going. \n\nI booted up her laptop and set it to reformat, deleting her dissertation and any notes pertaining to it before following her to campus, I parked a few lots over and rush over to his office where i find her screaming at him for giving her herpes. There’s lots of people there. Professors, aids, students, other faculty. I’m dying. He is beyond embarrassed and confused as fuck, she is ugly crying in front of her peers, I’m in heaven. I didn’t even care that people were going to think I had herpes too. \n\nThe fallout was apocalyptic in their department.\n\nHe lost his job due to code of conduct at the university, we got divorced the following year (state law was we had to be separated for one full year before being granted a divorce) I got to keep most of the assets (primarily savings, and not a ton, but I worked for it). She never finished her doctorate and went on to be a perpetually pregnant housewife that sells herbalife on Facebook and he teaches high school now. It took a few years for it all to unfold, but watching it was glorious. \n\n\n\nTL;DR: wife cheated, so I made her think she had herpes and engineered a social situation for her to out her affair publicly herself.\n\nEdit: a few of you are asking for a recipe for the goodies so here you go: \n\nFollow the directions for use or it’s kind of a waste, and this is totally geared towards the ladies. We’re talking big fucking Os. Use polyurethane condoms! It breaks down latex. \n\nWeed lube:\n\n1/4 ounce flower or 1 gram CO2 extracted live resin (preferred)\n\n4 oz MCT coconut oil \n\n2 16 oz mason jars \n\n3 coffee filters (only if flower is used)\n\n2 drops tea tree oil - it really makes a difference \n\n30 leaves poison ivy*\n\nSmall spray bottles- think perfume. \n\nPut oils and wax or flower in mason jar A and heat in oven for 80 minutes at 240 degrees, turn oven off and allow it to cool for about an hour. Strain through coffee filters if you used flower into the second mason jar and then fill the spray bottles. Here’s the instructions and description my current amazing wife wrote for a friend wanting to try it:\n\nAt first you can feel the warmth building up. Everything feels more intense to the touch. The waiting between application and play time is a wonderful mystery. As time progresses the butterflies in the pit of your stomach become more active, while feeling self awareness as the sensations and sensitivity increase. Walking become part of foreplay, the action causes more friction and heat to build up. As your spouse begins touching at your neck and shoulders the warmth rises up your body sending chills down your spine. Each touch becomes more euphoric than the last until foreplay is done...from there enjoy complete euphoria in your partners embrace. \n\nApplication: 8-10 total sprays. Use 2-3 on your fingers at a time. \nSelf application- spray on fingers and massage around the clitoris and labia down toward your opening working the oil inward towards your g-spot. \n\nTo help with cramps- spray on tampon, insert, go. Without tampon. Get .5 ml in a syringe, insert, spray and stay with hips lifted for 1-2 minutes. \n\nWith spouse- Have your spouse apply the spray to their fingers, gently spreading it over the clitoris, labia, pushing some into your cookie. Think of it like painting, the better the coverage, the better it will feel. Be sure to apply to your G-spot, it’s about 2 inches in on the front wall of your vagina, for an added plus, apply to the O-spot, which is directly across from the G-spot on the back wall of the vagina. Application shouldn’t take more than 3-5 minutes, then don’t even touch it for at LEAST 20 minutes. Spend this time exploring other areas of your lovely treasure. \n\nDon’t use if overly intoxicated, you’ll simply waste it. \n\n*poison ivy optional, not recommended for self use",

A few months ago my wife began pressuring me to do more around the house. Before I get an instant YTA. We already split chores and child care, admittedly, she had a bigger cut than I because she is a SAHM, but I do most of the cooking, breakfasts and Dinners, Lunch is her responsibility for her and the boys. I take out the garbage and I do laundry, and I deep clean the bathrooms once a week. I do also help with our boys homework and such.\n\nShe insists that I am not doing enough and that I should be doing more around the house. I tried having discussions with her asking what she expected from me (namely all chores and child rearing should be my duty it seems) and for months it seemed to be going no where. She used the D word more than once when speaking on this which felt manipulative.\n\nIt boiled over when we were out with friends one night, and she began talking about how I never helped out and how I use her as a house slave (her words). I will admit I saw red.\n\nThis next part is where I may be the asshole. I didn't say anything that night but the next day I asked my boss to be given reduced hours for the next little bit, due to stress.\n\nAnd I took over everything in the house. I cooked Breakfast, and made lunch for the boys before I drove them to school, I cleaned the house top to bottom, I did every dish we had twice and so on. My wife was blindingly happy, and bragged to her friend that she finally had me \"worn in\".\n\nShe Didn't lift a finger for around a month. Then she began asking why we never went on dates anymore and Complaining that she wanted to get her nails done as they were growing in. I explained that I had to take that out of our budget so we could continue to afford everything else, but we could absolutely have a movie night in, and I could paint her nails for her. She was unhappy with that solution, So I asked her if she would want to get a part time job to pay for either luxury's. You would have thought I asked if she wanted to join a cult.\n\nShe then asked if I could Just pick up more shifts at work to cover her other expenses, and used the phrase \"be a man\". Which I found more than a little insulting. I then asked her if she would be willing to go back to splitting the chores and such? Which is when she began to catch on that the two were related.\n\nShe yelled at me that I was being a manipulative asshole for doing this and even claimed it was financial \"a word\". I stood strong for a while but now I am questioning my methods, because even I feel what I did was a bit underhanded. so AITA?\n\n***Relevant Comments:***\n\n*Why are you still with her when she treats you like that?*\n\n\"I love her. With everything I got. She’s an excellent mother, and honestly before she met this friend we were both blissfully happy to the best of my knowledge.\"\n\n*How did she suddenly notice that she wasn't getting her nails done or going out on dates? Did you block the credit card from everything but the grocery store?*\n\n\"No, for one she has her own card, though we do only have one bank account. I set her nail and hair appointments, because she hates making phone calls, and she asked why I didn't take her out anymore. She could have spent from the card without saying anything I suppose but upon budgeting we would have been in trouble if 300+ was gone from a night out with friends.\"\n\n*More about his wife and their relationship:*\n\n\"She had always wanted to be a SAHM before we got together, I try not to say this part because while her two boys are not mine biologically, they are my sons, but being a single mother was incredibly taxing for her, because working in the public was too much. I had a bit of experience with being a single father myself, I have a son of my own, but I was looking to advance my career, and was more than happy to take over the bills for a lessened load at home.\"\n\n*You're paying to raise another man's children:*\n\n\"I do not like this comment. Those are my kids. No one else’s, and regardless of what happens with their mother ever, I hope those boys know that.\"\n\n*More about how things have changed:*\n\n\"Oh god, I can tell you but it may be a bit mundane. When we first got married, she would give me shoulder and back massages everyday after work, and have my favorite music playing when I opened the door, even though she hates bluegrass. She would make my coffee while I was getting dressed. She made sure to pick up extra crunchy peanut butter from the store even though I’m the only person who likes it. We would have movie night twice a week with the kids and a date night to ourselves once a week. I have always had trouble sleeping, and I don’t want to take pills for it, so she always had the bed ready for me, a heating pad already turned on, and my pajamas on the bed. She would run her fingers through my hair until I fell asleep, and would wake me up herself instead of the alarm because she knew it put me in a better mood. None of which I asked for. She’s a good wife and wanted to because she knew that that’s what I liked, and she did it. She hasn’t done a 180, some of this is still true, af least it was until I cut down my hours, that was really when she stopped doing anything at all. And right now she’s pissed so I’m on the couch. Awake and regretful. Personally I think she’s stubborn. I don’t think she even really wants it. She just wants to prove that I would do it if she asks. She has a troubled history with men, and that’s why I tend to be forgiving when things do happen.\"\n\n*Troubled history with men?*\n\n\"It’s not something I’m comfortable talking about. But believe me when I say. What happened, was not her fault.\"\n\n***OOP is voted NTA***\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/12znu7j/how_do_i_38m_explain_tohelp_my_sons_to_understand/)**: April 26, 2023 (6 days later)**\n\n**Title: How do I (38M) explain to/help my sons to understand their mother (30F) is going to Rehab.**\n\nI have never been in a situation like this. I am a former addict myself, but I didn't have children then.\n\nSee my last post for more clarification, ***(editor's note- I tried several different engines and search tactics, but couldn't find any other \"last post\" besides the AITA one)*** but the gist of it is that my wife and I recently had a blowout argument where she admitted to using two substances for several months, and has agreed to get checked into rehab, which we are currently setting up now.\n\nHow the HELL do I bring this up to them, without them being judgmental or hateful to their mother? Or worse, falling into the same mental space I am in? I don't want to lie to them, which is what my wife wants, but I am failing to see an alternative that won't destroy them or the respect they have for their mother. I am swimming blind here, and I have barely slept since this all came out. Any and all advice is appreciated. Thank you in advance.\n\n***Relevant Comments:***\n\n*I think it depends. What was she taking?*\n\n\"klonopin and adipex that she was buying from her friend. She also admitted to having tried coke and several other prescription narcotics, but those were the only two she did often.\"\n\n*Was this the friend that turned her on to radical misandry?*\n\n\"Yes. Though it’s come to light that it wasn’t misandry she was being taught but flagrant drug usage. I have told her that she goes no contact with this friend or else she will be facing divorce along with everything else.\"\n\n*How old are the kids?*\n\n9, 12, and 14.\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/user/throwaway970012390/comments/133xprp/i_yelled_at_my_wife/) **2: April 30, 2023 (10 days from OG post)**\n\n**Title: I Yelled at my wife**\n\nSee my profile for details. But I was driving my wife to the rehabilitation center we decided on. On the way she was screaming at me. About how she can’t believe I’m humiliating her like this (explaining what was happening to the boys, and making her message her dealer/friend that they would not be hanging out or using together anymore)\n\nAbout how she doesn’t want to go, and that I am a controlling monster, and how threatening her with divorce and taking primary custody of the boys was too far and I was insane, and I just took it, and took it and took it, until I just couldn’t.\n\nAnd I screamed at her. I screamed that the woman I met would have rather died than had a pillhead junkie around her sons, and how she disgusted me, and that I don’t know if she knew how much I was considering leaving her not because of the addiction but the way she was fucking acting, like she hadn’t brought drugs into our home. Around me, a former addict myself, and around OUR BOYS. That I am beginning to hate her for doing that. That she was becoming exactly what she always cried about her mother being, and that she was lucky I was here to see it before what happened to her happened to her goddamned sons.\n\nIt makes me sick to say but watching it sink in just how far she had spiraled felt good. Watching her realize that her actions have consequences was nice. She yelled a few more times, that I was an abusive asshole, or whatever, but she was still crying so I felt her heart wasn’t in it.\n\nI plan on speaking to a lawyer. I don’t want to divorce her, but I don’t know how healthy our relationship could possibly be after this. I know yelling like that was wrong, but I don’t feel bad. And that is the part that makes me think that maybe I shouldn’t be married to her anymore. For her sake and my own.\n\nI don’t know what else to do, and I’m so pissed that she detonated c-4 in every bit of our life.\n\n***Relevant Comments:***\n\n\"I believe I’m going to have to divorce her. And it’s. Wrecking me. I don’t want to. I still love her, but I don’t know if I trust myself around her, and also not to use myself. I have been closer to relapsing this week than I ever have been.\"\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/user/throwaway970012390/comments/13fk2ll/she_was_cheating/) **3: May 12, 2023 (12 days from last post, 3 weeks from first post)**\n\n**Title: She was cheating**\n\nBefore you read, please know this is a vent post. I normally would never be like this but I am beyond okay and need to get this poison out of my head before I go anywhere else with it.\n\nShe was fucking cheating. The drug dealing friend sent me fucking videos of her dancing and grinding on this ugly hick looking bastard.\n\nI am goddamned destroyed. The boys are staying with my mother for a few days, and I’m taking the next week off work.\n\nI am so done. I have never been so angry in my goddamned life.\n\nShe was so goddamned smug sending it, “in case you don’t realize you’re replaceable to her.” well the free ride stops here. I hope she can get on Medicaid for her suboxone LMFAO. I'm done.\n\nI save the video immediately and I’m going to see a lawyer asap. I can’t tell anyone yet because I want to do this shit right.\n\nThankful as FUCK my parents insisted on a prenup with what I at the time thought was an inhumane cheating clause. Never been cheated on before and I feel like tearing my goddamned hair out. I genuinely never thought she would turn out to be such a scummy piece of shit. I can not handle this. I am not physically able to handle this. I haven't been able to keep food down and I drank for the first time in over a decade last night.\n\nThen I woke up and had to pour the rest down the drain because I am about to spiral, and my boys don't need both mom and dad in rehab right now. I am so close to losing my goddamned mind.\n\nAlso, believe what you want, but stop sending me private messages about how I should take down the posts or that posting about my personal relationship with my wife is wrong- please. Leave me be it will not work. This is the only place I can talk about this shit.\n\n**Editor's note:** OOP clarifies the kid situation/who is related to who\n\n\"Two of my three sons are stepsons, but I adopted them, (they never had a father due to their bio dad being an absolute piece of shit) My biological son is the youngest and was born to a girlfriend who is not in the picture and doesn’t want to be. My sons are 9, 12, and 14. She had two jobs when I met her, though though were both shit jobs, and I had been looking into finding her a better one. When it comes to the dealer, she was getting the drugs from her friend who is a woman, and a few of the men who she cheated with.\"\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/153p4xk/my_soon_to_be_exwife_is_in_the_hospital_after_a/) **4:** **July 19, 2023 (3 months from OG post)**\n\n**Title: My Soon to be ex-wife is in the hospital after a suicide attempt, and I feel like a monster.**\n\nYou can read my other posts for more context on what happened to get here, if you like, but the short of it is, I was blind to my wife’s addiction until she admitted it, and went to rehab, while she was in rehab, I was sent evidence that she had been cheating, often, and with more than one person.\n\nI have been working on filing for divorce, while she’s in rehab, not just for the cheating, but because with that on top of everything else, and myself nearly sinking back into my own addiction due to the stress of the situation, I couldn’t stand to even think of her anymore, and there’s no healthy relationship that has room for that mind set.\n\nI honestly didn’t want to be in a room with her again, to try mediation or counseling due to the fact that the last time I was alone with her I raised my voice, and at the time even felt she deserved it. (I of course now know that me doing that was terrible, and could be considered abuse, yet another reason I should not be in a relationship with this woman.)\n\nI moved all of her belongings to our guest room, minus the pills I found hidden in her beside table. I took pictures of those in their hiding spot then flushed them.\n\nI also removed her from my Bank account and credit cards.\n\nI spoke to my boys, explaining the situation without demonizing their mother to the best of my ability, and they seemed to understand I have no intention of abandoning them, and blood or not, they were my sons.\n\nThen she came home. The boys were, and still are away at camp, a birthday present paid for by my mother. She was quiet. Eyes on the ground after the moment I picked her up at the facility all the way home. Once we got home, I led her to the guest room silently, and she didn’t take it well, crying before she could even take the first step.\n\nThroughout the next couple weeks, I let her get settled, and though I stayed carefully neutral, I know she could tell something was coming, but I wanted to do be as fair as possible, and try to let her get used to being out before I said anything, as that was one thing I myself hated about when I left rehab, everything was flying at me so fast, I didn’t have time to breathe.\n\nFinally, I asked her to sit on the couch and I began explaining to her that I do not believe I can continue being married to her, and that I wanted divorce.\n\nI should have known her reaction was all wrong, she didn’t say anything at all, she only nodded, and cried quietly as I spoke, I explained that I did not intend to hurt her, but I could not be married to her anymore, and that maybe both of us should focus on being the best parents we can be.\n\nI told her I had no intentions of kicking her out, and that because of our prenup the divorce should be cut and dry, and she should be safe to begin looking for employment now, and once she has a job I will help her find an apartment.\n\nAt this, she stood and walked to her room. I let her, because I thought she must have been overwhelmed, and this talk could wait. She didn’t come out at dinner time, and I weighed whether I should leave her alone or not. Eventually, I decided to knock on the door, and ask if she was hungry.\n\nLong story short. She had smuggled pills into my house somehow (or she had a stash I was unaware of), and had an overdose, and was dead for several minutes in the ambulance, and she’s in a medically induced coma, because the doctors aren’t sure exactly how much damage she’s done to her brain, from what they’ve said.\n\nI feel like an absolute monster. Like I am the scum of the earth. Like I should have just said nothing. Like I should have just dealt with it. Just. Held it in, and stayed.\n\nI am responsible for this and it kills me. I may not have the same love for her as I did, but I do feel so very sorry for everything she’s been through. It’s killing me. I haven’t told my sons yet, and I am debating waiting until they’re back from camp, so they can have a little more time without this on their minds on top of everything else.\n\nI am sorry for the grammar and such, I don’t have the energy to edit this, but wanted to get this off my chest.\n\n***Relevant Comments:***\n\n*Where's her family?*\n\n\"Not my story to tell but she doesn’t have much family alive, and the ones who are she’s no contact with. She has other friends, but I don’t know which ones were enabling. They all know what’s going on, I messaged all her friends, except the dealer, though she knows now I know from messages she sent me. She hasn’t shown up to the hospital though, possibly because she thinks I would throw her out, which I would be tempted to do, to be entirely honest. A couple of her other friends visit all the time.\"\n\n\"Yes, she’s no contact with her mother ironically because of her mothers addiction, and bad treatment of her. The rest constantly insisted she should see her mother, and two times even took her boys to her mothers house without her permission\"\n\n*One more clarification on the kids:*\n\n\"Yes, because all of our children are from previous relationships. I have adopted the two eldest, who aren’t mine biologically.\"\n\n*Why he did it at that point:*\n\n\"I wanted to do it while she’s in rehab, but my therapist told me to reconsider so I did. I was so angry when I found out about the cheating I wanted to take her belongings to her dealers house and leave them there, but I knew that was wrong. I knew that once my anger wore off I would regret it. So now all I want to get the divorce started and overwith as soon as possible, so that I can begin trying to pick up the pieces and move on with my life. On top of that? I didn’t want to lead her on, and I could tell that she knew something was coming because I can’t even stand her touching me anymore, it makes me physically ill. If I had known she was going to kill herself I could have closed my eyes and grit my teeth, and let her do whatever, but honestly even now, after what she did, I know that isn’t feasible for me. I still found myself wanting to start fights, to yell, and I know that I am not a strong enough person to be in a relationship with someone who hurt me that much, who disrespected me, my home, and my children that much, who took my own past experiences with drugs into account so little that she brought them into my home, directly under the nose of myself and my children (pun intended). This is as much kindness as I can afford to extend to her anymore for my own mental healths sake.\"\n\n***OOP's comments on July 24 (5 days later)***\n\n\"Not awake yet, I took the advice of some of the commenters, and went to go get my boys, to see if they wanted to see their mother, I explained the situation to the best of my ability, age-appropriate, and asked if they wanted to see her, they all agreed to see her eventually, but the eldest only wanted to go to support his brothers. I'm concerned about the anger he is building towards his mother, and I do intend to talk to him about it, but I also don't want to tell him how to feel, or tell him that his feelings are bad and wrong, I was already working to get them into therapy, but I'm going to expedite that.\"\n\n*Cheating:*\n\n\"There have been multiple pictures/videos of her dancing on/being inappropriate with men since that post. I haven’t blocked the friend because she sent me a large amount of proof of infidelity, for the divorce. And in that post the hick she was dancing on was a man, perhaps you are confused because her woman friend sent the video? Perhaps my wording was bad, I apologize. And yes. I do know that trauma is the gateway to addiction, as I am an addict and my own CSA from my uncle and general abuse from both my parents (we went to counseling during my rehab and our relationship is much better now, but growing up was very bad). I cant say I know what made her start using, but I can say I know she had a rough childhood and even worse teen years. Editing to add; regardless of sexual identity if I found out my wife was engaging in sexual acts with women I would also consider it cheating?\"\n\n\"She was doing other sexually inappropriate things. But no, I didn't get any straight up sex tapes. I would rather not go into it further, but I think you can get my drift.\"\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Final Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1aptc9k/my_wife_is_dead/)**: February 13, 2024 (7 months later)\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n**Title:** My Wife Is Dead\n\nMy wife is dead. I haven't updated in a while, and I'm sorry. But, I'm sure you can guess why I wasn't feeling up to it. I know that everyone said that she was manipulating me or trying to make me stay with her, but honestly, even if that was the case, it didn't matter, because the moment she woke up we both started crying, and talking, and we didn't stop for days.\n\nShe went back into rehab for a little while, came out and we did both Couples and solo therapy for both of us. She seemed happy. She seemed better, and I had hoped that the crazy was over, that we would just be happy again. I didn't update then because frankly, I was scared how everyone would react, I don't do well at getting yelled at. She promised me that if anything happened, if there was \\*anything\\* she needed to talk to me about she wouldn't hesitate.\n\nEverything was going well, and now when I ask myself if there were signs she would go back or that she never stopped the answer is NO. Nothing except the fact that she had an overdose at her friend's house while I was working and died on her couch.\n\nThe friend didn't even want to call an ambulance, her boyfriend had to convince her to. I don't think either of them were arrested that day, but I know from the paper she was picked up a couple of months ago for selling. Everyone kept telling me to go to the police, and frankly, maybe I should have, but frankly, with the way the police act, it wouldn't do much good.\n\nSince then, I have been drifting terribly. I took up smoking again, something I quit before I got married because she hated the smell. I hate it now too, the smell, I mean, but the hand-to-mouth is nice. My sons are in therapy and are taking the loss as well as they could be expected to. The younger two talk about her a lot, but the eldest is mostly angry. I'm thankful he doesn't seem to want to say things to his brothers about it, but I always let him tell me anything he's thinking, even when it breaks my heart. I know that maybe everyone here has an idea of who my wife was, but one thing that you could never deny was how much she loved our boys. They were her pride and joy, absolutely everything to her.\n\nI miss her. I miss her so much it feels like a death rattle to breathe. There's never music when I get home anymore and I hate it. I hate the quiet so much that some days before I go inside I sit in the car and just cry because I know she won't be there. I haven't even been able to clean out her side of the bathroom yet, it hurts too much to think about getting rid of her perfume, or her toothbrush.\n\nI haven't felt like writing for obvious reasons but there's something that feels important now so I will. Valentine's Day is tomorrow. On the way home from work recently, I caught myself calculating flower prices, before I remembered that I have no one to give them to unless I put them on her grave. I remember being pissed off at how expensive roses were getting, and now that seems so silly. I just wanted to say, if you have someone you love, please cherish them. Do something extra nice for the person you love tomorrow, for my sake.\n\nNothing crazy, but maybe you can dance around the living room to your song, or read to each other? Something soft, or good, to let them know you're real, and really, really there. I know that's so cliche and corny and if Alex were here now she would actively bully me, haha. But sadly, the old bastards were always right. Life \\*is\\* short.\n\nIsn't that a kick in the ass?\n\n***Relevant Comments:***\n\n*Smoking:*\n\nI know I should quit smoking, I don't do it in the house, because the smell really does make me sick after a while. I only really do it at night, or in the early mornings. I'm considering getting one of those \"flavored air\" ones that are going around, with no smoke or whatever, so I can keep the hand-to-mouth thing, which I like a lot, and missed. Not the best compromise, but it's something.\n\n*Try widow support on reddit:*\n\nI might, honestly, thank you. Any kind of emotional support right now is gonna be welcome. It's hard for me to be emotional around my boys because I hate to make them feel like they're ever in a position where \\*they\\* need to take care of \\*me\\*, (Poor kids have been through enough without me losing it) but I've been such a mess that they've caught me crying in my car more often than I'd like. Not to imply that I refuse to cry around them at all, just. I hate them seeing exactly how much of a wreck I am.\n\n*Are you in therapy?*\n\nI'm in therapy, but it's a long process, especially considering I'm a former addict myself. The entire situation has aged me a decade in a year.\n\n*As someone who's dad went through similar shit: cry in front of them. It's ok.*\n\nI can try. It just always makes me feel so guilty. I know I shouldn't, but I always just think to myself \"What are you doing? You're meant to be taking care of them, not the other way around.\" I hate to think that they ever feel the need to walk on eggshells around me because I'm too much of a wreck to handle something. I know that's a bad answer, but it's true. It just always comes around to the face that those are my boys and I am their dad. I am supposed to be stronger than this for them. And I don't mean to imply that crying is weak or wrong, I just don't know how to turn \"Its okay to cry,\" into \"It's okay \\*for me\\* to cry\" in my head. Then of course I mostly mean now, after everything. At the funeral, there was no helping it, and for the first few days after that I was such a mess my parents came to stay with us because they were concerned I wasn't sleeping.\n\n*This exchange (OOP and the commenter who wrote the above statement about crying:)*\n\nCommenter: Yeah. You can’t help your feelings. But I am sure your little dude has feelings and when he sees you not exhibiting those same feelings he may think that those feelings are wrong. But that could be my own baggage.\n\nDo what you need to for yourself my dude. But that just stood out to me.\n\nOOP: Thank you, genuinely. I will keep that in mind. I hadn't fully considered that, if I'm being honest, but I can work on it.\n\n*One last thought from OOP:*\n\nNot defending her is so hard for me, but that was the first thing my therapist told me, when I asked about my sons. That defending her to them wasn't going to help, and that all I could do was let them talk.\n\nMy eldest is the only one who really rages about it, but the younger two will eventually, I'm sure. I am also angry, in this helpless kind of way that hurts so bad I can't stand to think about it, because if she had just \\*talked to me\\* I could have helped her, and she would still be here. I am a former addict myself, and I know I made so many mistakes with my wife, but I swear it was like everything was so good again. We slept in the same bed again, and had dates. Everything in my mind just wants to scream and beg to know why she would do this and I can't.\n\nI hate it so much because I tried so very hard not to love her anymore when she was alive, and it didn't work then. I don't see myself doing any better now that she's gone. And it hurts even worse because when other people are mad, or say negative things \\*I still\\* want to defend her, to explain every little reason she had, and why it wasn't all her fault but in the end it doesn't even matter if I do because she is gone. She won't be here to reap the benefits of that defense, or even to care that I changed minds. She won't be here to be respected, or disrespected. It feels pointless, but I \\*still\\* want to and it makes me feel like a fucking moron.\n\n**Editor's note:**\n\nMost comments have been fine- thanks for that.\n\nBut Jesus Christ some of you need to remember to keep it civil in the comments. OOP may read these, but beyond that I FUCKING READ THESE as do many others. No need to be fucking rejoicing that a woman is dead or telling him he's an idiot or deserved this for having an addiction previously. Or that addicts are the scum of the earth and deserve death. Wtf is wrong with you? And some of those comments are fucking upvoted?",

He used to say that I looked ugly with makeup on, that I had low self esteem and the only way to conquer the low self esteem was to stop putting makeup on, and high heels. \n\nHe met me like that. But still wanted to change me, and instead of saying it was due to his own insecurities he put it onto me, like I had some lack in my personality. \n\nI still miss him, I still love him. I was so trauma bonded to that beautiful toxic mean mess. I didn’t even know it was wrong the things he told me. He was so good at outing the blame on me. I apologized for every single thing that happened. Even things I had nothing to do with. I still struggle in life thinking things that happens to my colleagues when I’m not even with them is my fault. I know it’s because of my ex. Yet I miss him. \n\nReading what your boyfriend says to you brought up a lot of memories for me. I want you to read your story out loud, like it’s someone else’s story. What do you think? Do you think a woman you love and care for, deserves to hear the things he says? My bet is that your answer is no. No one deserves that. \n\nYou can choose to love him while loving yourself MORE, and still walk away while loving him. Someone thought you growing up that love means to choose. That love means you cannot love yourself while loving someone else. That’s not true. You absolutely can and will be able to walk away and love yourself more, long before you stop loving this man. And it’s going to be rough, it’s going to be hard, but it’s going to be worth it. \n\nRepeat after me: \n\n“I love you, but I love me more”. \n\nGo get life, put your makeup on and walk away like the queen you are.

She asked our parents to buy plane tickets for them but they refused because they already give her a lot of money every month that she wastes.\n\nFor my birthday they got me an iPhone 13 Pro. She got angry and called them assholes for refusing to buy the plane tickets for her while giving me an expensive gift\n\nI told her the best thing our parents bought me before this iPhone was a book that I didn't even want and that they always \"forgot\" about my birthday even if I talked about it for months before. I reminded her that she always got anything that she asked for regardless if it was her birthday (expensive clothes, toys, phones, perfume, make-up and even a fucking car for her 16th birthday) and they still give her a monthly allowance which they have never gave me.\n\nShe picked up the box and left. I sat there in shock because I couldn't believe what she was doing. My parents kept yelling at her to come back but she ignored them and drove away. I've been calling and texting her non-stop to give me the phone back. She texted back telling me to keep dreaming and blocked my number.\n\nI informed my parents I was going to call the cops on her but they told me not to do it because they'll get me a new one. The only reason they started treating me nicely and getting me a birthday gift is because after she left for college they found out they had another child in the house that they are supposed to care for and love. Even the phone I currently have I bought after working all summer last year because they always refused buying me one no matter how cheap it was (my sister got one when she was 11)\n\nEven though my parents didn't like what she did they still looked for reasons to excuse her behavior like saying that she was probably just stressed after her exams and how she's been looking forward going to the concert. They even started blaming themselves for refusing to buy the plane tickets in the first place.\n\nI really want to call the cops on her despite their refusal because who says she isn't going steal from me in the future.",

        "body": "So as we can see being debated in most of the comments - the cops may or may not do anything and that may or may not be dependent on whether or not your parents are willing to press charges. \n\nYour parents have already made it clear that they will always protect your sister and refuse to hold her accountable for her actions. \n\nRegardless of the outcome with police, your parents will also be very upset at you for attempting to make your sister face consequence by getting the police involved. \n\nWhich means they will no longer replace the phone, or do anything else like they have been since your sister has left the house. \n\nIs it the morally right thing to call the cops on someone for stealing from you? Yes. Should your sister have to face consequences from her actions? Yes. Is this the hill you need to die on? Absolutely not. Not today. \n\nYou are in an abusive situation and you need to put yourself first. Your sister will eventually burn all her bridges on her own. You do not need to soak them in kerosene to speed up that process. Especially not at the expense of your own welfare. \n\nTake the replacement your parents are offering. Take any money or help or gifts they give you for the last year that you’re with them. You are so close to graduating high school, and being able to leave the house with a foundation to succeed in college or work. Build that with a new phone that will last you a few years, and whatever other support you can get out of your parents while your sister is away. \n\nYou can go NC and scorched earth on them and your sister AFTER you no longer rely on these people for housing and food, etc. I understand that it is ethically gray and morally reprehensible to put up with this bullshit, and it is taxing on your emotional and mental health. But life is fucking hard and you need at least a high school diploma and a place to live in order to have any chance of success. If you do not have the ability to leave your home - either living with a friend until graduation, or getting your high school diploma and a job or a spot in college/trade school/etc. - you need to bide your time and pick your battles until you can get out.\n\nETA: NTA and ty for the awards. Idk which ones cost money but please do not spend actually $ on internet points. It’s much better spent donated to a domestic violence or homeless youth shelter.",

After this your first goal is to become financially independent by yourself. That doesn't mean you need to start working immediately to earn some money.

Make your future better as per your wish and then get out from your family. [This paragraph is a collation of my thoughts and the suggestion commented by others in this post]\n\nRemember that when you will start earning lot of money in future, your parents or your sister might come back to you for your money and at this point never blindly give them away whatever they are asking for. Just think twice and think logically that whether they are contacting you just to get money out from you for their benifits.

    "body": "**My coworker won’t stop telling me that I smell**\n\n**Originally posted to Ask A Manager**\n\n[Original Post](https://www.askamanager.org/2017/04/my-coworker-keeps-telling-me-that-i-smell.html)  **Apr 11, 2017**\n\nI enjoy wearing perfume, but tend to stick to indie oil scents, since the smell tends to stick closer to my skin (so, in theory, I don’t bother my coworkers) and also because I seem to be sensitive to the alcohol that a lot of spray perfumes use. I also tend to use unscented deodorant and laundry detergent; I really dislike how “chemical-y” scented products like this tend to be.\n\nAbout a month ago, one of my coworkers told me that the perfume I was wearing bothered her. I work closely with her, so I immediately apologized and washed it off, and haven’t worn any of my perfume since. I don’t have a huge wardrobe, so most if not all of my office-appropriate clothes have been washed since then, so I’m pretty sure that there are no lingering traces hanging on.\n\nMy problem is that this coworker is now complaining constantly about the perfume I’m not wearing! She even went to my manager, who pulled me aside and asked me about things like deodorant and bath products. I’ve tried to explain to my coworker that basically nothing I use is scented anymore, but she makes exaggerated sniffing noises and says things like, “Oh, patchouli AGAIN?” when I get near her. (Again, I am not wearing ANY perfume, my deodorant is unscented, I shower every morning and my body wash is lightly lemon scented and doesn’t stick around.) It’s reached the point where it feels like juvenile bullying and I honestly don’t know what to do.\n\n[Update](https://www.askamanager.org/2017/12/update-my-coworker-wont-stop-telling-me-that-i-smell.html)  **Dec 13, 2017**\n\nSo, this is actually hilarious. After posting to AAM, I decided to try one final de-smellification and see what happened. I found a relatively cheap unscented body wash, and, since the weather had finally turned hot for the summer, got my summer clothes out of storage. I don’t wear any of my “heavy” scents in the summer, so none of those clothes have been touched by the foul scourge that (apparently) is patchouli. All my coats, gloves, scarves, etc, went into storage.\n\nMonday: I go into work wearing summer clothes – coworker makes a comment. I go into my manager’s (who is fortunately a super chill lady) office and ask her to smell me. She knows what’s going on with coworker, and agrees. Gets very close, sniffs, confirms that I am “almost creepily unscented” (her words).\n\nTuesday: coworker says something again. I ask another coworker who didn’t know what was going on if she will sniff my cube. (Thank goodness all this happened during a slow week!) In front of coworker, she walks around my cube, sniffing my chair and desk. Coworker looks embarrassed.\n\nWednesday: coworker says something AGAIN! I lose my patience and tell her, “Look, [coworker], you are clearly the only one smelling anything in this cube. Maybe you should go to the doctor and get checked for a brain tumor or something. Maybe you’re pregnant.” Coworker doesn’t respond, and so I look up to find her looking absolutely STUNNED. Like, the world could have exploded right then and I doubt she would have noticed. She’s super distracted the rest of the day.\n\nThursday: coworker calls in sick.\n\nFriday: I wake up to a $50 gift card for my favorite indie shop in my email. I come in and coworker literally hugs me. Turns out — she’s pregnant! Apparently she and her partner have been trying for a while and it finally took, and sometimes pregnant women just develop insane senses of smell. I didn’t even actually know that, one of the commenters here suggested it and I was just so irritated that I threw it out there without thinking.\n\nThe weird thing is that she swears she does actually smell something. I believe her, but have literally no idea what it could be. She was just being kind of a jerk with the sniffing thing, even though she can smell it, it doesn’t bother her and she said she thought it was funny to watch me freak out. Manager has talked to her about not taunting the coworkers. Right now she’s so overjoyed that I don’t think she could be mean to anyone, but I guess we’ll see what happens after about month five or six!\n\nAnyway, thank you for your advice and the really helpful comments on your site!\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP's OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**",

The facility I work at is pretty big as we’re a 24 hour emergency hospital.  We’re also on the phones throughout the day. There’s a lot of phones in a lot of locations, and since we’re moving around a lot, we end up on many of them throughout the day. \n\nAnywho. One girl who smoked, used to use patchouli to cover it up. She just ended up like cigarette patchouli…but I digress. She must have used an oil and rubbed it on her neck? Idk. But EVERY SINGLE PHONE IN THAT PLACE smelled like her. And if you used the phone, you also got the joy of smelling like her. And as it would turn out, ALL of the phones became covered in patchouli oil. \n\nIt was so bad that you could literally taste it in your mouth if she was in the room. You couldn’t escape from it. Everyone would desperately try to find someone, *anyone*, who wasn’t her to help them restrain an animal due to not wanted to smell like patchouli for the rest of eternity. It was BAD. She eventually got talked to, but all she did was tone it down, which did nothing for the oil getting on the phones….so our problem never really went away. \n\nIn fact, she ended up quitting. It took almost a year before we couldn’t smell it on the phones anymore. (I should mention, the phones all have a rubber thing stuck to the back of the receiver so it fits more comfortably between your shoulder and your ear when not holding it. The rubber must have absorbed that oil like a fucking sponge). \n\nIt’s been quite a few years since she’s been gone. But still, every once in a while, a newer employee will comment on how they keep smelling patchouli whenever they’re on the phone and can’t figure out where it’s coming from.  Us old timers just laugh. \n\nAnywho. That’s the reason I get physically sick to my stomach and get a raging headache, at the slightest hint of patchouli in the air. Which is a shame.

    "body": "So I got married last weekend. \n\nNot gonna lie, it was a bit of a nightmare from start to finish. My partner and I are going to run off and have an elopement ceremony in a few months because it was so bad. Maybe I'll make a post about that later but right now I'm still a bit too gutted about it. \n\nHowever, my brother invited his new girlfriend. She's got her own online business where she sells makeup and perfumes or something. She's a \"work from my phone\" girl. Anyway, our venue had a strict no phone policy during the ceremony, and I asked for nothing to be posted on social media about the wedding (family drama). \n\nToday I received an email from her with an \"invoice\" for £500. I gave her a call (she'd put her number on the email) and said to her that I wasn't in the mood for jokes about my wedding, trying to give her an out before she started some more drama, but she doubled down on it. Apparently she'd missed a message from a girl who wanted to join her team, and so the girl had signed up under someone else- due to my no-phone no-socials wedding, causing her to miss out on the commission. \n\nAnyway, I said I wasn't paying it, and that I'm hurt she would even ask. She then said that, if I joined her team, she would waive the invoice. Fine. I'll join if it will shut you up. Except apparently I now have to pay £60 for some starter pack with hundreds of perfume samples in it, even though I'm allergic to perfume. Also she expects me to post about it all over social media, despite my desire to avoid other people right now.Turns out she would also essentially be my \"boss\" and I don't want to work for her as I'm already in a career of my own that I'm passionate about, that isn't sales or recruitment, and isn't commission based.\n\nI just can't stop crying. My wedding was ruined, my social life has taken a hit from that drama, and now this bitch is going to cause drama between me and my brother if I don't join her shitty company. I hate how I couldn't just get married and be happy. My husband has been so supportive, but I feel so terrible that it's my side of everything that causes all the drama. \n\nI'm not going to join it, I know I just can't, but the drama of it all has just got me absolutely wrecked. I just want to run away with my husband and never speak to my friends and family again. \n\nSorry for the rant, I needed somewhere to vent seeing as I've already cried my husbands shoulder off already.",

We had a planned c-section but our daughter decided she couldn’t wait and I called him all morning, confused and terrified, in pain because I was scheduled 2 weeks later. My mum finally got a hold of him. He smelled disgusting. My Way. A perfume that I really hate. He looked more guilty than excited and he smelled disgusting. Anyway when we got home I looked in his phone and found out about them. I don’t know how he has been able to fool me or was I just blind? I told him that I knew and he tried to deny it and I didn’t argue. When I didn’t argue he probably felt relieved that I had dropped it or maybe he thought I believed him. \n\nOne day he came home late and he smelled of Our Way again and I broke down crying and begging him to stop. To choose our family. To choose me. I love you. He just denied it again and I didn’t argue again. I told him that I hated what he was doing and that I hated her disgusting perfume. I don’t think it mattered because he was “working late” again not a week later. \n\nThe day after new year’s day, I took my children to town because I convinced myself that I needed to do some shopping. I found myself walking around his office around lunchtime looking inside restaurants. I thought that after the holidays keeping them apart they would be wanting to have lunch together on their first day at work. My heart was racing and my stomach churning. I thought that if I saw them together I would faint or even die but none of this happened. I found them as I expected in the restaurant he used to take me to whenever I visited him. I was surprised that the hurt and humiliation I was expecting and fearing didn’t come. Instead, I felt calm and relief. Like something big and heavy was lifted from my heart. I even felt embarrassed that he was as predictable as I thought. I think I stopped having any feelings for him right that moment. It reeked of My Way in the whole restaurant or maybe I just imagined it. I told them that I wasn’t there to cause trouble but that I needed to see for myself. I told her that she had won and that now she could have him. I told him that if he followed after me that I would scream because he was about to.\n\nWhen he got home he wanted to talk. I told him that I wasn’t angry or hurt anymore. He could be with her. For almost two weeks now they have been arguing and fighting over text because he ended the affair. I will never understand how some people function. Why weren’t my tears and pleas enough for him to end it but my blessings were?",

If you let him stay, you are setting the precedent. \n\nDon't forgive him. Kick him out. Don't let him teach your daughter that she should expect to be cheated on and will be expected to forgive.",

I'm not the OP.\n\n[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gy79dx/boyfriend_wont_stop_telling_me_i_have_bo/)\n\n \n\n# Boyfriend won’t stop telling me I have B.O.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have been with my boyfriend for over a year and everything has been great except for one thing. Every single day, at least once, he will tell me that I stink and smell of b.o.\n\nWhen we met I showered every day, applied regular deodorant in the morning, brushed my teeth three times a day. Now I am so paranoid about smelling bad that I shower at least twice a day, I apply new industrial strength deodorant every few hours (I have a reminder on my phone), perfume, and I brush my teeth anytime I eat or drink something that isn’t water.\n\nI feel like I’m going crazy. I didn’t think I smelled bad in the beginning and I don’t think I smell bad now but I obviously smell bad to him right? Im that weirdo that keeps “sneakily” smelling their own armpits. I have been to the doctor and he has said there is nothing medically wrong. It has honestly gotten to the point where I literally shove my arm pit in friends and families faces asking if I smell bad, they all say I don’t smell like b.o. at all, one friend even said I smelled too clean like a lush store.\n\nI am getting so paranoid. He won’t cuddle or anything when he says I smell. I really don’t know what more I can do?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**OOP edits the post to add an update and.... WOW.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate - so unexpected edit. I waited for him to make a comment this morning so I could talk to him. It was less than an hour after waking up that he said “god you stink” I had already showered and put on deodorant. I snapped and asked what exactly was he smelling because, at this point I’m one of the cleanest people on the planet and if I still smell bad to him then we should just break up.\n\nHe got all panicked and upset, I eventually got out of him that this is what he father always said to his mother. Apparently his father told him that is was a sure fire technique to have a woman never leave you because “she will feel too low to cheat, will love only you, and will always be clean”.\n\nNeedless to say, his father is wrong. He’s packing his things and moving out of my house today.",

Thanks to u/BakingGiraffeBakes for the rec.\n\n# Do NOT comment on Original Posts. Latest update is 7 days old.\n\n**Mood Spoiler:** >!OOP makes the right choice!<\n\n**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fl1buf/aitah_for_wanting_to_go_through_with_a_divorce/)**: September 19, 2024**\n\nAfter returning from a month long trip to Florida with her friends she decided to tell me how unhappy she was and wanted to talk about divorce. Also mentioned to one of our kids that she was going to retire early and return to Florida and live on the beach. I cannot retire for another 13 years and she knows this.\n\nShe has always been secretive with her phone. Sleeps with it under her pillow and carries it with her everywhere in the house. Started to take 3 hours walks where she would shower, change clothes, and put on perfume before going. Had regular discussions with me about how we should divide everything in the divorce. During this discussions I would also get a reminder of how unhappy she is.\n\nAs negotiations continued it was decided that I would keep the house so she could keep all of her retirement for her future beach life. She also made two return trips to Florida in a month span. Supposedly by herself but she was very cryptic about them. The last one she did not tell the kids about them and did not communicate to them for the whole 5 days.\n\nFinal red flag is when she accidentally sent a text to our daughter with a sexually explicit message that I assume was meant for her boyfriend or affair partner. Now that it is time for her to move out she doesn’t want to get a divorce. AITAH for wanting to follow through with it?\n\n***Top Comment:***\n\n**Harvard\\_Diplomat:** She didn't change her mind. Sounds like her new BF in FL didn't work out.\n\n***There is no consensus bot on AITAH, but a majority were NTA***\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fl93ot/update_for_aitah_for_wanting_to_continue_with/)**: September 20, 2024 (Next Day)**\n\nUpdate: I am a real person. Yes, I did confront her about all of this but she still denies it. Claims message was meant for me.\n\nHowever, I never received it other than the screenshot from when I was informed about it. Asked her why she doesn’t just go live with this person unless he is married too. Also told her that I am not a placeholder until she can move in with this guy or find a new one if he bailed. Already spoke to a lawyer earlier this week when she was all in on the divorce.\n\nI feel there is no going back after this and want to see the divorce through to the end. She started the cold feet routine soon after meeting with the attorney. Yes, I know asking the question here makes me seem like an idiot. All of her actions did make me angry and I wasn’t ignoring them. Thank you everyone for your thoughts on the matter.",

    "body": "I only knew Michelle for a month, but it was truly a month to remember. I first met her when she was carving out my high school bully’s eye with a butter knife, and we were more or less inseparable after that.\n\nShe was a few years older than me, so of course I fell instantly in love, but I knew deep down we were destined for friendship and little else. I knew this deep down because she made it clear that she was gonna die in roughly a month. *Can’t love a dead chick*, she’d say.\n\nAt first I thought it was just a clever way to avoid the awkwardness of turning me down, but at some point I came close to believing her. It was just something about her, something extremely...free. Careless and unconfined. Refreshingly brave and outspoken and honest.\n\nWhen I met her I was going through the most depressing period of my life. I was constantly bullied and belittled at school, my younger twin sisters were both hospitalized, each needing a transplant to survive (Jenna needed a heart, Chloe needed kidneys), and my parents had their hands full covering the medical expenses. I think we all in our own ways were on the verge of just giving up, of just letting go.\n\nI was saved by Michelle. I have no doubt about it. If she hadn’t shown up when Brett was beating the shit out of me, I would have killed myself that day. I was just so sick of it, sick of the beating, sick of the abuse, sick of being alone. But Michelle came out of nowhere, threw him into the wall, knocked his nose half-way up his brain, and proceeded to dig out his left eye with the aforementioned cutlery. He never touched me again.\n\nYou’d think she’d get into to trouble after doing something like that. But it was never reported. Brett claimed it had been an accident, that he’d crashed with his moped. I think he feared that Michelle would kill him if he said otherwise. I for one have no doubt she would have. That was just who she was.\n\nMichelle never went to school. She said it was because she knew she was gonna die. Why bother with bullshit like school then. No, she was all about enjoying life to the fullest, kicking assholes in the face, fucking over people who fucked over others. She wanted to leave this world a better place than she found it, and by her logic this was done exclusively by ridding it of shitbags, one way or another.\n\n“How do you *know* you’re gonna die?” I asked her once.\n\n“My parents tell me,” she said, “Every day. And they’re good for their word.”\n\nShe wouldn’t explain it in detail. Just that she was raised knowing the exact date and time of her death, down to the very second. And that it was meant to be. That’s what they told her. In death, her life would have meaning.\n\nAt first I didn’t think much of it, you know. She was a crazy girl, and she always said weird stuff like that. I was kinda banking on it all being some bizarre joke or something, but when the month drew to a close, I was getting really worried it might all be true. I’d grown too attached to her. Every minute I wasn’t at school or the hospital was spent with her, and the thought of losing her, my only friend, made me horribly depressed.\n\nThat last week I was really on edge. The twins were in bad shape, and my parents were spending every waking minute at the hospital. They had yet to find any donor matches, and time was running out. It felt like my time was running out too. The dark thoughts were returning, and I started imagining how I would kill myself should Michelle ever leave me.\n\nI found it strange that she’d never invited me home. I mean, friends do that, right? Invite each other over. She’d been to our house several times, she even crashed on the couch a few times, and we would often watch movies there, raid my parents liquor-cabinet, get wasted and generally just have fun. But I’d never been to her house. Not once. I didn’t even know where she lived.\n\nSo one night I just decided to follow her. What was there to lose, really? Maybe I could get some answers from her parents or something. Some way to explain why she was so convinced she was dying. Maybe they lied to her? Some sort of cult? A way to form her beliefs into accepting the unacceptable. A way to control her.\n\nI stalked her for thirty minutes, lurking in the shadows as she paced down the streets. When she headed to the outskirts I started getting worried, and when she took the narrow trail through the forest I was almost having a full on panic-attack. Where the hell was she heading? As far as I knew, there weren’t any houses for miles.\n\nAbout halfway into the forest, I suddenly lost her. It was like she vanished without a trace. I walked back and forth, up and down, but there was just no sign of her at all. Eventually I had to give up and return home, my mind growing ever darker.\n\nI remember the last day like it was yesterday. Every minute of it, crisp and clear and vivid in my mind. Every scent, every sound, every muscle moving on her perfect face, all those smiles and kind words. Everything.\n\nThe last day came and went, but I didn’t *know* it was the last day. If I’d known, I would have told her how much I cared for her, how much she meant to me, how much I owed her my life and sanity. Without her I wouldn’t be alive. But I didn’t know, and I never told her. I hope she somehow realised it, that she could see it in my eyes and actions every day, but I can never be sure.\n\nShe just acted so normal, you know. She was Michelle that day too. Same carefree spirit, the same wild, devil-may-care attitude. We spent the afternoon smoking weed, watching silly cartoons, laughing and just enjoying each others company.\n\nBut when she left, I knew something was up. I don’t know how. I guess there was some detail, some little thing that alarmed me, but having replayed and analyzed that day over and over in my mind, I can’t think of anything. Nothing. But I knew.\n\nSo I followed her again. This time I stayed closer, always having her in my sights, always knowing exactly where she was. She was walking considerably slower that night, almost like she knew I was behind her. Almost like she wanted me to follow her. The air was cold and crisp, and whenever autumn draws close, I can step outside, take a deep breath, and relive the exact moment when she suddenly turned on her heels to face me.\n\n“This is it,” she said, “This is the day I die.”\n\nShe walked over to me and handed me an envelope. It was light, but there was definitely something in it. A letter perhaps.\n\n“You will need this,” she stroked my hair gently, “When the time comes, you’ll know what to do with it.”\n\n“I don’t understand,” I said, “Please, let’s just leave. Let’s just get out of here.”\n\nShe smiled and kissed me on the cheek. If I concentrate real hard I can still conjure up the smell of her perfume.\n\n“This is goodbye,” she murmured softly, “But you will come to understand that it was always meant to be.”\n\nI reached out to hug her when they emerged from the darkness. Two tall figures clad in dark robes, an old man and an elderly woman, their milky-white hair flowing gently in the breeze. They had this solemn expression on their faces, the kind you’d see in funerals, an expression of acceptance to sorrow and despair because it is just a part of life. Michelle pushed me away forcefully, and by the time I’d regained my balance it was already too late.\n\nHer throat had been slit from either side of her neck. A perfect cross, left to right, right to left. Blood was squirting out, coloring the dull brown of the roadside a deep shade of crimson. The robed couple swiftly stepped back into the shadows, leaving me desperately clutching the lifeless body of Michelle, screaming my lungs out, wailing like an animal into the cold night.\n\nThe paramedics came ten minutes later. I have no idea who called them. Anonymous, they later told me. She had no ID on her, so they asked me a bunch of questions. I didn’t know the answer to any of them. She was Michelle. That was all I knew. Her name was Michelle. She was my friend, and she was the best person I’d ever met.\n\nThey let me ride the ambulance to the hospital, but they quickly pronounced her dead. She’d lost too much blood, they told me. It wasn’t my fault. There wasn’t anything I could have done. This didn’t offer me much comfort. I was devastated. Totally broken, the dark thoughts resurfacing once again, this time with more power than ever before.\n\n“What’s that in your hand,” one of the paramedics asked, “Does that belong to Michelle?”\n\nI glanced at the envelope. It was completely drenched in blood, much like me. And then it suddenly hit me. I don’t know what it was, but it was like she told me; *when the time comes, you’ll know what to do with it*. So without thinking, I just handed it over to him. He sort of held it up, like he’d somehow see through it if he got a better angle of it, before he gently opened it.\n\n“Well, I’ll be damned,” he said.\n\n\\---\n\nI am better now. I still have problems understanding what happened, but I am better. I have come to terms with it. With the fact that everything happened just the way it was supposed to happen. And it has shaped me, shaped my life into what I am today. Michelle didn’t just save me. She saved my entire family. Every aspect of my life.\n\nAnd I guess you’re wondering what was in that envelope. Maybe you’d figured it out, maybe not.\n\nIt was a donor card. And as it turned out, she was a perfect match for my twin sisters.\n\n*Can’t love a dead chick*, she said.\n\nThat’s the only thing she was ever wrong [about.](https://www.reddit.com/user/hyperobscura)",

Growing up, we were each other’s best friends. We’ve been through a lot of stuff – our parents’ divorce, death of a few family members, even a devastating house fire when we were little. Even though we’re both adults now, we still really rely on and trust each other.\n\nAfter graduating high school, I went to college in a different state. I felt really bad for leaving my brother behind, but other than our parents being divorced, our home life had always been great. He was still rather upset with the fact that I was leaving and didn’t want to stay home to be with him. I felt (and still feel) like it was a little unreasonable for him to react that way. I promised that I would call and visit as frequently as possible.\n\nWhen my brother graduated from high school, he asked if he could come live with me. It wasn’t too strange for him to ask. We lived in a small town, and the place I moved was a bigger and more interesting city. Since he had decided not to go straight to college, it seemed like moving to the city with me was his only chance to get out of our hometown. I told him that we could look for a new place for when my lease was up (I lived in a studio apartment and wasn’t about to share that tiny space with and 18 y/o boy). Ultimately, we found a reasonable two bedroom and moved into it right before my classes started.\n\nThings were a little weird right off the bat. He got very upset when he found out that I had been casually dating. It seemed like he was upset that I hadn’t told him. He was mad that we were “drifting apart” so far that I wouldn’t tell him that I was dating, even if I wasn’t in a committed relationship or anything. Then he asked me if I could refrain from bringing guys over to our home. When I asked him why, he said it made him uncomfortable. I told him I could respect that while I was just casually dating guys, but if I got into a relationship, I would certainly be bringing my boyfriend over. “We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it,” he told me.\n\nWell, we got to that bridge. I had a new boyfriend and decided to confront my brother about having him over. I hadn’t told my boyfriend why I insisted that we always hang out at his apartment, and he didn’t ask. We got into a huge screaming fight where my brother basically told me that college guys only want sex and that I should be focusing on school. I couldn’t believe this was happening. When I told him that I was an adult and would do what I wanted, he reminded me that he paid rent and had input into what went on in his home. We compromised that my boyfriend could come over but wouldn’t stay overnight. I told him that solution would work for the time being but we would need to reassess. Again…he told me we would cross that bridge when we came to it.\n\nAfter having this same argument two or three times, I told my brother that if he wasn’t willing to stop being weird about this, I wasn’t going to be living with him once the lease was up. He apologized profusely but continued to insist that he was right in this situation. Finally he told me that he would let me make my own mistakes.\n\nUnfortunately, things didn’t go well with that boyfriend. We broke up (for reasons unrelated to my brother). Of course, my brother took advantage of this to tell me that he was right and that I should’ve listened to him. Around that time, I called my mom and told her about how weird he was being. She insisted that he was trying to take the place of our father, since he hadn’t really been involved in our lives since they were divorced. Even if that’s true, I still didn’t feel like it justified his behavior.\n\nOver the summer, a friend of mine was getting married so I was out of town for the wedding. When I came home, a bunch of my stuff was missing. Stuff like my perfume, some clothes and lotion. I asked my brother about it but he denied taking any of it. He told me that he’d had some friends over so they must’ve taken my stuff. He told me that he would deal with it and get my stuff back. He did eventually bring my stuff to me, but I’m not totally convinced that his friends took it. After all, he didn’t seem at all upset about them having stolen things from me.\n\nAbout a month ago, he told me that he had a girlfriend and that he wanted to bring her over to meet me. I briefly considered making a big stink about it like he had with my ex, but I decided to be an adult and told him that would be great. He scheduled a big dinner and cooked and asked me to dress up and everything. I was kind of relieved that he had someone he was so interested in because maybe he would be less weird than he had been. When this girl showed up, though…\n\nHe was in the kitchen when she arrived, so I answered the door. And it was like looking in a mirror. I could tell that she was just as alarmed as I was at how much we looked alike. We both have platinum blonde hair, fair skin, green eyes and similarly shaped bodies. We’re also approximately the same height. During dinner, we discovered that we also have lots of other things in common. She goes to a different college nearby but has the same major that I do. We also like a lot of the same music and share a lot of mannerisms.\n\nAfter she left, I asked my brother if he had noticed how much she and I look alike. He rolled his eyes and told me that I was just being weird. I don’t know if I am. He brings her over all the time, and they make out in the living room on the couch. When I asked him if they could take it into his room, he accused me of being jealous that he wasn’t making out with me, which was confusing to both his girlfriend and myself. At that moment, it kind of started to seem like he was trying to make me jealous with her.\n\nI wouldn’t think too much of it if he hadn’t been acting so strange since we moved in together. I can’t tell if I’m just imagining things or not. I don’t want to feel like my little brother has a crush on me, especially since we live together. I also don’t know how to talk about it with him without him just saying that I’m being crazy or jealous or whatever. Please help me.\n\nTL;DR – my baby brother has been weirdly possessive since moving in with me and now has a girlfriend who looks just like me.\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**momentomori4**\n\n>MOVE OUT ASAP. Also try to get him into counseling. He obviously has an unhealthy obsession with you, but it doesn't sound like he's very approachable about it. Do you have a lock for your door? You should lock your door when you're out so he can't get in and take your things.\n\n>He is completely inappropriate.\n\n**OOP**\n\n>>I do have a lock for my door. It never occurred to me before that I should have to lock with when I left the apartment. This sucks.\n\n**ThrowMaxibon**\n\n>>>You should probably also lock it while you're asleep. \n\n>>>I don't want to jump to your brother might wake you up one night trying to climb into your bed, but my first thought when you said he took your stuff was that he either used it for wanking or made his girlfriend wear your clothes while they banged. \n\n>>>It's not impossible, so be careful.\n\n**OOP**\n\n>>>>Yeah, I definitely washed the clothes as soon as I got them back. But if that's what he was doing, maybe burning them would've been a better route.  \n\n[Update 1 - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3j0y1g/update_my_22f_younger_brother_19m_has_been_acting/)  **Aug 30, 2015 (4 days later)**\n\nThank you all for your comments and messages! I appreciate all your concerns and the confirmation that I am not crazy.\n\nSo I met up with my future roommate to tell her that I had officially decided not to live with my brother anymore. I gave her a full rundown of everything that had happened between the two of us. We’ve made appointments to tour some houses and apartments this week. She also said that I’m welcome to move into her place if I don’t feel like I can ride out the lease.\n\nOn Friday night, my brother had his girlfriend over and they were watching movies in the living room. It had been recommended to me that I approach him about it while she was around because he would be less likely to fly off the handle. Just in case, I packed a bag full of valuable things and stuff I would need if I had to book it immediately.\n\nThey finished one of the movies they had been watching. He went into the kitchen to get them some more snacks and his girlfriend was still in the living room, so I figured that this would be a good time. This way we weren’t airing all of our dirty laundry in front of her but she would be there if he started yelling or anything. I asked him if he could talk for a second. He seemed a little irritated (probably because I was interrupting his date) but said it was fine.\n\nI told him that I felt like we didn’t make very compatible roommates and that I wouldn’t be renewing the lease with him for next month. When he asked why, I told him that I felt like he didn’t respect me as a roommate. I wanted to live somewhere with a person who would let me make the calls on who was or wasn’t allowed to be in my house. I wanted to live with someone who gave a shit if their friends were stealing from me. He told me that he respected me more than anyone else I could live with. He said that it’s because he respects me so much that he gave me a hard time about the boyfriend thing. I said that if he really respected me, he would give me the room to decide if a boyfriend was good for me or not.\n\nAround that time, he started getting louder and angrier, so his girlfriend came in to check and see if things were cool. He told her that things were fine and that she should probably go. I panicked and tried to play it off a little. I said stuff like, “Oh no, don’t let me ruin your evening. Please stay. I’m about to leave.” He kept telling her to go before finally I was begging her to please stay.\n\nHe could tell that I was kind of scared and started laughing at me. He asked if I was afraid of him and told me that I was being ridiculous. He asked his girlfriend if she thought there was any good reason for me to be afraid of him. She seemed really worried or confused and told him he was being weird. He explained that I had just told him that I was bailing on him as a roommate and that I was being a “horrible cunt” about things that weren’t a big deal. He asked his girlfriend to leave again and she did.\n\nOnce she was gone, he told me that I was just pissed that he wasn’t going to let me be a “huge slut” like I wanted to be. He told me that some day I would meet the perfect guy for me but he wouldn’t want to date me because I would have had sex with so many guys and “nobody worthwhile wants to marry a skank.” He said that he was trying to help me so that I wouldn’t wind up in that situation.\n\nI told him that I was going to leave and that we could talk again whenever he was ready to talk without saying horrible things to me but that I was going to be giving our landlord notice by Monday. I went into my room and got my bag. I locked my door behind me and headed to the door. When I was almost to the front door, he appeared almost right behind me and said my name. I turned around very quickly and as I did, he punched me right in the face. He didn’t knock me out or anything, but I collapsed on the floor. Without saying anything else, he stepped over me and went out the door, leaving me there.\n\nI iced my eye for a while (which is now pretty swollen and purple) before I grabbed my bag and left. I called my mom and talked on the phone with her while I walked to my car so that if he approached me, she would hear what happened. She insisted that I was exaggerating about what he had done so I sent her a picture of my face. She started crying and apologized for being dismissive. I told her that it was okay but I didn’t want to be forced to spend time with him in any family situations ever again.\n\nI haven’t seen him since then. I’ve been staying with my new roommate. I’ve gotten a few texts from him but haven’t responded yet. Here’s what they say:\n\nTEXT 1: Where did you go? I came home and now you’re gone? We have to finish talking about this.\n\nTEXT 2: Are you fucking kidding me? Tell me where you are or that you’re alive. I’m scared that I haven’t heard from you. You know how worried I am when you fall off the face of the earth like this.\n\nTEXT 3: You’re being such a child right now.\n\nTEXT 4: I don’t know what you said to mom but you’ve really upset her. I hope you’re happy.\n\nTEXT 5: I’ll be home all day Monday if you want to come over and meet with the landlord to give notice. That’s fine.\n\nTEXT 6: Where am I going to live?\n\nHis girlfriend even texted me once to tell me how worried he is about me.\n\nI’m a little nervous about tomorrow. As I said, I haven’t texted him back about joining him tomorrow. I told my new roommate that I need her to come with me. She suggested that I not wear any makeup so he can see the reality of what he did to my face. I don’t know. What do you all think?\n\nTL;DR: I confronted my brother about not wanting to live with him anymore and he punched me in the face.\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**OOP replied to a deleted comment**\n\n>This has definitely changed how I feel about my mom's ability to parent.\n\n**OOP When told to file a police report**\n\n>I'm currently on hold with the police department. If they need for me to come into the station in order to fill out the report, I'll do that first thing in the morning.\n\n**altonbrownfan**\n\n>>Whoa whoa whoa. AN OP with a backbone and actually goes to the police when they need to??? \n\n**OOP**\n\n>>>I'm kind of feeling like if I really had a backbone I would've stood up to him before things escalated to this point, but thanks!\n\n**When told to contact the brothers GF**\n\n>I just sent her a text message to ask if she was with him. For some reason I feel like engaging in this with her while they're together might put her in a bad situation. I don't know if it's true or not, but I'd like to think that I can trust my gut on this one.\n\nEDIT: I'm going to the police station with my roommate to file a report. I'm also trying to get in touch with his girlfriend to let her know what's going on. I haven't decided whether or not I should tell her that I'm going to the police with this. I emailed the landlord to make sure that he knows I'm putting in notice but don't want to meet to sign the paperwork if I have to meet with my brother. I haven't contacted my brother at all yet. I'm also thinking about calling my dad. He isn't super active in my life, but since my mom's turned out to be less than helpful in this situation, I'd like to have a family member on my side if I can.\n\n[Another Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3j4mgg/another_update_my_22f_younger_brother_19m_has/)  **Aug 31, 2015 (1 day after 1st update)**\n\n[Copy of the update](https://imgur.com/a/imnI9Ze)\n\nLast night my roommate and I went to the police station and filed a police report. I recounted to them all of the weird things that had happened with my brother in the past year that we’ve lived together. I told them that his girlfriend was a witness to the argument and showed them the text conversation with my mother. They also took pictures of my face in its current state, since my face is obviously more evidently bruised than in the picture I sent my mom. I couldn’t think of a whole lot of questions to ask at the time (I was very nervous and a little overwhelmed) and they didn’t provide me with a whole lot of information. They gave me a copy of the report and told me that a detective was being assigned to my case and would call me some time today. I don’t know if they’re going to be making an arrest or not. I think that they automatically have to in my state when this kind of report is filed, but I’m not sure. I feel really stupid for not thinking to ask such a basic question, but I also feel like it’s kind of weird that they didn’t offer that information. They did tell me that they would be happy to escort me to the apartment to collect my belongings if I felt that was necessary.\n\nHis girlfriend called me a few times while I was at the police station, but I was obviously busy and couldn’t take her calls. I texted her when I was done and asked if it was too late for me to call. She was still up, so I called and told her about what had happened once she left. She immediately started apologizing. I assured her that what happened wasn’t her fault. I asked if he had ever done anything like that to her. She said no. I hope she was being honest. I didn’t mention to her that I had gone to the police. I just said that I wanted to let her know for her own safety. She thanked me and apologized some more. She didn’t say what her next steps were going to be, but I told her that I would be checking in to make sure she was doing okay which she said she would appreciate.\n\nThis morning I called our dad. I haven’t talked to my dad since Father’s Day. He’s remarried and has a few younger children with his new wife. He’s definitely one of those remarried dads who ignores his old family in favor of his new one. I wasn’t anticipating much sympathy from him, but he really surprised me. He told me that based on some of my brother’s behavior from his childhood (violent tendencies towards other kids at school around the time of the divorce which I had never heard about from anyone until that moment) the whole thing didn’t especially shock him. Dad’s fairly well off financially and offered to get me a lawyer if I thought I needed one. He highly advised I at least meet with a lawyer to get a professional legal opinion on where to go from here. I took his offer and am meeting with a lawyer in my city tomorrow when I get off of work. My brother cannot afford a lawyer on his own, and my mother cannot afford to help him financially. Having a lawyer is definitely an advantage to me.\n\nThank you all for giving me the kick in the ass I needed to go to the police. I still haven’t contacted my brother and think I’ll refrain from doing so until after the meeting with the lawyer tomorrow. My mom has sent me a few text messages asking why I haven’t been in touch with my brother. I haven’t responded to those either.\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP's OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**",

I have an unhealthy eating habit and snacking a lot during work. She mentioned  twice (jokingly) said how I tempted her for eating cakes and how can I stay skinny even though I eat like pigs. I offered her some, she refused saying she's trying to lose weight.\n\nFine, I stopped snacking on my desk, but my other colleagues and I still have lunch at desk when we are quite busy.\nThen by the end of the first week, she reported to HR and say people should not have lunch or eat at desk because it can be unhygienic and the crumbs might fell into keyboard etc and attract bugs. She also mentioned how she was annoyed by me eating ice cream, cakes, bread etc during work hours and it disturb her because she's trying hard to lose weight. \n\nSo HR sent us all emails and now everyone in the office, EVERYONE can no longer eat anything on our desk.\n\n2. On her second day, She complained that the girl sits next to her (Jane) was using a very strong perfume and the scent nauseated her. Jane did wear strong perfume indeed but it wasn't that horrible. All of us could tolerate Jane and suddenly because this new girl couldn't tolerate her and Jane was the one that has to change.\n\n3. Between our team, 6 of us collect $10 weekly to buy lottery. One of the guy in our team is Muslim and he doesn't gamble, so he never participated but yet he never discouraged or criticised us. We offered this girl to join us and she criticised us about how gambling is bad and say it's very unprofessional to be collecting money to gamble in office environment.  She actually brought this to HR, arguing the harm and risk and if we happen to win millions of Dollars and did massive exodus, it would be harmful for the company. Luckily HR didn't do anything about it.\n\n4. The Muslim guy prays twice a day in our stationery room. Unfortunately we don't have praying room in the office. He has got his praying mat and some other stuff in our stationery room and it has been there since I start working. She suggested him to move it somehwere as he shouldn't put personal belongings in a common area. She told the other girl in our team that the old mat was not pleasant to look at.\n\nOk. What happened today:\n\nOur desks layout is shaped like L and my desk is next to a glass window. In our team, there are 7 people exlcuding her, and all of us are sun hater. We always pull down the shade and especially the guys sitting on the other corner. They said if the window is opened, the sun would glare on their computer screen in the afternoon and making them can't see their screen very well. This girl has been complaining how our corner is too dark and gives bad vibes and she needs to have the shades opened up. She mentioned how the sun will makes people happier and increase productivity. \n\nI couldn't stand her anymore so I stood up from my desk and say (I didn't yell): \"Look (insert her name), you have been here for less than a month but you keep telling us what to do. We have been changing our habit to accomodate you but then you keep pushing things. You can't keep telling us what to do. I think the best thing is for you to move to sit where the HR people sits because it's always bright there and you are closer with them than to us anyway.\"\n\nShe then said I hate women and I'm bullying her and she is telling our manager and HR about this.\n\nAm I the AH here? Did I bully her? Is it acceptable for new hire to tell older colleagues to do these things??\n\n________\nSmall not so irrelevant update:\nI was just talking about this with my colleague who work downstairs in storage room (I don't often go there, but this new girl has to go there everyday as part of her job), and he told me a story. In my company, we hire a guy with Down Syndrome to do some restocking, let's call him Bob. \nApparently a couple of days ago, an older lady who work in the kitchen was wearing a pikachu apron. When Bob saw the kitchen lady, he yelled \"Pikachu\" then ran and touched the apron, so he would have accidentally toucher her breast too. According to my colleague, The older lady just laughed and didn't make much of a fuss. The new girl witnessed this and say Bob has sexually harassed the old lady and she would report him to HR. LOL. She complained that Bob's behaviour is very inappropriate and unsafe.\n\nThanks for all of your input though. I definitely going to talk to the rest of my team and we might meet up with HR and my line manager to work on remediation of this situation.\n\nRegarding to the comments on my piggy eating habit and my skinny appearance, my other colleagues pretty much say that all the time, which I don't really mind, so I guess it's not a big deal for the new girl to say that. I won't bring that up in the meeting.  \n\n-----\nupdate 12 April\n\nWow, I didn’t expect this to blow up, I’m still getting so many messages and comments. BTW I use AI this time to correct my grammatical mistakes. \n\nI'm not a native English speaker, and now I understand that it's not appropriate to use the word “girl” when referring to a 25-year-old woman. I didn’t realize this before — thanks for the heads-up, Reddit!\n\nI showed this post to two of my colleagues, and they encouraged me (and I also felt it was necessary) to clarify a few things to be fair and to respond to some of your questions and comments. She actually complained about a lot of other things that I didn’t mention earlier, mostly because I didn’t think they were very interesting — and honestly, a few of them even benefited us.\n\n\n1. Okay, so apparently wearing perfume at the workplace is not allowed. Got it. I guess Jane’s just been lucky that no one’s ever complained before.\n\n2. Her comment about the Muslim guy’s prayer mat was more about the way it was positioned in the storage room. Everything else is neatly arranged in wooden cupboards, but in one corner, there’s a small table with the prayer mat and some religious items. She felt it looked out of place and thought personal items shouldn’t be in public/shared areas. That said, the prayer mat has been there since I started, and no one in the office has raised an issue about it for the past three years.\n\n3. About the “skinny” or “eats like a pig” comments — I’m totally fine with it. It’s just a part of our internal banter, and I’m the only person who get \"body-shamed\" (if you want to call it that way), and I do allow people to do so. We don’t comment on other people’s bodies or eating habits, and no one is being body-shamed. \n\n4. There was no HR policy that says we can’t eat at our desks, and nobody has complained about it until now. Everyone does it — even in other teams like IT. The new hire’s issue doesn’t seem to be about allergies or food smells. Her main complain was she’s trying to lose weight and doesn’t like watching people eat. She never brought up concerns about computer damage or bugs until she took it to HR. \n\n5. Yes, She’s currently on a 6-month probation period. This is not her first job but her second job. Apparently worked on that company for 2 years. The first job was in a different city, and she praises that company a lot.\n\n6. I didn’t mention this earlier because it kind of worked out in my favor, but one of my colleagues asked me to include it. On her second day, she asked our manager to move a cabinet closer to her desk. That cabinet used to be on the other side of the room, and I had to walk over every time I needed to use it. So now it’s more convenient for me. But of course, the people who used to sit near it — including the colleagues who asked me to mention this — are pretty annoyed, since they use it just as much as she does. She never mentioned about mobility issue or anything like that. She just wants the cabinet to be close to her. Funnily our manager complies and get the cabinet moved.\n\n7. She complained about how the IT guy who sits behind her has got a really loud ringtone. I personally too find it a bit annoying, but he doesn't often receive phone calls and it wasn't too bothersome for us.\n\n8. She complained how one of our colleague was putting on headphones when working and she dislike it when she has to tap on his shoulder when he needs to talk to him. She literally told him: \"Do you mind not putting headphones while we work, because I don't want to be keep tapping your shoulders everytime I need to talk to you and it is disrespectful towards the others\", or something along the line. We usually just send a message on MS Teams when we want to talk to him and he's on headphones. He suggested her the same, but she said she doesn't want to.\n\n9. She complained about one Filipino woman (I almost typed girl again here lol) who brought a smelly lunch to work. Yes I kind of agree with this complain. To be fair, the Filipino woman actually didn't do this very often and she usually have late lunch around 2pm after people finished their lunch. Few of my colleagues and I also dislike it, but we thought nobody is perfect, and since she doesn't bring that food often, we just put up with it.\n\n10. Also my colleague told me he heard how she criticised few of our Asian colleagues for eating rice with spoon instead with fork (why does this bother her?)\n\n11. She complained about our kitchen bin does not have lid. It doesn't bother us, but we can see her point.\n\n12. She complained how we should have coffee machine. Ok this one would be great.\n\n13. She allegedly reported a female colleague for wearing stilettos to the office, calling it inappropriate work attire. She also apparently reported the kitchen lady for wearing a Pikachu apron, saying it was unprofessional. Lol.\n\n14. Bob has down syndrome, or some sort of intellectual disability. I don't think he was malicious or intentionally being innapropriate. He probably doesn't have the capacity to think that it is not Ok to touch other people.\nHe didn't touch our new hire though. She just witnessed him touching another woman and immediately flag him as a potential sexual harraser.\n\nOne of my colleagues genuinely thinks she might be having some mental health issues.\n\nClearly, people commenting here are from different parts of the world and come from various cultural backgrounds. It’s interesting to see how some things are totally normal in one place but not okay in another. For instance, we’ve been eating at our desks for years — but apparently according to some of you, that’s a no-no in some workplaces. (Welp… sadly, it’s not okay for us anymore either.)\n\nNow genuine question here....\nExcluding the perfume thing, **Would you complained this much within 3 weeks of your initial employment??** \nI personally think we should just put up with some little things sometimes. Life is not perfect, let alone office.\n\nThanks again for all your input, and yeah definitely going to HR on Monday!\n\n------\n\nUpdate 21 April\n\nTLDR she resigned before HR had a chance to fire her.\n\nSorry haven't been able to update the post earlier due to personal reason.\nAs per most of the suggestions here I decided to report her to HR with my colleagues in our team.\n\nSo on Monday morning, few of my colleagues and I had a discussion regarding this new hire behaviour and we decided to talk to our line manager first before HR. However our manager couldn't come to work that day (legit reason). The new hire also didn't come to work, she called in sick. We then changed our plan and decided to go to  HR straight away. \nOne of the IT guy joined us too as our new hire had \"harassed\" him with a lot of unnecessary IT requests and demanded him to make a lot of changes in our IT system, so we offered him to join us to report her to HR. He suggested that rather than complaining about how she's annoyed everyone with her complains, we should pretend to be concerned about her struggle to adjust to our environment and get HR to talk to her because we wanted her to have a good expirience working with us.\n\nSo few of us then had a meeting with HR, and guess what? HR people were also annoyed by her lol. They didn't say it directly but subtly mentioned that she had been lodging a lot of unnecessary complaints. We also suggested that she might need to see a psychologist as she might be having some sort of internal personal crisis (aka crazy) that lead her to make all of these complains. The IT guy asked if she showed any signs of these behaviour when HR interviewed her, and they said she asked few detailed questions about the work culture here and also complained about some stuff (parking etc), but they didn't really think much at that time and she had glowing reviews from her referrees (probably because they want to get rid of her lol). The HR team said that they will discuss this matter and HR manager will have 1:1 meeting with her the next time she shows up.\n\n However that never happened because she sent her resignation letter the following day, along with a very long list of complaints and things she wanted us to change. The most ridiculous thing is she actually sent the same email to the big boss, complaining out workplace to be unsafe, unhygienic, non-inclusive, misogynist, backwards and radiating bad vibes (The HR lady who told us this found it strange that she didn't use the word 'toxic'. One thing the HR found amusing was she mentioned how our workplace should provide a lot of FREE stuff such as bottled beverages, fruits, snacks, espresso coffee machine, dining vouchers, feminine hygiene products, petrol voucher, etc.\n\nin conclusion: good riddance.  \n\n",

For example, if she was deathly allergic to peanuts then she could ask to ensure that you don't eat them at your desk where there's a risk of triggering an allergy.

I didn’t have these problems for a long time and really liked perfume myself, but some years ago I started being oversensitive with smells. I could not even use my favorite perfumes anymore, because I felt sick by the smell. I even had to change my soap and washing powder to scentfree products. And somehow the way how I smelled things changed too. It’s really disturbing and no real fun. Nausea, headache…and I had a colleague who liked using a lot of perfume, too.

    "body": "1- hijab being a choice is a privilege. \n\nHijab culture is so toxic it's pretty much women one upping eachother on how invisible they could be because the more you cover up, the more brownie points you get on being a \"good muslim women\".\n\n This reaches it's top in the [niqab/burqa](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/yFluUS_2sRRHGWg47fV4AUT5Cexm1zgo0zqwtaizq8LHIz6uuuoy796c02mP_iyQ9mCMPI26L9OkYWhaYql6-GiAKXvlJMwCpQw5qWbpnu4p_MOUNIKBGAZjIyBk2O5b7tDaAYWJ26HpE3IE3_LJqexW9Amc6G8A82JlSFugOBnLFycssUigNw) whose women give up their enitre idnetity becasue it's a race to the bottom. How invisible can you be to avoid triggering men sexually.. well the face is an attractive part of the body.. cover that.\n\n \n\nIf you grow up in a Muslim community, they will not teach you that hijab is a choice. They will teach you that hijab is mandatory to all women in Islam. Depending on where you live/ your family the option of it being a true free choice is different for every person. And best case scenario in which you are only doing it for Allah it's the choice of wearing it or going to hell. \n\n Instead of advocating that women live their life freely islam advocated that women live their lives trying to avoid triggering men sexually. For example you shouldn't speak softly to avoid triggering men with your voice. Another example there is a religious saying by the prophet that if a woman wore perfume and walked by a group of men and they smelled it, she is considered an adulterer cus she might trigger them with her perfume lol it's so effed up\n\n2- the pressure on men to enforce it \n\n Because of honor culture women are already not free to do what they want anyway, add to that the idea of hijab and you have a society where women's clothes is considered a reflection of how much of a man her husband is. \n\nSo, not only is the woman considered less because she doesn't cover up, her husband is also considered less of a man because he doesn't make her do it. Men are shamed for how their wives dress/behave and are called dayouth ديوث ie why do are you letting your wife showing her body to people ..This is because of a hadith by the prophet mentioning the dayouth word. \n\nThis means that it's not just men forcing women to do it. It's a whole community that enforces Islam on everyone. Other women can be worse than men. \n\n3- Extreme slut shaming.\n\n Women are called / \"motabraja\" which is a dergatory term for uncovered women or those who wear makeup/ whores / \"naked meat\" \"cheap meat\"/ the wood of hell fire if they take the hijab off. This is because of one \"hadith\" ( a saying by the prophet mohammed) where the prophet goes to the upper sky and sees women tortured because they were \" dressing nakedly\" \n\n\nWomen are constantly made to feel guilty over how they dress. To give you an example most women are made to feel guilty for wearing pants or jeans.. Even if she's covering every inch of her body she isn't wearing \"proper hijab\" becaause to be a good muslim women you should wear clothes that \" don't show the size of your legs\" why? well ofc to avoid triggering men sexually \n\nIt's an important thing to know that it's not just men subjecating women. Women themselves shit on other women who aren't modest like them. Women who don't wear it think  of themselves as sinners and are made to believe those who wear it are better than them. Sometimes women can be worse than men tbh. \n\n4- victim blaming is the norm\n\nWomen are almost always blamed for their sexual assault, they weren't modest enough and did the ulitmate sin of triggering the guy sexually. This happens everywhere but here it's to the extreme. again \"nromal clothes\" like a wearing a t-shirt or showing your hair are considered immodest and provoking the attack. \n\nBeing raped or sexually assaulted is considered a scandal to the victim and her family. I know of one girl who was beaten by her family for reporting her sexual harassmer to the police. Another family cut off their daughter and pressured her to avoid filing a lawsuit against her rapists. Their thinking is to avoid other people knowing that their daughter got assaulted which is again is scandalous for the girl. \n\n[Here is one extreme example of a Cleveland clinic researcher who says all women are responsible for their rape except those who wear burqas ]\n\n5- it's not oppressive because some freely wear it? \n\nSome people will say some women freely wear hijab so it is not oppressive for me it's like saying some Chinese people freely like the CCP so there's no political oppression in China. You can freely wear it but taking it off requires you have to consider the backlash you will face from everyone around you and the [physical danger you would be in if you spoke out against it.](https://youtu.be/TwXHx2JG4Dk) I was one of those ppl who freely wore at 11! But when I grew up found out that I can't freely not wear it.\n\n\n\nIf the government threatens you with torture if you don't cover up, no one has a problem calling that oppressive. Well Islam threatens women with torture in hell fire  if they don't cover up. How is there an argument of whether it's oppressive or not? \n\nIt is the existence of a mandatory religious dress code that is for women only to avoid triggering men that is oppressive. It's not to judge any specific person's choice. I don't care why you wear hijab personally. I care that that there is this discriminatory rule that women are penalized (religiously and socially) if they don't follow. \n\n \n\n6- it's only in the middle east that's oppressive? \n\nSome people say it's only in the middle east.. [Please watch Dina Tokio's video where she's reading hate comments of being called a whore and a porn star because she is showing her hair](https://youtu.be/i3kIJd-_yiY). This has happened with many Muslim hijabi youtubers who chose to take it off. So it's a problem with the Muslim community everywhere!\n\n7- other religions have it too? \n\nThe difference between the Islamic rules and other religions is that people take them incredibly seriously and literally. Liberal Muslims are a minority. The laws of the most Muslim countries is mainly inspired by the religion or out right theocratic. In the west you can escape your religious family and live a normal life else where. In the Middle East you have to leave the whole country for that which of course not everyone can afford. \n\n8- that's just culture? \n\nSome ppl will say it's culture but this is not true it's a mix of both toxic religious ideals of what a good woman is like plus a toxic patriarchal culture. Women being considered adulterers for wearing perfume is a religious saying for example! How do you expect a culture inspired by that will be like? \n\n\nBut I am happy to answer the question of how do we know if it's religious enforcement or truly what women want. In the Middle East, Christian women aren't pressured to wear the hijab or the niqab even though they live in the same culture that western Muslims always try to stick every bad aspect to it and not the religion.\n\n\n In Egypt, Christian women wear short dresses and have their hair out VS their Islamic peers can't do the same as freely. Christian women wear these short dresses in their gathering among themselves (ie other Christians) but can't wear them on the street where the majority of ppl are Muslims. It's not exactly like being in a western country but the rules are much lax for them and the only difference is religion.\n\n9- so you want us to ban hijabs \n\nOfc not. Women should be able to live how they want to even if that choice is to follow an oppressive rule. I am just against the glorification of this choice and the minimization of the social and religious baggage that comes with it. It's not a fashion accessory. It's a mandatory dress code for women. \n\nI just hope western feminists will stop accepting it as freely as they have. It's incredibly naive to try to water down the experiences of millions of women who were programmed with the toxic religious mindset and just start promoting that it's a choice without questioning why the hijab exists in the first place. Western women don't know how good they have it just being able to Show Your Hair. Wear what they want. Wear cute dresses. Show some skin. It's sth I had to spend 25 years of my life trying to do. \n\n10- but I it's bad to criticize another culture \n\nI don't know how that became a thing but some how white or western feminist are made to feel guilty if they critique the Islamic treatment of women. They are gas lit into thinking that saying women are oppressed in Islam is stereotyping people. If you are against the hijab you are an Islamophobic Nazi. \n\nThis is so so dumb. I don't have to be Chinese to say that footbinding is bad. A culture can be wrong and you should be able to say so. It doesn't make you alt right to say mandating women spend their entire lives covered up to avoid sexual harassment is bad, it makes you a regular feminist. \n\nPlease don't let any one make you feel bad for advocating against misogynistic ideas because it comes from 'brown people'. You should be able to call out Islam just as you do others. \n\nBTW Muslims shit on western culture all the time lol \n\n\n11- hijab is not about men I wear it for another reason \n\nThis is something you only hear western Muslims say. This is maybe what it's for you personally but it's not what it's in Islam. For example, the day you are required to start wearing hijab is the same day you are able to get married which is the day you start getting your period. \n\nIn the Quran, the context in which the hijab is mentioned is that some people were sexually harassing women so God ordered free women to cover up to mark themselves  as free women not slaves and thus be protected from sexual harassment. \n\nWomen are allowed to stop covering  themselves up so much  once they are so  old that they  \"have no hopes of getting married\" per quranic verses. \n\n\n.\n12- but I visited a Muslim country and it wasn't like that\n\n\n\nPlease understand that the Middle East has many different countries. [Not all of them are Saudi arabia and not all of them are Lebanon either.](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/01/08/what-is-appropriate-attire-for-women-in-muslim-countries/) There is also variation in different cities within the same country. Usually the touristy and rich Areas are the ones westerners have access to and are the most lax. \n\nYou can go to a touristy area in Egypt and wear a bikini but if you wear one in a regular beach where regular middle class Egyptians go, you will probably get raped.\n\nIt really depends on where you are but these ideas are always there in the background even if you can't see them in the place you visit.\n\n\n\n\n13- Men also have to cover\n\nThis is also one of the favorite lines apologists like. A covered Muslim man is one who covers between his belly button and his knees. So basically a coverd Muslim man is half naked one.\n\nObviously, there is no hadith speaking of uncovered naked men being tortured in hell or anything like that it's just the woman lol. This rule is also mostly ignored socially anyway. Very rarely will you ever see anyone giving a guy shit for not abiding by it.\n\nAnyone who has seen a woman in a burqa walking with her casually dressed husband or you could also go to to a swimming pool and see women covered from head to toe with their husband's in shorts and you can immediately tell that this argument is utter bullshit. and you really can't compare the rules for men and women.\n\n\n14- some final words \n\n\nFrom  \"the world’s first feminist\" prophet Mohamed :\n\n-I had a chance to look into the Paradise and I found that majority of the people was poor and I looked into the hell Fire and there I found the majority constituted by women.\n\n\n - I have not left after me any (chance) of turmoil more injurious to men than the harm done to the men because of women\n\n \"The life of the world is sweet and green. Allah makes you generations succeeding one another so that He may try you in respect of your actions. So beware of the beguilements of the world and those of women. The first trial of Banu Israel was through women\"\n\n\n\n- Any woman who puts on perfume then passes by people so that they can smell her fragrance then she is an adulteress.'\"\n\n- When a man calls his wife to come to his bed (ie to have sex with her) and she refuses and does not come to him and he spends the night angry, the angels curse her till the morning\n\n\n \"There are two types of people who will be punished in Hell and whom I have not seen: men having whips like the tails of cows and they will be beating people with them, and, women who will be dressed but appear to be naked, inviting to evil; and they themselves will be inclined to it. Their heads will appear like the humps of the Bactrian camel inclined to one side. They will not enter heaven and they will not smell its fragrance which is perceptible from such and such a distance.\"\n\n\n\nAban bin Sam'ah narrated that his mother said:\n\"I heard 'Aishah say: 'The Messenger of Allah [SAW] forbade the woman who does tattoos and the woman who has that done, the woman who affixes hair extensions and the woman who has that done, An-Namisah (the one who does the eyebrow plucking) and Al-Mutanammisah (the one who has it done)\n\n\t\nAishah narrated that: The Messenger of Allah said: \"Whichever woman married without the permission of her Wali (male guardian) her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid. If he entered into her, then the Mahr(dowry) is for her in lieu of what he enjoyed from her private part. If they disagree, then the Sultan is the Wali for one who has no Wali.\"\n\n\nThe Prophet (ﷺ) said: If any woman asks her husband for divorce without some strong reason, the odour of Paradise will be forbidden to her.\n\n\nIf a woman prays her five (daily prayers), fasts her month (Ramadaan), guards her chastity and obeys her husband, it will be said to her: Enter Paradise by whichever of the gates of Paradise you wish.” Narrated by Ahmad (1664) and others\n\n\nTldr: Dress code for women bad. hijab bad. No free Choice can be made under threat of torture. The bad culture is in many ways inspired by the religion. Western Feminists need to stop being scared of criticizing it!",

It represents a facet of muslim culture which clearly believes that women are less human, and so they have fewer rights. When it is enforced through inhumane tactics it is deplorable.\n\nBut I just want to play devil's advocate here: do you know it isn't *sometimes* a choice?  We should stamp out all of the lies and misogyny that islam peddles, but after doing that, will there still be women who choose to where a Hijab? Are they allowed to do so, if they truly make that choice freely?\n\nI'll give you an example: I'm a cis man, and I don't feel comfortable in public without a shirt on. I know I *could* go for a walk topless, but I just don't feel comfortable doing it. I would feel too exposed. So I choose to wear a shirt. I don't think anybody would have a problem with this. \n\nIf we're willing to allow me to make choices about how I cover my body in public, everyone should have that privelige. So if a woman who was raised muslim doesn't feel comfortable showing her hair in public, it might *be her choice* to wear a headscarf. And that's okay. I might not agree with it, but that's her choice. \n\nAnd as long as women are saying \"I choose to wear this,\" then I'm forced to believe them. Otherwise I'm doing something almost-as-bad: assuming all muslim women are liars. Surely some of them are telling the truth.\n\nThat's why we atheists land in a difficult position: we must fight against mandatory coverings and misogynistic muslim laws. We must stamp out religion itself, but never the freedom to practice it. We have to use reason to overcome hate, but never dogmatically force our views on others.\n\nAnd we have to defend the right of women to be allowed to wear a headscarf. **Because only when women are *truly* free to choose to wear a headscarf, will they also be free to choose to take it off.**",

You'll also see it used alongside [hypercorrection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercorrection).\n\nIt's not quite correct to say that the upper class \"preferred the language of the working class.\" It's more complicated than that. Basically, when dialect is a function of class, the upper and lower classes often talk however they talk with generally little insecurity about it. The upper class because they have status, and the lower class because they don't, and they aren't under any illusion that changing the way they talk will make them pass as upper class. There's no point in their trying to sound posh because nobody will buy it. The middle class, on the other hand, can be very insecure because they don't want to be perceived as low class. This is where the hypercorrection and flowery language comes in. \n\nPeople also sometimes adopt marked low class features of speech as an identity marker. [Labov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Labov), for example, famously interviewed a working class family of fishermen in Cape Cod. The members of the family all had New England accents, but one of their sons had a very thick New England accent, thicker than everyone else's. Labov asked the mother about it, and she said basically \"Growing up, he didn't have a very thick accent, but after he went to college for a couple years on the mainland, he came back and talked with a really thick accent.\" What happened was that the son didn't like life on the mainland, so when he came back home, he subconsciously adopted an even stronger Cape Cod identity than the one he left with.",

Hope you like it.      \n      \nLittle bit about me/my skin: Im 25F and I have sensitive, acne prone, combination skin. My skin is especially sensitive to fragrance, citrus and floral essential oils. Because of this I’ve become a bit of a skincare nerd and an obsessive ingredients list reader. I definitely still have a lot to learn about skincare but I hope this list helps some of you! Especially my fellow sensitive skin skincare addicts.          \n                \nI tried to keep the reviews very short and straight forward, but if you want me to expand on any products let me know!           \n           \n1.        **La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer 30 SPF - 3/10**                    \n*Pros:* Fragrance free and very moisturizing.        \n*Cons:* Broke me out and burned my eyes\nBest for: dry skin.      \n       \n2.        **Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser - 0/10**       \n*Pros:* literally nothing.        \n*Cons:* I don’t like the smell, it broke me out, didn’t remove my makeup well.         \n \n3.        **Drunk Elephant Beste No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 6/10**\n*Pros:* Clean ingredients list.          \n*Cons:* Stripping/drying and expensive.         \n*For who?* Oily skin or those that like to feel squeaky clean.     \n       \n4.        **La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen 60 SPF (American) - 3/10**            \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast.    \n*Cons:* Greasy, broke me out, stung my eyes.    \n*Bottom Line:* Stick to the European version.     \n       \n5.         **La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen 50+ SPF (European) - 9/10**          \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast, reasonably priced.    \n*Cons:* texture is a little too runny for my liking.    \n*Bonus:* LRP donates to skin cancer research.    \n       \n6.         **Jordan Samuel Hydrate Facial Serum - 0/10**       \n*Pros:* Couldn’t try long enough to say.    \n*Cons:* Gave me a bright red burning skin reaction.     \n*Bottom Line:* Looks like they changed their formula (for good reason obvi) so I can’t speak for the new version.     \n*For who?* Those who want an excuse to cancel dinner plans.    \n       \n7.         **Mario Badescu Rose Facial Spray - 0/10**    \n*Pros:* Cheap.   \n*Cons:* Mist comes out too strong, I don’t like the smell, contains fragrance, citronellol, geraniol and colorants.   \n*Bottom Line:* Thank goodness it was a gift, because I won’t be buying.   \n     \n8.        **The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 5/10**    \n*Pros:* Unscented, affordable.    \n*Cons:* Made my skin itch and left a residue.    \n*Bottom Line:* I won’t repurchase.   \n     \n9.         **A313 Vitamin A Pommade - 10/10**   \n*Pros:* My pimples reduced, skin texture improved (after two weeks). Thick vasaline texture that locks in the vitamin A.      \n*Cons:* Slight metallic smell     \n*Bottom Line:* Worth the hype! I use 2x a week max, alternating with a salicylic acid oil.    \n    \n10.   **Youth to the People Superberry Dream Cleansing Balm - 3/10**    \n*Pros:* Great ingredient list, interesting extracts.     \n*Cons:* Smells like waxy crayons, crumbly texture that doesn’t melt well into the skin, left a waxy feeling behind.     \n*Bottom Line:* I’ve tried better.    \n       \n11.   **Tata Harper Water-Lock Moisturizer - 2/10**  \n*Pros:* I liked her organic Vermont farm story and the light gel cream texture.   \n*Cons:* strong fragrance, contains skin irritants like Alcohol, limonene, citral, citronellol, linalool and orange peel extract.   \n*Bottom Line:* Don’t use if you have sensitive skin. There is a sunburn warning on the side of the box because it contains AHAs.    \n \n12.    **Saturday Skin Carrot + Niacinamide Moisturizing Cream - 6/10**  \n*Pros:* Hydrating thick gel cream.    \n*Cons:* Smells so strong of silicone.   \n*Bottom Line:* Bought it in Europe, loved it. Bought it in the US, smelled like straight up silicone. Different formula maybe?     \n     \n13.   **Glossier Future Dew - 0/10**  \n*Pros:* Cute packaging.   \n*Cons:* Made me look like a greasy pizza, broke me out and don’t like the smell.   \n   \n14.   **Versed Sunday Morning Antioxidant Oil-Serum – 1/10**  \n*Pros:* inexpensive.   \n*Cons*: Does nothing. The biphase ends up looking gross and muddled after a while.    \n   \n15.   **Murmure Bisou Clarifying Dry Oil – 10/10**  \n*Pros:* Cleared my blackheads, sinks into the skin fast.    \n*Cons:* Contains hazelnut oil so be careful if you have an allergy!     \n*Bottom Line*: I use it about 2x a week at night (not on the same day as my retinol). My skin is always less red and bumpy in the AM.    \n    \n16.    **Typology Glycolic Acid 10% - 3/10**   \n*Pros:* Affordable (Typology is like the French version of the Ordinary).    \n*Cons*: Broke me out, 10% glycolic acid is too strong for my skin.    \n     \n17.   **Nuxe Huile Prodigieuse Multi-Purpose Dry Oil – 9/10**  \n*Pros:* Nice dry oil that soaks in quickly, love the smell (I only use this on my body so the fragrance doesn’t bother me).   \n*Cons:* Wish it had a dropper or pump to make application less messy.   \n*Bottom Line:* I put this all over my body after my shower and my skin feels baby soft.   \n     \n18.   **Innisfree Daily UV Defense Sunscreen 36 SPF – 5/10**  \n*Pros:* Good value for money.   \n*Cons:* Broke me out, a little too oily.   \n*Bottom Line:* They have changed the formula since I tried it so I cant speak for the new formulation.     \n     \n19.   **La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5+ - 7/10**   \n*Pros:* Super soothing and healing.   \n*Cons:* clogged my pores (avoid if you have acne or milia prone skin).   \n*Bottom Line:* I would buy again for my eyelid dermatitis that I get every winter\nFor who? Dry, irritated skin.         \n20.   **SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic Serum - 8/10**    \n*Pros:* Brightened and evened my skin tone.   \n*Cons:* So expensive it hurts! Oxidized at around the 4 month mark. Smells slightly unpleasant.   \n*Bottom Line:* One of the most effective formulas for vitamin c that Ive tried. Keep it away from light and to close the bottle tightly so it doesn’t oxidize as quickly.    \n      \n21.   **Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Ultra-fine Mist – 1/10**  \n*Pros:* Cute packaging.   \n*Cons:* Broke me out, overpowering candy fragrance, didn’t hydrate.    \n     \n22.   **Pillow Talk Derm Major Fade Flash Mask – 0/10**  \n*Pros:* I can’t speak to the effectiveness of the product because my skin couldn’t handle it.    \n*Cons:* Instantly burned my face into a red mess.    \n*Bottom Line:* 15% glycolic acid was too much for my skin. Make sure to always patch test new products.    \n      \n23.   **The Outset Nourishing Squalane Daily Moisturizer – 7/10**  \n*Pros:* Clean ingredients list, nice light texture.    \n*Cons:* Not hydrating enough for my skin.    \n*Bottom Line:* If you have sensitive skin and like a lightweight moisturizer it might be worth a try.    \n    \n24.   **Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy – 10/10**   \n*Pros:* Heals, hydrates/seals in moisture.   \n*Cons:* Packaging is kinda ugly.   \n*Bottom Line:* Cult classic for good reason. I’m team Aquaphor over vasaline every day.   \n      \n25.   **Skinfix Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream – 10/10**   \n*Pros:* Super hydrating and nourishing. Nice cream gel texture.   \n*Cons:* none.   \n*Bottom Line:* My sensitive skin loves this moisturizer. Even though I have acne prone skin I still prefer their normal triple lipid over their gel version.       \n26.   **Saturday Skin Yuzu Vitamin C Sleep Mask – 4/10**  \n*Pros:* slightly brightening.   \n*Cons:* Strong smell, contains citrus oils, feels quite sticky.   \n     \n27.    **Youth to the People Superfood Air-Whip Moisture Cream – 3/10**   \n*Pros:* nice light airy texture.   \n*Cons:* Has fragrance and limonene. Didn’t do much.   \n*Bottom Line:* Last time I was at sephora I did notice that the cream is no longer a light green color, so I think they changed the formula.   \n    \n28.    **Caudalie Beauty Elixir Face Mist – 0/10**  \n*Pros:* None.   \n*Cons:* Doesn’t smell great, does nothing, has alcohol, fragrance, rosemary oil, citral, linalool, citronellol…).   \n*Bottom Line:* Outdated product imo.  \n    \n29.    **Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen 40 SPF – 5/10**  \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast.   \n*Cons:* Expensive and broke me out.    Feels very silicone heavy. like my skin was suffocating.    \n*Bottom Line:* Sensitive acne prone skin beware.   \n     \n30.    **U beauty The Plasma Lip Compound (Rose) – 0/10**   \n*Pros:* Couldn’t keep it on my lips long enough.   \n*Cons:* Smells so bad like straight up chemicals.   \n*Bottom Line:* So disappointing because it was really expensive.   \n    \n31.    **Youth to the People Polypeptide-121 Future Cream – 7/10**   \n*Pros:* Hydrating and plumping.   \n*Cons:* Started to smell a little funny when I got halfway through the jar.   \n    \n32.   **Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm – 8/10**   \n*Pros:* Nice creamy texture that melts into the skin. Smells delicious and removes makeup well.   \n*Cons:* Leaves a greasy film on my eyes\nBottom Line: One of the few glow recipe products that I actually like.    \n  \n33.   **Fresh Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream (Night) – 1/10**\n*Pros:* lovely texture.   \n*Cons:* Smells way too strong, like straight up perfume. Has citral, limonene, lemon peel oil and fragrance.   \n*Bottom Line:* Sensitive skin beware.   \n     \n34.   **Typology Niacinamide 12% - 5/10**   \n*Pros:* Inexpensive.   \n*Cons:* 12% niacinamide is too strong for my skin.   \n*Bottom Line:* studies show that your skin reacts best at a 4% concentration. I like to add a little into my moisturizer every so often to dilute it.   \n     \n35.    **Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask – 3/10**  \n*Pros:* Smells delicious (but has fragrance).       \n*Cons:* Made my lips more dry. I don’t like having to scoop into a jar.        \n*Bottom Line:* I don’t understand the hype of this product.    \n      \n36.   **Clarins Lip Comfort Oil - 9/10**  \n*Pros:* Not sticky, lasts a while and very shiny.   \n*Cons:* Wish there was more color payoff and kinda pricey (not doir expensive but getting there).    \n*Bottom Line:* My fav lip product to date.

    "body": "Our monthly stroll by the mall was the only thing that ever gave me a sense of normalcy in my former life.\n\nMom would dreamily and slowly walk by every store, contemplating the lives she would never get close to live. We watched brand new toys, shiny bracelets and a world of silk and wonder – a world that would never exist for people in our social standing.\n\nIt took me a while to understand that the trips were for her own sake, not mine.\n\n*“Your daughter could be a model, you know?”*\n\nThe smiling man approached us when we were having our ritualistic ice cream – we couldn’t afford anything there but the once-a-month sweet treat.\n\nI’ll admit I have unique looks. My hair was always jet-black, even as a child, contrasting with pale complexion and emerald eyes. I had, indeed, fantasized about being a model when I grew up, after seeing so many advertisements in the mall, all of them containing huge images of stunning ladies, surrounded by perfume bottles and jewelry, and dressed in daydreams.\n\n*“My husband… he…”* Mom started to shyly answer, but the man cut her off. He probably went through that dozens of times.\n\n*“Why don’t I give you my card and you call me after Dad allows it?”*\n\nHis smile grew wider. So wide you could see something underneath, but as a 7-years-old, I couldn’t pinpoint what.\n\nShe agreed.\n\nThat night, I pretended to sleep and overheard them.\n\n*“How much did he offer you, Janet?”* dad asked, aggressively as usual.\n\n*“N-nothing”* she stuttered. In his presence, she always did.\n\nHe slammed his huge hands against the counter.\n\n*“You’re lying! I know how those things work!”*\n\n*“I-I swear, Bradley. He just told me to call”.*\n\n*“So call him, dammit!”*\n\n*“Just like that?”*\n\n*“What do you want me to say? We can’t afford it anymore. I’m not even sure the damn prick is mine. You used to be quite the whore”.*\n\n*“I-I just had one other boyfriend before you, Brad”*, her voice now sounded teary and hurt.\n\nIt took me a few years to understand what he meant. The bastard. I looked exactly like him.\n\nThey fell silent, so silent that I could hear dad sipping from his bottle. Mom dared speaking.\n\n*“So you want to give her away?”*\n\nAnother slam.\n\n*“Don’t be dumb. Who’s talking about giving? We’re selling it”.*\n\n*“But you know they probably will…”*\n\n*“That’s none of my fucking business, Janet”.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe next morning, Mom asked me to wear my favorite dress and pack my best clothes. It was easy because I didn’t have many that could be considered good.\n\n*“Where are we going, mom?”*\n\n*“Modeling”*, she answered in a rushed tone, her smile faltering. *“We’ll see that nice gentleman from yesterday”.*\n\nWe took the bus because dad didn’t let her drive – said she was too dumb for it. He, on the other hand, was almost always too wasted to control a wheel. Our decadent Chevrolet Vega sat in the garage collecting dust.\n\nDad made sure to be there to see that mom didn’t hide any money from him. He didn’t let her work, so he knew that if she handled the transaction alone, he would probably never see her again.\n\nEverything was quick. The gentleman was named Mr. Carson, and his slightly chubby hand gave my parents a firm handshake, then handed me a lollipop. He took a few pictures of me, said everything was good, and gave my parents the money; it seemed to be more than they expected.\n\n*“Damn, if that’s the price we should make a new one”*, dad exclaimed, his yellowed fangs opening up in a smile for the first time in years.\n\nMom bit her lip and buried her face on her only coat, a beaten-up pinkish parka.\n\nShe stroked my hair, tearing up silently, and we parted ways.\n\nMr. Carson took me to his house. His car was brand new and he let me pick the song. The drive was so different from the ones with my parents; the songs were always filled with screams: dad cursing at the other drivers, Mom begging him to not pick a fight, him telling her to shut up. If he was in a really bad mood, he would lock me in my room and leave me without dinner because I was breathing too loud or couldn’t hold back my tears while they fought.\n\nThe place was a suburban, generic middle-class house, white picket-fence style. It was gorgeous for a humble girl like me. He parked.\n\n*“What we’ll do now, Mr. Carson?”* I asked, afraid he would hit me for being snoopy.\n\n*“Please, call me Ted. I’m taking you to your room. Soon it will be lunchtime, but I have a task for you first”*, I looked at him obediently. *“I left a videotape in your room’s TV. Please watch it and, during lunch, act like the girl you’ll see. Got it?”*\n\n*“Sure, Ted!”* I was overjoyed my room had a TV.\n\nI diligently watched the tape, then after around two hours Ted took me downstairs to have a light lunch, consisting of sandwiches and soda. I did my best to imitate the girl.\n\n*“You’ve done well, Delilah. This is your name now, got it?”*\n\nI nodded. I don’t remember the name I had before.\n\n*“I’ll put on another tape for you, but you can use the afternoon to relax too. Take a nap if you want. You’ll have a lot of tasks tonight”*, he said, taking me back upstairs.\n\nThat night, while I prepared for dinner, I was confident in my skills. Ted left me a brand new change of clothes, and told me dress up nicely; it was a special occasion.\n\nOn the dining room, stood an older woman. She was beautiful, and looked remarkably like me. Her eyes sparked up when she saw me, wearing a pretty tutu dress.\n\n*“Delilah!”* she hugged me tightly then, still not letting go, stared at Ted. *“How did you do it? They’re almost identical”.*\n\n*“I was lucky”.*\n\nOver dinner, they explained to me why I was there.\n\nTed and Laura had a daughter named Delilah who died at 15. It was a painfully silly death; she insisted to go to a pool party and drowned. Most people around were drunk teenagers – too drunk to help.\n\nTheir world was destroyed; they couldn’t accept losing their only child, the light of their life. She was such a good girl, and now she was gone by such a stupid reason. So they decided to look for a new one – a girl that looked like the original Delilah and could mimic her demeanor.\n\nThey were so good to me. Laura loved me to bits, and Ted spoiled me rotten. I was a true princess, living a make-believe life. I went to a great school, we had amazing family trips together, my toys and clothes were always the best, the trendiest, the coolest.\n\nIt was easy to become their perfect daughter once I practiced a little. Delilah never had to beg for a cup of water or be trapped inside a dark closet because she was listening to the TV too loud. As long as I learned everything about the original Delilah and could act like I was her, the world was mine.\n\nUntil I turned 12.\n\nTed and Laura said they needed to talk with me. I was ready to be send back home, to the horrible, hopeless life I had before.\n\n*“You know, Delilah… our other Delilah was perfect, but she had a serious problem”*, Laura started.\n\n*“She grew up. She grew apart from us. If she never insisted on making her own decisions, on going to that damn party, she would still be here with us”* Ted was grinding his teeth. *“We can’t let that happen to you”.*\n\nI admit I thought they would kill me to preserve my youth and innocence. But Ted had other plans.\n\n*“Your father is a very good scientist. He can fix you”.*\n\nI consented, still unsure of what needed to be fixed. But I wanted to be with them, and I want them to be happy.\n\nThe three of us went to the basement and Ted wired me to his machines.\n\n*“You’ll be young forever, my Delilah”.*\n\n*“Let’s hope it works this time”*, Laura added, uneasily.\n\nThe last thing I remember before being hit by a bolt of endless pain was understanding that there were other surrogate Delilahs before me.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI thought I would never speak again from the pain.\n\nI felt my bones shattering into a million pieces and reforming back all wrong; rinse and repeat.\n\nMy body was an endless puzzle consisting of a billion pieces that nothing could put back together. My limbs literally swam in a pool of despair – metallic despair. It was my own blood.\n\nI was nothing but a pile of organic matter for days. I was as much a daughter as I was a guinea pig. Floating, infinitely floating in his lab fluids.\n\nUntil somehow everything was assembled again.\n\nI woke up in my bed. Both Laura and Ted were by my side.\n\nThere was a sharp pain in the back of my neck, but other than that, nothing at all. They kissed my hair, begged for forgiveness and asked how I was.\n\nI was, as crazy as it sounds, fine. The hours of infinite aching were distant now, almost like they happened to someone else.\n\nI ran my fingers through my neck and felt something different there. I asked if they could see anything. Ted gasped.\n\n*“It’s a new bone”.*\n\nThe new bone was small, but shaped like a thorn. It prickled my finger, but didn’t really hurt me.\n\nTwo years went by. While the other girls my age were quickly growing up in height and shape, I never fully developed into a teenager. It was clear that something was different with me.\n\nTed and Laura were overjoyed to notice I was still childish in mindset and looks. It had worked, after all.\n\nI didn’t mind it. Maybe puberty was nice to others, but not to most; a lot of my classmates had awful breaks of acne, and talked in irregular, weird tones of voice. One girl even had a boob way bigger than the other. I was happy being a child instead of a train wreck.\n\nOthers weren’t so happy.\n\n*“Why the hell your looks don’t change? Are you a fucking witch?”*\n\nIt was Sandy, the tallest girl in class. She was a troublemaker, and she had picked me as a target because I was too short and my skin was too clear.\n\nI just tried to unleash my arm from her, I swear. I don’t like fighting. But I ended up crumbling her ulna and radius.\n\nIt happened in an instant and it was so crazy. I merely grabbed her wrist and felt everything inside collapsing.\n\nSandy cried desperately, her arm swelling and looking like rubber, while shards of bones erupted from the skin. It was nauseating seeing what was left of her bloody mass of bones.\n\nNobody understood what happened, and everyone ruled out as impossible that such a small girl could cause this damage to a strong and tall bully. The school nurse called the hospital while saying that Sandy must have fallen in a weird way.\n\nThat day, I felt the thorn-like structure in my neck burning like crazy. When I told Ted, he took me to the lab to perform a few tests.\n\n“It appears that, as a side-effect, you became extremely strong” he said, after a few hours.\n\n“But why I didn’t crumble anything else before?” I asked.\n\n“How did you feel when this girl Sandy tried to pick a fight with you?”\n\n“Very annoyed”.\n\n“Well, then your strength is probably triggered by negative emotions”.\n\nI considered the information for a few seconds. It made sense; my life was so perfect that, ever since I underwent the procedure to stay young forever, I never had a bad experience – or, at least, not the kind that would make me easily break something as sturdy as a human bone.\n\nA few weeks after we discovered my superhuman-angry-strength, I finally understood that dad thought he was selling me to prostitution – and he was totally okay with it.\n\nAfter hurting my mother in ways I’ll never know and understand, after hitting me and starving me over nothing, he thought that handing a 7-years-old – his only daughter – to an unknown man was perfectly normal; if she was going to be sexually enslaved, it was none of his business.\n\nThis thought made me feel very annoyed.\n\nI just rang the doorbell of my former home[.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPoisoningTales)\n\nWho would believe that a teenager too small for her age could turn a grown man’s limbs to dust?",

Whenever she visits me and my fiancée or our parents she'll just dump her kids to everyone else and sit around with no responsibility. One time she was mad that my fiancée couldn't babysit for her kids because my sister wanted to go to a bachelorette party but it was also my fiancées birthday so she of course didn't want to stay inside watching someone else's kids on her bday.\n\nNow my sister gave birth to another baby. The baby is 1.5 months old. On Saturday we had to attend my cousins wedding. My fiancée wore her usual perfume. On the reception my sister tried to dump the baby on my fiancée again but she didn't do so because she smelled my fiancé's perfume. She then got mad that my fiancée wore perfume and said something like \"You knew you'd be around a baby and you're wearing a heavy perfume like that?\" my fiancée told her it's a wedding, she's allowed to wear perfume. She then noticed my fiancé also has a body glitter lotion on and my sister got even more mad. She called my fiancée insensitive for wearing perfume and body glitter knowing she'd have to interact with the baby at some point.\n\nI told my sister that maybe she should stop trying to dump her kids onto other people, in this case my fiancée and if other people's scents and lotions bother her so much she should care for her own kids for once.\n\nMy parents called me insensitive for saying that to my sister and how being a mom is not easy and I was really hard on her. They also said I'm TA for defending my fiancée like that just for wearing perfume and lotion and how it's not that difficult to skip perfume and lotion so you can help someone else when they need to and they called us disrespectful to my sister's needs and the baby.",

We both live across the country from our families and see then a few times a year for a week or so at a time.\n\nWe budgeted enough to splurge a little this year and we both started good jobs at the start of the year that gave us both bonuses. Together our bonuses are a combined 1500 dollars, and we agree this is the firm budget for Christmas gifts, split evenly. I know it seems like a lot but there are several things we have both gone without for a while when we were struggling for the first couple years of our relationship financially. We both desperately needed new clothes and a few other misc. items. We both prepared lists of clothes, shoes, cologne/perfume, things for our apartment like a rice cooker, new bedding, some items for our dog.\n\nIn total I bought him everything on the list. I told him several times that I was so excited for \"our first real Christmas together\", emphasis on \"our\" Christmas, and I told him over and over again how extremely romantic and intimate I thought it was going to be. In my head we would simply have a lowkey Christmas, stay in, cook a big meal, mess around in bed for most of the day and play video games or something.\n\nI felt like I communicated this clearly and we both agreed, I know for sure we talked about it and he never seemed to contest or ask for anything else. We spent the entire month of November talking about our mutual excitement and seeking out activities for us to do together, dates, board games, etc. We had a few dates planned.\n\nI don't know what came over him last night, but he decided to tell me my Christmas gift early. He spent a large portion of my gift budget on a plane ticket for my kid sister, orchestrated and planned with my parents to send her to our apartment to spend Christmas with us, and got my sister some gifts to open on Christmas morning so she wouldn't feel left out.\n\nHe has a whole week planned for him, me, and my sister. All of our date ideas, but he included her. We will go see Christmas movies and Christmas lights with my sister. He got me 1-3 items off of my list, but none of these items were the things I needed i.e. warm clothes, shoes, bras, a winter coat, cosmetics.\n\nWe both made a lot of sacrifices this year while we struggled together, and I was looking forward to getting some items that would help me feel like me again and not like I was just in survival mode.\n\nMy gift is that my sister is getting a vacation to my apartment. When he explained this to me, I just started crying. I feel so insanely frustrated. I love my sister, and we are very close but it's because I am more like a parent to her. When I moved away and met my bf I had some independence from this, but now something I was really looking forward to has been turned into a baby-sitting experience where I'm in charge of giving my sister a child's Christmas experience. I'm upset that my bf doesn't know me well enough to know that this was actually one of the worst things he could do for me. He knows I hate surprises and grand gestures. I told him this really ruined my Christmas, and it's something that can't be undone without upsetting my sister who I feel responsible for.\n\nMy bf is telling me I'm being ungrateful and that he tried his best to be thoughtful, but I can't shake the feeling that this was the last thing from thoughtful. Can someone please offer some insight?",

This is not a brand new relationship, you two are very far from strangers and I’m certain you have talked about family situations and past dynamics at least a good handful of times. You set simple, clear, easy expectations for him and he just refused to meet them. And even above that, and what’s most important to me, is that when he saw how much this choice of his hurt you he didn’t immediately start apologizing or trying to figure it out with you, he just called you ungrateful. He didn’t even consult with you before making this decision that would affect you both. I’m sure there were more details to the interaction but this is what really seems important to me. It may not be kind but your partners lack of kindness and consideration to you is enough to seriously evaluate who you thought he was and perhaps even his place in your life.

    "body": "Hello again! Turns out that there are a lot of books out there.\n\n**Neuromancer by William Gibson**\n\n* **Plot:** A down and out hacker gets in over his head.\n* **Page Count:** 271\n* **Award:** 1984 Hugo, 1984 Nebula\n* **Worth a read**: Yes.\n* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot**, **World**, or Character)\n* **Bechdel Test**: Fail\n* **Technobabble:** Oh sweet saskatoons.\n* **Review:** Look, it's great, alright? Does the story jump wildly? Sure. Does it require more than one reading? Probably. And yeah, it's intentionally confusing. But the plotting is superb - truly breakneck speed. And just what a world. It's spectacular. It's work to get into it, but I enjoyed the heck out of this.\n\n**Mythago Wood by Robert Holdstock**\n\n* **Plot:** There's a fine line between myth and reality, one that doesn't exist within the Wood.\n* **Page Count:** 274\n* **Award:** 1984 World Fantasy Award\n* **Worth a read**: No\n* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or Character)\n* **Bechdel Test**: Hard Fail\n* **Technobabble:** Fantasy Babble in Spades.\n* **Review:** Very clever premise and good writing that ultimately lack payoff. Unavoidable and excessive sexism to astounding levels. Obsession is a good character trait - but it's also the only one that anyone in this book has. Plot events occur for the sake of something happening - without reason, often without impact. They just... happen. Also, obsessively explaining the rules of this world while then having arbitrary new rules sneak up for plot convenience feels silly.\n\n**Ender’s Game by Orson Scott Card**\n\n* **Plot:** When the Buggers return, we're going to need the greatest military mind Earth can produce to stop them. Which means we need to start training young.\n* **Page Count:** 256\n* **Award:** 1985 Nebula, 1986 Hugo\n* **Worth a read**: Absolutely\n* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot**, World, or **Character**)\n* **Bechdel Test**: Possible Technical Pass? But Likely Fail.\n* **Technobabble:** Moderate.\n* **Review:** Look, it's great, okay? Writing is solid, characters are consistent, pacing is deftly executed. Stakes are maintained throughout. Relentless nature of issues brilliantly done - the moment one issue is solved, another appears. It's just a really great book. It's got some flaws, sure. But it's just a joy to read. I'm also extremely biased: this is also the first real science fiction book I can recall reading, when I was nine.\n\n**Speaker for the Dead by Orson Scott Card**\n\n* **Plot:** Ender Wiggin travels to the only planet where humans are interacting with another species, in the hopes of finding somewhere to leave the Bugger Queen.\n* **Page Count:** 419\n* **Award:** 1986 Nebula, 1987 Hugo\n* **Worth a read**: Yes\n* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or **Character**)\n* **Bechdel Test**: Pass\n* **Technobabble:** Moderate.\n* **Review:** A very different side of Ender, but a believable development. A truly massive cast of characters to keep track of, for the most part successfully. The Piggies are excellent - aliens with confusing customs, misunderstandings, physiology, and so on. And all grounded with some compelling and heartbreaking human drama. A worthy follow up to *Ender's Game*.\n\n**Xenocide and Children of the Mind by Orson Scott Card**\n\n* **Plot:** Buggers, Piggies, and Humans all live together in uneasy peace. But the descolada virus lives with them, lethal to humans. Perhaps the only way to stop it is to destroy the planet.\n* **Page Count:**\n   * **Xenocide:** 592\n   * **Children of the Mind:** 370\n* **Award:** Books 3 and 4 of a series; 1 and 2 won awards.\n* **Worth a read**: No. Which hurts to say.\n* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or **Character**)\n* **Bechdel Test**: Pass\n* **Technobabble:** Mucho.\n* **Review:** Were you satisfied with the evolution of Ender from *Ender's Game* to *Speaker for the Dead?* Good, because we're done with character development. Massive cast of characters, each with one negative character trait, which is fixed by the end of the story. Slapdash inclusion of galactic politics to try to add stakes instead rips out the human core of the Enderverse. Meanders unpleasantly - actual story has some interesting beats but could be told in a third of the time.\n\n**Job: A Comedy of Justice by Robert Heinlein**\n\n* **Plot:** When Alex comes to, he is not in his own world. Is God testing him?\n* **Page Count:** 377\n* **Award:** 1985 Locus Fantasy\n* **Worth a read**: No\n* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or **Character**)\n* **Bechdel Test**: Fail\n* **Technobabble:** Minimal to moderate.\n* **Review:** All the fun of parallel worlds with no charm. Irritating characters responding in incomprehensible manners to unfortunate but often uninteresting twists of fate. New candidate for weakest female lead character in a book! Pacing is atrocious - up to and including a massive shift for the final third or so of the book, making it feel like two lackluster novellas. This book felt significantly longer than its 370 pages. Everything about this book feels half-baked and peculiarly self-indulgent.\n\n**Song of Kali by Dan Simmons**\n\n* **Plot:** It's a once in a lifetime opportunity to speak with an elusive author. But darkness and danger are everywhere...\n* **Page Count:** 311\n* **Award:** 1986 World Fantasy Award\n* **Worth a read**: Maybe? But probably not.\n* **Primary Driver:** Rare bonus: Atmosphere.\n* **Bechdel Test**: Fail\n* **Technobabble:** Minimal.\n* **Review:** Excellent use of atmosphere, legitimately gripping as horror. Masterful interplay of understated yet unsettling and acutely horrifying. Pacing is slow but usually well executed to ratchet up tension. Like much horror, often hard to get behind the protagonist - he continues to do unreasonable things, and push himself needlessly further into these situations. Also, feels kinda... problematic. No one is slinging slurs around, but there's definitely some extreme fetishizing goin' down.\n\n**The Postman by David Brin**\n\n* **Plot:** Society has already collapsed. But someone needs to deliver the mail...\n* **Page Count:** 339\n* **Award:** 1986 Locus SF\n* **Worth a read**: Yes\n* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, World, or **Character**)\n* **Bechdel Test**: Fail (Slim chance that there's a technical pass, but... I don't think so.)\n* **Technobabble:** Minimal to moderate.\n* **Review:** I am a sucker for a good grifter, and Gordon Krantz is one of the best. He's one of the few \"full\" characters here - but I was rooting for him the whole time. The natural evolution of his role is believable; it keeps the story moving. His interpersonal interactions are also good - and the few other characters who are more developed are nicely done. *The Postman* stumbles when it tries to expand this small-scale story of a survivor to a broader world - pacing, plot, and character all suffer in the home stretch. Can be preachy about American Exceptionalism…\n\n**Chronicles of Amber (Corwin Cycle) by Roger Zelazny**\n\n* **Plot:** Amber, a parallel realm to ours, is in a state of turmoil. Fantasy hijinks ensue.\n* **Page Count:**\n   * *Nine Princes in Amber: 175*\n   * *The Guns of Avalon: 223*\n   * *Sign of the Unicorn: 192*\n   * *The Hand of Oberon: 188*\n   * *The Courts of Chaos: 189*\n* **Award:** None, but Book 6 (which begins the next quintet) won.\n* **Worth a read**: Yes.\n* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot, World, or Character**)\n* **Bechdel Test**: Fail (Unsure...)\n* **Technobabble:** Fantasy Babble - yes\n* **Review:** Delightful fantasy. Wildly unpredictable, charming protagonist, neat world. A deftly handled update to the standard sword and sorcery formula. Clearly written with tropes in mind, and uses them (or subverts them) to excellent effect. This is not an impactful read; it is not profound, or deeply thought-provoking, or anything else. It is instead a perfectly streamlined snack, and as such it is one of the best.\n\n**Chronicles of Amber (Merlin Cycle) by Roger Zelazny**\n\n* **Plot:** As much as Merlin wants to be his own person, Amber keeps pulling him in.\n* **Page Count:**\n   * *Trumps of Doom: 184*\n   * *Blood of Amber: 215*\n   * *Sign of Chaos: 217*\n   * *Knight of Shadows: 251*\n   * *Prince of Chaos: 241*\n* **Award:** *Trumps of Doom:* 1986 Locus Fantasy\n* **Worth a read**: Yes\n* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot**, **World**, or **Character**)\n* **Bechdel Test**: Fail.\n* **Technobabble:** Mild fantasy babble.\n* **Review:** A remarkable job of creating a sequel series. Takes the previous five books as a foundation and develops it, filling in details of the world. Also adds a new magic system – or, more accurately, adds new aspects to the already neat system of magic. Zelazny struggles a bit in giving Merlin a distinct voice from Corwin. Pacing stays quick, writing is cleaner than the earlier books. Merlin’s motivations are much clearer than Corwin’s as well. Totally enjoyable.\n\n**Perfume: The Story of a Murderer by Patrick Süskind**\n\n* **Plot:** If he gathers enough material, he'll be able to craft the perfect smell. He'll finally smell human.\n* **Page Count:** 263\n* **Award:** 1987 World Fantasy Award\n* **Worth a read**: Yes\n* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, World, or **Character**) + **Atmosphere**\n* **Bechdel Test**: Fail.\n* **Technobabble:** Barely.\n* **Review:** Evil is a challenge. How do you make a monster believable? If it's too ridiculous, there's no justification. If motivations are too believable, well, your monster is not really evil. Süskind nails it. This is evil as a fundamental lack of morality; an indifference to the needs and wants of others. And it's terrifying. Pacing is not always great, plot meanders a bit - but the mood, which is the essential characteristic of a horror story, stays oppressive, and unsettling. At less than 300 pages, this is worth reading for that alone.\n\n**Seventh Son by Orson Scott Card**\n\n* **Plot:** In an alternate-history America, the seventh son of a seventh son is born with remarkable abilities.\n* **Page Count:** 377\n* **Award:** 1987 Locus Fantasy\n* **Worth a read**: No\n* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or **Character**)\n* **Bechdel Test**: Fail\n* **Technobabble:** None.\n* **Review:** An intriguing alternate timeline that is ultimately undercut by bloat and poor pacing. Interesting use of different magic systems. Many well written scenes of believable family interaction, generally convincing interpersonal stakes. The protagonist, however, is the least compelling character by dint of being exceptional at everything. Weak antagonists as well. This book is longer than it needs to be, the series is even more so.\n\n**Tales of Alvin the Maker by Orson Scott Card**\n\n* **Plot:** In an America much like our own, Alvin is one of the only forces of order capable of countering the Unmaker.\n* **Page Count:**\n   * **Red Prophet**\\*: 311\\*\n   * **Prentice Alvin**\\*: 342\\*\n   * **Alvin Journeyman**\\*: 381\\*\n   * **Heartfire**\\*: 336\\*\n   * **The Crystal City**\\*: 340\\*\n* **Award:**\n   * **Red Prophet**\\*: 1988 Locus Fantasy\\*\n   * **Prentice Alvin**\\*: 1989 Locus Fantasy\\*\n   * **Alvin Journeyman**\\*: 1995 Locus Fantasy\\*\n* **Worth a read**: No\n* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or **Character**)\n* **Bechdel Test**: Pass, but only barely. As in, I think in only one book.\n* **Technobabble:** Mild fantasy babble.\n* **Review:** The delicate crafting of Alvin's world gets wackier and wackier the further the series goes. Card desperately scrambles to cram any and all historical figures he can into the narrative with little to no justification. Pervasive religious themes come across as excessive. Slow plotting and attempts to overdevelop backstories leave the story at a standstill.\n* **One Sentence Summaries of Each Book**\n   * **Red Prophet**\\*:\\* What this series really needed was more backstories and some genocide.\n   * **Prentice Alvin**\\*:\\* Racism is bad, education is groovy.\n   * **Alvin Journeyman**\\*:\\* The best way to add action to a series is including legal proceedings.\n   * **Heartfire**\\*:\\* Witchcraft trials are not super-ethical.\n   * **The Crystal City**\\*:\\* The real Crystal City is the friends we made along the way.\n\n**Replay by Ken Grimwood**\n\n* **Plot:** Jeff Winston dies of a heart attack and returns as his younger self. What would you do with a second chance?\n* **Page Count:** 311\n* **Award:** 1988 World Fantasy Award\n* **Worth a read**: No.\n* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, World, or Character)\n* **Bechdel Test**: Fail\n* **Technobabble:** Minimal to none.\n* **Review:** The most generic possible take on (de facto) time travel. Dislikable protagonist doing the blandest and most predictable possible things. If you've read anything similar, you know every single beat of this story. Unremarkable writing. Slow pacing. Completely underwhelming.\n\n**Soldier of the Mist by Gene Wolfe**\n\n* **Plot:** Latro forgets everything: he must keep a close record on a scroll. Even his meetings with gods.\n* **Page Count:** 335\n* **Award:** 1987 Locus Fantasy\n* **Worth a read**: No\n* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, World, or **Character**)\n* **Bechdel Test**: Fail\n* **Technobabble:** Nah.\n* **Review:** A lot of fun elements that do not quite gel. All of the basic elements of story are good: interesting cast of characters, particularly the cameos from different gods; cool settings as we wander through ancient Greece; generally good pacing. It is the central conceit of this book that makes it hard to read: it feels like 20% of the text is Latro either being informed or informing others that his memory does not work. It gets exhausting - and while the rest of this is better than competent, it's not enjoyable. Also, Wolfe's terrible at ending books.\n\n**Soldier of Arete by Gene Wolfe**\n\n* **Plot:** The great amnesiac adventure continues!\n* **Page Count:** 354\n* **Award:** None, but books one and three of the trilogy won.\n* **Worth a read**: No\n* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or Character)\n* **Bechdel Test**: Fail.\n* **Technobabble:** None.\n* **Review:** A less-inspired continuation of the Latro's journey. Wolfe's love of obtuse allusions to historical events and figures would make this a compelling mystery if this was even remotely engaging. Neither characters or situations draw the reader in enough to make this feel like more than a slog. Actual quality of writing is quite high - deft use of imagery, poetic phrasing that avoids feeling overdone. But all in service of an underwhelming product.\n\n**Soldier of Sidon by Gene Wolfe**\n\n* **Plot:** Our favorite amnesiac soldier is back, but this time he's in Egypt!\n* **Page Count:** 320\n* **Award:** 2006 World Fantasy Award\n* **Worth a read**: Not really.\n* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or **Character**)\n* **Bechdel Test**: Fail\n* **Technobabble:** No.\n* **Review:** Did you like the military adventures of Sir Forgetful the first two times it came out? Then this is a great book for you. A different set of supporting characters and a new location - as well as a significant in-world time jump - offer surface level differentiation from the previous volumes. But once the adventure actually begins it is more of the same. Slow pacing and constant reminders of amnesia punctuated with occasional excellent scenes involving the gods. Also, Wolfe's still terrible at ending books.\n\n**The Falling Woman by Pat Murphy**\n\n* **Plot:** An estranged mother and daughter are reconnected on a troubled archeological dig.\n* **Page Count:** 287\n* **Award:** 1988 Nebula\n* **Worth a read**: No\n* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, World, or **Character**)\n* **Bechdel Test**: Pass\n* **Technobabble:** None\n* **Review:** A bland coming of age story/relationship drama with pretensions of being either horror or suspense. Characters are flat: the woman who threw herself into her career and ignored her family, the man who needs to protect people, the old woman who is superstitious. Story is a plodding mess that is meant to give the characters and their interactions the spotlight - but characters don't deliver, and the whole thing crumbles. Boring and predictable.\n\n**Falling Free by Lois McMaster Bujold**\n\n* **Plot:** Quaddies were genetically engineered to thrive in null gravity. Too bad they're basically kept as slaves.\n* **Page Count:** 320\n* **Award:** 1988 Nebula\n* **Worth a read**: For a Vorkosigan Saga completionist: Yes. But can be skipped.\n* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or Character)\n* **Bechdel Test**: Pass\n* **Technobabble:** Yes.\n* **Review:** One of the weaker stories in the *Vorkosigan Saga.* Characters lack depth - and the childlike state in which the quaddies are kept becomes grating. Pacing is decent and the story is somewhat engaging. Leo Graf, the main \"standard\" human character, is far more compelling than any of the quaddies. Corporate greed is a believable but underwhelming bad guy, because \\[gestures vaguely at everything\\].\n\n**Cyteen by C J Cherryh**\n\n* **Plot:** The only person brilliant enough to run the cloning colony cannot live forever - but a perfect copy of her can take her place.\n* **Page Count:** 680\n* **Award:** 1989 Hugo and 1989 Nebula\n* **Worth a read**: No\n* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or **Character**)\n* **Bechdel Test**: Pass\n* **Technobabble:** Oh yes.\n* **Review:** Slow, dull, and plodding, this book is a rough read. Interpersonal relationships are the backbone of the story but a lack of believable or compelling characters make it all fall flat. Beneath it all are some legitimately interesting questions of identity and self, couched in the context of cloning but more broadly applicable. These are posed as unresolved questions, and would be better served by a short story than a text girthy enough to pull a body underwater.\n\n**The Healer's War by Elizabeth Ann Scarborough**\n\n* **Plot:** A nurse in Vietnam tries to navigate the everyday danger of life on the front, and puts herself at risk to care for others.\n* **Page Count:** 336\n* **Award:** 1989 Nebula\n* **Worth a read**: No\n* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, World, or **Character**)\n* **Bechdel Test**: Pass\n* **Technobabble:** None\n* **Review:** Turns out the Vietnam War was not that great. Turns out being a woman in a warzone is not that great. Turns out viewing your enemies as subhuman is not that great. This is a character-driven story, and is semi-autobiographical. Kitty is likeable enough, though inconsistent. There is not really a story, exactly. She is thrown from one situation to another, usually without agency of her own. Pacing is all over the place. Not a terrible book but feels like yet another war story in a long line of such.\n\n**Koko by Peter Straub**\n\n* **Plot:** A series of murders over many decades point to only one person: Koko. But his former squad mates could have sworn he was dead...\n* **Page Count:** 562\n* **Award:** 1989 World Fantasy Award\n* **Worth a read**: No\n* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot**, World, or **Character**)\n* **Bechdel Test**: Fail\n* **Technobabble:** Doesn't really apply.\n* **Review:** Turns out that the Vietnam war was pretty much not a good thing. Superb use of atmosphere and mood coupled with generally good writing. Plot is not great, heavy flashbacks break flow of present-day story. Scenes of gratuitous gore and violence are at first shocking and then become dull. Most characters are flat, making it hard to stay invested in what is a heavily people-driven story. Ends up feeling more like an experience than a story. And gets relentlessly depressing.\n\n**Mystery by Peter Straub**\n\n* **Plot:** The best detective out there - a misanthropic bookworm - tackles corruption and violence in his own backyard.\n* **Page Count:** 548\n* **Award:** Sequel to *Koko*. No awards of its own. Published 1990.\n* **Worth a read**: Yes\n* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot**, World, or **Character**)\n* **Bechdel Test**: Pass.\n* **Technobabble:** None.\n* **Review:** A delightful if surprisingly dark mystery/adventure. Elevated above comparable stories by compelling protagonists and a clear love of books woven throughout. As is the case with many mysteries, some jumps are a bit contrived - but the suspense elements deliver, and Straub's writing shines. Excellent character work.\n\n**The Throat by Peter Straub**\n\n* **Plot:** Tim Underwood and Tom Pasmore team up to investigate a death close to Underwood.\n* **Page Count:** 692\n* **Award:** None, final book in *Blue Rose Trilogy*\n* **Worth a read**: No\n* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot**, World, or **Character**)\n* **Bechdel Test**: Fail\n* **Technobabble:** None.\n* **Review:** A decent horror thriller with interesting meta-fiction elements. However, it feels less like a culmination of a trilogy than a retread, and does not build appreciably upon *Mystery*. Main character work generally solid, but falls off for side characters. Writing is good, plot is messy. Pacing is alright for a 700 page tome, but the story does not justify its length.\n\n**Lyonesse Trilogy by Jack Vance**\n\n* **Plot:** Kingdoms vie for supremacy, wizards do the same, and the fairy folk mock them from the sidelines.\n* **Page Count:**\n* **Suldrun's Garden:** 436\n* **The Green Pearl:** 406\n* **Madouc:** 544\n* **Award:** Madouc - 1990 World Fantasy Award\n* **Worth a read**: No\n* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot**, **World**, or Character)\n* **Bechdel Test**: Pass.\n* **Technobabble:** Some magic gibberish.\n* **Review:** A fantasy epic with a remarkable number of storylines, sometimes told out of chronological order. As a demonstration of how to effectively interweave a huge number of characters and plots this is a masterclass. This does not, however, make it an enjoyable read. Character work is underwhelming - a few standouts highlight how flat most of the others are. Pacing is choppy - sudden frenetic bursts followed by 100 page slumps. World feels pretty standard for medieval fantasy - tricky fae, conspiratorial wizards, arrogant monarchs. Ultimately there is nothing terribly wrong with this trilogy, it just does not feel worth 1300 pages.\n\n**Hyperion by Dan Simmons**\n\n* **Plot:** Seven pilgrims journey to the one place that connects them: the planet Hyperion.\n* **Page Count:** 492\n* **Award:** 1990 Hugo, 1990 Locus SF\n* **Worth a read**: Yes. Right now.\n* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot, World, or Character**)\n* **Bechdel Test**: Possible Pass?\n* **Technobabble:** Moderate.\n* **Review:** Hot diggity dog. What a book. It's a masterpiece. The world is great. The characters are distinct and fantastic. A sense of mystery permeates everything, as well as urgency. Every plot beat is woven brilliantly - each character telling their story informs another, fills in blanks. But doesn't overfill! Keeps things mysterious! World building both answers and raises questions - but so, so, so well. Writing is crisp, pacing is great. I cannot recommend this one enough. Go! Get thee to a bookery!\n\n**The Fall of Hyperion by Dan Simmons**\n\n* **Plot:** The Shrike is not the only threat facing the pilgrims of Hyperion, and much needs to be resolved before the Time Tomb opens.\n* **Page Count:** 517\n* **Award:** 1991 Locus SF\n* **Worth a read**: Yes.\n* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot**, **World**, or **Character**)\n* **Bechdel Test**: Fail(?)\n* **Technobabble:** Yeeeeaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh\n* **Review:** A decent sequel, though a huge change in both tone and format from *Hyperion.* Characters are solid, though heavily dependent upon their development in the first book. Plot is interesting enough to keep raising questions - but not every answer is satisfying. Pacing is all over the place - intermittent monologues pause everything for the sake of exposition. Read it because you've read the first book.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------\n\nAt the request of a number of you, I’ve written up extended reviews of everything and made a blog for them. I took a bit of a break, but things are back and track, and I'm doing my best to keep 'em coming!   I'll put a link in the comments for the curious.\n\nIf you haven’t seen the others:\n\n* [Vol 1: 1950s](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hmr4z5/im_reading_every_hugo_nebula_locus_and_world/)\n* [Vol 2: 1960s](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hwgckx/im_reading_every_hugo_nebula_locus_and_world/)\n* [Vol 3: 1970s Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/i31uvc/im_reading_every_hugo_nebula_locus_and_world/)\n* [Vol 4: Late 70s\\~1980](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/iclihy/im_reading_every_hugo_nebula_locus_and_world/)\n* [Vol 5: Early 1980s](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/l6zkar/im_reading_every_hugo_nebula_locus_and_world/)\n\nAny questions or comments? Fire away!\n\n**A truly massive thank you to everyone who has sent me books, suggestions, gotten me a hot chocolate, or any other support - you guys are all heroes, and I love this community.**\n\nI’ve been using [this spreadsheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/8z1oog/i_made_a_listspreadsheet_of_all_the_winners_of/), as well as a couple others that kind Redditors have sent. So a huge thanks to [u/velzerat](https://www.reddit.com/u/velzerat/) and [u/BaltSHOWPLACE](https://www.reddit.com/u/BaltSHOWPLACE/)\n\nAlso, yes - these are only the books that won “Best Novel” and not any version of First Novel/Short Story/Novella or anything else. I might take a breather at some point and do some short stories, but that is a task for another day.\n\nThe Bechdel Test is a simple question: do two named female characters converse about something other than a man. Whether or not a book passes is not a condemnation so much as an observation; it provides an easy binary marker. Seems like a good way to see how writing has evolved over the years. At the suggestion of some folks, I’m loosening it to non-male identified characters to better capture some of the ways that science fiction tackles sex and gender. For a better explanation of why it’s useful, check out [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hmr4z5/im_reading_every_hugo_nebula_locus_and_world/fx739dv?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) from [u/Gemmabeta](https://www.reddit.com/u/Gemmabeta/)\n\nEdited to fix some typos!",

Though it feels rough around the edges now. \n\nHyperion was the only Simmons work I really liked. Fall of H was, I felt, a little self indulgent. Fleshing out a universe that didn’t entirely need it and the cracks started to show. \n\nCyteen, actually, has been one my favourite books for a very long time. Yes it’s a big plodding political end piece, but I find it compelling somehow. I think it’s place varies depending on how invested you are in her Alliance/Union universe. As half the book is political machination on machination, the other half a coming of age but yes some of the characters aren’t fully cooked yet. And it demands considerable patience with exposition, exposition and occasionally, exposition. \n\nCannot believe how much Card is in here. I found Enders Game a compelling read when I was much younger. I’ve looked back at it and despite the tight writing the overall themes are…a little uncomfortable. To me anyway. \n\nAnd the Heinlein, that felt like a courtesy nod. I mean. He was a dinosaur long before then. I loved his space opera when I was younger but. Yeah. Also could not stop laughing at concept of Heinlein v. Bechdel test. \n\nBrinn, after reading a lot of stuff back in the day I never did read the Postman.

Reposted with permission.\n\nCW: potentially distressing medical details; mention of family member's death\n\nFurther updates possible after OP sees the doctor.\n\nMood spoiler: >!alarming, suspenseful!<\n\n**I shit so hard, I can smell again.**\n\n>[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/ukuuzs/i_shit_so_hard_i_can_smell_again/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)  \n>  \n>32 M 5'6 195 lb  \n>  \n>So the craziest thing happened and I am wondering if I should seek medical attention.  \n>  \n>Today I woke up and nature called as usual. I made my way over to the bathroom and did my business. Now I'm not sure what happened exactly, If I pushed to hard or what, but something in my head popped. It was in the back of my head at the apex of the back of the skull.  \n>  \n>This is the part that scared me. I had intense pain. Really intense pain. In the back of my head. I get cluster head aches and migraines from time to time. But this was not a head ache. This was just an intense pain in the back of my head.  \n>  \n>I am a cancer survivor (ewings sarcoma) and I have dealt with level 10 pain this was easily an 8 or a 9 on my pain scale.  \n>  \n>So I went back to my bed and my girlfriend saw how much pain I was in. She brought advil and the pain went down to a dull roar for about 6 hours. And is now more or less gone.  \n>  \n>But the crazy thing that happened is when I got out of bed I just started sniffling and then a large amount of mucus just came out of both nostrils. The most I have ever seen in my life.  \n>  \n>Now I have had almost no sense of smell for quite a long time. I was always conjested and could not smell anything. Antihistamines did nothing.  \n>  \n>After this event I can smell perfectly again. I am smelling things I haven't smelled in forever and getting very nostalgic.  \n>  \n>I'm honestly so worried something is gonna build up and take my smell away again. But even if it does. Today has just been the best day in a long time.  \n>  \n>I'm in no pain right now. But I am wondering if I should seek medical attention. I am also curious if this will stop my snoring! I guess I'll find out tonight.  \n>  \n>Honestly this is such a ridiculous story and I'm not even ashamed of it. I want to tell everyone hahaha.  \n>  \n>Had anything like this happened to anyone else?  \n>  \n>TLDR: I took a shit. Popped my head, became a booger faucet, then regained my sense of smell.\n\n*In the comments, multiple  medical professionals encourage OP to go the ER due to medical history and possible aneurysm symptoms*\n\n**3 hours later OP replies**\n\n>Hahaha will do! I'm in bed now about to fall asleep. Got a heat pack on cause my neck/head is a bit sore again.  \n>  \n>I really hope I wake up with smell tomorrow!  \n>  \n>I made a meatloaf for dinner today and the smell of the ketchup used for thr sauce was so nostalgic. I haven't been able to smell vinegar or ketchup for ages!  \n>  \n>The other amazing thing is now that im in my room with the AC on my nostrils are cold! I can't remember the last time my nostrils felt cold. I can feel the fresh air enter! Its pure euphoria for me right now!\n\n*Multiple commenters overnight express concern about OP dying in their sleep*\n\n**OP reports back the next day**\n\n>Update: woke up totally fine. I'm going to tell my gp what happened and probably end up with an MRI. My mother died of an aneurysm about 10 years ago so I have had a few MRIs cause it can be hereditary. I haven't had an MRI in the last 5 years though.  \n>  \n>I have also had a ton of CT scans from my days with cancer.  \n>  \n>Either way based one what I'm seeing here I will 100 percent tell my doctor. I have a feeling nothing will turn up on scan. But it's better to be safe then sorry. My Gp is right next to the hospital so I can go straight to ER  \n>  \n>The reason I didn't go to ER right away was I am tested constantly cause of my cancer. From heart function yearly to an MRI/CT every 5 years. To blood tests every 6 months. I have been cancer free for 20 years now though.  \n>  \n>The less happy reason I didn't go. Is I found my mother dead in bed when she had her aneurysm and I was told even if it had burst while whe was next to a paramedic there would have only been a 50 percent chance she would survive and if she did there would only be a 50 percent chance she should have regular brain function.  \n>  \n>I figured if I was having an aneurysm there wouldn't be much I could do and I just wanted to lay in bed with my girlfriend as my last moments but then the pain went away.\n\n*Other commenters ask if OP can still smell today*\n\n>I can and not only can I smell I had the best sleep of my life. I had the AC on and I feel like I had so much cold air go through my nose. I haven't felt cold nares in years.  \n>  \n>So many things I could only kind of smell before smell so strong now. My girlfriends perfume. And Canabis are the two main ones. I could smell them a little bit before but I am picking up so many more notes if that makes sense.  \n>  \n>The smell is just fuller. Then there are things I couldn't smell at all like ketchup, vinegar, soy sauce, toothpaste etc. And smelling those brings me back to my teens. Cause I can't remember the last time I had this scent memory. Honestly this whole experience while terrifying was also terrific.\n\n**Second Update after OP talks to a nurse hotline:**\n\n>I talked to a nurse and am waiting for a doctor. They belive I had some sort of cyst blocking my smell receptors. And what was cleared out was all infection.  \n>  \n>They said to go to ER if my head ache comes back. Or I start having clear fluid drip out my nose. And to lean forward to check if anything is coming out.  \n>  \n>I'll see what the doctor says with in the hour.\n\n**Update 3 after talking to doctor:**\n\n>UPDATE 3: just talked to the doctor on the phone and I'm going to the ER for testing. She said my story is very interesting but she doesn't like it at all.  \n>  \n>She said she would sleep better knowing someone checked me.  \n>  \n>Live or die I am so happy to have this experience and I trust the doctors!  \n>  \n>Wish me luck!  \n>  \n>And remember life is to short to worry about how long it is!\n\n**Update 4 (2 hours after previous):**\n\n>Update 4:  \n>  \n>In the ER waiting.  \n>  \n>Neck pain is back. 4/10 Small head ache. 2/10  \n>  \n>Otherwise in good spirits.\n\n**Update 5 (1.5 hours after previous):**\n\n>Update 5 I think? Maybe 6?  \n>  \n>They took my blood pressure and it made me really nervous  \n>  \n>I was 200/75 and went down to 175/75.  \n>  \n>I'm in first year biology and I know this is way to high.  \n>  \n>She asked me if I was on any blood pressure medication which I'm not.  \n>  \n>My blood pressure has always been a little high but this is like sever hyper tension I think.  \n>  \n>Still feel decent.  \n>  \n>Mild head ache probably cause I haven't eaten today just incase I need to fast.\n\n**Update 6 (about an hour after #5)**\n\n>Update 6:  \n>  \n>Small update.  \n>  \n>Still in waiting room but had blood work done.  \n>  \n>I'm bored. I tried playing hide and seek with some of the nurses but they kept finding me in the ICU...  \n>  \n>My neck is sore but otherwise fine. Small head ache still.  \n>  \n>I can smell my breath in my mask which is cool, I have never been able to smell my breath so my girlfriend tells me if I got coffee or garlic breath.  \n>  \n>Also Holy crap you all were right my last MRI was in 2013 which for those of you playing at home was 9 years ago. Not 5.  \n>  \n>I'm so old now. Hahahaha  \n>  \n>Edit: Just found out I have 300 followers now from 16 before this post. Hope you all like pictures of canabis, warhammer, biology and shower thoughts that are never unique enough.\n\n**Interlude (in which we learn more of OP's backstory)**\n\n>I actually suffer from depression and diagnosed OCD I take 20mg of cipralex daily.  \n>  \n>Depression is a hell of a thing. Feeling alone even if your surrounded by other people is never fun.  \n>  \n>To all my friends out there who suffer from depression I promise you therapy isn't as bad as you think it is. Hopefully this will help even one person. I have the time so here is my story.  \n>  \n>I had cancer at 12  \n>  \n>I was diagnosed with ewings sarcoma which is a type of bone cancer. For my fellow Canadians, Terry Fox had osteogenic sarcoma which is basically the same cancer in long bones instead of short.  \n>  \n>In fact me and Terry had the same oncologist!  \n>  \n>I ended up losing my scapula and the surrounding muscle and lost most mobility in my left arm. I can't lift it higher then my stomach.  \n>  \n>My mother died when I was 21.  \n>  \n>I will never forget that day. I got a call from her work asking if I had seen her cause she hadn't been to work in a few days. I was writing a final exam during this call (My original background is marketing, I'm switching to biology.)  \n>  \n>I remember my whole body sinking cause I put a lot of pieces together in my head that I didn't think of at the time.  \n>  \n>For example her car was in the parking lot, even though she should have been at work. And the worst thing. The thing I don't think I'll ever live down. Is I remember it was a hot summer day and I had a date I was excited for. I went to tell my mom I would be out and I thought she was sleeping. It was really hot so I thought she was just really hot and that's why she had her head curled back into the pillows.  \n>  \n>But that's not what it was. She was dead. She was dead across the hall from me for 2 days and I didn't know. We didn't see each other often cause I would get home late from school. I felt so guilty. I still do  \n>  \n>When I picked her up it was stiff like picking up a surfboard she wasn't my mother anymore. She had just become a \"thing\"  \n>  \n>I have learned to forgive myself because if I didn't figure that out I am pretty sure I wouldn't be here today.  \n>  \n>My kid brother died when I was 23  \n>  \n>I was alone, I was an alcoholic (don't drink anymore)  \n>  \n>I had basically lost everything.  \n>  \n>My brother ODd, he didn't handle my mother's death the same way as me. No matter what anyone says it was depression that took him from me in my opinion.  \n>  \n>It breaks my heart knowing that I wasn't able to be the type of big brother he needed, because I was basically still a child myself. He was only 21 when he passed.  \n>  \n>A few months after my brother died of an over dose my girlfriend of 4 years cheated on me and started actively doing cocaine, she was clean for the 4 years we were together and even a little bit before that.  \n>  \n>I was broken.  \n>  \n>Completely lost, wondering why me. Why are all these things happening to me. I felt I didn't even deserve to be upset because all in all my life is pretty solid, I'm not homeless, I'm not starving.  \n>  \n>But I just felt empty.  \n>  \n>I decided I needed some time to think.  \n>  \n>I took a minimum wage job working at a gamesworkshop . I worked there for 2 years just painting models and selling toys and I shifted from a person of spite, complaints and aggression into someone who realized that not everything has to be perfect. Not everything has to be efficient. You don't have to be the best. You just have to try your best.  \n>  \n>After working there for 2 years I realized what I wanted to do. I always always wanted to work in a science field. But I had no math skills. Because I missed so much school when I had cancer I couldn't do anything past grade 10 math.  \n>  \n>I went to college to upgrade my math. I struggled so hard to just maintain 50 percent on tests. I scraped by every test. I busted my ass studying for the final and guess what happened? I failed. Hard. I ended the class with a C-  \n>  \n>I was devastated. 2 years in the making. And I still came up the loser, I was so mad because it ruined my time line and I wouldn't be able to graduate until I was 37.  \n>  \n>My girlfriend told me something that really brought me back to earth. Whether I spend 5 years at school or not I'm still going to be 37 in 5 years.  \n>  \n>And you know what? She was right. Even with all my new found positive thinking I still failed.  \n>  \n>So you know what I did. I went back to school. I took the math class again and 2 biology courses and got straight Bs!  \n>  \n>I am still so proud of myself. I thought I would never understand math but now I can do stuff that confuses my friends and I am just so happy to be alive and have the chance to learn.  \n>  \n>So no matter how far down that tunnel you go. And trust me you can go far down that tunnel. Please, please don't stop.  \n>  \n>Please keep trying.  \n>  \n>Please keep failing.  \n>  \n>Because at the end of the day we are just specs on a rock flying through space and the universe does not care who we are and what we did.  \n>  \n>The universe does not care who is good and who is bad. And that's okay!  \n>  \n>When your down and out when you have nothing left the only way you can go is up.  \n>  \n>And if the worst happens and you succumb you can rest easy knowing you tried your best to be a good person.  \n>  \n>No matter who you talk to in life, your mother, your teacher, a homeless person. You will leave them better or worse then they started. No one will ever be the exact same after meeting you and it's up to you to decide how they will feel.  \n>  \n>No one will remember what you said but they will always remember how they felt when you said it.  \n>  \n>And for those of you wondering. My current girlfriend is the love of my life. She lost her mother young as well and knows what it feels like.  \n>  \n>Seek that out, seek people who understand you. But also seek out understanding for people who are different from you. Talk to that stranger on the bus, ask people about thier day and actually mean it. Listen to them.  \n>  \n>Anyways this is getting really sentimental. I truly wish you are all having a great day. I hope to be out of the ER soon.\n\n**Update 7 (about 1.5 hours after #6)**\n\n>Update 7:  \n>  \n>I have a room! I am waiting for the doctor. The nurse was much nicer to me after she read what the phone doctor said.  \n>  \n>Hospital staff are so stressed right now. I feel so bad for them.\n\n**Update 8 (about 10 minutes after #7)**\n\n>Update 8: blood pressure taken again 182/75 concerning. Guess I'll need to lay off the salt and red meat!  \n>  \n>Waiting for doctor.\n\n**Final (?) Update (\\~4 hours later, after a CT)**\n\n>Final update (I hope):  \n>  \n>After all of this waiting I have finally been discharged.  \n>  \n>I have no aneurysms and he said that he doesn't think I need a spinal tap because the chances of me having bleeding is very very low. However if I get a bad headache, have trouble walking or anything like that I must go back and I'll be tapped at that point.  \n>  \n>He said he has no idea what happened to me yesterday. He said I should scream this story from the roof tops because it's a great story. And to be honest I agree.  \n>  \n>My blood pressure wasn't to bad he said I think it was 180/90 on the last one but I'm not sure.  \n>  \n>I have to monitor myself closely and go back at the first sign of trouble.  \n>  \n>I haven't eaten anything today I can't wait to get home and have some left over meatloaf and smoke a bowl.  \n>  \n>The one silver lining is I guess I get to wait 9 years before I get tested again! Hahaha. (Kidding)  \n>  \n>To all of you who have supported me today. Thank you.  \n>  \n>From the bottom of my heart thank you all.  \n>  \n>I was so certain I was fine until I read these messages but honestly I am glad I went. It's better to be safe then sorry.  \n>  \n>Never under estimate the power of human compassion. There are so many bad things in this world. So many things that make it seem not worth it.  \n>  \n>But not matter how dark it gets, no matter how much you think the world is against you.  \n>  \n>Just know that there will always be a few thousand people to listen to your shit stories.  \n>  \n>All the best  \n>  \n>That guy who shit so hard he could smell again.\n\n**OP saw his doctor on May 16 (slightly over a week after the original post) and shared this update** [**in a new post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/urff5g/update_i_shit_so_hard_i_can_smell_again_guy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)**:**\n\n>**UPDATE: \"I shit so hard, I can smell again\" guy.**  \n>  \n>First of all thank you all again for your support last week. To all of the concerned doctors, nurses, emt's and averaged redditors just looking to lend a hand.  \n>  \n>I decided to make another post for visability because I think this will be my final public update and I don't want to get a million notifications asking what's up.  \n>  \n>So the results are in! Sort of.  \n>  \n>I had a full physical today and my doctor has no idea what happened to me specifically but she has ruled out any sort of head bleeding.  \n>  \n>The not so great news is my blood pressure is still high. I was I went from 120/×× to about 150/xx  \n>  \n>It has been determined that I will start a small dose of blood pressure medication. This is disheartening as I tried my best to be healthy and even lost 10 pounds since I was checked last year!  \n>  \n>She told me it's not my fault and I lasted much longer then many childhood cancer survivors with out blood pressure medication. She said I just didn't get lucky with my genetics. (My father had his first heart attack at 40ish)  \n>  \n>It's very surreal and it feels bizarre going to college while a bunch of 18 year Olds zip around on nothing but those robot unicycles and hot shame.  \n>  \n>Mean while I am getting put on blood pressure medication! Well to that I say PAH! I'm still young at what's left of my heart! I am going to start a fraternity and we can be Alpha Beta Blockers. It's just going to be a bunch of mature students complaining about the price of gas...around a keg...of Ensure.  \n>  \n>I am going to get a stress test to see how bad everything is.  \n>  \n>I have also been perscribed 3 hours of exercise a week so if any of you have a good fitness subreddit please let me know!  \n>  \n>I will also be seeing a sinus specialist. I think there is more there and the CT showed slightly more thickening then there should be in my mucus lining? (I can't remember where)  \n>  \n>Some questions I'm sure many people will ask.  \n>  \n>The best smell I have smelled so far is still that first ketchup.  \n>  \n>The worst smell I have smelled so far was subway off my gfs hands. I have no idea why but subway just smells bizarre when you don't expect it.  \n>  \n>Some nostalgic smells Motor Oil Bowling Ally Pasta Sauce (I love pasta and now I can smell when I simmer sauce all day)  \n>  \n>Smell I didn't expect was the food court at the mall. I don't know why I never thought it would smell so much but wow. I can see why people stop and get food on a whim now.  \n>  \n>The funniest thing that has happened is my girlfriend now feels the need to be \"strategic\" with her bathroom trips now! Not me though, I just let her rip like always. Hopefully not to hard though!  \n>  \n>School has been great and I am working hard on chemistry this term. It's a new topic for me and I am fascinated with just how wide it is! I always though chemistry was just solutions in test tubes but it seems it's more like problem solving and I really enjoy problem solving!  \n>  \n>As you may or may not know, my background is marketing and I am currently attacking a degree in Biology. (Maybe bio chemistry depending how how much I enjoy this term!) While I love science and that's the way forward for me, the marketer in me would be remissed if I didn't throw this out there well I have this many eyeballs, does anyone know of any scholarships I can apply for as a mature student in Canada, with my background? I am in the process of applying for some and I would love to try for as many as I can. I am happy to write, make videos, speak ect ect.  \n>  \n>Please feel free to shoot me a dm or post them here if you have any!  \n>  \n>My mental health is still strong! My girlfriend and I and working on an exercise plan for the two of us and we are going to kill it and have beach bodies by next Tuesday I promise!  \n>  \n>Also lastly I got some DMs from individuals looking to talk about depression. I am always happy to listen. If you ever need someone to vent to or what ever, come find me! How bad can it be! It's not like you are ever going to shit really hard and hear a pop in your head then spend a day in the ER!  \n>  \n>Love you all,  \n>  \n>Thelosteyeball\n\nThus conclude the adventures of The Guy Who Shit So Hard He Could Smell Again.",

Please get them to read it and make sure they have seen the right Dr before being reassured!! \n\nOP I am still concerned I have to be honest, and this is coming from an ED doc in Australia who literally passed my consultant exams a month ago.\n\nEverything you described screams of a Sub arachnoid haemorrhage.\n\nThis begins with a thunderclap headache, mostly during exertion or straining. This can improve. Sometimes it is associated with a change in neurology, potentially smell interpretation.\n\nIt can cause neck discomfort just as you have described, and also hypertension!!!!! 180/90 is something to be discharged with at your age!!!\n\nNow the issue with these buggers is that they can be annoying to diagnose, sometimes only on an MRI angiogram do we find it.\n\nThey are rare and generally 95% of the time we look we don't find anything. However there is an issue with the ruling out of the diagnosis.\n\nA non contrast CT brain within 6hrs of the onset of headache is 99-100% sensitive in ruling in or out a bleed.\n\nAnything over that time period, you should consider doing an LP or spinal tap as a CT brain may not show a small bleed due to the body resorbing the blood.\n\nNow you presented >12hrs almost 24hrs after the onest of headache which means a CT brain is very likely to be normal.\n\nOnly an LP or an MRI angiogram would be able to 100% rule out a bleed at this time.\n\nPlease please consider returning or seeing someone else ASAP especially if the Dr you saw was Junior and/or not aware of these facts.\n\nI am convinced you have had a Sentinel bleed, given your history, your signs/symptoms etc that Dr is playing with your life by not doing an LP/spinal tap!!!\n\nI am more than happy to show my qualifications to whomever needs it to show proof of my expertise and knowledge in this area as I am EXTREMELY concerned by this story.",

    "body": "Okay, I’m 90% sure that I am, but I’ve let it sit for a day and I’m still hurt. So, I need some outside perspective.\n\nBefore we get into this, I’m very aware that many people in the world get nothing at all for Xmas. I actually spend weeks leading up to Xmas volunteering (virtually this year) for the battered women’s shelter and a foster care organization.\n\nPrior to this Xmas we quarantined for weeks and we all got tested. We are one of those families that doesn’t go into stores (hurray curbside), or eat out, and we are all fortunate enough to work from home or be retired.\n\nNow, my mom does ALL the shopping for Xmas, full stop. She asked what I wanted and because I’m pregnant I just asked for stuff for the baby, especially since I won't have a baby shower. She said, fine, I’ll get that stuff, but what about you and your husband?\n\nWell, we really didn’t want for much so I threw together three ideas for each of us but told her to please shop for baby. I also gave them a link to a registry with over 40 small items selected so they weren’t on their own.\n\nMeanwhile, I got them what they asked for. My dad a Firestick TV and contributed to his Oculus. My mom some jewelry from Pandora and handblown glass cups she wanted. My brother (24m) who still lives with them a case for the iPad they got him and $100.\n\nMy parents still do Santa. The whole bit. The cookies, the milk, the presents that magically show up. It’s their choice. We don’t ask for it, but we play along because it makes them happy.\n\nWe come downstairs yesterday morning and everyone else has gifts from Santa. We do not. My dad just slips us a note saying Santa is done for us so we sit there awkwardly while my mom, dad, and brother open all their gifts from 'Santa'.\n\nThey struggled to find gifts for me at all. They found plenty for my husband (gardening stuff he wanted) but the only real gift they gave me were a pair of Adidas shoes I didn’t ask for, a perfume I don’t wear, and a ramen I like. That’s fine. All I wanted all along were things for the baby who they’ve known for weeks will be a boy.\n\nThey gave us three onesies and an ugly nursing pillow.\n\nIcing on the cake was my older brother (40m) and his family have a whole stack of presents to be sent to them. Just for him, we’re talking power tools, drill sets, brand name clothes, and shoes just for him not to mention wife and kids.\n\nHere’s what might make me an AH. Not wanting to spoil everyone's fun by sulking, I chose to return two days earlier than planned.\n\nMy husband is trying to be understanding but said I may be the AH for expecting anything at all and for leaving so unexpectedly. In fact, the entire family made passive aggressive comments the entire day, but I ignored them all. The only person I felt bad for was my dad, because he seemed truly hurt.\n\nIt feels as if it was just me and my future son who was neglected. So, I left. AITA?\n\nTL;DR I grew out of Santa but the rest of my family apparently didn’t. AITA for leaving 2 days earlier than planned?",

Aside from some small bumps in the road, we have been in a very good place throughout the whole relationship. However, last night things escalated, over - in my opinion - something super dumb. But he thinks differently of that, and now stopped talking to me.\n\nIt started when we were on bed, he was gaming and I was on my laptop looking to order a new perfume. Since I stopped my job (to focus on studying) I don’t have as much income, so I decided to not get the expensive perfume I usually go for, Miss Dior. I thought it’d be better to find a body spray with a resembling scent. As he was looking over my shoulder he asked me what I was doing, so I explained.\n\nHe then reacted saying I wore Miss Dior in our first period of dating and it is “my smell”, and how it was one of the things that attracted him to me. I must admit this made me a bit annoyed, because I’d rather get that perfume too - but it’s just not responsible to do so right now. He started rambling on how I care more about saving money than I care about him. I said that’s not true, but then he kept saying his hypersensitivity issues can’t deal with adjusting to a new scent.\n\nI said I’d find a scent similar to my old one, but he wasn’t content. At this point he said he’d have to break up with me if I would go for another scent. I found this hilarious and thought he surely must be joking so I laughed, which made him go silent. I let him be, because I was really annoyed, and we went to sleep.\n\nNow he left early morning and doesn’t respond to my texts or calls. I have no idea what to do and I’m starting to doubt how I handled the situation.\n\nDid I fail him by not taking his hypersensitivity into account?\n\n***Top Comments:***\n\n**EmceeSuzy:** I'm concerned that you are even asking this question.\n\nThis boyfriend of yours tried to assert that you must stick with the Dior perfume and never once offered to buy it? What is wrong with him?\n\nIn any case, his reaction to your perfume choice is very strange. What are you asking us if YOU did something wrong?\n\n**Shelby\\_the\\_Turd:** Lol threatening to end the relationship because you don’t stick to the brand of perfume he likes. Say that aloud. He is holding the relationship hostage because you didn’t smell a certain way.\n\n**AuntyVenom:** \\>.He started rambling on how I care more about saving money than I care about him.\n\nDid he offer to buy it...for you? This is some of the dumbest shit I've ever heard, sorry. OFC if you're in saving money mode you're gonna pull back on admittedly frivolous purchases, and any regular partner with their head on straight would be glad they had a frugal partner when circumstances demand. He wants you to overspend in order to satisfy his pantsfeelings.\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ib4ao7/update_my_boyfriend_24m_threatened_to_break_up/)**: January 27, 2025 (5 days later)**\n\nWow, first of all, thanks everyone who gave me advice (and some tough love). I did not expect so many of you to help me and definitely teared up at some of your replies.\n\nAfter I posted this I was a bit of a mess, but after hours of ignoring me he texted me late in the evening and asked me to meet up, because he does not want us to be in a bad place. I really wanted to talk to him, at least to clear things up, so I went to his place. When I got there he acted a bit disappointed still, but he did say he didn’t want us to fight. I felt the same, but also took your advice to heart: the idea of letting HIM buy a bottle.\n\nHowever, for some context, I do think he might be on the spectrum (no diagnose but his dad is too, and it’d make sense) so I did want to show him I care and take his hypersensitivity seriously. Therefore I decided to suggest we pay half/half for a new Miss Dior and then until that one would be finished, I’ll make sure to do research to find a really good dupe.\n\nHe was not as convinced, told me it wasn’t my birthday anytime soon. I explained that I understood but we’d have to both compromise. Well, to quote his literal words: “If you’re such a feminist, you should be so financially too”. This got me fuming. I had no words, so this time I left.\n\nAs per your advice (in the replies), I did some thinking about the rest of our relationship. I realised other things in our relationship that at the time didn’t sit quite right with me, were situations of him being controlling and self-concerned, situations I always considered as little things he’d mean differently or would learn from. I was wrong. You were right.\n\nI asked him to meet up today and I dumped his ass. I feel terrible right now, but I know I’m better off. So, anyone advice for a cheap, nice body spray?\n\n***Some of OOP's Comments:***\n\nCommenter: That was a difficult decision, but the right one. I don't know where you live but in the UK/Ireland Aldi does a great miss dior dupe on occasion. It's called perfect pink.\n\n>**OOP:** We do have an Aldi here so I’m going to check it out! Thank you!!!!\n\nCommenter: Good for you, he sounded unreasonable. I would have said that he should pay the difference between the perfume you would have bought and the perfume he wanted you to buy but his comments are so out of line it’s not even worth thinking about anymore \n\n>**OOP:** I didn’t even think about this, it would have been a good reaction but since he thinks I have to pay everything because I’m a feminist, I don’t think he would’ve been okay with that either…\n\nCommenter: I’m so tired of people weaponizing feminism. Good riddance.\n\n>**OOP:** This. I always found it very hard to be mad at him for long, but when he said this I felt like he showed his true colours and I was so, so done\n\nCommenter: What did he say when you broke up with him?\n\n>**OOP:** He mumbled something along the lines of “good, I deserve better” but after that he did text me to say sorry and if we can talk again, so he’s not very consistent ://:\n\nCommenter: Good on you for throwing him out, OP! I’m glad you also got recommendations for a dupe perfume, although maybe a change of fragrance may not be a bad idea so you don’t associate it with him!\n\n>**OOP:** Thank you a lot!!! I was thinking the same thing, I feel like it’s a good time to re-invent myself, starting off with a new signature scent hehe",

    "body": "Course: XenoBiology\n\nInstructor: Professor Ed (Note: The Professor's real name is unpronounceable to the majority of sapients thus a monosyllabic name was chosen at random by his previous institution.)\n\nRating: 4.7/5\n\nTop Comment: Beware the Chalk.\n\nMost asked: What’s Chalk?\n\nMost Helpful: Good luck on the first day. Take the bags.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLecture Hall 47, was, by far, the largest one in the complex. It was a point of pride for Professor Ed something that he, in his mind, had earned. It also had the dubious honor of possessing a piece of history so archaic that it was shunned by every other professor in the university: A blackboard. Blackboards were, according to the professor, one of the few useful things Humanity had provided in the two decades post contact. It’s not that his people, or any other people for that matter, were incapable of producing slate and chalk it's that nobody else clung to such archaic traditions with quite as much vigor. But it was a useful one, and thus it was tolerated, and when he was feeling charitable, it was defended. It helped him single out those students who were meticulous enough to take their own notes instead of relying on digitized lectures and holographic slides. The fact that it gave him projectiles with which to discipline the stupid and the unruly was a completely unintentional and entirely secondary benefit.\n\nProfessor Ed’s exterior mandibles twitched in excitement. It was the first day of the first semester, the heady perfume of innocence and optimism was as infectious as it was omnipresent. Many of the, arguably saner, custodial staff would claim that the professor simply spent too much time inhaling formaldehyde and cleaning agents and it had finally gotten to him. Whatever the air quality of hall 47 may have been, the true source of the Professors glee was his students. He wouldn't waste time covering the syllabus and explaining his expectations, the idiots could read it themselves. Those of them who couldn't or wouldn't had no place being at the best university in the spiral arm, if not the galaxy. He'd go strait for the throat and disabuse them of any notions of complacency, any vestiges of naivety and any, physical or psychological frailty. He hummed, a terrifying sound produced by his species vocal cords and jaws, as he lined up his chalk. The pieces used for writing, pristine and fresh from their boxes, were carefully slotted into styli to prevent premature breaking while the old ones, used for throwing, were set into four distinct piles: One for each manipulator\n\nThe doors at the front of the building unlocked and the sounds of hooves, feet, wings, suction cups and whatever else the myriad species of the galaxy used for locomotion filled the building. The cacophony of movement only occasionally disrupted by the quiet murmurs of uneasy students seeking directions. He sighed when the humans arrived. Of course, they had arrived together, of course they all knew each other, and it was only natural they would be the loudest mammals in the damn building. They weren't a bad race per se they were just...insufferably cocky. Sure, they had arrived on the galactic scene with all the subtly of a supernova, won a war, turned religious fanatics into a fine mist, and were possessed of a few amusing mutations and adaptations but still...they could at least keep up some pretense of humility. Dr. Ed was amazed that even after 20 years not a single human had been devoured by a Skrilat, especially given the number of them that had either tried to pet them or gotten drunk and tried to fight them. It might be that he was underestimating the impact that the Styx firestorms had had on the galaxy or the mental scars left by St. Urbans guns but really... it was just a matter of time.\n\nThe students finally arrived at his hall, the multitude of shapes and forms brought a renewed smile to his face. The tapestry of life was one of the most beautiful sights in the galaxy and there was no better place to witness it than a university. Every species, every race, every sapient in attendance had to coexist in close proximity without prejudice, at least on paper anyways. The confusion on the students faces as they entered the hall was one of the few things which Dr. Ed lived for, a brief moment of levity before his work began. It was a natural for a generation who had grown up rarely holding a stylus. The projectors weren’t on, there were no models to reveal the subject of the day there, there weren't even any displays, there was only the blackboard which none of the students had ever seen...almost none of them anyways.\n\n“Dude...A Chalkboard!” One human said elbowing his friend in the ribs, shattering the moment.\n\n“Huh? Man... it’s like being in Mrs. Braun’s class!”\n\nThe first human laughed the second one laughed with him...both were deserving targets. Chalk, fired with pinpoint accuracy, hit the two humans in the forehead shutting them up and motivating them to find their seats.\n\n“Just like Mrs. Braun” The tall one grinned.\n\n“Dude shut up!” The other punched him in the shoulder. A display of violence that granted them a wide berth and ensured the seats around them remained empty.\n\nThe two humans fell silent under the gaze of a cluster of their professor’s eyes, both suddenly interested in brushing the chalk dust on their clothes in silence while the other students waited in relative sedation for their professor to speak, lest they too suffer a barrage of chalk.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“So.” Professor Ed began letting his gaze wander the hall “Since the humans have drawn attention to themselves. Can anyone classify their home world and species?” It might be a bit beyond them but understanding the classification system was part of the reading he required his students to have done before the year began.\n\nA student from the third row raised its appendage, the third row...where students eager not to appear too eager sat.\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“Homo Sapiens, the Thinking Man colloquially known as Humans, evolved on Earth. A Category 6 Death world.” The student proclaimed\n\nProfessor Ed regarded the student silently for a moment before directing his eyes to the hall at large “How many of you also *know* that Earth is a death world?”\n\nMost of the hall save for the pair of humans sitting off to the side raised their appendages “How many of you *KNOW* that from watching the Terminatus trilogy?” Again, most of the hands, reluctantly, stayed up.\n\n“Well. You are all, as is colloquially known” He turned all his eye clusters to the student who withered away under his glare “WRONG!” He whipped a piece of chalk at the student’s head.\n\n“If you're going to be pompous, be right. Earth is NOT classified a Death world, and even if it were it would be a solid Category three, maybe a five if you squint and play with the data but never. NEVER. A Category 6.” He paused to survey the assembled students “Does anyone know what Earth is actually classified as?”\n\nA few hesitant students slowly marshaled the courage to speak “E-Earth is a Crucible World.” A Syrinx chirped, wings fluttering to bat away any chalk that might go its way\n\n“Yes.” Dr. Ed began writing on the blackboards behind him “Why are crucible worlds not scaled?\n\n“Because there was no reason to?” The student ventured.\n\n“Correct, conventional wisdom holds that crucible worlds are too unstable to host sapient life. Now...taking a step back.” Dr. Ed continued speaking as his lower two arms began writing on the board behind him “There is one thing that must be made abundantly clear. Everyone please read, aloud, what is written on the board.”\n\nThe hall was silent for a moment as the Professor stepped out of the way “ACTION MOVIES ARE NOT VALID SOURCES OF INFORMATION.” The walls shook with the voices of hundreds.\n\n“Excellent. And the next person to proclaim what they heard in a human action movie as a fundamental law of the universe will cover every blackboard I can find, in this martyr damned cluster, with lines.” His third and fourth eye clusters trained on the Carlag who was having a hard time hiding his massive bulk from the professor’s predatory gaze.\n\n“Now” Dr. Ed continued as though he hadn’t just caused the largest species in the galaxy to shrink to half its size “Some of you may be wondering why I’m harping on this, why I’m stressing the importance of nomenclature. It’s true that I have a personal stake in this, I am the highest ranked deathworlder with a doctorate from a reputable university. But more importantly” He directed his eyes, all of them, at the two humans who sat in the fourth row “I served alongside the Marshall of Fire aboard the Nautilus during its slaver hunting campaign in the early 70’s. I’ve seen what happens when sapients regard each other without the bigotry of caste, clade or, species and…” The Professor trailed off shaking his head, face twitched slightly “I know from painful personal experience what happens when we do and am also aware of the consequences when otherwise good people look away while our work is exploited.”\n\n“Consequences?” One of the Tra’zeth asked timidly\n\n“You mean aside from slavery?” Dr. Ed snarled, showing a part of his upper torso that had been disfigured and mangled by the hooks slavers used to control his kind. “Aside from treating sapients like animals because of a designation given by some forgotten biologist a millennium ago? Aside from that you mean…Right?” He demanded letting the Tra’zeth stutter and squirm before waving him to silence.\n\nEveryone knew the slave trade existed, and everyone knew that in a galaxy of 250 billion stars and a trillion planets, there would always be a dark corner for slavers to hide. But as far as these children of the rich and powerful were concerned, slavery and piracy were a problem for people who wore cheap uniforms and wielded cheaper guns. What did they care about pirates in the trade lanes or slavers on the fringe when they had private security, personal ships and never left the core? So, for them it was a shock to stand face to face and be lectured by an ex slave, especially a chattel slave whose body bore the scars and mangled limbs of years of forced labor. A shock they desperately needed if they wanted to delve into Xenobiology and Xenopsychology. If they couldn't survive even such a mild shock without suffering a fit of vapours well...Dr. Ed was not known for tolerating the weak of spirit.\n\n“Do you know what the Marshall asked when he came to the cage, it wasn't comfortable enough to call a cell, I had been left in?” Some of his students, the ones who had taken the course planning to pass time, twitched towards the doors “When his men broke open the cages of the others, they tried to kill their would-be rescuers. So thoroughly had my people been reduced, so completely had they been reduced to animals, that as his men broke their cages open, their only thoughts had been to kill. The last thought they had as thinking beings was of revenge so when they were made into animals, that's the only one that remained.\" He paused feeling his eyes roll. A hatred for slavers, a passport and, over time shared values had brought Dr. Ed closer to his human friends. Chief among them: an irrational hatred for injustice. “The only question he asked was if I planned on trying to kill him. I said no and then he gave me a gun. The rest... where I was from, what level of death world I was born on, where I had been captured, if I was a citizen of a relevant authority...because yes, I see your skepticism, some people would have left us on a burning station to die.” More students looked ready to bolt as they looked and properly took in his appearance, discomforted by his blinded eyes, his mangled limbs, his torn shoulders.\n\n“The natural world is brutal, ruthless and remorseless...\" Dr. Ed's voice rose for the first time, gaining passion and power as he spoke \".... for every good person there is a depraved savage set on making the galaxy colder and darker. For every group of herbivores there is a predator lurking in the shadows and every thing that has ever lived will die! Some brutally. As biologists you will have to observe this with dispassionate interest and absolute objectivity. As psychologists you'll often have to do more than observe and yet remain even more objective.” He raised his ruined arm to point at the doors. “Anyone disturbed by that can kindly fuck off and join another section.”\n\nA hundred or so left, maybe more, maybe less, probably more... Dr. Ed didn’t care: his priority, his concern, his obligation was those that remained, those that would at least try to see the world without blinders or tinted lenses. Some of those who left did so with communicators in hand, ready to call their parents and complain about the quality of the staff. Some left nauseated, unwilling or unable to handle the violent death that was so common in much of the galaxy. A facet of reality that they, as herbivores, had never had to consider as more than an abstract. Some simply realized that Dr. Ed wouldn’t suffer indolence or idiocy and his class might require effort to pass. And some, more than he would have liked, simply would not tolerate being lectured by a deathworlder slave.\n\n“Good.” He nodded “Now the rest of this lesson I will be doing one thing and one thing only: Impressing upon you the importance of our work and the importance of being thorough, truthful and, objective. Who here is familiar with the history of the Agazid?”\n\nShrugs, universal shrugs, which prompted Dr. Ed to mutter a curse and wish, as he often did in situations like these, that he had a human face. Their fleshy muscular faces were capable of showing so many degrees of emotion. “A clerical error saw them classified as a low or non-sapient B6. Does anyone know the implications of such a classification?” Again, there was silence “A low or non-sapient B6 designation means that it was perfectly legal for military units to train against them in live fire exercises.”\n\n“Sir.\" One of the humans spoke, he knew hot to be respectful at least \"This was in the reading. The biologists classified them, the military applied for a permit, it was granted, they did what soldiers do. All the correct protocols were followed. This just seems like a standard clerical error.” One of the humans, Phillippe from French Mars according to his name tag, stated looking for an answer to his unasked question.\n\n“Doesn’t it?” Dr. Ed sighed “Benevolent Bureaucracy or even benevolent Bureaucrats are rare on Earth and even rarer in the galaxy as a whole.” The professor chuckled at some joke no one else understood.\n\n“The Agazid were classified as inhabiting a B6 World. Meaning that it was one of the most vicious, predatory and, dangerous worlds in the galaxy, thus, when xenobiologists landed, they were more concerned with their own safety than doing their jobs properly. When they encountered what could have been intelligent life, they wrote it off as low-sapient, because what else could evolve in such a hellhole, and nobody bothered to follow up.\" Dr. Ed laughed a bitter laugh \"Never mind a follow up, nobody bothered to go over the initial survey reports until the atrocities came to light. When the initial survey report was released to the galaxy at large, the Kal-eth applied to use the world as a training ground for their military. An undesirable world, inhabited by undesirables in a relatively far flung region of the galaxy…” Dr. Ed trailed off to survey the class. The Kal-eth students were largely uncomfortable, those who knew what was coming were trying to repress their instinct to run and hide, a few remained defiant... until their death world professor showed his teeth. The Humans... they had read enough of their own history to know how this lecture was going to end and Philippe from French Mars felt like an idiot. Good. “Their application was quickly granted and their military set up a station in orbit to facilitate the planet side training. Kal-eth soldiers quickly encountered the Agazid and, if their logs are to be believed, enjoying using them as practice given their natural ferocity, cunning and, use of primitive tactics.”\n\n“Shouldn’t….”\n\n“Yes.” Dr. Ed cut the student off, his voice hard enough to cut Ruhr steel, causing the student to recoil “It should have tipped the Kal-eth off to their intelligence. It should have caused a re-evaluation but they didn’t feel obliged to concern themselves with a savage race. So what if they were intelligent? The survey had shown them to lack true sapience. The learned and trustworthy xenobiologists had classified them as such, their hands were clean. Besides, they were *just* soldiers who were *just* following orders.” Professor Ed stopped himself before his lecture turned into a rant “Not to mention that, even if anyone suspected that the Agazid were intelligent, most militaries will **not** forgo the opportunity to train against deathworlders if they can do so in *relative* safety. So, if the military wasn’t going to do spearhead a re-evaluation, it would have fallen on politicians to step in, but why would they? The world wasn’t inhabited by anyone useful or by the ‘right’ kind of species. To the political class, it wasn’t worth the possible blowback or political capital. Much better to apologize after the fact, pass the blame back to the military, and build a memorial than to risk one's career trying to stop something useful. The final hope for the Agazid lay with civil society. Now...It is important to acknowledge the realities of the universe before we continue.” He paused to watch his students and their reactions, nothing major, good.\n\n“Nine in ten sapient species evolve on Garden Worlds, Paradise Worlds, Gardens of Eden as the humans call them. This means that the perceived default sapient is a two to six-legged flightless herding herbivore that evolved to live either exclusively or primarily on land. These species evolved on worlds that were either largely or completely devoid of large predators and lacked parasitic life forms including most viruses or bacteria. Given these non-competitive comfortable environments, most species prefer to eschew actual physical violence in favour of displays of power and force *if* things escalate that far. From their perspective, wars where you actually use weapons are needlessly destructive and only used as a last resort or pre-emptively when success is guaranteed. This stands in stark contrast to the remaining ten percent of life in the galaxy, species that evolved on either primarily or exclusively carnivorous worlds. On those worlds, life lives not in competition so much as in a continuous state of conflict. Among higher order creatures this process is driven more by instinct and the pursuit of glory which in turn allows social advancement than the need to feed. Violence is exceptionally commonplace and shows of force are usually only precursors to the actual use of force Additionally, moderate to high category B planets are dominated by obligate carnivores as opposed to omnivores, thus they tend towards low populations of highly aggressive individuals who, most importantly, have the capacity to act on their tendencies. Now, who wants to tell me which adjectives are frequently used to describe my kind among civil society?”\n\nThe silence was deafening, the herbivores who dominated the room sat in nervous silence, perhaps aware of the fact that the few deathworlders present could kill many of them with little or no effort and they were loathe to provoke them in such tight quarters.\n\nDr. Ed laughed, at least they knew when to keep silent “Even the common name for my people’s category of world should tip you all off as to how we’re viewed by the larger galaxy “Lower Deathworlders” though most people drop the ‘Lower’ and ‘Lesser’ and simply call us Deathworlders. There are also \"Savage Death worlds\", even more vicious and horrible than Lesser Death worlds. Lesser or Lower were frequently used due to cast doubts on our intelligence. In modern society that has fallen from use as people generally assume that deathworlders are second tier at best, while savage deathworlders are more akin to beasts of burden than sapients. Other common adjectives are: stupid, aggressive, violent, destructive, untrustworthy, lazy, disease ridden and other delightful variations on the theme. Unfortunately, given that species higher up the food chain tend towards lower overall populations and the fact that Herbivorous species outnumber carnivorous ones almost ten to one to begin with, means that ‘Deathworlders’ have been unable to muster the political capital to change our reputations.”\n\n“Because they’re accurate.” A student couldn't help but mutter in what was, for him, a low voice but to the nine predators in the hall he might as well have shouted\n\n“Personal beliefs, dogmas, and opinion have neither place nor bearing on our work. If you can’t accept that... Leave. I lived on Earth for two decades, I've heard slurs more creative than anything you could ever come up with.” Dr. Ed gestured to the door for a second time and let the silence drag on for a moment before continuing “So when considering the muted response of Kal-Eth civil society during the Agazid affair, we also have to consider how they were viewed by said civil society. They were a technologically backwards, deathworlder species of questionable sapience, whose existence had barely warranted a few lines on a slow news day. As such, civil society, if it was even aware of the question of their sapience, was probably not going to act in their defense when there were so many other things with which to fill their time. On top of that, many would have been willing to tolerate combat training given how close their home world is to the hinge of empires This is compounded by the fact that one of them IS a deathworlder empire. By the time the killings ended over 80% of the Agazid had been exterminated. They lost much of their technological and social progress and have regressed from bronze and iron tribal confederations to primitive, isolated, Xenophobic clans. It will be centuries at the earliest before they join the galactic community if ever and frankly most of our field is leaning towards half a millennium. That! Is why our work is so important: If we do our jobs properly, thoroughly and, well we play a central role in expanding our understanding of life in our galaxy and ensuring that all species, no matter their origins, can find a place in the larger galactic whole. However. If done poorly we simply serve a source for bigots and racists to legitimize their views. If corrupted we become tools for whatever ends our paymasters have envisioned, if done maliciously we may become complicit in genocide and the destruction of whole species and cultures.\"\n\nHe surveyed his students who looked like the immature students they were. They heard his lecture, they heard his speech, they heard his words...but they didn’t understand. They couldn’t... but they would. In this hall they would grow into adults or they would cry to a councillor, Dr. Ed had said as much in his course outline. They hadn’t believed it then, but they would. Because... everyone knew… that seeing was crucial to believing. He would make them see.\n\n“All of you are wondering I’m sure, what I plan to say now. Now that my speech about responsibility, one you’ve heard a thousand times from your parents, is done” He smiled, he had too many teeth to make his smile anything more than a gruesome pantomime of the human variety.\n\nThe projectors that had sat dormant came to life, it was one thing for students to be told that their choices might lead to genocide, it was quite another to be confronted with that reality and the hall had been specially outfitted with the best projectors money could buy... and some projectors that money couldn't. It paid to have friends on Earth and Ruhr IV who would lend advanced tech to friends under the auspices of “field testing”.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBodies...the Agazid were a bipedal species that could drop to all fours, this allowed them to sprint at high speeds and granted them considerable acrobatic ability for their size. Their bodies were covered in hard plates giving them a modicum of natural armour while curved horns and thicker plates covered their head preventing them from wearing helmets. Instead they opted for decorated bronze masks and additional layers of bronze and iron armour over their bodies.\n\nIron and Bronze that had been punched through by guns. Lasers and Plasma had done their deadly duty and cut the Agazid down like so many stalks of grain...The Kal-Eth had carried out their training missions like professionals inflicting fatal injuries without prejudice or remorse.\n\n“As you can see, at this point the Kal-Eth were still acting like soldiers and not blood crazed lunatics. That changed shortly after the construction of the orbital station and the arrival of more experienced officers.”\n\nThe images and video clips that followed showed changes, not in the Agazid who still wore bronze and iron now with a few scraps of Kal-Eth armour. Their ability to scavenge Kal-Eth armor was a testament to their natural skills given that they had little else to rely on. The changes that the audio and video revealed were in the Kal-Eth and how they acted. Gone were the precise lethal wounds inflicted from a safe distance, in their place were deep gouges inflicted by blades, the crushing impacts of blunt force weapons and the gruesome burns of point-blank plasma. Where there was previously the efficient silence of a military force, broken only by commands, there was now the raucous noise of a frontier mercenary band. On top of that, sometimes, in some clips, they could hear how the Agazid were killed: slowly, painfully, and with obvious relish.\n\n“What prompted this change?” Dr. Ed asked\n\n“Undisciplined recruits?” Someone hazarded\n\n“A good guess but no. Additional and more experienced officers had arrived with the construction of the orbital station.” Dr. Ed repeated\n\n“I’d think hand to hand and close quarters is valuable, especially on ships” the other human ventured “but…” he shook his head, replaying the audio and video in his mind “This must’ve started out as proper training and these final sections are from later when...when something changed.”\n\n“Excellent, but what prompted the change?” The professor prodded\n\n“I’d have guessed a breakdown in discipline from shitty officers who couldn’t or, probably, wouldn’t keep their soldiers in line.”\n\n“You’re right in that it did start as routine combat training exactly for boarding maneuvers. But the escalation was due to two separate factors. The first pair were boredom and indifference. Threats to ground stations kept soldiers constantly on guard and on edge, they didn't have time or energy to screw around. Once they got eyes in the sky and an orbital station, it became possible for the soldiers on the ground to relax. They knew there was no real threat, the primitive tactics that were occasionally effective in an ambush were useless when the Kal-Eth could see them coming from, literally, miles away. Bored soldiers quickly become stupid and they promptly began competing with each other, which in this case took the form of increasingly stupid engagements with the Agazid. The second reason was for revenge. Deathworlders don’t have their reputation for nothing and many of the officers who were experienced had earned that experience in piracy suppression campaigns and border skirmishes. It follows then, and deployment records back this up, that many of the friends and soldiers they had lost were to deathworlder pirates and mercenaries. They couldn’t avenge or take blood from the pirates themselves but the Agazid were functional stand-ins and when they realized that there was little to no risk of a reprimand from higher powers...\" Dr. Ed shrugged, the still frame spoke for him \"This second phase lasted about seven years.”\n\n“Second phase? It gets worse?” A Capra, descended from mountain stock if appearances were anything to go by, asked. His fur clinging tightly to his body, distressed...He should be.\n\nDr. Ed looked at him with his dead eyes “Much. The standard contract for a Kal-Eth soldier is about seven standard years, give or take a few months. Some of them went home with fantastical stories...and even more fantastic trophies.”\n\nThis time, Dr. Ed didn’t rely on a hologram, he lifted a case onto the oversized lectern and lifted the cloth. “This Agazid skull was acquired by a Kal-Eth Sergeant during the fourth year of operations, here...” he moved another crate into position “.... we have tusks and horns which were occasionally kept whole but usually made into decorative weapons or gun stocks and finally…” he lifted a glass jar and placed it atop the skull case “.... this is an Agazid heart. Which, when properly broken down, can improve many outward signs of aging.”\n\n“Trophy hunting.” One of the humans, Mark of Terra, whispered\n\n“Exactly,” Dr. Ed nodded “The vanity of the upper classes never changes. Not across time and not across worlds. Some Agazid were killed for personal trophies as soldiers wanted to prove their bravery and strength. Some were killed for their various bits and pieces that were of use to the pharmaceutical industry or, more commonly, miracle cure peddlers. But those were the lucky ones...they generally died quickly given how dangerous a species they were and how much of a risk it was to leave them alive.”\n\n“The unlucky ones?” A Syrinx asked quietly\n\n“Records are hazy regarding exactly when this began but...\" Dr. Ed paused \" The unlucky ones were used for testing. Weapons testing mostly, but everything from poisons to exposure to who knows what else was carried out in secret.” Dr. Ed paused, shock, horror and, the most vehement kind of disbelief that only surfaces when someone's view of the universe if being directly challenged. “The military no longer had to worry about the public’s collective conscience now that they too had wholly embraced the status of the Agazid as being animals. This in turn meant that they no longer had to bother with the veneer of deniability. Kal-Eth leaders rationalized testing on the Agazid the same way amoral savages always have: ‘the greater good’. It was for the greater good that Agazid were used to test laser and plasma weaponry, it was for the greater good that the limits of deathworlder survivability were explored, it was for the greater good that drugs and poisons were tested on them, and it was for the greater good that they were killed in the hundreds of thousands.”\n\n“BULLSHIT!” A Kal-Eth student exploded to his feet chest heaving, trapped with nowhere to run.\n\nDr. Ed chuckled “There’s one in every class. Direct your attention to the front. This is standard audio and video.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“I can assure you. All our weapons have been extensively tested.” A Kal-Eth, presumably an officer, spoke, footsteps echoing off the cold metal\n\n“But not in combat?” A human asked, he spoke one of the more heavily accented dialects.\n\n“No.”\n\n“So that’s why you’re offering us such a deal.” The Human chuckled\n\n“Indeed. We need someone who’s willing to test our weapons against a... variety of targets.”\n\n“Varied targets, I guess that’s one way of putting it.”\n\nThe two men arrived at a set of heavy doors and, for a moment, the oppressive silence of the lecture hall reasserted itself.\n\n“What. The. Fuck.” The human breathed, and the students saw what he saw. The men stood at a walkway that crossed over a massive hall, divided roughly into four. Cages housing Agazid, a testing laboratory, a range, and a morgue where the dead were laid out and studied like so many pieces of meat.\n\n“As I said, the weapons have been tested extensively.”\n\n“On animals.” The Human asked, though it fell like a statement that brooked no argument.\n\n“Of course. Sapient testing is illegal, not to mention unethical.” The Officer affirmed, voice smooth and steady\n\n“Indeed”\n\nDr. Ed chuckled to himself, the predators had noticed it, the humans too: The veiled distrust and suspicion. Nobody knew what tipped the human off to the fact that the things in the cages weren’t just animals. It might have been nothing, it might have been the ethereal and inexplicable feeling that they get between their shoulder blades or it might have been an itch on his fighting hand that ran into his trigger finger. Joachim had refused to elaborate on how he knew that something was off and humans in general couldn’t explain their ‘gut feel’ in any useful way.\n\n“That” Dr. Ed spoke up as the men on screen began signing documents “Was Joachim von Ros, a pirate turned privateer. The treaty protecting the Agazid has his name for his role in putting an end to the atrocity, and because humans love putting their names on things. Now prepare yourselves, I’ve had months.”\n\nDr. Ed waved a hand and the lights changed, to more accurately reflect the atmosphere of Algoth, the Agazid home world, though few students would appreciate the attention to detail. The humidity rose with the temperature to well above standard. Then came the sounds but, where there should have been the vibrant cacophony of tropical life, there were only a few cries and the omnipresent buzzing of insects. Some students snickered while others sat in guarded silence unwilling to risk the chalk. The smart ones saw the Syrinx instinctively puff their feathers, the warning call they heard might not have been a Syrinx but among avian species, warning calls were universally understood. The smell followed, Dr. Ed had spent months working with humans to concoct the right fragrance. The smell of organic rot and decay as well as that of the fresh growth and blooming flora that permeates any jungle. Then they were hit by the stench of fear; urine, feces and, a touch of sweat and finally the cloying richness of dead flesh, already decomposing the in the sweltering heat mixing the ferric stench of blood. Most of the students were retching, some had already vomited, a few proud fools had neglected to take a sick bag, further contributing further to the horrific miasma that filled the hall. Then came the projection to match, a village untouched by flame, peaceful...until you saw the bodies.\n\nThe students might not have known what a dead Agazid child looked like before, but they did now. They might not have known what a person butchered for its trophies looked like before, but they did now. They might not have known what a tortured form looked like before, but they did now. They might have been children before...but they weren’t anymore.\n\nThe scene in front of them wasn’t a statistic, wasn’t an abstract from a textbook, this was the sight, the smell, the sound of murder... of genocide.\n\n“Son of a bitch.” The voice of Joachim von Ros from before cut through the retching that filled the hall and paralyzed even those students who had thought to flee.\n\n“What the fuck!”\n\n“JESUS!”\n\n“Shit!”\n\n“BASTARDS!”\n\n“What the sweet hell...”\n\n“God have mercy…”\n\nIt continued, frame after frame, as the human soldiers moved silently through the ravaged village only breaking the jungle sounds to swear at a particularly grisly scene. Parents shielding their children, elders too old to fight, beaten and left to bleed out, bodies crushed by armored vehicles...bodies...corpse after corpse, each new dwelling holding a few more mangled and desecrated corpses. Only when the last room was cleared, holding what must have been the very young. Only once the humans returned to the center of the village, where boot prints and the trails left by feet being dragged through the dirt ended where the vehicle tracks began did the projectors cut. It was a mercy to be torn from a forgotten village on Algoth and deposited back in Hall 47 where the only proof of what they had seen was the smell of vomit, but that too was processed by the ventilation systems until all they were left with were there maelstroms in their minds.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Those of you who need to, clean yourselves up. I will continue.” Many left on shaking legs, eyes dazed still trying to process what they had seen, only a single handful would return. Some stayed and to those Dr. Ed would dedicate his time without reserve because they would confront whatever came at them with open eyes, they had offered sufficient proof of that.\n\n“Three days after this footage was taken, Joachim von Ros and his crew stormed the training facility and slaughtered the soldiers on the planet. They then seized the orbital station and held the crew hostage. Four days later, and thirty minutes after the arrival of the human Titan Fleet around the the Kal-Eth homeworld and threats from every Deathworld species as well as Caralis High Command, the Kal-Eth to publicly admitted to what they had been doing and signed of the Von Ros treaty which led to the creation of protectorate class worlds. It was the fastest that large scale crisis was resolved, the threat of total annihilation tends to have that effect.” Dr.Ed chuckled “The Agazid still don’t communicate with outsiders save the human delegation that goes down once a quarter to deliver supplies and data packets and... their population will likely remain depressed for several centuries.”  Dr.Ed shook his head \"What you just saw was our work stretched to its most horrific extreme.\"\n\n“We classify, quantify and qualify all life in the galaxy. We study, analyze, process and once all is said and done, we are the ones that assign life its final designation. We are the final arbiters of the realities which all newly discovered life will face. We determine how long and hard their road to acceptance will be. We are the ones who can, through biased and research and deceptive findings, either build up stereotypes to confirm what everyone knows. We can lend legitimacy to acts of genocide and become willing pawns in campaigns of bigotry and prejudice that produce only pain and suffering on an unimaginable scale. Or we can stand for truth in whatever form it may take. Truth is not always be pretty, it may not always be what we want to see nor what we had hoped to find. But it will ensure, that when the people of tomorrow fix their gaze upon us, that we can look back unflinching. It is truth above all else that we must pursue, for it is truth, above all else, that will set our souls, if not our hearts, at ease.”\n\nDr. Ed sighed “Was it a clerical error? Was this…” The projectors came on, a still image “.... A clerical error?” He let his eyes wander across the hall, across the students who would likely never see things the same way. The humans were remarkably unaffected, it wasn't a surprise, they were crucible forged after all...and to them, this was nothing new. But the rest...many of them would skip the rest of the day. They would go home and cry, they would call their mothers and their siblings they would demand to know why... why we were so cruel, why we were so base, why there was still evil in a time of plenty. Even the deathworlders like him, wouldn’t be unaffected, they might drink more than the others and once deep in their cups they would reach out to their trainers and masters and... slowly...with halting words and broken sentences they would try to express the pain they had seen, pain not their own. They would ask question to which their all-knowing masters would only offer silence. The question, of a clerical error, hung in the air, where Dr. Ed decided to leave it.\n\nHe let his gaze wander over his class as they shuffled out, some still covered in sick. It had been, and he hoped they would agree with him in the future, for the best. The children of today must grow to be the beacons of tomorrow and he would weather whatever the administration threw at him at to ensure that they did. He had, after all, suffered much much worse in pursuit of far less.",

A lot of these sentences, even if they aren't technically run-ons, can benefit significantly from being broken up. Smaller sentences are fine, too. They help keep things interesting by varying the tempo and hammering points home. \n\nThis particular sentence is a run-on with two independent clauses (full sentences with a subject and verb). \n\n> Lecture Hall 47 had the luxury of being at the end of the building.\n\n> It was, by far, the largest lecture hall in the complex.\n\nThere's a \"meaning that\" joining the two sentences together. Generally speaking, when you do that, you need some form of punctuation separating the two sentences. While\n\n> It was, by far, the largest lecture hall in the complex.\n\nis a complete sentence, \n\n> meaning that it was, by far, the largest lecture hall in the complex\n\nis not. So, you should use a comma to separate the two.\n\n> Lecture Hall 47 had the luxury of being at the end of the building, meaning that it was, by far, the largest lecture hall in the complex. \n\nYou already have a long sentence in that, so the next little bit can be separated into its own sentence. Plus, the focus shifts from the lecture hall itself to what Prof. Ed thinks of it. That alone makes it worthy of being its own sentence. \n\n> Lecture Hall 47 had the luxury of being at the end of the building, meaning that it was, by far, the largest lecture hall in the complex. It was something that Professor Ed, in his mind, had earned.\n\nI also moved the \"had\" around. I just think it sounds better there lol\n\n---\n\n>>> It’s not that his people or any other was incapable of producing slate and chalk, but nobody else clung to such archaic traditions with quite as much vigour as humanity. \n\nWas should be were.

It's just sorta injected into an already complete sentence. There's two ways to do this: the dash or the parenthesis. They both read differently. Someone actually educated in this can probably tell you when to use one or the other, but I think you can use either here. (Important to note that the dash is different from the hyphen. It's longer and doesn't have a key on the keyboard. I use two hyphens as a shorthand.)\n\nAlso, this little interjection is too long. It makes the sentence confusing. Maybe \"and the survivors of years one and two deserved to be referred to as such\"? Or maybe even \"and the survivors deserved to be referred to as such\"? \n\n> Veterans of his class (and the survivors of years one and two deserved to be referred to as such) knew that it gave professor Ed projectiles with which to discipline the stupid or the unruly.\n\nOr\n\n> Veterans of his class -- and the survivors of years one and two deserved to be referred to as such -- knew that it gave professor Ed projectiles with which to discipline the stupid or the unruly.\n\n---\n\n>>>It also helped him single out those who were meticulous enough to copy what was written and not simply rely on recorded, digitized lectures and the holographic slides which was a bonus, but one the Professor could have lived without.\n\nSuper super long sentence.

Probably condense, because it's a single, cohesive idea. \n\n---\n\n>>> Professor Ed’s exterior mandibles twitched in excitement, it was the first semester of a new year and the first real day of classes were always the best. \n\nYou have three complete sentences here.

For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So? These are funny conjunctions because they can join complete sentences but also join other stuff, too. (Like I just did there!) If you use them to join sentences, you need to precede them with a comma.\n\n> Professor Ed’s exterior mandibles twitched in excitement; it was the first semester of a new year, and the first real day of classes were always the best.\n\n---\n> He didn’t believe in spending the first day going through the syllabus, this was the best university in the spiral arm if not the galaxy, the idiots could read it themselves. \n\nTriple comma splice! \n\n---\n\n>>> No, he’d be going straight for the throat, a maneuver he’d learned from his travels with the, now retired, Grand Admiral decades ago.\n\n\"Now retired\" should either be hyphenated or moved to after \"Grand Admiral\". If you put it before the noun, it becomes an adjective, and because it's two words instead of one, you hyphenate them. If you put it after the noun, it becomes an aside, and you can leave all the punctuation intact for that. \n\n> No, he’d be going straight for the throat, a maneuver he’d learned from his travels with the now-retired Grand Admiral decades ago.\n\nOr\n\n> No, he’d be going straight for the throat, a maneuver he’d learned from his travels with the Grand Admiral, now retired, decades ago.\n\n---\n\n>>> He breathed the air which still smelled faintly of cleaners and turned to face his beloved green blackboard carefully lining up his chalk.\n\nNeed a comma before \"carefully\".

It's an aside, so there should either be commas before and after it, or no commas at all (if it's important to the meaning of the sentence). \n\nI also personally disagree with the colon towards the end. A colon means that whatever comes afterward will further explain a point you just made. You could argue that \"It would be glorious\" explains why they were set into piles, but I think you'd hammer the point home better if it were its own sentence.\n\n---\n\nI can continue if you'd like, or explain further any of the things I said. Right now, I have to get to sleep so I'm not dying at work tomorrow, haha\n\nGrammar errors aside, I really enjoyed your writing.

The atmosphere, the passion and the imagery really brought the bitter reality of genocide to center stage. It reminds me of some of the old WWII footage I watched in history class years ago. It was unbelievable that something so evil and gruesome could take place at such a grand scale. Some students cried, others, (most, like myself) were at a loss. It didn't feel real in a way. Like something that happened really far away and very long ago. After the video ended, a older man walked into class. He was a holocaust survivor. He showed us pictures of where he slept, where he ate, and the last place he saw his mom and little sister. He had a picture of his dad too. Broken, frail, and with an expression I find hard to describe with words. I tried hard to stay impassive and just listen, as a boy surrounded by high-school friends and classmates. But at some point I had to wipe tears away. I like to think some part of me grew up that day and I thank my teacher for going that extra mile to bring history to life for us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry to ramble on about my own experiences.

    "body": "So here’s a little story time about me and something I went through: \n\nMy mom was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer back in 2018. During the pandemic, it made visitation very difficult, especially where children were concerned. \n\nBy the time she was moved into hospice care, I was 8 months pregnant with my daughter. She spent all of late 2020 to the end of her life yearning to see her grandchildren most of all. \n\n“If I could only see their shadows, that would be good enough for me.” \n\nI gave birth to my daughter in May 2021, two days after my birthday. My mom, at the end of her rope and drifting in and out of consciousness, was able to video chat and see her newest grandchild moments after I had delivered her. A text she meant to send my brother but didn’t have the strength to hit send read “I’m so happy.” \n\nI intended to video chat my mom as soon as I got out of the hospital, but she passed away the evening I returned home. Having a brand new baby while dealing with the loss of my parent was tricky. I was the only one who didn’t cry and I envy my older brothers being able to process it all right then and there. Mine is a delayed grief that comes in waves whenever I hear her favorite song, reflexively use one of her silly monikers for my pets or kids or even catch a faint ghostly scent of her lotion or perfume. \n\nGrief will always catch up to you, no matter how slowly it moves.

But one night, in the highlands of Vietnam, I was sleeping in the hut in my hermitage. I dreamed of my mother. I saw myself sitting with her, and we were having a wonderful talk. She looked young and beautiful, her hair flowing down. It was so pleasant to sit there and talk to her as if she had never died. When I woke up it was about two in the morning, and I felt very strongly that I had never lost my mother. The impression that my mother was still with me was very clear. I understood then that the idea of having lost my mother was just an idea. It was obvious in that moment that my mother is always alive in me.\n\n\nI opened the door and went outside. The entire hillside was bathed in moonlight. It was a hill covered with tea plants, and my hut was set behind the temple halfway up. Walking slowly in the moonlight through the rows of tea plants, I noticed my mother was still with me. She was the moonlight caressing me as she had done so often, very tender, very sweet... wonderful! Each time my feet touched the earth I knew my mother was there with me. I knew this body was not mine but a living continuation of my mother and my father and my grandparents and great-grandparents. Of all my ancestors. Those feet that I saw as \"my\" feet were actually \"our\" feet. Together my mother and I were leaving footprints in the damp soil.\n\n\nFrom that moment on, the idea that I had lost my mother no longer existed. All I had to do was look at the palm of my hand, feel the breeze on my face or the earth under my feet to remember that my mother is always with me, available at any time.\"\n\n\n-Thich Nhat Hanh \"No Death, No Fear\"",

    "body": "Little bit about me/my skin: Im 25F and I have sensitive, acne prone, combination skin. My skin is especially sensitive to fragrance, citrus and floral essential oils. Because of this I’ve become a bit of a skincare nerd and an obsessive ingredients list reader. I definitely still have a lot to learn about skincare but I hope this list helps some of you! Especially my fellow sensitive skin skincare addicts.          \n        \nI tried to keep the reviews very short and straight forward, but if you want me to expand on any products let me know!           \n           \n1.        **La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer 30 SPF - 3/10**                    \n*Pros:* Fragrance free and very moisturizing.        \n*Cons:* Broke me out and burned my eyes\nBest for: dry skin.      \n       \n2.        **Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser - 0/10**       \n*Pros:* literally nothing.        \n*Cons:* I don’t like the smell, it broke me out, didn’t remove my makeup well.         \n \n3.        **Drunk Elephant Beste No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 6/10**\n*Pros:* Clean ingredients list.          \n*Cons:* Stripping/drying and expensive.         \n*For who?* Oily skin or those that like to feel squeaky clean.     \n       \n4.        **La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen 60 SPF (American) - 3/10**            \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast.    \n*Cons:* Greasy, broke me out, stung my eyes.    \n*Bottom Line:* Stick to the European version.     \n       \n5.         **La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen 50+ SPF (European) - 9/10**          \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast, reasonably priced.    \n*Cons:* texture is a little too runny for my liking.    \n*Bonus:* LRP donates to skin cancer research.    \n       \n6.         **Jordan Samuel Hydrate Facial Serum - 0/10**       \n*Pros:* Couldn’t try long enough to say.    \n*Cons:* Gave me a bright red burning skin reaction.     \n*Bottom Line:* Looks like they changed their formula (for good reason obvi) so I can’t speak for the new version.     \n*For who?* Those who want an excuse to cancel dinner plans.    \n       \n7.         **Mario Badescu Rose Facial Spray - 0/10**    \n*Pros:* Cheap.   \n*Cons:* Mist comes out too strong, I don’t like the smell, contains fragrance, citronellol, geraniol and colorants.   \n*Bottom Line:* Thank goodness it was a gift, because I won’t be buying.   \n     \n8.        **The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 5/10**    \n*Pros:* Unscented, affordable.    \n*Cons:* Made my skin itch and left a residue.    \n*Bottom Line:* I won’t repurchase.   \n     \n9.         **A313 Vitamin A Pommade - 10/10**   \n*Pros:* My acne reduced, skin texture improved (after two weeks). Thick vasaline texture that locks in the vitamin A.      \n*Cons:* Slight metallic smell     \n*Bottom Line:* Worth the hype! I use 2x a week max, alternating with a salicylic acid oil.    \n    \n10.   **Youth to the People Superberry Dream Cleansing Balm - 3/10**    \n*Pros:* Great ingredient list, interesting extracts.     \n*Cons:* Smells like waxy crayons, crumbly texture that doesn’t melt well into the skin, left a waxy feeling behind.     \n*Bottom Line:* I’ve tried better.    \n       \n11.   **Tata Harper Water-Lock Moisturizer - 2/10**  \n*Pros:* I liked her organic Vermont farm story and the light gel cream texture.   \n*Cons:* strong fragrance, contains skin irritants like Alcohol, limonene, citral, citronellol, linalool and orange peel extract.   \n*Bottom Line:* Don’t use if you have sensitive skin. There is a sunburn warning on the side of the box because it contains AHAs.    \n \n12.    **Saturday Skin Carrot + Niacinamide Moisturizing Cream - 6/10**  \n*Pros:* Hydrating thick gel cream.    \n*Cons:* Smells so strong of silicone.   \n*Bottom Line:* Bought it in Europe, loved it. Bought it in the US, smelled like straight up silicone. Different formula maybe?     \n     \n13.   **Glossier Future Dew - 0/10**  \n*Pros:* Cute packaging.   \n*Cons:* Made me look like a greasy pizza, broke me out and don’t like the smell.   \n   \n14.   **Versed Sunday Morning Antioxidant Oil-Serum – 1/10**  \n*Pros:* inexpensive.   \n*Cons*: Does nothing. The biphase ends up looking gross and muddled after a while.    \n   \n15.   **Murmure Bisou Clarifying Dry Oil – 10/10**  \n*Pros:* Cleared my blackheads, sinks into the skin fast.    \n*Cons:* Contains hazelnut oil so be careful if you have an allergy!     \n*Bottom Line*: I use it about 2x a week at night (not on the same day as my retinol). My skin is always less red and bumpy in the AM.    \n    \n16.    **Typology Glycolic Acid 10% - 3/10**   \n*Pros:* Affordable (Typology is like the French version of the Ordinary).    \n*Cons*: Broke me out, 10% glycolic acid is too strong for my skin.    \n     \n17.   **Nuxe Huile Prodigieuse Multi-Purpose Dry Oil – 9/10**  \n*Pros:* Nice dry oil that soaks in quickly, love the smell (I only use this on my body so the fragrance doesn’t bother me).   \n*Cons:* Wish it had a dropper or pump to make application less messy.   \n*Bottom Line:* I put this all over my body after my shower and my skin feels baby soft.   \n     \n18.   **Innisfree Daily UV Defense Sunscreen 36 SPF – 5/10**  \n*Pros:* Good value for money.   \n*Cons:* Broke me out, a little too oily.   \n*Bottom Line:* They have changed the formula since I tried it so I cant speak for the new formulation.     \n     \n19.   **La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5+ - 7/10**   \n*Pros:* Super soothing and healing.   \n*Cons:* clogged my pores (avoid if you have acne or milia prone skin).   \n*Bottom Line:* I would buy again for my eyelid dermatitis that I get every winter\nFor who? Dry, irritated skin.         \n20.   **SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic Serum - 8/10**    \n*Pros:* Brightened and evened my skin tone.   \n*Cons:* So expensive it hurts! Oxidized at around the 4 month mark. Smells slightly unpleasant.   \n*Bottom Line:* One of the most effective formulas for vitamin c that Ive tried. Keep it away from light and to close the bottle tightly so it doesn’t oxidize as quickly.    \n      \n21.   **Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Ultra-fine Mist – 1/10**  \n*Pros:* Cute packaging.   \n*Cons:* Broke me out, overpowering candy fragrance, didn’t hydrate.    \n     \n22.   **Pillow Talk Derm Major Fade Flash Mask – 0/10**  \n*Pros:* I can’t speak to the effectiveness of the product because my skin couldn’t handle it.    \n*Cons:* Instantly burned my face into a red mess.    \n*Bottom Line:* 15% glycolic acid was too much for my skin. Make sure to always patch test new products.    \n      \n23.   **The Outset Nourishing Squalane Daily Moisturizer – 7/10**  \n*Pros:* Clean ingredients list, nice light texture.    \n*Cons:* Not hydrating enough for my skin.    \n*Bottom Line:* If you have sensitive skin and like a lightweight moisturizer it might be worth a try.    \n    \n24.   **Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy – 10/10**   \n*Pros:* Heals, hydrates/seals in moisture.   \n*Cons:* Packaging is kinda ugly.   \n*Bottom Line:* Cult classic for good reason. I’m team Aquaphor over vasaline every day.   \n      \n25.   **Skinfix Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream – 10/10**   \n*Pros:* Super hydrating and nourishing. Nice cream gel texture.   \n*Cons:* none.   \n*Bottom Line:* My sensitive skin loves this moisturizer. Even though I have acne prone skin I still prefer their normal triple lipid over their gel version.       \n26.   **Saturday Skin Yuzu Vitamin C Sleep Mask – 4/10**  \n*Pros:* slightly brightening.   \n*Cons:* Strong smell, contains citrus oils, feels quite sticky.   \n     \n27.    **Youth to the People Superfood Air-Whip Moisture Cream – 3/10**   \n*Pros:* nice light airy texture.   \n*Cons:* Has fragrance and limonene. Didn’t do much.   \n*Bottom Line:* Last time I was at sephora I did notice that the cream is no longer a light green color, so I think they changed the formula.   \n    \n28.    **Caudalie Beauty Elixir Face Mist – 0/10**  \n*Pros:* None.   \n*Cons:* Doesn’t smell great, does nothing, has alcohol, fragrance, rosemary oil, citral, linalool, citronellol…).   \n*Bottom Line:* Outdated product imo.  \n    \n29.    **Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen 40 SPF – 5/10**  \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast.   \n*Cons:* Expensive and broke me out.    Feels very silicone heavy. like my skin was suffocating.    \n*Bottom Line:* Sensitive acne prone skin beware.   \n     \n30.    **U beauty The Plasma Lip Compound (Rose) – 0/10**   \n*Pros:* Couldn’t keep it on my lips long enough.   \n*Cons:* Smells so bad like straight up chemicals.   \n*Bottom Line:* So disappointing because it was really expensive.   \n    \n31.    **Youth to the People Polypeptide-121 Future Cream – 7/10**   \n*Pros:* Hydrating and plumping.   \n*Cons:* Started to smell a little funny when I got halfway through the jar.   \n    \n32.   **Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm – 8/10**   \n*Pros:* Nice creamy texture that melts into the skin. Smells delicious and removes makeup well.   \n*Cons:* Leaves a greasy film on my eyes\nBottom Line: One of the few glow recipe products that I actually like.    \n   \n33.   **Fresh Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream (Night) – 1/10**   \n*Pros:* lovely texture.   \n*Cons:* Smells way too strong, like straight up perfume. Has citral, limonene, lemon peel oil and fragrance.   \n*Bottom Line:* Sensitive skin beware.   \n     \n34.   **Typology Niacinamide 12% - 5/10**   \n*Pros:* Inexpensive.   \n*Cons:* 12% niacinamide is too strong for my skin.   \n*Bottom Line:* studies show that your skin reacts best at a 4% concentration. I like to add a little into my moisturizer every so often to dilute it.   \n     \n35.    **Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask – 3/10**  \n*Pros:* Smells delicious (but has fragrance).       \n*Cons:* Made my lips more dry. I don’t like having to scoop into a jar.        \n*Bottom Line:* I don’t understand the hype of this product.    \n      \n36.   **Clarins Lip Comfort Oil - 9/10**  \n*Pros:* Not sticky, lasts a while and very shiny.   \n*Cons:* Wish there was more color payoff and kinda pricey (not doir expensive but getting there).    \n*Bottom Line:* My fav lip product to date.",

I read through so many comments, and honestly, you guys gave me a mix of validation, reality checks, and some serious laughs. Some people suggested I march into work drenched in the most obnoxious perfume I could find. Others told me to embrace the chaos and start “accidentally” standing way too close to the coworkers who complained.\n\nBut the real question was—what did I actually do?\n\nWell… I decided to stay. For one day. Just to test the waters.\n\nThat morning, I was extra careful. Showered twice, put on fresh clothes, even used a different deodorant (because some of you had me questioning my entire existence). Walked into the office, heart pounding, waiting to see if anyone reacted weirdly.\n\nAnd guess what? Nothing. No one recoiled in horror. No whispered comments. Absolutely nothing.\n\nBut here’s where it gets interesting.\n\nAt lunch, I sat alone as usual—until one of my coworkers (one of the nice ones) came over and said, “Hey, I saw your face when those two were talking the other day. That wasn’t cool.”\n\nI almost choked on my food. I hadn’t even told anyone I overheard them. But she kept going.\n\nApparently, those two coworkers? They’re known for being judgmental and gossiping about everyone. And get this—one of them had actually been called out before for making rude comments about someone else’s body odor. That’s when it hit me: this wasn’t really about me. They were just the office bullies.\n\nAnd then, plot twist. One of them came to my desk later that day.\n\nI braced myself for awkwardness, but she actually looked kind of… nervous? She fidgeted and then mumbled, “Hey, uh… sorry if I said anything weird the other day. I was just joking.”\n\nNow, I could’ve called her out, but honestly? I just wanted to move on. So I shrugged and said, “Cool.” And that was it.\n\nBut here’s the best part. I decided not to quit—but I did switch things up. Instead of changing myself to fit in, I started dressing even weirder on purpose. More thrifted outfits, more funky patterns. One day, I even wore this outrageous vintage blazer with giant shoulder pads just to see their faces. And you know what? They didn’t say a word.\n\nSo yeah, I stayed at my job. But I made it clear—I’m not changing for anyone.",

    "body": "I just got married to the love of my life. I've usually gotten on pretty well with my new in-laws. Usually, my mother-in-law doesn't wear perfume or at least not any that I've been able to notice. My wife had her mother be her matron of honor so she was standing with us upfront. It was a small area and with her right next to my wife, I was able to smell her perfume. Shortly after the ceremony started I started to get watery eyes and sniffles. Our ceremony was supposed to only last 20 minutes max so I thought I would just push through unless it got worse.\n\nIt didn't get worse until after the ceremony when new mother-in-law hugged me. Itchy eyes, itchy throat, and headache got added to the mix. My wife asked if I was alright and I told her I think her mother's perfume was getting to me. We had someone go get some allergy medication. I took one but it didn't do a whole lot and I started to feel out of it.\n\nGet to the reception and we started to do our photos, and I couldn't do group photos with my mother-in-law in them. I told my wife we needed to figure something out because my symptoms weren't letting up and I didn't want to be out of it from taking more meds for our reception or have to leave our own reception. My wife asked her mom to keep some distance between us to try and make it easier for me. It didn't really. That perfume followed her like a damn cloud. Then my wife asked her mom to try and wash wherever she dabbed her perfume but mother-in-law said she hadn't dabbed it on, she spritzed herself so it was on her dress too. At that point they said they were out of ideas and there wasn't anything we could do.\n\nI said there was one more thing and suggested that maybe mother-in-law leave to change her dress and then come back or even just go to a nearby thrift store or something and get any kind of clothes, I'd even pay for them. I asked my mother-in-law to either please to do that or to leave and we'd visit later with cake because it was getting to the point that I would have to leave. My wife and mother-in-law objected to this because my wife wanted her mom there the whole time. I understand the day was big for my wife and she wanted her mother there and I wanted her there too but I wasn't able to enjoy my own wedding. I wound up sitting outside with some of my family and groomsmen. I started to feel better and when I did, my wife came out and asked if I'd be going back inside then. I told her no so long as her mom was still there and hadn't changed.\n\nThe night ended with my wife spending our wedding night at her parents' house. AITA for asking my mother-in-law to leave?\n\nETA: Yes my wife is aware of this, I had a similar reaction to a perfume she bought before. This was only the third time I've had a reaction that bad to perfumes.",

Either way it makes me jealous because I can never get to that level of having my body leave a \"scent\"! I always thought you only need one or two sprits on your wrist/neck or clothing because the amount of alcohol in perfume would ruin the point if you overdo it.\n\nEdit: This got much more attention than I was expecting!

With a high concentration scent it will last much longer. A good eau de toilette will be noticeable for between 4-6 hours, sometimes longer. Application to the wrist or neck is not as important to somewhere like your chest, where heat will promote the perfume to deepen and sink into your clothes. These factors allow for longevity of your nice smell, and for it to lightly permeate all of your clothes. \n\nRemember, a scent is meant to be discovered and not announced. If someone smells good, but you can smell them from down the hall, they are doing it wrong!\n\nedit: \nAs pointed out by other users, there are different scents that are going to be much stronger than others, ranging from eau de toilette on the low end of concentration to true perfume, on the high end. The level of price is also associated with concentration. Just please use your amount of fragrance according to concentration so I'm not blinded by your smell. Cheers!",

This step you'll want to do right out of the shower while skin is still damp so it gets into your pores (this is what keeps the scent on you all day)\n\n\\-Then I use the Amazing Grace body lotion  (it is expensive but the most moisturizing lotion I've ever used it is worth every penny!)\n\n\\-Then once I have my clothes on I lightly spray the body mist in a halo over my head and let it bless me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, a big part of smelling nice all day aside from practicing good hygiene is to know what scents go well with your body chemistry.

It is all trial and error. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, go to Sephora and test out a complete line of a perfume collection. I believe you get up to 4 samples.

The scent sticks to your hairs so if you have arm hair it stays on longer and also I don’t sweat much on my neck so the scent doesn’t wash off.

        "body": "There are a few options here:\n\n1. These people may be buying higher quality scents. Scents come in varying  strengths. Eau de cologne, eau de toilette, eau de parfum, and parfum are terms that describe the level of essential scent in the solution, from 2-5% all the way up to 30%. Here, I have listed them in ascending  order. This is why the same scent may sometimes be available at drastically different price points.\n2.  It may just be the case that you no longer notice the scent. With constant exposure, your body gets used to smells, and you'll eventually stop noticing them. I wear a scent every day, and I get complimented on it long after I no longer notice it. \n3. The scent you're wearing may be changing throughout the day, leading you to think that it has faded. While our individual chemical makeup affects scent compounds on our skin differently, high quality scents will change as time goes on. Scents are traditionally composed of \"chords\" made from three sets of notes, with each note representing a different scent. These chords are comprised of top notes, heart notes, and base notes. Lighter top notes, such as bergamot, may only be detectable for a few minutes, while heart notes linger for a few hours, and base notes, such as musk, may linger for days. \n\nLeading to t-shirts stolen from boyfriends everywhere, every *body* has a scent. If you want to be sure that it's a pleasant one: \n\n1. Stay clean, and use one high quality scent each day. The more you use it, the more those base notes will become a part of you as days and weeks go by. \n2. Ignore advice to layer scents. You've spent good money on that eau de parfum. If you've bought quality, you'll not need anything else. Don't mess it up by using strongly scented shampoos, deodorants, or hair products. No products in my bathroom, besides my scent of choice, have a stong or lingering scent. When I've just spent $80 on that shiny bottle in my medicine cabinet, I'm not going to make it compete with a $5 bottle of lemongrass shampoo. \n3. A scent should be worn like a jacket, not a costume. When you pile on multiple scented products in the shower, or when you wear too much of one scent each day, you don't smell like you; you smell like product. The scent you wear should enhance and compliment the natural scent of your body. It should be intimate, something that only people close to you can detect. You don't want to be able to be smelled downwind, no matter how pleasant the scent may be. \n\nScent is the sense that is most tied to memory in humans. Designer scents continue to be sold for decades, and the unique combination of a judiciously applied scent with the natural, clean, scent of *you* will cement you in the memory of people who meet you, and will bring back memories in old friends, colleagues and lovers. That's an effect you'll not get when you just smell of *products:* shower gel, fabric softener, and strongly scented deodorants. It's a wonderful tool to be used with care and tact; tact is key.",

        "body": "I was one of those people who used to get compliments that I still smelled good 12+ hours through my day. I’ll tell you what I did:\n\n1. Just use general hygiene. This sounds so basic, but if your body, or your clothing has lingering sweat, oils, or dirt attached to it, it can start producing bacteria. That bacteria is what makes you smell bad, so just to get first things first out of the way...\n\n2. I saw someone suggest this earlier, and I agree. Buy the eau de parfum versions of whatever scent you are wearing. You will use half the amount of spritzes for double the staying power.\n\n3. I got this one from my brother, who ALWAYS smells good. Like seriously, he makes it his job. SPRAY YOUR PERFUME/COLOGNE DIRECTLY ONTO CLOTHES AND HAIR. The fibers of your clothing and hair will capture and “trap” the scent for longer than your skin will. Also, over time, your skin’s heat will change and alter the scent of your fragrance, where your clothing and hair will not.\n\nThese are the three big ones.\n\nThe bonus round, if you feel like putting in some extra effort:\n\n1. Carry around floss and a toothbrush. Not only will this make your breath and oral hygiene so much better, you will feel like a boss after freshening up mid-day after everyone else’s breath smells like tuna.\n\n2. Use powder on your feet and private areas. This will absorb moisture and keep bacteria from growing. Again bacteria = enemy #1\n\n3. Keep your deodorant and fragrance with you to freshen up on extra long days. But before your reapply deodorant, clean up the area with a baby wipe, this will remove the old sweat and oils, so that you can reapply to a clean area instead of adding on top of the funk.\n\nGood luck!",

I also worked with people who just smelt like they rolled out of bed, non offensive odours but just like ‘stale’ body odour.\nI happened to be walking around the shopping centre and saw a product that is basically a clothes spray which you spray on your clothes whilst they are hanging up on the wardrobe and thought about how my grandparents would smell like mothballs sometimes when they wore their good clothes. So thinking I would like to have nice smelling clothes I bought it (it’s  pomegranate and spice) and sprayed it on my clothes. A couple of days later I wore some clothes that had been sprayed and noticing the fresh luscious smell thought that it would wear off during the day...Lo and behold, I got compliments left right and centre all day from the clothes spray. So I now spray it on before I leave for work and continue to  smell nice and get compliments.\nMay not be what you were asking but just sharing my experience.",

If you get a nice perfumed lotion you can put it on every few hours for a nice smell that'll last maybe an hour. Also scented hand soaps are great for at home.",

        "body": "Dude... ask!!\n\nI LOVE it when people ask what I wear! \n\nIt (*usually*) means “you smell good & I wanna smell that good!”\n\nI ask people all the time. Something like\n\n>*Oh my gosh, your perfume smells amazing! What is it?*\n\n...or, if this would make you more comfortable...\n\n>*Sooo, not to be totally random or to pry, but... you smell great & I totally want your perfume! What are you wearing?*\n\nAs I’ve gotten older (30’s), women just usually ask straight up “what are you wearing?* or “I like your perfume, what is it?”\n\nAnd, **LPT: spray your pressure points!** It might seem like a lot, but it’s not. Maybe wait a bit before leaving the house if that worries you. \n\n\n\n**Perfume (Pressure) Points:** (veins & arteries are closer to the skin so smell caries better)\n\n   >• **Neck (under jaw line)** ...I spray all around my neck & a bit in my checst, about 4 sprays\n\n  >• **Wrists**\n\n  >• **Behind ear lobe** (spray extra on your wrists & wipe behind each ear)\n\n  >• **Inner Elbow** (a little bit on the crook of your arm & also the inner side of the elbow on your upper arm; kinda where you’d hit your funny bone, but up & in. Not *on* your elbow... inside upper arm by elbow\n\n  >• **Extra:** My roommate always sprays a bit on the **back of her neck** right at the hairline/ base of the skull. People will get a whiff when you put your hair up. I started doing this with good results. \n\nJust spray at the END of getting ready (the lingering smell on your clothes makes it last longer). And remember, just because *you* can’t smell your perfume after a while doesn’t mean others can’t. It’s why Febreze (I think) coined the term “Nose Blind” or sadly, how people can’t smell their own B.O. - after a while, you acclimate. I’ll think my perfume has warn off but then at the end of the day while changing, I’ll get a whiff. \n\n\n**Surefire Winners:**\n\n **1. Viktor & Rolf’s “Flower Bomb”** - I’ve been wearing this since it was 1st released at Sak’s Fifth Ave during Black Friday of 2004. It’s my tried & true & always get compliments. Many women love it, but it’s not for everyone. Some of my friends (roommate, especially) have said that while they love the smell on me, they don’t like how it mixes with their own pheromones/body chemistry.\n\n **2. Chanel’s “Mademoiselle”** - universally flattering. Only started changing up my everyday Flower Bomb when I discovered this in 2015. It is so beautiful & feminine without being sickly, sweet.\n\n **3. Jo Malone** - I have a friend that was warm this line since 2004 (another loyalist like my faithfulness with Flower Bomb). What is nice about this line is that you can mix & match to “layer” perfumes. You can stick with just one scent or layer with others to create a new scent or one that is uniquely “yours.” I don’t personally wear Jo Malone, but I love her stuff. It’s a bit intimidating at first, so I’d go to a store that carries her line (a larger Sephora that will have a whole display of hers) or Nordstrom etc. & ask how the line works w/layering etc.\n\nHonestly, when all else fails, & you’ve got a big day, date night, or want to freshen up, you can always go with a small **roller ball** of perfume to stick in your purse. These were niche about 5 years ago, but now have a big section all to themselves in Sephora. Since most women don’t want to overspray their perfume &/or don’t know about pressure points, I’d guess that the women who smell like new perfume all day have a roller ball bottle somewhere in their bag. \n\nI, personally, am not a fan of roller balls as I feel like they don’t deposit enough product & in turn, don’t last as long. I just go for **travel-sized** bottles of perfume if & when I know I’m going to freshen up my perfume later in the day. \n\nLastly, it may just be down to **pheromones & body chemistry** - What is amazing & long-lasting on one woman, may be lackluster on another. Once you find the perfume for you, you’ll know it! Starting out with roller balls & travel-sized bottles is a good way to test our perfumes before committing to something expensive. Good way to avoid the hassle of loving something but having it wear off too soon or realizing it’s not something you want to wear often and then being stuck with it. \n\nGood luck on your path to smelling amazing! \n\nLook up the pressure points if you need clarification. It’s a bit of a lost art - my grandmother (who was born in 1918) would always spray her inner elbow, crook of the arm, and behind her ear. Have only seen 2 other women who do this besides me, and none of them spray all the points I listed above. Yes, I smell *strong* at first, but I’ve never had any complaints. And anyway, after 15-20 minutes, the strength of the smell diminishes considerably (& no, not from Nose Blindness. Thanks, Febreze!) \n\n**Edit:** u/DOBIS_PR_24 And don’t go cheap - good, quality, long-lasting perfume is usually **expensive.** I figure, if you’re in it every day, do the math & calculate how much it costs per day. Probably worth it.",

    "body": "My (36F) daughter’s (13F) birthday was last weekend. There’s this trampoline park in town that offers sleepover parties where the kids could play for a few hours, watch a movie, and have a sleepover on the trampolines. Her school is very small, so there are only 20 students in her entire year. When we were booking the event, she said to only book 19 places. I asked her if she was sure she wasn’t missing out someone, but she assured me there were only 19 kids in her class, and I was just misremembering.\n\nFast forward to her birthday, and this girl “Kamilla” shows up with an entire box full of gifts: teddy bears, perfume, candles, nail polish, flowers, chocolates, etc. I remembered picking up my from school at the beginning of the school year and seeing her chatting and being very friendly with Kamilla, so I assumed they were quite good friends. When Kamilla went up to hug my daughter and wish her a happy birthday, she lightly pushed her away and told Kamilla she couldn’t attend as we forgot to book her place. I apologised to Kamilla and her mother and offered to talk to the people in charge and pay for her place, but my daughter insisted that Kamilla couldn’t come. Kamilla was very distraught over this and started sobbing.\n\nI pulled my daughter aside and asked her why Kamilla couldn’t join, even though they used to be friendly and she’d invited every other student in her year. She said that Kamilla was just really weird, obsessive, and creepy, and she didn’t want to be friends with her anymore. I asked her if Kamilla was bullying her, and she said no, she just didn’t want to be around Kamilla. Kamilla’s mother had found out about the party through another parent and Kamilla decided to surprise my daughter knowing she hadn’t been given an invite.\n\nI returned the gifts to Kamilla, apologised again, and gently told her that there weren’t enough spaces. Her mother started screaming at me, telling me that I was a grown adult woman bullying a preteen girl. I told her that it was my daughter’s birthday party, she could invite whoever she wanted. She accused me of raising my daughter to be a bully, and that she couldn’t just invite the entire class and exclude one girl. She claimed that Kamilla was my daughter’s “best friend” and she had to right to be invited.\n\nI told her that my daughter’s a teenager, not a 5 year old, she can’t be forced to invite the entire class just to be nice. I said that I didn’t want to raise a doormat. I didn’t want to teach her to value the feelings of others at the expense of her own - if my daughter feels uncomfortable around someone, then I prioritise HER wellbeing over that of a stranger’s.\n\nKamilla’s mother is now talking to the teachers to punish my daughter for “bullying”. I’ve tried explaining to her that my daughter was simply setting her boundaries, she shouldn’t have to face consequences for that. Kamilla’s mother said that I was an “evil b\\*tch” who “took joy in bullying little girls”. AITA?",

From your story it seems like she's the bully here.\n\nYou didn't seem to handle the situation very well. While I agree that IF Kamilla was making your daughter uncomfortable in some real way, then she shouldn't be forced to have her around. But you daughter just called her 'weird' and you accepted that as enough to exclude this poor humiliated girl. This was a parenting moment and you dropped the ball. \n\nKamilla's mom also did not handle the situation well. Obviously the name calling and focusing on getting you and your daughter in trouble at school is only going to escalate the situation.\n\nKamilla I said maybe because there's probably more going on than what's in your post, and there may very well be valid reasons your daughter is uncomfortable around her. But unless you step up to find out what's going on between these two, we should assume she's not an AH here.",

I genuinely thought these people were my friends, and never caught on that they weren’t. I was the one who would see all of these people I thought I was friends with being invited to things in front of me, and I’d never be asked to join. It hurt like hell.

Even when I begged her to leave me alone. She tried to say I was bullying her, and did a ton of stuff that made me extremely uncomfortable. Begged the school to make us locker mates, begged teachers until they sat us next to each other, wrote notes and put them in my bag, and generally would not leave me alone. Everyone encouraged me to just go along with it, because she didn’t have a lot of friends and obviously liked me. I didn’t entertain it, and it got to the point where I yelled at her in the cafeteria (I was 14, not that it’s an excuse for yelling). If she showed up at my birthday party and my mom forced me to have her there, I would’ve felt extremely betrayed. \n\nYour daughter has the right to not want to be around people. She should not be forced to put up with people who make her uncomfortable, and teaching girls especially to embrace people who can’t respect boundaries and who make them uncomfortable is really detrimental to them as adults. And, yes, going to a party you’re not invited to is 100% not respecting boundaries. She’s 13, she can choose who does and doesn’t come to her birthday. \n\nBut, I’d tell her that you support her in choosing who she wants to be around, but that she shouldn’t lie to you about it.

We agreed we would not do IVF, but somehow it felt like the next step. The easy solution. We’re both under 30, generally active & healthy. We never thought we would be in the 2% of cases where IVF doesn’t work.\n\nThere is something to having so much time to think about having children. It’s strange how other people can decide they want to bring life into the world & simply do it. We have watched our friends, our family have very difficult times with their children & love their children with everything in them. They ask us if we want to take them home and in the same breath tell us it’s the best thing that’s ever happened to them.\n\nI have always imagined my life full of children, but when I couldn’t conceive naturally, I hoped for one. While I watched people spank, yell at and harshly discipline their children. People who I never would think could do those things-would I turn into that? A lot of these people are shells of themselves. I have found myself wondering if that’s what I even want for me.\n\nThousands of pills, appointments, bloodwork, hundreds of shots, 2 surgeries, several transfers, dozens of ultrasounds, anticipation, tears, disappointment, thousands of $, healthy embryos, acupuncture, periods…it has never worked. And for what? To force life into this world?\n\nI have this deep instinct it’s not going to happen. I will never be pregnant. How could I continue to try & be able to feel this at the same time? That’s like torturing myself. I have no emotions about it anymore. I’m sure I’ll be sad some days, but right now this decision feels freeing.\n\nAnd I feel guilty. We have frozen embryos. What are we going to do with them…People know. People are praying, people are invested. But I am done. Not in an angry way-I’m done with the game. We are done with the game. Game of the doctors, game of pretending like this is exciting.\n\nI don’t want to try so hard for a child that ultimately might not want to be born, for the sake of ourselves. We might not be able to give them a sibling, which I believe is the greatest gift you can give any human. It feels selfish, it feels wrong.\n\nIt’s ruining me, it’s ruining us.\n\nWhat will be, will be.\n\n***Some of OOP's Comments:*** \n\nCommenter: Has anyone actually checked your mans sperm? I know a guy whos wife did 2 rounds of IVF over 7 years, before anyone checked his sperm and they found out he was actually the one with the issue.\n\n>**OOP:** Yes several times. It’s not him, it’s me. Our clinic does ICSI\n\nCommenter: In moments of emotional and physical exhaustion, our fears become amplified. You need rest. Take a break, take some time, and gain some perspective from a healthy place. Additionally, stop worrying about the opinions and expectations of people outside your marriage. They have no stake in this and no right to influence your decision. I wish you the best of luck.\n\n>**OOP:** Thank you. My thing is, I’m either 100% or zero. The middle ground is what makes me crazy-I cannot continue this if I know I’m not doing everything I possibly can. The what-ifs, the curiosity of ovulation or when my period is coming. Does that make sense? I don’t even know if it sounds insane.  \nFor example, I’ve switched my cooking utensils/pans, household products, hair products, we use local soap, makeup, I don’t wear jewelry. I stopped dying my hair. We eat clean & local. No perfume. I don’t wear workout clothes, 100% cotton or linen. I quit vaping, marijuana, drinking. I work out, hike, kayak, go fish & walk every single day. I’m the healthiest I’ve ever been in my life. I feel good about this-but still no child. It wasn’t for nothing, but it wasn’t enough for a pregnancy. I want to go back to a normal view on these things-not an obsession. I want my life back\n\nCommenter: I feel this so hard right now. My husband and I are on our 7th cycle (four with times intercourse and third IUI as of yesterday). Next step is IVF and I’m fucking tired. I was diagnosed with Endometriosis at 20, right oophorectomy and appendectomy at 27, and I have hEDS, chronic pelvic pain, etc. I got pregnant last year (34F) on our second month of trying and had a blighted ovum and had a missed miscarriage at 5.5 weeks, but didn’t find out until 8 weeks. My body has been THROUGH IT. I think if you already have embryos, take a couple of months off. Take a vacation and get away from the noise of it. Reevaluate in two months. Start therapy if you aren’t already. Every month I ask myself if I really want this. Even before my procedures, shots, pills, etc. “do I want this?” Once I start hearing No or I can’t commit to even getting my prescriptions filled or taking the pills, I’ll know I’m done. It fucking sucks and I’m so sorry you are going through this.\n\n>**OOP:** Thank you for your support & understanding. It’s extremely difficult to walk this path, I don’t see it as giving up. I think it’s simply a new chapter. I’ve been having these thoughts before our last transfer, but it feels different to write them down & say them to my partner.  \nI have gained wayyyy more than I have lost during this process. Of course there’s the baby showers, excitement of seeing a positive test due to miscarriage/loss, but I have gained friends, boundaries, healing my childhood, therapy, overall health. There’s really a lot to live for. I want to focus on that now and not feel hopeless every day. The risk outweighs the reward at this point.\n\nCommenter: How is having a sibling the greatest gift you can give a human? I wish I had no sibling. It’s literally only made my life harder.\n\nI’m sorry you’re going through this. It sucks.\n\n>**OOP:** (downvoted) Siblings are all I have from narcissistic parents. They are the only people who fully understand the abuse, it’s my personal opinion. I would feel guilt from not being able to provide a sibling. That’s just me\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i32bfz/update_we_are_going_through_ivf_we_dont_want_kids/)**: January 16, 2025 (5 months later)**\n\nFollowing up 6 months later on our decision to stop fertility treatment due to new thoughts about producing offspring.\n\nWe both started a new diet, exercise routine, we both lost 25 pounds. I cut all supplements & medications, got a new therapist, finished many things I was pushing off, our business has thrived. Things have been great without this taking up 95% of my mental space.\n\nI wavered back and fourth for a while if & when we would try another embryo transfer. Largely because I was trying to heal that it most likely won’t happen for us and enjoying envisioning a future with just my husband while simultaneously listening to everyone in my life calling this “a break.” It’s been confusing to say the least. Especially never knowing WHY it didn’t work.\n\nI knew from the beginning, it was not a break. I visited my primary for a regular check up, she encouraged me to head to my obgyn to see if she had any ideas. I agreed & made an appt.\n\nObgyn said let’s do an exploratory surgery to see what’s happening, some blood work & other minor treatment. I made it clear that I am not doing this for the hope to conceive.\n\nBlood work came back ALL normal (first time in 5 years). Laparoscopy did not come back normal. I have stage 3/4 endometriosis. They did excision but it was covering my entire pelvis. Bladder, colon, small bowel, uterus, encasing my fallopian tubes & ovaries. After 2 years of being told right in my eyes I don’t have endometriosis, this was so relieving. I have an answer now.\n\nShe gave us a brief description of our options while I was waking up. I’ve had weeks to think-do I want to go back to treatment? Do I want try naturally? Do I even want to try at all.\n\nRecovery was hard. Mentally & physically. All I could think about was how I have this timeline now before it grows back. And if I don’t medicate, it comes back faster. I was having vivid dreams of disaster situations happening and no one around me believing me, brushing me off.\n\nI cannot even begin to describe how difficult this has been to process. It doesn’t feel real, the diagnosis, the options, this is not me. It can’t be happening to me.\n\nFollow up was today, they laid out our options. 2-5% rough chance to conceive naturally every month. 50% chance of conceiving with euploid embryos AFTER at least 3 months of suppression that practically will put me into menopause.\n\nIt seems like the next step. Here I am again-researching all day, calling clinics to see who will do transfers for the cheapest. What the actual fuck am I doing?!\n\nHusband gets home. I tell him everything I learned. I’m still in the same spot-I don’t want to do it. So we’re not.\n\nI am sad it has come to this but truly I have spent the past 5 months feeling great inside & out. I want to feel this way for as long as I can-fertility treatment will derail that completely. I don’t think the risk is worth the reward.\n\nI’ve learned so much. And it is frightening to possibly go back to the place I was 1 year ago. I don’t think anything can convince me.\n\nI’m a different person & I’m still done.\n\n***Top Comment:*** \n\nTheunpolitical: One thing people rarely talk about when it comes to fertility treatments is just how much time and energy it consumes. You're juggling multiple fertility clinics, handling the research, pricing, testing, medications, and all the details while also dealing with the constant mental weight of thinking about what you should and shouldn’t be doing each day.\n\nThen, once you’ve managed all of that, the real work begins: administering the medications. And did I mention how you might even change your diet, driven by the desperation to make sure everything is perfect? It’s overwhelming, time-consuming, stressful, and often downright depressing. Every month, when your period arrives, it’s another reminder that you’re not pregnant. Meanwhile, those around you who know you're trying might brush it off, but it’s a huge deal to you. And, of course, there’s always that one friend who seems to get pregnant effortlessly, sometimes even unsure if they want to keep the pregnancy.\n\nEach failed attempt takes its toll. It’s not just the emotional pain of disappointment, it’s also the physical toll. The medications you’re taking might cause weight gain and trigger a sort of postpartum-like depression. So now, you're dealing with deep sadness and the crushing reality of not being pregnant.\n\nI completely understand why, after all of this, you might not want to go back to trying. It’s been over 10 years since we first started, and the only thing that’s helped me is focusing on doing my best every day and finding joy in life. Six years of trying was incredibly tough. I missed out on so much because I was always focused on the next step in the process, missing the chance to enjoy time with friends and live in the moment.\n\nJust know, you’re not alone in this journey.\n\n# Again, do NOT comment on Original Posts. Do not contact OOP. \n\n**Editor's note:** This is a bit of a different one than usual for this sub that deals with a really difficult subject for a lot of people. I hope others can find some encouragement in OOP's story and in some of the kind comments. ",
