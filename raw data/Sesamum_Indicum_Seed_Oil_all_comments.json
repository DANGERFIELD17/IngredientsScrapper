    "body": "Kaniadto, basta panahon sa Kwaresma, magkagulilang ang mga mananambal diri sa amoa. Ganado kaayo ang mga espiritu sa ilang kanya-kanyang tahas. Feeling nako, mura ni sila‚Äôg ga-annual renewal sa ilang pagkamananambal‚Äîlicense to heal, gamit ang tig-tres nga kandila.\n\nAmong silingan, mag-solo glamping sa simbahan sugod Biyernes Santo hangtod Sabado Santo. Dili lang ni basta simba‚Äîmagdala siyag banig, moskitero, ug thermos. Magsugod alas tres sa kadlawon, mahuman alas tres pud sa sunod nga kadlawon. Walay day-off.\n\nAko ra ning nadunggan, pero ang uban daw mokulob sa kwarto. Magdagkot og kandila, magsige og yawyaw og orasyon nga murag tongue twister: ‚ÄúLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.‚Äù\n\nNaa puy uban moadto sa lasang pagkabuntag sa Lunes Santo. Mangolekta og ingredients aron himuon og lana: sesamum indicum seed oil, PEG-40 sorbitan peroleate, propylparaben, BHT, Isopropyl myristate. Di pud ko sure kung mao ba gyud ni. Gi-kopya ra nako ni sa likod sa akong Neutrogena Body Oil.\n\nPero naa koy nakita gyud. Gihilantan akong manghud, pero giingnan lang sa mananambal nga ‚ÄúGiinitan ra na. Hilanat nis sulod.‚Äù Kuyaw. Gilawayan lang og krus sa tiyan ug gi-orasyonan. Nakatawa ko ato. Pero naayo siya pagka-ugma. Ang resita? Ambot mga dahon-dahon man to nga gilapwa. \n\nUsa sa akong pinakadugay nga pangutana: nganong Holy Week man gyud ni ginabuhat? Ngano dili Pasko? Kung ang pagkatawo ni Kristo mao ang sinugdanan sa paglaum, ngano man sa iyang kamatayon magsugod ang spiritual journey sa mga mananambal?\n\n‚ÄúKay kung patay si Kristo, abri ang langit,‚Äù tubag sa akong lola.\n\nAmbot unsay meaning ani. Vague. Basin metaphysical. Basin instinct lang, sama sa pila ka kutsara nga asukar ang ibutang sa binignit inig Biyernes Santo.\n\nGi-explain pud niya: kung bugto ang tulay sa langit ug yuta, mao‚Äôy pinakasayon nga panahon makigsabot sa espiritu. Murag off-duty ang Ginoo. Maka-walk-in ang uban. No queue. No judgment.\n\nAng Kwaresma sa amoa kaniadto, dili lang kabanhawan ni Kristo. Kabanhawan pud sa tambal, mga tinuohan, ug mga katingalahan nga, tuohan man nato o dili, mopadayon lang gihapon. Ang mga orasyon, bisag wala ni follow sa Elements of Style nila Strunk ug White, makaayo gihapon sa ubo, sip-on, hilanat, ug heartbreak.\n\nKaron, halos tanan naay Bluetooth, QR code, ug wellness vlogger. Wa na koy nadungog nga mananambal nga nag-ampo sa lasang. Murag napulihan na.\n\nAng maong lana sa una, giluto sa kalaha, gi-ampoan, gihalad. Karon, makapalit na sa Shopee. Free shipping pa kung P499 and up. Sa una, ang espiritu gitawag pinaagi sa kandila ug kamot nga gipatong sa agtang. Karon, guided meditation with ambient sound. Ad-free pa kung naka-premium.\n\nAng atong henerasyon‚ÄîMillennials ug Gen Zs‚Äîni-shift og interest: from orasyon to astrology, from lana to skincare routine.\n\nNi-evolve ba ta, o ni-backslide?\n\nWala koy tubag. Pero kabalo ko, wala nay naulian sa sip-on tungod sa orasyon. Paracetamol na ron.\n\nAyaw lang gyud mo pasamad ron. Kay di na ra ba na maulian. \n\nOrasyon di kipot, halaba halipot.",

    "body": "Hey everyone! Before I got super busy with my new job, I used to regularly post reviews over on r/AsianBeauty. I really enjoyed that process, and now that things have mellowed out a bit for me, I wanted to start doing the same here. \n\nI generally try to review products that I don't see too often on skincare subs. Past reviews have included [Missha Near Skin Madecanol Cream] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/87r241/review_missha_near_skin_madecanol_cream/), [Missha Near Skin Total Ceramide Cream] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/82f8h9/review_missha_near_skin_total_ceramide_cream/), [Missha Near Skin Phyto Azulen Cream] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/8cejd0/review_missha_near_skin_phyto_azulen_cream/), [Tosowoong Apricot Seed Cleansing Oil] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/7u2j65/review_tosowoong_apricot_seed_cleansing_oil/), and [Benton Honest TT Mist] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/7trt3u/review_benton_honest_tt_mist/). Today I wanted to review one of my favorite masks: The Body Shop Ginseng and Rice Polishing and Clarifying Mask. \n\nI hope you enjoy the review, and as always, please feel free to leave questions and feedback!\n\n**The Body Shop Chinese Ginseng and Rice Clarifying and Polishing Mask**\n\nI *love* masks. Like seriously **love** them. And as much as I enjoy a good sheet mask, there's still something about a nice wash-off mask that feels like you're really pampering yourself. I still have very high expectations for my wash-off masks though...they can't just feel nice. I also expect them to address my skin concerns, which are mainly acne, PIE, and dryness/dehydration. \n\nI spotted this particular mask in someone's shelfie over on ScA, and hadn't heard of it before, so I popped into the Body Shop one day to have a look. I was a bit hesitant to try it, as I was worried it might be too drying. It's ended up being one of my favorite products, and I'm so glad I took the risk. \n\n**Packaging:** This product comes in a 3oz/75ml dark brown glass jar with a black plastic lid. It's surprisingly heavy for its size, but has proven fairly durable...the lid has stayed intact for as long as I've had it, and while I haven't dropped it, the jar did survive an international move with no problems. Aesthetically, it's apothecary/minimal, so if you're into Aesop's vibe, you'll probably like this too. I know not everyone is keen on jar packaging, but I personally don't mind it. \n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nThe star ingredients in this mask are kaolin, salicylic acid, ginseng, and rice extract. The first two are acne-fighters; kaolin is a type of clay that's known for being less drying than other types of clay while still providing similar acne-fighting, pore-reducing benefits. And we all know salicylic acid as everyone's favorite BHA. While the percentage isn't listed, it's high enough on the ingredients list that I'd estimate (very unscientifically) it's somewhere in the 1% range, and expect to see an impact. Rice bran extract is an emollient ingredient ([source] (https://cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/oryza-sativa-rice-extract)) but in its powdered form, can be a mild exfoliant. I'm not sure which form it's used in here, but given the slightly grainy texture of the mask, I'd expect it's powdered, and is acting as an exfoliant rather than an emollient. Ginseng is touted for its anti-aging benefits, and has been shown to act as an antioxidant, have an anti-inflammatory effect, and stimulate blood flow to give you a bit of a glow ([source] (https://www.refinery29.com/42123). Beeswax and shea butter in the ingredients list also made me a bit more optimistic when considering the product--it seems like there was definitely some thought that went into making this a clarifying product that still wouldn't strip dry skin too much. \n\nThat's the good stuff. However, there are a lot of potentially sensitizing ingredients in there. Denatured alcohol features pretty high on the ingredients list. I personally don't have issues with alcohol in skincare, but it's something to watch for those who do. Fragrance is also higher on the list than I'd generally like, so those who are sensitive to fragrance, beware. There are also some fatty alcohols, as well as limonene, and linalool. If you have especially sensitive skin, this product is probably not for you.\n\nThe full ingredients list is:\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Glycerin, Luffa Cylindrica Fruit, Kaolin, Sesamum Indicum Seed Oil/Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, PEG-100 Stearate, Alcohol Denat., Decyl Glucoside, Cera Alba/Beeswax/Cire d‚Äôabeille, Perlite, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter/Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter,Parfum/Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Limonene, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Myristyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Menthol, Panax Ginseng Root Extract/Panax Ginseng (Ginseng) Root Extract, Disodium EDTA, Citral, Citronellol, Linalool, Menthoxypropanediol, Tetrasodium Pyrophosphate, Eugenol, Dextrin, Oryza Sativa Extract/Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, CI 77891/Titanium Dioxide.\n\n**Price:** I bought mine in the UK for ¬£17; it retails for $28 in the US, but The Body Shop often runs sales and 3 for 2 deals. \n\n**Use and Performance:**\n\nLike I mentioned when talking about the ingredients, this is a clarifying mask that seems to have been formulated with dry skin in mind. This is very clearly reflected in the texture of the mask. It's far creamier than your typical clay mask, and doesn't dry down as completely. The mask itself is an off-white colour, and the creamy clay consistency also includes a grainy element (most likely from the rice). It smells very strongly of ginseng, which I love. You apply this like you would any other clay mask--spread a thin layer over your face using your fingers or a brush, then wait 15-20 minutes for the mask to dry down, and then rinse it off. \n\nI don't find that this mask dries down as aggressively as other clay masks I've tried, and I don't feel like my face is about to crack at the end of 20 minutes. I usually prefer to wash this mask off in the shower, because it can be a bit difficult to wash it off cleanly without making a total mess--consider yourself warned! My face does feel a bit tight afterwards, but it's nothing that a few layers of Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion and Scinic Honey AIO can't fix. \n\nI see instant results from this mask. My pores immediately look smaller, and my skin has much more of a glow. If I use it at night, I wake up the next morning with a significant reduction in my acne. I also find it reduces my PIE, which was something I wasn't expecting! I use this mask once a week, or twice a week if my skin is especially congested, and I find that it clears up any random acne or texture issues that I'm dealing with. \n\n**Final Thoughts:** This is a really great mask option for someone who needs an occasional serious acne-fighter, but is also worried about dryness. Oilier skin types may be able to use the mask more often than dryer skin types. It's definitely not a one-stop miracle acne product...I rely on Differin (currently, previously Skinoren) to keep my acne under control in the long-term, and use this mask to address random breakouts and congestion. It's also probably not great for more sensitive skin types, I'm sorry to say. And if you're dehydrated, you'll probably want to steer clear as well--clay and salicylic acid won't do your moisture barrier any good!\n\nOverall, it's a very effective, pleasant to use mask that I consider a holy grail, and will continue to repurchase for as long as I can. \n\n**My Rating: 5/5**\n\n",

I was looking at the Body Shop Vitamin C Glow Boosting Moisturiser since I've tried it as a sample before and liked the way it applies. Vitamin C is always a huge plus (currently using C-Firma sample) so I was pretty keen.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm super confused however as I can't figure out which ingredient in the Body Shop Moisturiser is Vitamin C. I've been researching Vitamin C ingredients and found that I can't find any of the synthetic Vit C ingredients (Ascorbic acid, L-ascorbic acid, Magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, Ascorbyl palmitate, Ascorbic acid polypeptide, Ascorbyl glucosamine, Ascorbyl glucoside, Ester-C, Sodium ascorbyl palmitate, Sodium ascorbyl phosphate***). The only natural ingredients are a sesame seed oil and a fruit extract very low down the list. Could these be the source of the Vit C?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSorry for such a long post! Trying to wrap my head around using effective products and am learning how to navigate ingredients!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Body Shop Vitamin C Glow Boosting Moisturiser Ingredients:** Aqua/Water (Solvent), Alcohol Denat.

There are still alcohols and synthetic components in these.\n\nYou‚Äôre starting from too complicated of a controlled perspective. You say you wish to determine what ingredients are subjectively preferred by yourself, and I doubt even the most oil-affluent human on the planet would be able to independently judge each of these 10 ingredients in each bottle. Too much combination happening at once. \n\nAdvice:\nIf you can‚Äôt pronounce an ingredient, don‚Äôt use it. If you were to use your own judgement system and be successful with finding the right oils, you‚Äôd be using natural stuff in the end. Save yourself the time now. \n\nIt was said before, but stay simple. Use your classic base oils, a little essential, and added vitamin E if you‚Äôd like. Parfume and Fragrance typically refers to alcohol-based, and you don‚Äôt want that on your skin or hair. \n\nSpend $50-75 on amazon and you‚Äôll be able to make yourself quality beard oil for at least a few months.",

Dip my face dry and apply moisturiser. The one I'm using now:\n**C√Æme Belle d'amour - Protective day & night cream**\n*This cream nourishes and protects the skin of your face and low neckline, giving it a smoother, fresher and overall healthier appearance. The formula combines precious mountain plants such as edelweiss and wild roses. Edelweiss, a powerful antioxidant, protects the skin against external stress whilst wild rose oil nourishes and regenerates the skin, helping prevent its premature aging.*\n*Ingredients: aloe barbadensis extract - aqua - cocus nucifera oil - dicaprylyl ether - cetyl babassuate - glycerin - glyceryl stearate citrate - glyceryl dibehenate -hydrolyzed rice starch - methylheptyl isostearate - rosa rubiginosa seed oil - tribehenin - benzyl alcohol - aroma - cellulose gum - microcrystalline cellulose - sodium stearoyl glutamate - glyceryl behenate - alcohol - leontopodium alpinum extract - xanthan gum - tocopherol - dehydroacetic acid - linalool - citronellol*\nI also use Clinique pep-start eye cream.\n\n* My evening routine is slightly longer, I used to use my Clarisonic every evening but, people over on Makeupaddiction advised me to use it less so I now use it every other evening. \nFirst I remove makeup with Garnier micellar water for sensitive skin. After that I use Philosophy Purity again with cloth or clarisonic. Now before moisturiser I use C√Æme Kissed by a Rose - Serum.\n*This delightful, natural serum ‚Äì an ultra-concentrated and expert blend of essential oil of rose, rosehip oil, sea buckthorn oil and apricot kernel oil - actually nourishes the skin. Rich in the rare fatty acid Omega 7 and Omega 3, 6 and 9 fatty acids and vitamins A, B, C and E, this serum stimulates natural cellular regeneration and restores skin elasticity. Moreover, it helps to reduce fine lines, normalise irritated, red skin and brighten the complexion.*\n*Ingredients: sesamum indicum seed oil - dicaprylyl carbonate - dicrapylyl ether - prunus armeniaca kernel oil - rosa rubiginosa seed oil - hippophae rhamnoides fruit extract - tocopherol - rosa damascena flower oil - citronellol - geraniol - linalool- citral - eugenol - farnesol - rosmarinus officinalis leaf extract*\n\nFinish with same moisturiser as in the morning. \n\n* Now how does my skin look, I'll start by saying that I'm almost 30 and I have a fair skin with freckles. My chin always has cists and bumps, the minute you think they are gone another appears and it's only in the middle or the right side. \nMy nose has blackheads but looks dry. My forehead looks a bit flaky. My cheeks are good, they are soft and look healthy. \n\nI also use a mask every sunday evening mostly calming or hydrating.\n\nSo I think the dry nose and forehead might be dehydration, it's cold outside and I like to turn the heat up high inside. I don't drink water, just Coke Zero.\n\nMy thoughts are that I need a different facewash, my skin feels stripped after using purity. The moisturiser seems fine though. What are your tips. \n\nSorry for this long post :)\n",

I have lately been applying a foot balm (more on the product below) to my face, and I was wondering if it could be a bad idea...\n\nI am a male (23) and luckily I no longer have severe acne problems. Just the usual pimple or pustule, not more than 2 or 3 at a time. \n\nAbout a month ago or so, I tried using this foot balm on a single pimple that was growing on my face. Surprisingly, the pimple disappeared in 2 or 3 days, way faster than what they usually take. So since then I have been using it on every single pimple/pustule that starts growing on my face. This way they don't get as big and red as they used to, and they only last for 2 or 3 days.\n\nI'm not complaining at all, but I can't help but ask myself if doing this could be bad for my skin. As I said, I do not use in over all my face, just over the pimples. Besides this foot balm, I use a cleanser and a moisturizer almost daily.\n\nAdditionally (sorry if it's offtopic) I would also want to know why does this work. Checking on the ingredients, the only one that could help is Lactic Acid, but this acid is used to prevent acne breakouts, not to treat already existing pimples.\n\nI do not post the product link cause that would be against the forum rules (correct me if I'm wrong and I will post it).\n\nI'll write down the active ingredients here instead:\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua (water), Sesamum indicum seed oil (nourishing sesame oil), Citrus aurantium dulcis fruit water\\* (orange hydrosol), Polyglyceryl-6 pentaoleate (emulsifier derived from sesame oil), Sambucus nigra fruit extract (antioxidant elderberry extract), Propanediol, Glycerin (plant-derived moisturiser), Brassica campestris/aleurites fordi oil copolymer (natural polymer from rapeseed and tung tree oil), Salix alba bark extract (skin-soothing willow bark extract), Adansonia digitata seed oil\\* (baobab oil), Opuntia ficus-indica seed oil (prickly pear seed oil), Limnanthes alba seed oil (meadowfoam seed oil), Zinc stearate (zinc-fatty acid compound), Magnesium sulphate (Epsom salt), Arginine (moisturising amino acid), Olea europaea oil unsaponifiables (unsaponifiable part of olive oil), Symphytum officinale root extract (comfrey root extract), Theobroma grandiflorum seed butter\\* (grooming cupuacu butter), Equisetum arvense extract (soothing common horsetail extract), Leptospermum scoparium branch/leaf oil (manuka oil), Eucalyptus globulus leaf oil\\* (eucalyptus oil), Melaleuca alternifolia leaf oil\\* (tea tree oil), Salvia officinalis oil (sage oil), Astrocaryum tucuma seed butter\\* (pampering tucuma butter), Bisabolol, Menthol\\* (from Mentha arvensis), Camphor, Mangifera indica seed butter\\* (mango butter), Rhus verniciflua peel cera / Rhus succedanea fruit cera (berry wax / sumac wax), Phenethyl alcohol (rose alcohol), Shorea robusta resin (sala tree resin), Helianthus annuus seed cera (sunflower wax), Tocopherol (vitamin E), Malic acid (apple acid), (L+) Lactic Acid (Lactic acid), Hydrogenated rapeseed oil (thickener from rapeseed oil), CI 75810 (chlorophyll derivative), Limonene¬∞",

DC seems to be a sort of silicone-replacement in skin-care products, but not widely used in haircare (the manufacturers of dicaprylyl carbonate list one hair product containing it called [\"Forever Trendy Grease Hair Balm\"](http://dewolfchem.com/formulations/forever-trendy-grease-hair-care-balm/), which also has a high oil content like your serum; the name makes me think the product stands a good chance of being heavy).  It appears to be insoluble in water, but I can't find exact information about how it interacts with hair (does it cling as readily to hair as standard silicones?); if you use sulfate-free stuff and are leery of silicones, I would use this product in your hair VERY sparingly at the start and see how it goes, because it may or may not be hard to wash out.  The only other issue is that the oils may be heavy on your hair, but that's also something you'll find out by trying it.  There's nothing that should be dangerous to your hair in here.",

Losing hair strands during bathing is considered normal. You cannot exercise control over it.\n\nIf the hair loss is severe, you should meet a dermatologist immediately and undergo various tests to find out the underlying problem.\n\nYou should start taking prescription drugs and medicines prescribed by the dermatologist and find ways to recover from severe hair loss. Before visiting the dermatologist, you should first try some of the time-tested methods listed below. Grandma used to say brushing wet hair or detangling the hair when it is wet is risky.\n\nMen and women struggling from severe hair loss should follow the above instructions and recover from hair loss quickly. Combing long and thick hair after a bath aggravates the hair loss to a great extent. You may even become bald when the situation turns grim. Hair becomes thick, moisturized, and wet after a bath.\n\nIf you comb your hair with a brush immediately after a bath, there are chances of becoming bald. The knots and tangles may develop after the bath. You must rinse and dry your hair with a dryer for a few minutes before brushing your hair.\n\n**Organic hair shampoos and conditioners act as lubricants**\n\nBrushing the hair after a head bath is the wrong option. Stop using sulfate and chemical-rich hair shampoos and conditioners since these products can damage your hair permanently. Organic hair care shampoos enriched with Aloe vera and other ingredients listed below can do wonders on your lovely hair.\n\n* Pumpkin\n* Holi basil\n* Wheat germ\n* Coco Nucifera oil\n* China Root extract\n* Chia seed and tea tree oil extracts\n\nThese ingredients are safe and time-tested natural extracts that promote hair growth and nourish the hair from deep within.\n\nClick here to find the best organic nourishing hair shampoos and conditioners that come from the house of reputed brands. The fastest-selling organic shampoos, sprays, gels, and conditioners contain the following ingredients which penetrate your scalp and improve the hair texture to a great extent.\n\n* Cumin\n* Carissa Carandas\n* Curcuma Aromatic\n* Linden flower\n* Maca root\n* Malabar nut\n* Berberis Lyceum\n* Sesamum indicum seed oil and\n* Beeswax\n\n**What to inspect and analyze while buying organic shampoos?**\n\nThe shoppers should explore the product label, brand reputation, price tags, quantity, quality, ingredients. They should also explore the ratings, reviews, feedbacks, testimonials, and tweets. Never rush to the nearest dealer and buy hair care products without exploring the ingredients.\n\nHair treatments like transplantation, weaving, and insertions are high expenses. You may have to pay through your nose for these types of expensive treatments. You should always consider alternative forms of hair care treatments before approaching cosmetologists.\n\nAyurveda oils, shampoos, conditioners, and soaps contain the right amount of herbal, plant, and floral extracts which are safe to use. You can use organic hair care products liberally during bathing and brush your hair after it dries thoroughly.",
