    "body": "Hello all, I have been spending this summer playing sunscreen musical chairs in attempt to find my favorites. Sunscreen reviews on SCA have been incredibly helpful during this process, so I'd like to give back to the community by providing some content myself.\n\nThis is a comparison review of two American sunscreen options:\n\n* cult favorite [**Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++**](https://supergoop.com/products/unseen-sunscreen) | $34.00 for 1.7 oz | $20 per oz\n* budget-friendly potential dupe [**Kroger Sunscreen Invisible Gel SPF 40**](https://www.kroger.com/p/kroger-sunscreen-invisible-gel-spf40/0004126000791) | $10.99 for 3.0 oz | $3.66 per oz\n\nI'm also dipping my toe into European and Asian sunscreens right now to find my go-to's with better UVA protection, but I couldn't resist trying Supergoop to see what the hype is all about. I picked up the Kroger dupe as well to compare for \"fun\". I originally caught wind of it via [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/fapfh5/sun_care_kroger_sunscreen_invisible_gel_spf_40/).\n\n[**Supergoop vs. Kroger photo album.**](https://imgur.com/a/JuBFacB)\n\n1.

Glow Oil SPF 50](https://supergoop.com/products/sun-defying-sunscreen-oil-with-meadowfoam) (5.0 oz for $38.00 / $7.60 per oz). I am not planning on trying either of these myself, so if you have tried these, please share your thoughts for us!\n\n# 🌞 Review\n\n**PROCESS**\n\nI have been using both of these intermittently for the past couple of weeks. I also did a direct comparison one day where I applied Supergoop on one half of my face and Kroger on the other.\n\nI did not purchase a full size of the Supergoop, so feel free to take this as my \"initial impressions\", as the Supergoop sample size only provides about 8 applications using the 1/4 tsp rule. (If they're available, I prefer to try sample sizes of the products I'm considering before committing the counter space and the ca$h to full-size versions.)\n\n**Relevant about me and my skin:** Female, late 20s. Relatively pale. My skin is oily but loves hydration. No known ingredient sensitivities, skin is relatively clear except for occasional hormone-induced breakouts. Other skin concerns: mild redness, managing pore appearance and sebaceous filaments, fading hyperpigmentation and previous sun damage.\n\n**Since this is a sunscreen review, my current morning routine may be helpful, too:** Rinse face with water, pat dry. Timeless Vit C 20% + E + Ferulic. The Ordinary Caffeine 5% + EGCG under eyes. Hydrating serum if the mood strikes. Sunscreen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**APPLICATION**\n\n* **See photos:** [Packaging](https://i.imgur.com/mo8jhT5.jpg) | [Dispensed onto my arm](https://i.imgur.com/8clDq0R.jpg)\n* The Kroger formula does appear darker when coming out of the tube, but it is not actually tinted. Both sunscreens do not have any noticeable tint upon application for me.\n* They both have a similar gel texture, similar to...buttery Neosporin, in a non-gross way? The gel is not runny or goopy, but quite easy to spread as it glides easily over the skin. No issues with pilling, even upon reapplication. Easy to apply the recommended 2mg/cm^(2) \"dosage\" (\\~1/4 tsp).\n* Both make my hands feel weirdly greasy after applying for a bit, even after washing.\n* Neither have a distinct scent to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LOOK & FEEL**\n\n* **See photos:** [Immediately after application](https://i.imgur.com/safMkZr.jpg) | [10 minutes after application](https://i.imgur.com/ydlue5M.jpg)\n* Once applied, both the Supergoop and Kroger look essentially identical on my face. No whitecast whatsoever. Both have the signature \"velvety finish\" that Supergoop is known for, which is neither dewy/shiny nor mattifying.\n* Thanks to the silicones in these formulas, both provide a very slight smoothing effect. The Unseen has been described as [similar to the Smashbox Photo Finish Primer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sephora/comments/ghcihy/supergoop_unseen_sunscreen_spf_40_reviews_and_the/). I rarely wear a full face, so I did not test how these wear under makeup.\n* They both feel very soft and almost weightless on the skin. Both are quite moisturizing, which I appreciate since I prefer to have sunscreen double as my AM moisturizer.\n* Despite feeling quite light on my face, I find that both sunscreens take an annoyingly long time to \"set\" after application. The Kroger sunscreen dries more slowly than the Supergoop and feels a bit heavier to the touch, which to me is the only notable difference between the two. (Weirdly, this isn't noticeable in terms of how the sunscreen feels on my face – I'm only aware of it when I happen to touch my face with my hands, if that makes sense.) The Supergoop seems to finally mostly set after about two hours; the Kroger takes about three. In the meantime, it seems like there is still some malleability to the sunscreen finish. I wonder how susceptible the coverage is to getting disrupted up if I happen to touch my face.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PROTECTION & PERFORMANCE**\n\nPlease take the following with a grain of salt, as these are just my personal musings. I'm not a dermatologist or cosmetic chemist, I'm just a random person on the internet with skin.\n\n**UVA**\n\n* Since these are both American sunscreens, we already know that UVA protection is relatively lacking due to the abysmal selection of FDA-approved sunscreen filters. (For those not familiar with UVA protection ins-and-outs, [I enjoy this breakdown from LabMuffin](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-feature-why-you-should-protect-yourself-from-uva/).)\n* I emailed Supergoop and Kroger last week requesting current PPD ratings and both said they couldn't provide this info. Here's [Supergoop's response](https://i.imgur.com/KsL1tIA.png) and [Kroger's response](https://i.imgur.com/C33WWG4.png). \n* Supergoop [lists the Unseen as PA+++](https://thebrightside.supergoop.com/pa-sunscreen-rating-system/), so we can assume the PPD is somewhere [between 8-16](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-feature-why-you-should-protect-yourself-from-uva/#:~:text=PA%20is%20a%20similar%20concept,2number%20of%20plus%20signs.). They did actually provide PPD ratings at one point – [per this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/brih2q/i_emailed_supergoop_about_ppd_ratings_sun_care/) from May 2019 that lists Supergoop! Unseen as PPD 9.9 – but this was pre-formulation (that removed octinoxate at the end of 2019).\n* Without confirmation from Kroger, I am assuming the PA rating for the Invisible Gel is similar to the Unseen Sunscreen. Both contain [avobenzone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyl-methoxydibenzoylmethane), the only FDA-approved chemical filter that provides proper protection across the entire UVA range, but it is not photostable (degrades quickly with exposure to sunlight). The Kroger Invisible Gel does have a higher concentration of [octocrylene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/octocrylene), which is supposed to help stabilize avobenzone, but I am absolutely *not* qualified whatsoever to say if this actually results in improved UVA protection.\n* For some peeps, PA+++ is far too low of a level for UV protection. I feel like I'm personally in this category at this point in my Great Summer of Sunscreen Experimentation – especially on days that I'm going to be outside for long periods, I want a sunscreen that gives me better overall protection. \n\n**UVB**\n\n* Both sunscreens are SPF 40.\n* I did not notice any visible burning while wearing either sunscreen, but I also didn't use them on days when I was outside during peak sun exposure times.\n\n**Ingredient sensitivities**\n\n* Neither of these sunscreens caused breakouts or irritation, but my skin is not very sensitive in general. For those sensitive to chemical filters or silicones, these may not be ideal picks for you. Both are fragrance-free, however the Kroger does contain [citrus peel oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citrus-aurantium-dulcis-peel-oil), which could also be problematic for some.\n* Those with sensitive eyes may want to exercise caution when applying the Kroger Invisible Gel, as I did experience some minor irritation one day when I had liberally applied close to my eyes and got a bit sweaty. I haven't noticed this much with the Supergoop, but I'm not sure why – it could be because of the formulation differences, because I happened to not apply it as close to my eyes, or because I just simply didn't apply sweat as much on the days I wore the Supergoop.\n\n# 🌞 Conclusion\n\n**I'd recommend the Kroger Invisible Gel as a budget-friendly pick for Americans who currently love or want to try Supergoop! Unseen, but don't want to pay Supergoop prices.**\n\nIf you are willing to compromise just slightly on texture to pay literally *one fifth of the price per ounce*, give the Kroger a try so you can slather yourself in velvety sunscreen without emptying your wallet. For those with sensitivities to chemical filters or silicones, or who don't like the primer-esque texture, this is probably one to skip.\n\nYou're kind of prioritizing cosmetic elegance over higher UVA protection with both options, but this may be somewhat unavoidable for those who don't want to deal with sourcing foreign sunscreens or a [Zuckerberg-esque whitecast](https://www.reddit.com/r/awfuleverything/comments/hu8m7g/mark_zuckerberg_surfboards_in_hawaii_with_way_too/).\n\nIf you're in the US and willing to regularly spend $20 per ounce for a cosmetically elegant sunscreen like Supergoop, it may be worth your time to explore La Roche Posay or EltaMD sunscreens that offer equal elegance and better sun protection for your buck. Or even better, source Asian or European sunscreens to get better broad-spectrum protection.\n\nIf you don't live in the US, I would not recommend either of these sunscreens, as you probably have more easily accessible options at home that fit your criteria for UVA/UVB protection, cosmetic elegance, and/or budget.\n\n**Would I personally repurchase?**\n\nNot planning on it at the moment, given my focus on sunscreens that provide better UVA protection. If I were on a trip and forgot sunscreen or something, I would pick up the Kroger Invisible Gel again, since I know it is excellently priced, easy to apply, and has zero whitecast. Personally, the gel vehicle isn't my fave. I found it annoying that it takes basically eons to set on my face, and the slightly lighter consistency of the Supergoop does not justify the huge price jump for me.",

        "body": "I know this post is a little old, but I thought I'd add in my own experience with buying the Kroger Supergoop! dupes... a couple of weeks ago I went into a store and bought both the gel and the body oil. \n\nThe Kroger gel feels the same as the Supergoop! gel I've tried, although I would recommend shaking them both before dispensing them. The oil generally feels nice, like a moisturizing body oil does. I haven't tried the Supergoop! one, so I can't compare them. I'd also add that the oil does have a pretty strong smell. It's not a bad smell-- I actually liked it, but if you're sensitive to fragrance on the body, maybe skip that one. I also don't feel like I would use it on a sunny day while I'm outside. As an everyday sunscreen, I'm happy to use it. I also didn't notice any issues using it on my neck, which has a tendency to turn red if any sort of product touches it ever. \n\nAll fine and good so far, until I realized the next day that I made a rookie mistake and hadn't checked the expiration dates before buying. The oil expires 10/21, the gel 11/21. Took them back to the store just hoping to exchange them... all the bottles there were the same expiration dates. So I just got refunded.\n\n  \nToday I went to a different store and both the oil and gel were in stock. Unfortunately, all the oils still expire 10/21 and most of the gels expired 11/21. I managed to search through and found a gel with a date of 4/22, so I went with that one. I haven't repurchased the oil, but I would like to. \n\n  \nTL;DR: good sunscreens that feel great, but be sure to always check the expiration dates on the sunscreens!",

    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

While you might have had a bad experience, using acids with retinol will NOT cause more breakouts as you erroneously suggested, and on the contrary many dermatologists recommend using benzoyl peroxide in conjunction with retinols to stave off purging and help acne heal faster. You can say be careful using acids, but speaking so definitively about something that is completely not true and unfounded (especially about it somehow causing more breakouts) is something that needs to be editing or removed.",

I personally would go for the Be Plain when it's available because it has a simplified formula without the unnecessary plant extracts and flower oils. I think the Be Plain one would be better for oily skin than the Round Lab one. Both of the Hyggee sunscreens look promising, but I'm gravitating towards the Vegan Sun Cream because it is a chemical sunscreen and I have a tan complexion, I don't want to risk a white cast. However, the Real Sun Cream does have an interesting ingredient list and whipped texture (as I can see on Yesstyle)  and I will be looking out for reviews to see whether it leaves a white cast or not and make my decision accordingly. What I love about the Hyggee sunscreens is that they are fragrance/essential oil free, but they still contain alcohol. I prefer alcohol because it allows the sunscreen to set better and be less tacky. If you have oily skin, I would think that one of the Hyggee sunscreens would work better for you because I have a Kolmar sunscreen (Isntree Watery Sun Gel) that is similar to the new Round Lab and Be Plain sunscreens and I definitely wouldn't recommend it for oily skin as it is way too shiny.\n\nEdit: I just noticed that the Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream has beet root extract, which made me think of the Krave Beet Shield. Get this, the Beet Shield was also made in Cosmax, same as this new Hyggee one. So I did some digging and found out that the Beet Shield has the SAME exact 5 filters as this new Hyggee sunscreens in the same order. The rest of ingredients are not too similar though, so I do not think they are the same exact sunscreen, as opposed to how I feel about the Be Plain and Round Lab sunscreens, which I do think are almost identical. I do think this Vegan Sun Cream is inspired by the Beet Shield, with maybe an improved formula, since the Beet Shield did not pass SPF tests. So if you are looking for a replacement of the Krave Beauty Beet Shield but with verified SPF protection, get the new Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream!",

    "body": "Hiya,\n\nI hope you enjoy the below reviews. I'm just a regular consumer buying everything with my own money - i.e., nothing sponsored, etc. Note, I've bought all of them on sale for around AUD$15-20 because I like sales haha.\n\nProducts:\n\n1. PKY - essence toner;\n2. PKY - mist toner;\n3. Secret Key - fresh nature toner - milk brightening one;\n4. Benton - Aloe BHA Toner;\n5. Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 Relief Toner; and\n6. Purito - Centella Green Level Calming Toner & the unscented version (Purito Unscented Centella Toner)\n\nMy skin used to be severely dry but is now slightly dry on the cheek areas and slightly oily on the t-zone during summer and slightly dry on the whole face in the winter.\n\nAlso note that the below two PKY products have different 'actives'/hero ingredients notwithstanding them seemingly being quite similar! I've bolded the plant extracts under the ingredient headers below.\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Essence Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495), *Australian* websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. *Note, this one is generally recommended for people with drier skin whereas the mist version is generally recommended for those with oilier skin* Friends with eczema have also used this with success. *.* I can use both year round without breaking out. I've had friends with oilier skin who've used this one and have broken out. YMMV.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** LOVE THIS. May repurchase this for the rest of my life. I've used this after breaking my moisture barrier, after chemical peels, after active masks, and also *after getting my face ablatively lasered (after the the initial few days of only using an ointment)*. It's REALLY benign in a godly way. If you want it to do anything other than hydrate or increase the penetration of your other actives, this isn't the product for you (note, it doesn't claim to do anything else apart from hydrate & calm really).\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a little bit thicker than water but not as thick as the Purito centella toners. Won't run off your hand/face like water will but will eventually run off.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** None at allll, even when I broke my moisture barrier.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? Yes**/I have rebought this 4 or so times so far.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Mist Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance. This is in a spray bottle and is better suited to oily skinned persons.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL.

November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Decent hydration, I prefer to use this in the toner stage instead of after my skincare but I have enjoyed using it as a 'refreshing' spray during the day.\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a nice mist, doesn't run on the face. Feels like a spray of water?\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a spray bit on top. I've had no issues with it but one mate had a couple that didn't spray properly.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** Unsure. I've rebought it once but haven't gone to use this one as much as I have the PKY essence toner or the Purito Unscented Centella Toner. I also don't like mists a whole bunch as they can go onto your clothes (if you're out) or jewellery if you're wearing any. But, I did go through a phase of keeping it in my handbag and using it when out and about for a bit of hydration.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Coptis Japonica Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Secret Key - Fresh nature Toner (Milk Brightening)**\n\n**What is it:** Hydrating toner that's meant to brighten your skin.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx.

Couldn't use it long enough to notice anything.\n\n**Smell:** A very strong scent that I could barely use it. I think I used it around 5-10 times before binning it - I couldn't even put up with the scent of this to use it on other parts of my body.\n\n**Feel:** really watery.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Fortunately (given the high fragrance), no reactions to this. If you had any irritation though, I'd expect some sort of reaction.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? No**, given I threw mine out.\n\n**Ingredients:** Not a comprehensive list given there's a generic list on yesstyle then a list below it for the main ones in the milk one but here -\n\n700ppm) \\[**sic**\\], 1, 2-Hexandiol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata Extract, Nonoxynol-12, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Tremella Fuciformis Extract, Allantoin, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Cucumber Extract, Propylene Glycol, Tomato Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Rice Extract, Lanoline, Tea Tree Leaf Water (9, Sciadopitys Verticillata Root Extract, Pumpkin Extract, Papaya Fruit Extract, Oleth-10, Viola Tricolor Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Ethanol, Glyceryl Stearate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Chamomilia Recutita Flower Extract, Morus Alba Bark Extract, Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Lemon Extract, Oleth-5, Sodium Hyaluronate, Potato Extract, Pomegranate Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Sap Extract, Bean Extract, Aloe Vera Leaf Water (9, Broccoli Extract, Glycerin, Green Tea Extract, Plantago Asiatica Extract, Hollyhock Root Extract, Witch Hazel Extract (9, Phenoxyethanol, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Mineral Oil, Ulmus Campestris Extract, Carrot Extract, Polysorbate 80, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rose Damascena Flower Water (9, Korean Raspberry Extract, Milk Protein Extract (9, White Willow Bark Extract, Psidium Guajava Fruit Extract, Witch Hazel Extract, 4-Terpineol, Algae Extract\n\nand then it says the main ones in the milk version are -\n\ngalactomyces ferment filtrate, pomegranate extract, physalis alkenkengi extract, milk protein concentrate, raspberry extract, pasque flower extract, potato extract, carrot extract, pumpkin extract, rice extract, usnea extract, broccoli extract\n\nso who really knows what's in it...\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Benton Aloe BHA Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating toner which is meant to gently exfoliate with 0.5% salicylic acid.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$23. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/benton-aloe-bha-skin-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1053033537), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** people with sensitive and dry skin as it's quite rich.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** on and off since mid 2020, still using it randomly to just use it up.\n\n**My thoughts:** Per Google (may not be accurate), it has a pH of 5.5 which is too high for there to be any noticeable exfoliation with 0.5% BHA present. I've not noticed any calming effects. It is definitely hydrating but given it's advertised as a BHA toner I'm quite disappointed at the lack of BHA efficacy here. I would much rather use the purito centella toner to hydrate and calm my skin as the centella has other benefits such as helping to stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** Similar to the PKY essence toner. Not as thick as the purito centella toners.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a pump on top. No issues with it, but it can come out a bit forcefully sometimes.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **No**, almost threw it out but am trying to use it up.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nAloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Water (80%), Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Beta-Glucan, Polyglutamic Acid, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Portulaca Oleracea (Green Purslane) Extract, Psidium Guajava (Guava) Fruit Extract, Salicylic Acid (0.5%), Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract (200mg), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice (200mg), Arginine, Pentylene Glycol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Polysorbate 20, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** **Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 relief toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$25 for 180mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/etude-house-soon-jung-ph-5-5-relief-toner-180ml-180ml/info.html/pid.1058586258), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone. It adds light hydration with benign ingredients - akin to the PKY toners but very minimally more expensive. It'd be good if you have irritated and/or dry skin.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** I used it once/twice a day until I used it up. Bought it in December 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Pretty decent. I'd recommend this to the same group of people who'd use the PKY essence toner. Nothing ground breaking. I prefer the calming nature of the Purito Unscented Centella Toner or even the PKY essence toner if you want zero actives (if you consider centella an 'active').\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** A watery toner.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** No but for no fault of the product. I just prefer using the Purito Unscented Centella one as it's just as benign, a bit cheaper, and has the benefits of centella.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, Propanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Madecassoside, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Polyglycerin-3, Disodium EDTA\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**Centella Green Level Calming Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804) **& the** [**Centella Unscented Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380)\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating and calming toner - may also stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$30 but I've always bought it on sale for approx. AUD$20-25 for 200mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380), [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml)\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone however this is best suited to those with any sort of irritation, acne, or redness. That is, if you have basically perfect skin you're probably not going to notice much of a difference but if you have irritation etc then you'll likely fall in love. Also good if you're wanting to help stimulate collagen production especially for the low price point - target ages for this is probably mid twenties and up.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** religiously since April 2020, sometimes twice a day.\n\n**My thoughts:** *BLOODY EXCELLENT*. I'm on my second bottle of this. My first bottle was the first listed one (scented) and then they released the unscented one so I bought that! It's incredible. I love it. In my opinion, it's partially why my skin is able to tolerate me using actives so much. It's excellent to use before actives as it doesn't interact with anything and really good to use after an 'active' mask or a clay mask etc. I switched to the unscented one to just reduce the risk of irritation.\n\n*also studies, which I haven't read but have seen derms I trust on insta etc, say that* ***centella can help stimulate/produce collagen... a big yes from me given it's a calming ingredient that shouldn't purge you or break you out*** *(unless you're allergic/sensitive to it)!*\n\n**Smell:** The scented one smells herbaceous (akin to Asian herbal medicine - I don't mind it but others may). The unscented one doesn't really smell like anything / I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** thick/fat/heavy water. Not a watery toner. Enjoyable.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Neverrrrrr, this helps me reduce the side effects from using actives such as retinoids, AHAs, BHAs, etc.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **Yes** & I have. Will probably rebuy for life.\n\n**Ingredients:** 4 variants as they've got the scented and unscented versions, and then those with and without witch hazel\n\nnon-witch hazel unscented version -\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract (strengthens skin barrier), Butylene Glycol (humectants), Pentylene Glycol (skin-conditioning agents), Dipropylene Glycol (humectants), 1,2-Hexanediol (stabilizers), Trehalose (humectants), Sodium Hyaluronate (natural moisturizing factor/ humectants), Hamemelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiaticoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiatic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Madecassic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Panthenol (strengthens skin barrier), Carbomer (viscosity increasing agents), Allantoin (skin protectants), Arginine (skin-conditioning agents), Portulaca Oleracea Extract (skin-conditioning agents), Ethylhexylglycerin (skin-conditioning agents), Disodium EDTA (stabilizers)\n\nI hope these reviews were useful :)",

I would only trust claims I can see after using a product. \n\n\nAs far as I know, topical creams cannot generate collagen production. Collagen is created from the foods you eat. I’m not even sure you can take collagen supplements to increase collagen production because everything in your body is broken down in the same way and your body will direct the amino acids to where the body needs it most and not where you might want it.",

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

I sure hope people are buying it so it doesn't get discontinued. I got it for maybe 6000 KRW for the 50 ml tube and it's such a nice moisturizing vehicle with Tinosorb S and Uvinul A Plus. So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

    "body": "Hey guys! I haven't really heard this product being talked about in here, so I thought I would write a review/first impressions. \n\n**Skin1004 Zombie Pack** (Korean)\n\n\nHi my name is Bluecowboyboots and I am a mask addict. \n\n*hello bluecowboyboots*\n\nI sheet mask daily, I am constantly looking for new sheet masks to try and I scare my boyfriend and dog constantly looking like Jason from Friday the 13th. My bfs nickname for me sometimes is Sheet Mask Monster\n\nHowever, for the past two months I have avoided all wash off masks because I have been repairing my skin that was very dehydrated and irritated. \n\n**BUYING**\n \nAfter reading one of my favorite mask dedicated blogs Maskepedia, I was browsing and came across her [Post](https://maskepedia.com/2017/09/26/review-skin1004-zombie-pack/) on the Skin1004 Zombie Pack. What intrigued me was that it was able to \"diagnose\" your skin (not sure if it is a gimmick or not) and provide instant results.\n \nI freaked!! It looked like a similar mask to [Hanacure](https://www.hanacure.com/products/the-all-in-one-facial-set) that my friends rave about but without the $110 price tag. \nDespite all my friends rave reviews, I couldn't justify spending $110 dollars on a treatment that includes FOUR applications that total to $27.5 Each. \n\nI impulsively bought it on Amazon for $19.98 dollars. It includes 8 treatments (thats $2.50 a treatment. heck yeaah dolla make me holla!) \n\nIt came to my house in two days  *thanks amazon prime/bae* (don't tell my bf) \n\nThe powder consists of nine organic ingredients including albumin, corn powder, aloe berry leafy extract and lavender oil, while the activator contains over 15 ingredients that work mainly on pore tightening and wrinkle care.\n\n\n**FIRST IMPRESSIONS**\n\n\nSkin1004's [website](http://www.skin1004indonesia.com/product/detail/skin1004-zombie-pack-8pack-brush) \nclaims that it is:  \n\nA 8-in-1 full-face TREATMENT MASK : in only 15 minutes, get a facial that\n1. Reduces fine lines and wrinkles,\n2. Visibly lifts up your skin,\n3. Clears small breakouts and acne\n4. Tightens enlarged pores,\n5. Hydrates your skin deeply,\n6. Improves skin texture by gently removing dead cells,\n7. Balances the epidermis pH level,\n8. Brightens your complexion with a \"just-came-out-the-spa\" glow\n\n\nMore claims from [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Skin1004-Zombie-Pack-set-treatments/dp/B06XZV7ZGC/ref=sr_1_3_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1542723676&sr=1-3&keywords=skin1004%2Bzombie%2Bpack&th=1)\n\n\"NO PAIN, NO GAIN! 15 minutes of horror for a 15 years younger-looking skin… doesn’t sound so bad! After mixing the powder and activator, apply the mask on your face and feel it getting to work instantly!\"\n\nPore Tightening: The Zombie Pack will instantly tighten pores for a visible effect. \n \nSkin Lifting: Active ingredients such as Albumin help to instantly lift the skin while Copper Peptide and Rose of Jericho help to strengthen the skin\n\n**MAIN INGREDIENTS**\n\n*Albumin : Known as a component from eggs, this is a protein made of amino acids, and is effective for attracting moisture to the skin - this is great for skin elasticity!*\n \n*Centella Asiatica : Effective for soothing and calming the skin, this ingredient is especially perfect for those with acne prone, or sensitive skin.*\n\n\n**Powder ingredients:**\n\n*Albumen, Zea Mays (Corn) Starch, Silica, Allantoin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Panthenol, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Propolis Extract, Fragrance*\n\n**Activator ingredients:**\n\n*Water, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Niacinamide, Centella Asiatica Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Rosa Centifolia Flower Extract, Hippophae Rhamnoides Extract, Betula Alba Juice, Anastatica Hierochuntica Extract, Adenosine, Allantoin. Panthenol, Copper Tripeptide-1, Glycerin, Sodium PCA, Disodium EDTA, Arnica Montana Flower Extract, Echinacea Angustifolia Extract. Commiphora Mukul Resin Extract*\n\n**COMMENTARY**\n\nThe ingredients really intrigued me, I liked how it contains Centella because my skin LOVES it for my redness. Ingredients like Centalla, Niacinamide and Aloe are pretty high up on the list. \n\nI know many people with sensitive skin can't do fragrance, but weirdly lavender oil has never really bugged my skin. \n\nThe package comes with 8 powder packets (attached together so you can break them off), 8 activator packets (in a sealed bag) and a brush. \n\nThe instructions are to pour the activator in the powder packet and mix it to a liquid consistency. \n\n\n**PRE MASKING :**\n\nMy skin: \n\nIt is almost winter in the midwest and my skin has been very dry, slightly dehydrated and red.  \nMy concerns are : \n\n- Visible pores around my nose \n\n- lots of redness and PIE from hormonal breakouts on my jawline and some of my cheeks. \n\n- forehead wrinkles ( I am 24, and I want to be preventative as well) \n\n- irritation: my skin HATES physical scrubs, clay masks etc \n\n\n**MASKING**\n\nI apply the whole mask over my face per what the directions. I applied a little bit more around my areas of concern (my nose and cheeks and jawline/chin) \n\nThe directions said to wait 15 minutes and leave the mask on for the long TOPS. \n\nI double cleansed my skin and applied the mast. \n\nThe mask kind of smelled like egg, but that didnt really bug me. It was drippy and I accidentally dripped some on my dog (sorry doggo) \n\nFirst few minutes, the mask was starting to dry, i felt no irritated. \n\n5 minutes later - HOLY CRAP my face started to feel tight. I could make NO expression. \n\n10 minutes later - it kind of started to itch a little but I told myself I would stick it for 5 more minutes (no pain no gain amirite?) \n\n15 minutes later - I looked in the mirror, crap. I looked scary. My bf said I looked like I was 88 years old. My face felt tight and frozen. I LOOKED LIKE A ZOMBIE OLD LADY\n\n**DIAGNOSING MY SKIN**\n\nThe website says areas that are bumpy are Areas that lack elasticity, and are prone to wrinkles.\nAreas that are cracked are areas that lack hydration \n\nI thought that I would have bumps on my forehead. But in all actuallity pretty much my whole face was cracked. (SMH -_-) \nThe only areas that were bumpy were my undereye area, temples and my smile lines.\n\nWhat does this tell me? That I need to load up on hydration more (drink a lot more water) and maybe get a better eyecream haha \n\n**DID MY SKIN LIKE IT?**\n\nI washed it off, my skin felt pretty tight. and it was a bit red but ohhh myyyy. My pores looked so much smaller and my skin looked a little bit brighter. \n\nI showered, continued on with my night routine and went to bed. \n\n\nWaking up, my skin looked super smooth, my pores were still small and there was little redness except for a few pimples I had on my jawline. I looked a lot brighter.\n\n\n**MY THOUGHTS**\n\nDo you want to scare your BF or significant other into thinking your age is actually 64 years older than you said. \n\nDo you want all your friends to laugh at a photo you sent them asking \"What is wrong with your face?\" \n\nDo you want your face to look pretty and smooth like an instagram filter the next day? \n\nDo you want to not spend $110 dollars on a Hanacure mask? \n\nIf you answered yes to one of those, this mask is for you! \n\nThe instructions say to do it 3 times a week. but I don't think my sensitive skin will be able to handle that so I will save it for special events or if I am bored and want to spook people. [mwahahaha](https://giphy.com/gifs/planning-happy-gif-evil-plan-14nNwczrhgaQ5G)\n\nOverall id give it a 4/5, I loved the price point, it was fun, and I would deff buy it again but I havent used it enough for HG status. \nI also really liked the brush it came with. \n\nWhere you can buy it :\n\n[Amazon]( https://www.amazon.com/Skin1004-Zombie-Pack-set-treatments/dp/B06XZV7ZGC/ref=sr_1_3_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1542723676&sr=1-3&keywords=skin1004%2Bzombie%2Bpack&th=1) for $19.87 USD \n\n[YessStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/skin-1004-zombie-pack-set-powder-2g-x-8pcs-activator-3-5ml-x-8pcs/info.html/pid.1066657689) for $15.16 USD - It is on sale right now! \n\nI will be posting this review on my Instagram as well: [@lafilledifficile_](https://www.instagram.com/lafilledifficile_/)\n\n\nEDIT : Opps pardon my research but someone last year reviewed the same mask, you can find that review [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/6oxkff/review_skin1004_zombie_pack_korean_special_facial/) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ",

I'm going to use it twice a week and order another box (or 12?).\n\nIt mixed easily, went on nicely with the very satiny brush provided. I did not smell anything, have no idea what others were whining about?!!! I used a hot wet facecloth to reveal what looked like NEW skin. I can't believe it.

I bought it off Amazon and you have to mix a liquid into a powder pod with a brush, lots of mask for my small face so I layer it all on so I don’t waste. The drying part is so uncomfortable, at minute 10 I’m ready to claw my face off. The part where there are bumpy parts and cracked parts are true, interesting to experience where those parts are, somewhat what I expected. \nBUT, your skin looks amazing after, I have dry acne prone skin and it does not irritate it from what I’ve experienced. I wash my face first, apply, rinse off then use a cleansing toner after and apply a face oil before bed. Wake up and skin looks great. Almost as if life’s horrors haven’t aged me an extra 10 years. I use it maybe once a week if I have time, I can see how twice a week would help but for cost and saving money I’m happy with once every 1-2 weeks.",

I'm probably not the only one who has a dog that likes to lick lotion off of me.  \nXylitol is extremely toxic to dogs and also NOT usually found in lotion.   \nThe alternative to the lotion is a set of essential oils, which includes an orange oil. My vet advised me that some citrus oils weren't great for dogs, either (and citrus oils are really bad for cats, too). I emailed FFF because both choices suck if you have four legged friends. \nEdit: I will post their reply here if/when they respond.\n\n-----\n\nFrom [Anthropologie's page](https://www.anthropologie.com/shop/mer-sea-co-body-cream):  \n\n> Water, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Sea Whip Extract, Tocopherol, Sea Salt, Maris Limus (Sea Silt), Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Dicapryl Succinate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Parfum (Fragrance), Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Phytate, **Xylitol**, Glyceryl Stearate, Maltodextrin, Caprylic Acid, Alcohol (Denatured), Sorbic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Benzoic Acid, Dehydoacetic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin\n\n-----\nFrom /u/stereofailureohno, on why Xylitol is added: \n\n> Never in a million years would I have expected to see Xylitol in a body lotion!\nOut of curiosity I looked a little more into it, different sites list it as everything from a moisturizer, humectant, thickeners/emulsifiers, to slip agent. Apparently it does have some merit as a skin care ingredient after all?\nAs a dog and cat owner I am very disappointed that I have no 'good' choice out of these items.\n\n\n",

    "body": "Garmi aaa gayi haiiii\\~ dhoop badh hui hai aur heatwaves pardhaar chuke hai 🥵🥵 obviously we need sunscreens! I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae](https://preview.redd.it/04x8cx1jvsy81.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db29ff28ad9fbcd3ff56a158d60e872ed63cb538)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\nand that's all from my side! I know its not much but then again kangaal haalaat mein kharidaari mushkil hai 💀. anyway, here's a list ss that I do want to try once this lot is finished:\n\n* sunscoop sunscreen serum (only if dermaco doesnt work lmao. really intrigued)\n* Face shop sunscreens (itne variants . ek try karne ka mann hai 😖)\n* beauty of joseon rice ss (stock mein aaja bhai 😫)\n* missha sun aqua gel and essence (bas aise hi lol)\n\nI've also tried the neutrogena ultra sheer, episoft , a few banana boat ones but way long ago so I don't clearly remember them to give the verdict on them. just if I haven't repurchased them, consider that they didn't work well for me.\n\nhope this was informational and you guys enjoyed! if you still have any other questions related to the product above, feel free to comment!",

I read your earlier post on Top 10-20 Cleansing Oils & Gels also. \n\nI'm looking to introduce a new cleanser to my daily routine and was playing with the idea of an oil cleanser.  So much choice, but this should make it easier.  Ideally, I'm looking for something without propylene glycol. butylene glycol, essential oils or added fragrance.  And no parabens - was shocked to see Phytomer still incorporating these!  The ATrue Black Tea Cleanser in your previous post looked interesting; simple list of ingredients, although ironically green tea is the first ingredient in the list, rather than black tea!  Aromatica Orange Cleansing Sherbet looks interesting, as does Clinique - so simple but effective.  Have you any idea what Kakadu (reference Sidmool) means??\n\nWhich do you use incidentally?  You are probably more geared up than most to recommend?  Thanks again.  Bev",

    "body": "So I always thought that ferments were a \"Asian skin care\" thing. But ever since getting some high end Western skin care as gifts, I noticed that many of them actually have a lot of fermented/yeasty ingredients in them.\n\nBut I can't find much on the \\~science\\~ or evidence behind why ferments can be good for your skin. But I also wonder, since ferments aren't really a thing that majority of consumers in the Western market are looking out for (like fragrance, rose water, coconut water, rosehip oil, fruit/veggie extracts that have label/experience appeal, but aren't necessarily good for skin), why would these huge companies bother putting ferments in their expensive skin care if they didn't have evidence that they do SOMETHING?\n\nI especially am curious because AB/Korean beauty are sometimes looked down upon as just being trendy and not using ingredients that are scientifically proven to be truly beneficial for skin.\n\nDo you think ferments are legit? What do they do for YOUR skin? Your fav AB fermented products or ones you are wanting to try?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are some of the leave-on skin care from [Sephora's \"Best Selling\" skin

        "body": "I actually wrote a literature review on fermented skincare at my university for an assignment and I know Gothamista on YouTube did a video on it also! Fermenting antioxidant rich ingredients such as ginseng, green tea etc. breaks down the antioxidants/complex molecules that are beneficial to our skin into smaller molecules, which allows it to be absorbed into the skin easily. Not only that, yeast/bacteria ferments produce additional metabolites (AHAs, peptides) that provide additional benefits such as whitening, hydration, skin repair, you name it!\n\nEdit: forgot to put my favorite fermented product!! I love the Manyo Factory Galactomyces Niacin Special treatment. :) \n\n2nd Edit: here are the links to some scientific literature articles on fermented cosmetics which were found through PubMed! You do need access to the database if you want to read them in its entirety, but you can get some brief information on the topic just through the abstract.\n\nFermenting red ginseng enhances its safety and efficacy as a novel skin care anti-aging ingredient: in vitro and animal study.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23126662\n \nEvaluation of tyrosinase inhibitory and antioxidant activities of Angelica dahurica root extracts for four different probiotic bacteria fermentations.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254340\n\nSkin resistance to UVB-induced oxidative stress and hyperpigmentation by the topical use of Lactobacillus helveticus NS8-fermented milk supernatant.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28598022\n\nBifidobacterium-fermented soy milk extract stimulates hyaluronic acid production in human skin cells and hairless mouse skin.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12637786",

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F18 (umar badh gayi but dimaag nahi 💀)**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , acne (pustules, fungal and cystic) pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae ](https://preview.redd.it/fnjipguox9ma1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d880ff6b482ade3f03237375ef02cdd64fb4e3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol.

I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl  Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise!

I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a  fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\n* **The Derma Co.** **1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum** \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\]\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 30 ml (bought from amazon)\n\n**For skin type** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid. fragrance free. really watery and leaves a dewy-shiny finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredient list** : Purified Water, Glycerin, Avena Strigosa Seed Extract, Lecithin, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Silica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Decyl Glucoside, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7 & Disodium EDTA.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was....okay-ish? idk but I was really excited for this since their HA sun gel is one of my HGs. This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less 😖 if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would  get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation.

I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop 😭. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :(  but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nupdate : this ones a hard no for me. is it calming? yes. but the whitecast is too much. and when i sweat it literally looks like I'm secreting milk from my skin  (~~nipple)😭😭~~\n\n**rating** : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/​PPG-10/​1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is 🔥🔥🔥. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool 🤤 only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure! in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty 😖 I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao 😌 so you can guess I go out a lot heheh.

I used it as a body stick most of the time with how oily this was. but can be used by anyone ig\n\n**texture and appearance** : whitish yellow stick. has a fruity kind of smell. really oily and greasy on first application that doesn't absorb or goes away after a while.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Polyethylene, Isohexadecane, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Ozokerite, Paraffin, Synthetic Beeswax, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Neopentyl Glycol Diisostearate, Dimethicone, Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Fragrance, BHT\n\n**filters** :\n\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n\noof this was an impulse purchase that I regretted later on. mind you, this is a great sunstick for your body but definitely not for your face . not to mention its waterproof . but the tapti garmi really just melts everything in its way and this is no exception. bhai itna chip chipa lagta hai i dont even feel like putting this on just because of the MoIsT feeling it gives. unless you're going to a pool or beach (as it suggests duh) , if you're okay with feeling like [that peanut butter baby](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.ie%2Flife%2Ffamily%2Fthis-peanut-butter-baby-is-sure-to-brighten-up-your-day-31499579.html&psig=AOvVaw0Qc7SXcD436wP5Ywrn_yJv&ust=1678212392776000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCIDzt77yx_0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) , then you can give it a try. it  does provide a good amount of product for the price and is a solid waterproof one fosho. but nahi jhela jata for some reason 😣😣😫\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\nme after buying and trying all of these to find my HG\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zzjpjrbly9ma1.gif\n\nbut it was fun doing this in a span of a few years and I finally got one that fits all my boxes . the BOJ one is seriously godsent for me ✨✨~~lets just ignore that it makes my wallet cry every time I buy it .~~ But id rather spend more on stuff that works than just hit and trials lmao. also I've gone past my obsession on using sun sticks as a whole since they require quite a lot of pressing while applying and the application just irritates my acne a lot 😫 imma finish the ones I have but I have no intentions on buying anymore from any brands (even though the minimalist and earth rhythm ones look good 🤡)more reviews to come! ill be doing one on stuff my dad will be bringing from the U.S in the next few weeks so do let me know if you'd like a follow up on those too! (~~why do i treat my posts like a sitcom😭).~~  and as always, any other questions, comments are always welcomed and so are dms!\n\nbyeeee 💖💖",

        "body": "also my post exceeded the word limit so here's some more lmao :\n\n   \n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF      50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n   \n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte      Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable      UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB      filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV      filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB      mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change",

Hopefully it'll work as good if not better but it's still a huge bummer to lose Naturals and not have the newer product available yet. :(\n\nEDIT: I found ingredient lists for both conditioners a few minutes ago and they definitely aren't the same.

Apart from some Neutrogena products and No7 Beautiful Skin Blemish Defence Serum, they contain \"alcohol denat.\", which is a dealbreaker for me as I try to avoid drying alcohols as much as I can. \n\nBHAs are few and very far in between, in addition to not being labelled as such and most probably without the percentage of salicylic acid contained or whether it's in the right pH to be effective. \n\nI haven't done a price comparison, and since I found them in Boots I've used the online site's price point. Prices are only as a guide, they may be cheaper/more expensive elsewhere. Ingredients are highlighted to point out the position of salicylic acid, as well as presence of drying alcohols and parfum for those irritated by them. \n\nAdditional suggestions, opinions and reviews are very welcome!\n\n* PRODUCT: Boots Skin Clear Deep Blackhead Cleansing Lotion\n\nPRICE: £2.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua (Water), **Alcohol denat.**, **Salicylic acid**, PPG-1-PEG-9 lauryl glycol ether, Butylene glycol, Potassium hydroxide, Ammonium glycyrrhizate, **Parfum (Fragrance)**, Dipropylene glycol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Deep Cleansing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.29 for 65 exfoliating pads\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat., Salicylic Acid,** Isoceteth-20, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Hydroxide, Triethanolamine, Allantoin, **Parfum**, **Menthol**, Benzyl Salicylate, Disodium EDTA, Limonene, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Pads\n\nPRICE: 5.39 for 65 pads\n\nINGREDIENTS:Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, **Salicylic Acid**, Hydrogen Peroxide, **Parfum**, Sodium Hydroxide, Dextrin, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben.\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Superfruits Refreshing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.07\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, Glycerin, **Salicylic Acid**, **Parfum**, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Sodium Hydroxide, Propylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Citric Acid, Limonene, Citronellol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Hexyl Cinnamal, Rubus Idaeus Juice, Trideceth-9, Vaccinium Macrocarpon Fruit Juice, Geraniol, Bisabolol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Garnier Pure Active line (various)\n\nPRICE: from £4.99 to £7.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: I can't find an ingredients list anywhere, which is frustrating but as a guide, I remember putting all the Garnier products down because they contain \"Alcohol Denat.\" The packaging lists 2% salicylic acid.

While I could see the improvements, it would feel like my skin was burning. I'm not sure if it's due to the age of the bottle, or just the ingredients, but I discontinued use.\n\nThen I bought *Boots Skin Clear Deep Cleansing Lotion* which is exactly the same as the Blackhead version just with an extra word on the front. It feels just like[ L'Occitaine's Shea Butter Toner](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8adf20777.html) that's alcohol free, but a month in and I don't really feel like it's doing anything.\n\nI used to use Neutrogena a lot and I really liked their grapefruit range, but the *Neutrogena VISIBLY CLEAR Pink Grapefruit Oil-Free Moisturiser* stopped being effective far too quickly. It goes on really light which I like, but after a while my skin either feels dry, or really oily.

    "body": "I previously posted this post on Reddit however it was removed due to being a link to my blog post. That link on Reddit is http://redd.it/1zwi7x\n\nSo long story short. Ipsy sent out a mini (deluxe size) gloss from POP Beauty called PLUMP POUT. It was sent out in Peony Petal and Fuchsia Freesia. Unfortunately there was a manufacturing issue, which POP Beauty claims was a flavor ingredient having been left out.  This may not be the case as people have reported on various social media sites that within days of using the product their lips have been raw, sore, cracked, blistered, red or developed a rash around their mouth. Ipsy has also stated to subscribers, via email, that the glosses are safe. \n\nDue to the fact that the ingredients in the gloss is NOT what's listed on the website OR on the shrink wrap the product is essentially misbranded which violates US FDA laws and regulations. \n\nFrom the FDA \nhttp://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm241820.htm\n\nWhat to Report\n\n<i>Katz says consumers should contact FDA if they experience a rash, hair loss, infection, or other problem—even if they didn’t follow product directions. FDA also wants to know if a product has a bad smell or unusual color—which could signal contamination—or if the item’s label is incomplete or inaccurate.\n\nIf you have any concerns about a cosmetic, contact MedWatch, FDA’s problem-reporting program, on the Web or at 1-800-332-1088; or contact the consumer complaint coordinator in your area.\n\nWhen a consumer report is received, FDA enters the information into a database of negative reactions. Experts then look for reports related to the same product or similar ones. FDA scientists will use the information to determine if the product has a history of problems and represents a public health concern that needs to be addressed.\n\nIf you file a consumer report, your identity will remain confidential.<i>\n\n<i>\"Cosmetics are usually safe, but when they aren't, consumer reporting is essential so FDA can take action when appropriate,” Katz says. Those actions could—depending upon the product and the problem—range from issuing a consumer safety advisory to taking legal action.</i>\n\nIf you received a POP Beauty Plump Pout mini from Ipsy PLEASE report it to the FDA. POP Beauty has continued to delete comments from people regarding their reactions to the gloss. There have been many people posting pictures of their lips and you can see that they did not experience a normal \"allergic reaction\" but something more serious. At this time there is no way for anyone to say the gloss is safe or not safe because no one knows for sure but it's best to discontinue using it until POP Beauty can PROVE it's safe by having an independent lab test the minis from Ipsy.\n\nIpsy has no plans on making any public announcement on the matter so please pass the word to anyone you know who has the mini gloss that it's potentially not safe.\n\nThe ingredients in the minis are NOT the same as the full size. Until yesterday the ingredients on Ipsy and POP Beauty were completely different than what's on the actual full size packaging and mini packaging. \n\nHere's what's now on the POP Beauty site in regard to the full size ingredients (this now matches what's on the packaging of the full size):\n\nHydrogenated Polyisobutene (and) Ethylene / Propylene / Styrene Copolymer (and) Butylene / Ethylene / Styrene Copolymer, Mineral Oil, Polybutene, Beeswax, Copernica Cerifera (Carnouba) Wax, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate (and) Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (and) Stearalkonium Hectorite (and) Palmitoyl Hexapeptide-12, Ethylhexyl Palmitate / Tribehenin Sorbitan Isostearate / Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Benzyl Nicotinate, Persea Gratissima (Avocado Oil), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin-E), Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Almond) Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia Extract / Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (Lavender Butter), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba Seed) Oil, Mangifera Indica Seed Butter (Mango Butter), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Fragrance. [+/- Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI 77492, CI 77499), Red 7 Lake (CI 15850), Yellow 5 Lake (CI 19140), Red 33 Lake (CI 17200)]. \n\nFrom Ipsy's site - the ingredients to the mini glosses.\n\nFuchsia Freesia: mineral oil, polyisobutylene, beeswax, disosteary malate, silica, ethyl hexyl palmitate, caprylic/capric triglyceride, ethylheyxl palmitate, silica dimethyl siliate, butylene glycol, pentylene glycol, sodium, hyaluronate, caprylyl glycol, hexylene glycol, phenoxyetharol, simmondsia chinensis(jojoba) seed oil, tocopherl acetate, sambucus nigra fruit extract, fragrance [+/- iron oxides (cl 77491, cl 77492, cl 77499), titanium dioxide (cl 77891), yellow 5 lake (cl 19140:1), red 6 lake (cl 15850:2) red 7 Lake (cl 15850:1)]\n\nPeony Petal: mineral oil, polyisobutylene, beeswax, disosteary malate, silica, ethyl hexyl palmitate, caprylic/capric triglyceride, ethylheyxl palmitate, silica dimethyl siliate, butylene glycol, pentylene glycol, sodium, hyaluronate, caprylyl glycol, hexylene glycol, phenoxyetharol, simmondsia chinensis(jojoba) seed oil, tocopherl acetate, sambucus nigra fruit extract, fragrance [+/- iron oxides (cl 77491, cl 77492, cl 77499), titanium dioxide (cl 77891), yellow 5 lake (cl 19140:1), red 6 lake (cl 15850:2) red 7 Lake (cl 15850:1)]\n\nAlso note that the full size is made in the US, the minis in Taiwan.\n\nIf your lips or mouth area has developed any type of rash, redness, sores or any negative experiences PLEASE report it to the FDA and if you're in Canada to Health Canada and your country's import regulators. The bottom line is they know there was a manufacturing problem but refuse to acknowledge that there was something more serious than a single flavor ingredient having been left out. The products could potentially be contaminated or have totally different ingredients than what's on the label.\n \nTo report the matter to the FDA visit: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/\n\n",

        "body": "I know I am defnitely in the minority here, but I think this has been completely blown out of porportion.\n\nYou are paying for a beauty bag to try out products you wouldn't normally try, or may have never heard before. That doesn't mean you will like all of them- to think you will is silly. ~~Its why the bag is cheap.~~\n\nI understand that some people may not have appreciated the smell of the POP product, but it is disappointing to see everyone jump on the \"lets hate POP and IPSY and M. Phan\" bandwagon because POP made a flavoring mistake- and then everyone feels they deserve more free products because it smells weird (some people are now upset they didn't get TWO replacement products instead of just one) **If the product actually caused you significant harm, I understand wanting a replacement or new product- but because it smelled funny?**\n\n~~Its a cheap beauty bag for a reason~~- you aren't going to like all of the products. I don't think raising pitchforks, complaining on every single POP and IPSY networking website, and contacting the FDA **when nothing harmed you** is worth it- especially for a ~~10 dollar~~ bag where you know you aren't going to like everything.\n\n\nWhether or not the full size and sample size version of the products are the same is completely irrelevant here- other than the fact that the mini is missing a flavoring ingredient. The fact that the minis are made in Taiwan is irrelevant. I think the mob mentality needs to calm down.\n\n_________________________\nEDIT: The pricing isn't the point I am making, here.\n\n________________________\n\n(pasted from lower comments) \n\n\nYes, I did receive a strange smelling gloss. I, too, was also concerned at first- and I did my share of research, and looked up reviews on the normal size and saw that the harsh chemical smell is present in the normal versions as well.\n\n**Again, I am not saying to not contact the FDA if you actually had physical harm from the product.**\n\nBut, again, I must state that I am very against the mob mentality and the pitchforking- especially if absolutely nothing has come from the lipgloss other than a \"strange smell\" to you personally. Just because a few people reacted to the product does not mean we all need to call the FDA.\n\nSure, some people reacted to the product. It does have irritating ingredients, it is a plumper after all- and sometimes this does happen. But it wasn't a huge, wide spread disaster. Many fda cosmetic products irritate people's skin or leave rashes.\n\nAnd its strange to me that people would actually think that POP (or any company) would pretend an item wasn't toxic if it actually was, and tell its customers it was safe if it wasn't. A voluntary recall would be far better for their sales and keeping their customers than an outright lie. Why would they pretend? They have no reason to as far as sales go, or customers. For some reason people just NEED to believe its something bigger than that, and blow this thing out of proportion. \n\nI am not one to play the \"what if\" or conspiracy game. They said it was safe, Ipsy said it was safe, and it did not affect me in any negative way (other than an odd smell.) I am not going to pretend to be an expert scientist in cosmetics- that is their job.",

POP Beauty will be releasing a statement on the matter with the Plump Pouts. What it will contain I do not know. Hopefully, as I replied to her email, a statement acknowledging something went wrong in the manufacturing process, discontinue using the minis until they know for sure if the products are safe. That, as I told her, is my primary goal.\n\n>Years ago, and some of you know this from past posts of mine, I had a bad contact lens fit by an optician which resulted in permanent damage to my eyes. My right eye has a \"tear shape\" growth at the back which my last Ophthalmologist said is permanent and that it must be monitored over the years. I am not a candidate for laser surgery to correct my vision (I'm nearsighted with an acute astigmatism) and laser may not correct the growth issue.\n\n>This plus other things that have happened to me over the years causes me to be very vocal when it comes to safety concerns. I do not want to see other people harmed by something that can be easily avoided. In this case simply stating \"don't use the product until we know for sure\" is what I want to see happen.\n\n>I like the full size Plump Pout. It smells like a vanilla cupcake. It's a beautiful color and had the minis been like the full size in the first place I would have most likely bought more of those Plump Pouts. But I've said it over and over, something went horribly wrong with those minis to smell so acrid and for people to experience such adverse reactions such as cracked lips, rashes around the mouth, redness and soreness.\n\n>Once POP Beauty has released the press release or make a statement I'll share it plus give you my thoughts on the matter then.",

I may or may not have been keeping a weather eye on upcoming SPF releases ever since Director Ahn In-Sook mentioned in passing in a video that many cosmeceutical brands have either put a stopper on releasing new sunscreens or postponed the release of those awaiting completion to better the formula and ensure they're up to snuff, thus there will be a slew of SPF releases come March. ~~Heaven forfend we suffer the wrath of deadly solar lasers cuz finding The One is nothing short of a bluidy struggle.~~\n\nWhat I've noted in these new releases was a combination of robust formulas and new filters. *Exciting!* I've already translated the INCI lists and entered them into Incidecoder & Cosdna. Okay, enuff intro. Have a look-see at some of the freshest sun armours to keep safe from baneful UV rays.\n\n(Links to show product specs, ~~no affiliates no sirree, s'all SK retailers/official

I'm pretty sure these are all  the same base sunscreen with the same protection. I would get the sunscreen with the simplest ingredient list and whichever one is cheapest. The About Me Be Clean seems to be alcohol and fragrance-free (non sure if rosemary leaf oil is an essential oil and fragrant??). I would probably go with the Innifree though because I prefer alcohol in my sunscreen, otherwise they are too too dewy and greasy looking, and the ingredient list is rather simple. If only it didn't have fragrance, but I can compromise with that. The Dr. G has too many unnecessary ingredients and many comedogenic ingredients like myristic acid, so I would stay away from it.",

    "body": "Nitong nakaraang mga araw may isang Tiktok content creator ang inulan ng comments sa kanyang Tiktok page dahil diumano sa hindi magandang paraan o istilo ng pagrereview ng sunscreen na ito. Dahil dito , naisipan kong bilhin at subukan itong sunscreen na ito. \n\nUna sa lahat, binili ko itong sunscreen na ito sa tingin kong official store nitong Worada sunscreen na ito. Ito yung store na may Worada din sa pangalan. Dito din sa store na ito binili nung content creator na binanggit ko kanina. Yung B1T1 na yung binili ko, yung isa sa usage test, yung isa naman e sa gagawin kong test sa lab. May kasama din pala itong freebie na Whitening Antiperspirant and Deodorant Cream (isusunod ko itong i-review). \n\nSimulan ko muna sa packaging. Yung packaging nito ay 50 g Cosmetic Pouch with spout. Ito ay gawa sa BOPP/VMPET/LLDPE/Aluminum Foil na sinadya para maprotektahan ng husto ang laman na sunscreen. Ito yung isa sa mga usual na material na ginagamit sa paggawa ng mga cosmetic pouch. Makikita din sa packaging na gawa pala ang Worada Sunscreen sa China. \n\nHindi ko nakita sa packaging ng sunscreen na ito yung mandatory warning para sa mga sunscreen na dapat present sa mga sunscreen products na binebenta sa ASEAN: Do not stay too long under the sun, even when using a cosmetic product. \n\nSa paggamit naman. Pagkabukas ko pa lang ng sachet nitong Worada sunscreen, naamoy ko na agad yung fragrance nito. Amoy milky floral ang fragrance na ginamit dito. Ang laman na sunscreen ay isang cream na off-white na may hint ng dilaw ang kulay (mas maputi ng kaunti sa evap na gatas). Kapag inilagay na sa daliri, nagbe-break na agad ang emulsion at nagiging matubig o runny, kagaya nung sa video review. Noong ipinahid ko ang 2-finger lengths nitong sunscreen, una kong napansin e masyadong maputi yung sunscreen para sa skin tone ko. Tinagalan ko na ang pagbe-blend nito sa buong mukha at leeg ko, pero sa huli halata pa din ang whitecast. Nasabihan pa nga ako ng kasama ko sa lab na nagsusumigaw yung sunscreen ko sa mukha. \n\nNgayon sa ingredients naman. Ito ang ingredients nitong Worada sunscreen:\n\nMilk, Aqua, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Titanium Dioxide, Glycereth-26, Potassium Laurel Phosphate, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Isohexadecane, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polysorbate-80, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Niacinamide, Trehalose, Tocopheryl Acetate, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA, Parfum\n\nUnahin na natin ang UV-Filters. May tatlo na UV-Filters ang Worada Sunscreen:\n\n* Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (UVB) \n\n* Ethylhexyl Salicylate (UVB) \n\n* Titanium Dioxide (UVB) \n\nBabalikan ko ito mamaya para mai-relate sa product claim nitong sunscreen. \n\nAng pinakaunang ingredient sa IL nito ay Milk. Maling entry na naman. Lac (Milk) ang tamang INCI name kung naglagay ng gatas as ingredient. \n\nRelated naman ang gatas sa susunod kong punto. Gumamit ng Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, at Propylparaben itong sunscreen na ito bilang preservative system. Angkop itong preservative system na ito, dahil ang taas ng ginamit na Milk sa formulation na ito. Nararapat lang na broad spectrum preservative system ang gamitin. \n\nPreservative Efficacy:\n\nParabens: Yeast and molds; Gram(+) bacteria\n\nPhenoxyethanol: Yeast and molds; Gram(-) bacteria\n\nRegarding sa safety ng parabens (methyl, propyl), approved for use pa yan ng regulatory bodies ng ASEAN at EU, basta masunod lang ang maximum allowed concentration. Pakitingnan na lang sa pic yung statement ng SCCS, ang committee na inaatasan ng EU na magsagawa ng safety assessments ng mga ingredients kagaya ng parabens. Pero kung isa ka sa mga nakakaranas ng contact dermatitis dahil sa pagiging sensitive ng iyong balat sa parabens, mabuting iwasan na lang ang mga produktong gumagamit nitong mga preservatives na ito. \n\nSunod, may laman naman itong mga ingredients na moisturizing sa balat: \n\n* Glycerin (humectant) \n\n* Trehalose (humectant) \n\nPara naman sa whitening:\n* Milk\n\n* Niacinamide\n\nMay antioxidant din: Tocopheryl Acetate\n\nSunod nating tingnan ang product claims ng Worada sunscreen:\n\n* SPF 60 PA+++ UVA-UVB Protection\n\n* Invisible\n\n* Waterproof\n\n* Sweat Resistant\n\n* Lsolate Skin (nasa harap, di ko naintindihan kung anuman ito) \n\n* Whitening\n\n* Moisturizing\n\nSa SPF claim, hindi ko mawari kung papaano nasabi ng brand na ito na may UVA protection ito, samantalang yung tatlong UV-filter nito e puro UVB protection ang kayang ibigay. Dagdag pa, wala pa akong nakikitang SPF test report para sa Worada sunscreen na ipinakita ng brand owner sa kanilang soc med accounts. Kung meron man, makikicomment na lang sa baba. \n\nSa claim na invisible, hindi naman invisible e. Kitang kitanang white cast e. \n\nSa water proof claim, hindi pwede ang water proof claim. Water resistance ang tamang ilagay jan. At kailangang may patunay na tinest ito, kesyo ito ay 40 min or 80 min water resistance. Ganoon din sa sweat resistance. May test din para jan, either 40 min o 80 min, kagaya ng water resistance. \n\nYung Lsolate Skin na claim na nasa harapan, malay ko jan. Kailangang i-clarify ng brand owner yan. \n\nSa claim na moisturizing at whitening, meron namang ingredients na laman ang sunscreen para masabi kahit papano na pasok ang claim nila. Ang concern ko lang e yung paggamit ng Milk. Matumal ang mga studies kung sa nakakapagpaputi ang gatas. Tapos, takaw-mikrobyo pa yan. Mabuti na nga lang, ginamitan ng broad spectrum preservative system. Pero kung mahina ang preservative system nito, madaling masisira ang product na ito. \n\nFinal words:\n\nMarami akong concerns na nakita sa product na ito. Una na jan yung kung SPF-tested ba talaga ito. Pangalawa yung claim na may UVA protection, pero malabo base sa mga UV filters na ginamit. Ikatlo, yung mga unallowed (water proof) at unsupported (water resistant at sweat resistant) claims. Yang tatlo na yan, major red flags na agad dahil hindi tama na magki-claim para sa product na hindi pa naman nagtetest. Palaging tandaan, sa mga product claims, laging dapat may kaakibat yan na substantiation. Kasi napakadali gumawa ng product claims, ang mahirap e patunayan kung tunay ba talaga yan. Performance-wise, hindi para sa akin itong sunscreen na ito, dahil ayoko ng whitecast. \n\nAbangan ang Part 2 para sa mga isasagawa kong mga test sa lab. \n\nAyun lang. Salamat sa pagbasa. \n",

Since bihira lang ako makakita ng Filipino chemists online, I usually just end up watching people like Lab Muffin. Kaya ang saya na may mga katulad niyo na nagpo-pop up lately! \n\nThanks for the detailed info—honestly, nakakainis yung mga locals online na nagkakalat ng misinformation or kulang sa research, so seeing someone credible like you is really refreshing. I hope you consider uploading videos on TikTok or any video platform, too! Would love to see your reviews, tests, and opinions reach a larger audience. That’s all.

Just because it takes the # of reviews into account. You can find lots of good reviews vouching for very good products with lesser amount of reviews. It doesn't necessarily mean that just because a product is extremely popular, there can't be lesser known amazing products as well. For some categories, like toners and creams, I feel that it's worth to look all the way down towards the 40s and 50s. I think I will make certain categories longer if you guys don't mind my spamming, lol.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm thinking doing creams or gels next. =) Thank you everybody for the comments, glad to see the time I spent making these posts is helping some of you!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Oils & Gels](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6dqq7/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing_oils_gels/)\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Balms/Milks/Creams & Foams](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6fso3/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing/)",

    "body": "My foray into skincare began around July last year when I decided I wasn't happy with my skin and wanted to do something about it. Initially I researched foundations, but none of the products I tried evened my skin to my satisfaction, which is when I found /r/SkincareAddiction. Here, I learned that my skin was dehydrated, more than likely due to using Dove bar soap and BP on my face and zero moisturizer every day. :) My skin has changed so much since I started and I am finally ready to review some products I have been using and maybe help others find their way.  \n**Disclaimer** This is my first Reddit text post, I'm really hoping the formatting turns out the way I anticipated.  \n\n**Where we started:**  \n* 25/F/FL; combo/oily dehydrated skin with mild acne, some PIE, sporadic CCs and occasionally painful nodules usually on my forehead, chin, or temples. Noteworthy: I have been on oral contraceptives since I was a teenager and switched to Skyla in 2015. I don't believe my acne is hormonal, but since I've always had some sort of hormonal birth control it's hard to tell how much it has affected my skin.  \n\n\n* No real routine, just washing my face with bar soap in the (scalding hot) shower, using a Neutrogena BP mask to annihilate acne. I was under the (false) impression that since my face was oily I certainly wouldn't want to add moisturizer!  \n\n\n* Mostly concerned with the nodules I was getting because they were big and painful and took forever to heal. Admittedly, I am a skin picker and just recently I realized this is probably the cause of the nodules because the two that I have dealt with recently developed in spots that I had messed with just a few days before.  \n\n\n**Level one: Build a routine.**  \n* At this point, I read everything. EVERYTHING. I spent a couple of months just researching products, learning about skin types, and poring through threads on SCA. I put down the BP mask and bought Neutrogena foaming face wash and CeraVe PM. This was around September when Irma hit and I was without power for a few days, but still managed to keep my fledgling routine. \\o/\n\n* Unfortunately, I felt that CeraVe PM was contributing to a new outbreak of whiteheads around my mouth, where I don't normally get whiteheads. I wound up replacing it with Peach Slices Citrus Honey Aqua Glow which I LOVE. More on that later.\n\n* I also incorporated Neutrogena Sheer Touch sunscreen around this time, but that gave me small breakouts as well and I just didn't like the way that it sat on my skin so I decided to put sunscreen on hold while I did more research.\n\n* While incorporating these products into my routine I tried my best to follow SCA's advice and start slow, one product at a time, and patch test first. I don't really feel that patch testing helped me determine if a product would break me out, as I wouldn't notice any difference in the area I patch tested but then within a few days of trying a new product on my whole face I would see an increase in whiteheads in strange areas. It sucked, but it's alright since the breakouts were mild and didn't take long to appear so I knew fairly quickly that a product wasn't working for me. I still recommend patch testing for sensitivity purposes.\n\n**Level 2: Sunscreen and acids.**  \n* Finally, after months of reading, I felt ready to take on an acid. I settled on CosRX BHA Blackhead Power liquid because it was purportedly more mild (and less expensive!) than other options and I felt that I should start gentle. I picked this up from Ulta in early December and used it every three days for 4 weeks. During that period I don't feel like I had a purge; I kind of expected my acne to go into overdrive but it didn't really get any worse. After the 4 weeks I started using it MWF. \n\n* I also bought Skinfood's Aloe Watery Sun Water Gel from Amazon, but shipping took about a month so I was able to incorporate it well after the BHA.\n\n**Level 3: Skincare God.**  \n* *Just kidding.* So here we are in mid April and I have repurchased the Neutrogena cleanser once (although I switched to hydrating instead of foaming), Peach Slices moisturizer three (!!!) times, Skinfood sunscreen once, and am 1/3 of the way through the CosRX BHA. Let me tell you, I am SO much happier with my skin. \n\n* My skin is more bright and even and I have had much fewer blemishes than I used to, which I would attribute equally to a marked decrease in picking. Taking better care of my skin and working towards a goal makes it easier to keep myself from messing up my progress, although I still have setbacks during times when I am very stressed out, but I try not to let that discourage me.\n\n* Oil production WAS down, but a couple of weeks ago I tried to incorporate Cosrx Ultimate Moisturizing Honey Overnight Mask at night for added hydration, but it wound up drying me out? Additionally, I am running dangerously low on Peach Slices Moisturizer and could not find it at any of my local CVS locations so I have been rationing it while I wait for more to come in the mail. :'( \n\n* From here, I want to try to find a more hydrating cream for nighttime and an easily accessible drugstore sunscreen because currently it takes the Skinfood 2-4 weeks to come in so I have to make sure I order it in advance. I also REALLY want to try Krave Beauty Kale-lalu-yAHA, but I am waiting until I get back from vacation next month before I incorporate a new exfoliant. Finally, someone talk me out of buying something from the Dr Jart Cicapair line because I'm not quite sure what it's for but I really want it.\n\nI hope this will be helpful for those still figuring out what works for their skin, as I know I felt completely overwhelmed when I first started. I am still interested in experimenting with new products but I feel that I have a really solid routine as it is so I am content to wait until I am in a better situation financially to mix things up.\n\n**Current routine**  \nAM: splash with water  \nPeach Slices moisturizer  \nSkinfood sunscreen  \n\nPM: cleanse with Neutrogena  \nCosRX BHA MWF  \nPeach Slices moisturizer  \nSometimes a sheet mask when I'm feeling fancy (I really like Ariul Seven Days masks)  \nVaseline (not so much lately after I read a thread here about Vaseline potentially trapping bacteria if your face isn't cleansed properly)\n\n**Reviews**  \n* Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser: Not much to say here, but from what I have read that is good to say about a cleanser. It took a little time to get used to not having that tight, \"squeaky clean\" feeling that I got using the foaming cleanser, but ultimately I think this has been better for my skin. I have had my eye on Glossier's Milky Jelly cleanser for MONTHS but I can't bring myself to buy it when I am pretty satisfied with how this has been for my skin.\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Glucoside, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol*\n\n* Peach Slices Citrus Honey Aqua Glow: Light gel formula, sinks into my skin really well. I am still a bit oily toward the end of the day, but I have kind of resigned myself to the fact that that may not fully go away. Maybe when I start incorporating a more hydrating night cream it will help. Either way the slight oil doesn't bother me much and I really like this moisturizer.\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Polysorbate 60, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Honey Extract, Ceramide NP, Sorbitan Stearate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Isohexadecane, Tromethamine, Hydroxyacetophenone, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Polysorbate 80, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitan Oleate, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Oil, Disodium EDTA, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Butylene Glycol, Bixa Orellana Seed Oil, Tocopherol*\n\n* Skinfood Aloe Watery Sun Water Gel 50+ PA+++: Very happy with this sunscreen, although the oil control is hit or miss. Some days when I apply it after moisturizer it has a nice, almost powdery finish and I forget it's even there. Some days I'm more oily but I'm still figuring out what the cause of that might be. I don't wear foundation so I can't speak to how this sits under makeup but I do wear a little blush and I can still see it at the end of the day. When I apply it I pat it around my face and then rub it in, there is a slight white cast at first but for me it disappears very quickly, however, I am fair skinned.\n\n*Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Octyl Methoxycinnamate, Octyl Salicylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Peg/Ppg-10/1 Dimethicone, Lauryl Peg-9 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Stearalkonium Hectorite, Titanium Dioxide, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Propylene Carbonate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Fragrance, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Tocopherol*\n\n* CosRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid: I use three pumps MWF and occasionally a tiny amount to spot treat nodules. Overall I feel like it helps existing acne heal more quickly and keeps it from getting to that huge, inflammatory state. It applies and dries down very nicely and I typically wait 15-20 minutes after application to apply moisturizer. I didn't realize until recently that it has niacinamide, which I had thought didn't agree with my skin because it was also in CeraVe PM, but I think it has really helped lighten my PIE, particularly a spot on my forehead that I really went to town on last year and it was a pain in the ass to heal.\n\n*Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Water, Butylene Glycol, Betaine Salicylate, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Arginine, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol*\n\n**Links that I found helpful along the way**  \n[Try a gentle hydrating cleanser -- even if you have oily skin.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/7j6juf/psa_try_a_gentle_hydrating_cleanser_even_if_you/)\n\n[Routines which involve inadequate cleansing, high moisture, and heavy occlusion are risky...](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/86twai/psa_routines_which_involve_inadequate_cleansing/)",

Since I have acne-prone skin, the ingredient list scared me a little at first. The texture of the product is definitely very, very light, you don't even feel it on your face. The product is absorbed into the face very quickly, but after a while there is a slight oily feeling when you touch your skin. That's why I don't know if someone with very oily skin can like this product. I think that moisturizing is not enough for dry skin. When I started using Differin, I had to apply this product in several layers because differin dried out my skin, and I was still getting flaky places on my face. There are too many extracts on the ingredient list, some of which can cause fungal acne and clogged pores. \n\nAs a result, I think combination skins would like this product. If you have oily skin, I think you can use it in winter. Its performance under makeup, on the other hand, was not very good. That greasy feeling if you use a shiny bb cream or foundation, it reduces its concealing and creates an oily appearance rather than a glowy appearance. I don't think I will buy the product again. The size is 110ml and I think it's too big to finish in 6-12 months. I don't think it provides an extra benefit to my skin. It was an ordinary moisturizer for me. If you have also used it, please write down your reviews!!",

    "body": "Hello everyone, I’m a long-time lurker and first-time poster on this sub.\n\nI’m 29(F) and my skin type is fucked up (dry cheeks, oily T-zone, with a recent bout of hormonal acne along cheekbones and jawline).\n\nI use Epiduo that has adapalene (0.1% w/w) + benzoyl Peroxide (2.5% w/w) and Glyco-12 cream (glycolic acid 12%) in my PM routine (alternatively, with a break day in between each treatment). In the AM, I finish up my skincare routine with Re'equil Ultra Matte Dry Touch Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA++++ and touch up with a sunscreen stick every two hours or so (I go over the same area 3-4 times with the stick for optimum protection).\n\nLike most people, I struggle with sunscreen reapplication because, honestly, it’s a pain in the ass. I’d rather put it on once in the morning and then forget about it for the rest of the day. However, as I’m currently battling hormonal acne and PIH brought on by PCOS and the fact that I stopped taking oral birth control pills, I’ve been subjecting my face to some pretty strong actives like adapalene and glycolic acid. And, I’ve also recently had some warts removed from around my eyes and on my neck via cauterization. Given these treatments and because I spend a lot of time outdoors, I knew I had to become more diligent with sunscreen reapplication to prevent sun-related hyperpigmentation. And since I’m lazy af and don’t like touching my face often, I turned to sunscreen sticks. Please note that I do not know much about the ingredients, but have listed them below for reference. Here is my review of the three sunscreen sticks I’ve tried so far:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e4v40q0j04t91.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57160c139b133d631630407c20ffca566e08110b\n\n**1.** **TOCOBO Cotton Soft Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Niacinamide, Tromethamine, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Pentylene Glycol, Polysilicone-15, Vigna Radiata Seed Extract, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Extract, Sophora Flavescens Root Extract, Rheum Palmatum Root/Stalk Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Oenothera Biennis (evening primrose) Flower Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Seed Oil, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Fragrance\n\n**Where to buy and price:** Beauty Barn for INR 1240\n\n**Experience and opinion:** I really had high hopes for this one, I saw so many good reviews online. To be fair, its not a bad sunscreen stick. It glides on the skin easily enough, and sinks into your skin to give a matte powdery finish. But, it has a strong (imo) scent. It’s a linen-y kinda scent, which I just don’t like. This scent even lingers for quite some time after application, which makes it even more annoying. Honestly, I don’t care about fragrance in skincare as long as I like the fragrance, and I just don’t like the fragrance in this sunstick.  Another con is its shape, which makes it hard to use under the eyes. Overall, if you don’t mind the fragrance, it’s a decent sunstick.\n\n**Repurchase status:** WNRP, I can’t get over the smell.\n\n**2.** **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**Where to buy and price:** Beauty Barn for INR 1480\n\n**Experience and opinion:** My absolute favourite and current HG for reapplication! You can see from the picture that the writing on the packaging has faded because I’ve handled it so much. It has no fragrance, just a faint chemical scent which dissipates quickly after application. It takes a few seconds to warm up on your skin, after which it glides oh so smoothly. It has no white caste, and has a matte satin-y finish, which I LOVE. A little bit tacky to touch immediately after application, but sinks into your skin in a few minutes and becomes barely noticeable. Best part: its tear drop shape!! This makes such a difference, it makes it so easy to touch up under my eyes and around my nose.\n\n**Repurchase status:** WRP absolutely I love it so much!!\n\n**3.** **Avène SunsiStick KA SPF 50+**\n\n**Ingredients:** Octyldodecanol, Polyethylene, Butylene Glycol Cocoate, Hydrogenated Microcrystalline Wax, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Beeswax (Cera Alba), Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Water (Aqua), 1,2-Hexanediol, Aluminum Hydroxide, Butylene Glycol, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Caprylyl Glycol, Cichorium Intybus (Chicory) Root Extract, Disodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Oxothiazolidine, Saccharin, Sodium Benzoate, Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891), Tocopheryl Glucoside.\n\n**Where to buy and price:** Box of Color for INR 743.\n\n**Experience and opinion:** This was the first ever sunscreen stick I purchased and it made me almost give up on all sunsticks. It has a chemical-y waxy kind of fragrance but my biggest qualm with this sunstick is its texture and finish. It has a Vaseline-kinda balm-y texture that just sits on top of your skin and looks like you’re slugging during the day. Needless to say it gives an oily finish, not even dewy, which looks awful on my skin type. Its extremely transferrable and gets all over your hands if you happen to touch your face. I despise it and I’m not sure how I’ll use up the product.\n\n**Repurchase status:** WNRP never ever, god I hate it.",

    "body": "[Here](https://imgur.com/a/Mnijy) are some pictures of the goods! \n\nWhen you get a haul, even a mini one, there is always at least one thing that doesn't work out the way you thought it would. For my finicky skin, it's usually several things. So I was ***shocked*** when not only did everything from my recent AB haul work for me, but it all worked ***really*** well. So well that I wanted to share my excitement with all of you! I'm still mildly in disbelief right now, this never happens. \n\nCVS was having a BOGO 50% off sale so I decided to try a couple things that I’ve had my eye on. I thought these reviews might be helpful for those in this sub that aren’t very familiar with AB products. My routine is a mix of different types of brands (I do love my French pharmacy products) but I’ve had a lot more luck finding things that work for my skin type in the AB world. Some people get scared off at the idea of ordering things from overseas - either because of shipping cost or the length of shipping times. Since these are all products carried at CVS, they are a lot more accessible for those in the US. \n\n**Skin type:** Oily, dehydration-prone, sometimes sensitive (depends on its mood that day), with a very low tolerance for silicones. \n\n**Holika Holika Aloe Cleansing Foam -** I've had rough luck with foaming cleansers as they all seem to strip my skin (other than my HG LRP Toleraine but it's fun to switch it up sometimes). Not this guy! My skin loves anything aloe and this did not disappoint (aloe is the best humectant for oily skin imo). It has a very dense, thick foam that feels very nice on my skin. The scent is very fresh, it almost reminds me of fresh-cut watermelon and aloe mixed together. It leaves my skin very soft and not remotely stripped. No squeaky-clean feeling here! I'm not positive of the pH but it does contain potassium hydroxide (a pH adjuster) so I'm assuming it's in the normal range and not on the higher end. I think this is going to make a great AM cleanser since it's so gentle. \n\nIngredients: \nAloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Water, Lauryl Hydroxysultaine, Myristic Acid, Lauric Acid, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Chlorphenesin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Palmitic Acid, Capric Acid, Butylene Glycol, Betula Platyphylla Japonica Juice, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Potassium Sorbate.\n\n(*Ah-ha! I just saw the watermelon extract as I was adding this, so that explains the lovely scent.)\n\n**Peach Slices Citrus-Honey Aqua Glow Hydrating Moisture Gel -** Holy shit you guys, this is ***everything*** I've been looking for in a winter moisturizer. It's lightweight, a gel, has ceramides, is hydrating *and* moisturizing and doesn't make me oily. The search is over! Seriously, I've been trying to find the perfect moisturizer for about 8 months now. I thought I had the perfect one (Etude House Moistfull Collagen Water Jelly Cream) but turns out it was perfect *for summer*. Once winters cold, dry air came it just wasn't enough. I've desperately wanted to add ceramides to my routine with no luck (Rosette Ceramide Gel was a greasy disaster). The inclusion of ceramides is what originally caught my eye and also the lack of any -cones. My skin is sensitive to silicones and finding a heavier winter moisturizer without any has been virtually impossible. This does include a couple -anes so I was skeptical at first but they don’t seem to bother me as much as straight up dimethicone. Dimethicone + my skin = a greasy mess and lots of clogged pores (and fun little whiteheads all over). The first time I used it, I squeezed out too much but thought 'what the heck, I'll see what happens'. As I began to spread it around, I realized that it was *way* too much product and figured I was doomed for an oily face that night. Cut to a few minutes later, when I was shocked to find that it had ***all*** absorbed. It dries down quickly to a soft, almost-matte finish. It legit gives my skin a healthy glow without making it oily, something that I didn't think was possible. The first time I wore it to work, I was ***incredibly*** impressed by the fact that my skin was still matte at the end of the day. My work's super dry air usually drives my dehydrated skin nuts and by the end of the day, it's over-produced a ton of oil to compensate. But not with this!! It gives my skin the hydration it always needs with just enough moisture to seal it all in. I am absolutely over-the-moon in love with this product and I can't recommend it enough! \n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Polysorbate 60, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Honey Extract, Ceramide Np, Sorbitan Stearate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, 1, 2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Isohexadecane, Tromethamine, Hydroxyacetophenone, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Polysorbate 80, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitan Oleate, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Oil, Disodium EDTA, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Butylene Glycol, Bixa Orellana Seed Oil, Tocopherol.\n\n**The Saem Iceland Hydrating Soothing Gel -** The name pretty much says it all and it lives up to those claims. It's very hydrating, soothing and feels very refreshing. The fascinating thing about this product is how it dries down. It leaves an almost undetectable finish. I've never had anything disappear into my skin before - and I say that in the best way possible. It doesn't leave a tacky film the way most gels do. I use the Skinfood aloe gel daily (which does leave a bit of stickiness) and out of curiosity, I applied this on top of it. The combo dried down to almost nothing! It took away the stickiness all together. I am highly impressed with this gel! It is definitely a staple in my routine now and (*gasp*) may just replace my beloved Skinfood aloe (at least in the AM).\n\nIngredients: Water, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate 20, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Perfume, Sodium Acrylates Crosspolymer-2, Potassium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Disodium EDTA, Silica, Betaine, Heptane, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Propylene Glycol, Butylene glycol, Cetraria Islandica Extract, Sorbitol, Citric acid, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Prunus Mume Fruit Extract, Lactic acid.\n\n**Elisha Coy Refreshing Ampoule Solution Sheet Mask -** Another product that lives up to its name. I was nervous because these are on the cheaper side and usually the quality reflects that. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised! The mask itself fit very well. It's on the thinner side and it reminds me a lot of my fav sheet masks, the Etude House 0.2mm Air Therapy. It stayed in place and despite the essence being very watery, it didn't drip everywhere. The mask really seemed to hold onto the essence. After I took it off, I patted in the remaining essence from the pouch and it all absorbed completely. I was able to continue my routine with no issues. My skin was left hydrated, soothed and happy. \n\nIngredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Magnolia Kobus Bark Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Betula Alba Juice, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower Extract, Chrysanthellum Indicum Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Fragrance.\n\nI haven’t had the chance yet to try the rest of the sheet masks yet but I am very excited to do so!! If anyone has any questions, I’m happy to help! :)\n",

    "body": "Hiya,\n\nI hope you enjoy the below reviews. I'm just a regular consumer buying everything with my own money - i.e., nothing sponsored, etc. Note, I've bought all of them on sale for around AUD$15-20 because I like sales haha.\n\nProducts:\n\n1. PKY - essence toner;\n2. PKY - mist toner;\n3. Secret Key - fresh nature toner - milk brightening one;\n4. Benton - Aloe BHA Toner;\n5. Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 Relief Toner; and\n6. Purito - Centella Green Level Calming Toner & the unscented version (Purito Unscented Centella Toner)\n\nMy skin used to be severely dry but is now slightly dry on the cheek areas and slightly oily on the t-zone during summer and slightly dry on the whole face in the winter.\n\nAlso note that the below two PKY products have different 'actives'/hero ingredients notwithstanding them seemingly being quite similar! I've bolded the plant extracts under the ingredient headers below.\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Essence Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495), Australian websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. *Note, this one is generally recommended for people with drier skin whereas the mist version is generally recommended for those with oilier skin* Friends with eczema have also used this with success. *.* I can use both year round without breaking out. I've had friends with oilier skin who've used this one and have broken out. YMMV.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** LOVE THIS. May repurchase this for the rest of my life. I've used this after breaking my moisture barrier, after chemical peels, after active masks, and also *after getting my face ablatively lasered (after the the initial few days of only using an ointment)*. It's REALLY benign in a godly way. If you want it to do anything other than hydrate or increase the penetration of your other actives, this isn't the product for you (note, it doesn't claim to do anything else apart from hydrate & calm really).\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a little bit thicker than water but not as thick as the Purito centella toners. Won't run off your hand/face like water will but will eventually run off.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** None at allll, even when I broke my moisture barrier.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? Yes**/I have rebought this 4 or so times so far.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Mist Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance. This is in a spray bottle and is better suited to oily skinned persons.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1060395517?cpid=1060395516&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1060395517%3Fcpid%3D1060395516%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=876677637398885328), and Australian websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/pyunkang-mist-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. This one is more for people with slightly oilier skin too. It's a lighter formula than the essence one.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Decent hydration, I prefer to use this in the toner stage instead of after my skincare but I have enjoyed using it as a 'refreshing' spray during the day.\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a nice mist, doesn't run on the face. Feels like a spray of water?\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a spray bit on top. I've had no issues with it but one mate had a couple that didn't spray properly.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** Unsure. I've rebought it once but haven't gone to use this one as much as I have the PKY essence toner or the Purito Unscented Centella Toner. I also don't like mists a whole bunch as they can go onto your clothes (if you're out) or jewellery if you're wearing any.

Couldn't use it long enough to notice anything.\n\n**Smell:** A very strong scent that I could barely use it. I think I used it around 5-10 times before binning it - I couldn't even put up with the scent of this to use it on other parts of my body.\n\n**Feel:** really watery.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top.

I've not noticed any calming effects. It is definitely hydrating but given it's advertised as a BHA toner I'm quite disappointed at the lack of BHA efficacy here. I would much rather use the purito centella toner to hydrate and calm my skin as the centella has other benefits such as helping to stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** Similar to the PKY essence toner. Not as thick as the purito centella toners.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a pump on top.

AUD$25 for 180mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/etude-house-soon-jung-ph-5-5-relief-toner-180ml-180ml/info.html/pid.1058586258), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone. It adds light hydration with benign ingredients - akin to the PKY toners but very minimally more expensive. It'd be good if you have irritated and/or dry skin.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** I used it once/twice a day until I used it up. Bought it in December 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Pretty decent. I'd recommend this to the same group of people who'd use the PKY essence toner. Nothing ground breaking. I prefer the calming nature of the Purito Unscented Centella Toner or even the PKY essence toner if you want zero actives (if you consider centella an 'active').\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** A watery toner.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** No but for no fault of the product. I just prefer using the Purito Unscented Centella one as it's just as benign, a bit cheaper, and has the benefits of centella.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, Propanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Madecassoside, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Polyglycerin-3, Disodium EDTA\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**Centella Green Level Calming Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804) **& the** [**Centella Unscented Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380)\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating and calming toner - may also stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$30 but I've always bought it on sale for approx. AUD$20-25 for 200mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380), [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml)\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone however this is best suited to those with any sort of irritation, acne, or redness. That is, if you have basically perfect skin you're probably not going to notice much of a difference but if you have irritation etc then you'll likely fall in love. Also good if you're wanting to help stimulate collagen production especially for the low price point - target ages for this is probably mid twenties and up.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** religiously since April 2020, sometimes twice a day.\n\n**My thoughts:** *BLOODY EXCELLENT*. I'm on my second bottle of this. My first bottle was the first listed one (scented) and then they released the unscented one so I bought that! It's incredible. I love it. In my opinion, it's partially why my skin is able to tolerate me using actives so much. It's excellent to use before actives as it doesn't interact with anything and really good to use after an 'active' mask or a clay mask etc. I switched to the unscented one to just reduce the risk of irritation.\n\n*also studies, which I haven't read but have seen derms I trust on insta etc, say that* ***centella can help stimulate/produce collagen... a big yes from me given it's a calming ingredient that shouldn't purge you or break you out*** *(unless you're allergic/sensitive to it)!*\n\n**Smell:** The scented one smells herbaceous (akin to Asian herbal medicine - I don't mind it but others may). The unscented one doesn't really smell like anything / I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** thick/fat/heavy water. Not a watery toner. Enjoyable.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Neverrrrrr, this helps me reduce the side effects from using actives such as retinoids, AHAs, BHAs, etc.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **Yes** & I have. Will probably rebuy for life.\n\n**Ingredients:** 4 variants as they've got the scented and unscented versions, and then those with and without witch hazel\n\nnon-witch hazel unscented version -\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract (strengthens skin barrier), Butylene Glycol (humectants), Pentylene Glycol (skin-conditioning agents), Dipropylene Glycol (humectants), 1,2-Hexanediol (stabilizers), Trehalose (humectants), Sodium Hyaluronate (natural moisturizing factor/ humectants), Hamemelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiaticoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiatic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Madecassic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Panthenol (strengthens skin barrier), Carbomer (viscosity increasing agents), Allantoin (skin protectants), Arginine (skin-conditioning agents), Portulaca Oleracea Extract (skin-conditioning agents), Ethylhexylglycerin (skin-conditioning agents), Disodium EDTA (stabilizers)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope these reviews were useful & feel free to ask any questions / start any discussions :)",

    "body": "I was on Sephora.com last week about to order some Kat Von D makeup removing wipes (I was hoping to find something that would take off waterproof everything and I recall the sample of hers doing the trick, as in being ridiculously oily.) when I came across something brand new: [Urban Decay's Makeup Removing Wipes](http://www.sephora.com/meltdown-makeup-remover-wipes-P409954?skuId=1850403&icid2=D=c6:products%20grid:p409954). I can literally not find these anywhere else, not a review, nothing. Or at least I couldn't prior to Friday. I was trying to find an ingredient list before ordering, but it was as though they did not exist other than the listing on Sephora.com to buy.  Since they were really reasonably priced (ETA: reasonable by Sephora standards.) and you get 100 wipes in the pack, I figured what the hell. I seem to have no self control when it comes to anything makeup related and just buy it like it's nothin'. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/b2kCl2Z\n\nThey arrived today and even though it's only 530 pm, and I really don't normally take my makeup off this early so as not to scare small children or offend their sensibilities (my niece has some pretty strong opinions about me going out without makeup on: she \"doesn't prefer it.\") I could not wait to test them out and see if they worked better than the [Aveeno ones](http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod5600049)  (shit, yo, Ulta charges way more, get em at Target or Drugstore.com or something!) I'd been using or if they burned any less. (FYI--they still burn but not as badly, but I have ridiculously sensitive skin, plus retinoids. So, everything burns.) \n\n\n\n*Sizing, and about the wipe:*\n\nThe sheets themselves are bit smaller (6.5\" x 4.5\") than the Aveeno ones (7.4\" x7.2\" per the package, so a little over 7\" square), but compared to the Aveeno ones were slightly damper--not as wet as I would like though and not as wet as I recall the Aveeno ones being in the past--and certainly not as damp as the Simple Micellar Wipes are.  I've had several packs of Aveeno ones that have been really dry lately from the start, and dried out before the pack was even half done. \n\nThe wipes themselves are texturally similar. The Aveeno ones are slightly thicker, and stronger than the UD ones, but the UD ones are labeled as biodegradable. \n\nA used UD wipe:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/tcuMw6M\n\n\n\n*Efficacy/Usage:*\n\nI usually use one Aveeno wipe (out of a 25 wipe pack) at a time, and that will take off most or all of my waterproof eye makeup (yknow, assuming it is wet enough) and then will go over my whole face with one of the Simple Micellar wipes to make sure any oiliness is gone. There are still times where I don't get all of the eye makeup off, because I pile it on. Often what is left is mascara, and I either give up, or will go over my lashes with another wipe OR use one of the Ocusoft scrub pads to get it off. \n\nI felt due to the size of the Urban Decay wipes that I needed two. I probably didn't, but for the sake of comfort, I did use two. Given that 100 come in the pack, even if I use two at a time, I will still get twice as much out of this pack assuming it doesn't dry out before I run out.  I still used the Simple wipe afterward, because again, oily.  I did not really have anything left on my eyes or lashes afterwards, and didn't feel like I needed to go over my lashes or eyes at all. There might be a tiny bit of something still on there, but not enough that I feel like I need to worry about it. I'd go to bed like this.   Tonight I have boxing, so I will still shower, so I don't care--I'll be washing my face again.\n\nBefore/After photos, try not to have nightmares:\n\nB:  http://imgur.com/P4MOMdb\n\nB:  http://imgur.com/qmJiPAq\n\nA:  http://imgur.com/1BbCxIF\n\n\n\n*Pricing:*\n\nThe price difference is significant, but I felt worthwhile.  The Aveeno wipes are around $6.99 (at Target) for a pack of 25. The Urban Decay were $20 for a pack of 100. So basically to get as many Aveeno wipes as UD wipes, you'd pay $27.96 assuming you didn't find them on sale/coupon deal. Though, I guess considering you're using two UD wipes, it's really half that, so $13.98, given I need one Aveeno for every two UD wipes (need...maybe. Used, yes.) And again, that assumes the Aveeno ones are not dried out. \n\n\n\n*Ingredients:*\n\nI took a photo of the package, it's not great. \nhttp://imgur.com/Gqw4mWc\n\nList is:\n\nWater, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Ethyl Macadamiate, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Citrate, Gluconolactone, Polyglyceryl-3 Polyricinoleate, Sunflower Seed Oil, Sodium Benzoate, Olive Oil, Lavender Oil, Jojoba Seed Oil, Sodium Laurylglucosides Hydroxypropylsulfonate, Calcium Gluconate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Chloride, Rice Bran Extract, Tocopheryl, Malic Acid, Sunflower Extract, Rosemary Leaf Extract\n\n\nBut this product has five natural oils in it, vs none in the Aveeno.  Here's the list from Ulta on the Aveeno:\n\nWater, Isononyl Isononanoate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Isostearyl Palmitate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hexylene Glycol, PEG-6, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Phenoxyethanol, Sucrose Cocoate, Fragrance, Carbomer, PEG-4 Laurate, Sodium Hydroxide, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Chrysanthemum Parthenium(Feverfew) Flower/Leaf/Stem Juice, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Glycerin, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract.  The package says there's a 3 month shelf life, which I think given the ingredient list is interesting, though, it's heavy on the natural oils, and maybe they're less stable?  Compared to the Aveeno list, it's significantly more natural. \n\n\n\n*Bottom Line:*\n\nI am pretty impressed after one use. I will see how I feel after several more. I want to see if they dry out and how quickly they dry out if they do.   But efficacy in the first use made them worth my while. \n\nedited to correct stupid typo\n\n\n**24 hours later update:**\n\nI just did my second use today and I was able to use ONE wipe this time (well that was my requirement of myself this time), and it worked just fine, both eyes completely clean. I followed with the Simple Micellar wipe all over and briefly around my eyes, bec I am just that anal, and my face is spiffy.  Then I just applied my serums and all that after like normal.  *Fingers crossed* that my face doesn't lose it's marbles with all the natural oils. ",

    "body": "I was already skeptical when I bought it as an add-on, but I figured for $3 bucks it didn't hurt... Now I'm wondering if I should even put it on my face. \n\n\n1. There are basically no reviews anywhere outside of the official website. There's reviews on Nordstrom's, but they're all *reposted from the company's site*. The positive reviews didn't mention anything specific--\"Really pleasant serum and effects on the skin to suit.\" the few reviews seem fake as FUCK in my opinion. I found one more site that has reviews, but still, few reviews and a little generic. \n\n\n2. Packaging says it's **made in China**. Sorry, what the fuck?? A purportedly $350 cream is *made in China*? A company with very little info, very few reviews, making stuff in China? Alarm bells going off here, esp with regulation of ingredients. Not that China automatically means bad quality, but it's not a great sign for a no-name company. \n\n\n3. The **ingredients don't match the official site**. What the what?!\n\nHere's what the back of my sample said:\n\n\nWater, Sorbitol, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Bis - PEG - 18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Diazolidinyl Urea, Sodium PCA, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Hyaluronate, Disodium EDTA, Niacinimide, Panthenol, Carrageenan Extract, Propylene Glycol, Acrylic Acid Copolymer, PVM/MA Copolymer, Beta-Glucan, Chlorphenesin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Maltodextrin, BHT, Aesculus Hippocastanum Seed Extract, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Atecyl Cysteine, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Soybean Oil, Citric Acid, Calendula Officinalis Extract, Tocopherol, Fragrance. \n\nAnd here's the ingredients list from the official site:\n\n\nGLYCERIN, AQUA / WATER / EAU, SORBITOL, ISOPROPYL MYRISTATE, ALOE BARBADENSIS (ALOE VERA) EXTRACT, CALENDULA OFFICINALIS EXTRACT, ALCOHOL, CARBOMER, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, AESCULUS HIPPOCASTANUM (HORSE CHESTNUT / MARRON) SEED EXTRACT, SODIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE, ACETYL CYSTEINE, PANTHENOL, NIACINAMIDE, THIAMINE, RIBOFLAVIN, PYRIDOXINE, CYANOCOBALAMIN, DISODIUM EDTA, FRAGRANCE / PARFUM.\n\n\nCan anyone explain to me why the ingredients themselves would be different, and in the wrong order?? A lot of the ingredients not officially listed, like BHT and Diazolidinyl Urea, don't have great results on CosDNA.... And overall, I don't see any special ingredients beyond a few basic moisturizers, a bunch of preservatives, etc. Like, nothing that would make this worth $$$. \n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nHas anyone tried it? What are your results so far? I guess I'll still give it a try, but the fact that it's made in China (definitely potential ingredient contamination) and the ingredients aren't listed correctly makes me very skeptical... What's your take?\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/niANANe.jpg",

        "body": "This sounds like it might be a private label product, made by whoever in China and repackaged by a company that specifically sells/vends to beauty boxes. That there is no other information on this product online, it’s only appearance is in this beauty box, indicates a PLM product. Beauty box companies routinely pair with companies who private label their (inexpensively sourced) products and put a high price tag on it to make it seem like an amazing deal. \n\nSome people on this sub HATE any talk of private labeling in beauty boxes, they don’t want their bubble burst of how “great a deal!” their boxes and the products in them seem to be. Some brands seem to only exist in beauty boxes (Doucce, Laritzy, Starlooks, Micabeauty, The Beauty Crop, Be A Bombshell, Mirabella, etc). There are tons more, I’ve only subbed to Play and Allure lately so I’m a little behind. I suspect most or all of the brands I listed are private label. \n\nYou can usually tell because the brand’s presence is entirely online (outside of boxes) and the actual website will be a little “off.” A bit of a DIY template look. Real brands that manufacture their own products will usually sell in retail stores and have a custom website. Private label brands won’t because that shit costs money and they’re all about repackaging inexpensively-sourced products that another company made. \n\nIt’s a huge thing in the beauty industry right now. I’m not against private labeling, I just think a lot of people are being misled about “box values” with these inflated prices. Things are ultimately worth what you pay for them I guess but when someone posts how their “$20 box has a $300 value!” I roll my eyes a bit every time lol.\n\nSephora Play has had the fewest amount of PLM products in their boxes, which is why the samples are smaller and less varied-seeming. They seem to only have items in their boxes that they sell in their stores. Ipsy used to have a TON but they seem to send more higher-quality brands lately. Allure seems to be going down that road (Juvia’s Place, LASplash, etc). Most of the eye palettes in Boxycharm are from private label manufacturers, for example. Brands that just pop up out of nowhere in a beauty box, then just keep showing up in beauty boxes only. \n\nThis isn’t just true for beauty boxes though, it’s the case all across the entire beauty industry. I read somewhere that up to 80% or department store products are made by private label manufacturers. It’s just more obvious in beauty boxes because the same brands repeat over and over. When really, a good chunk of the products are made by the same larger companies and factories overseas, regardless of what brand name it says on the packaging. And the websites of beauty box brands seem more homemade and template-y.",

Meanwhile, there is a laundry list of other brands that routinely cause people break outs and no one breaks out the pitchforks.\n\nANYWAY. I have tried a few times to contact them via their Twitter account to ask, wth-when will you properly preserve these products? Because I seriously love the Snail Bee Essence and have yet to have a single issue personally, but it sure would be great to be able to recommend them with more confidence. My queries were ignored.\n\nSo I recently tried reaching out via their Facebook account. I had actually forgotten I asked and [had this message this morning back from them.](http://imgur.com/kWr7MfS) \n\nI honestly don't know a lot about preservatives and types. But I did some mild googling and pentylene glycol seems to be a preservative \"booster\" for other preservatives.\n\nSo,people who know more about this than me, what do you think?\n\nHere is the ingredient list minus the pentylene glycol for reference:\n\n*Snail Secretion Filtrate (90%), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycerin, Arbutin, Bee Venom, Plantago Asiatica Extract, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Ulmus Campestris Extract, Bacillus Ferment, Azelaic Acid, Althaea Rosea Flower Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Human Oligopeptide-1, Beta-Glucan, Betaine, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Adenosine,Panthenol, Allantoin, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Arginine.*\n\nEdited to add: I am in ongoing contact with Benton and hope to have more clarity for everyone soon.

So while I totally understand people choosing not to use Benton, the way some people have gone about it has left a sour taste in my mouth. Unfortunately I feel like there's some people on this board that kind of mindlessly follow the majority (or blogger opinions) without doing their own research and they have these ridiculous, over the top reactions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut again, I have no problem with anyone who has chosen not to use Benton. We all have to make decisions for our own skincare and people best know what's right for their own skin. Just do your research before you trash a brand, especially if you've never used said brand or don't even have a contaminated product.",

    "body": "**1) Minimalist UV Protection Invisible Sunscreen SPF 40+++**\n\n**Price:** Rs. 499 for 50gm. I got it for free from Myntra App along with their Vitamin C Serum.\n\n**Ingredients:** Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Octocrylene, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Diisopropyl Adipate, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Isododecane, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Silica, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Squalane, Solanum Lycopersicum (Tomato) Fruit Extract, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Microcrystalline Wax, Tocopheryl Acetate, Silica Silylate, Quaternium-90 Sepiolite, Quaternium-90 Montmorillonite, BHT\n\n**Packaging:** Tube \n\n**Texture:** White P\nOpaque Gel\n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\n**My Experience:** I didn't use this regularly, it was mostly kept in my office bag for applying during evenings while leaving work. \n\nAs the name suggests, there was never an issue of white cast due to its texture and colour. With invisible sunscreen, you gotta know till when you to massage the sunscreen. I feel with other sunscreens, you've an idea on how long to blend or massage. With invisible sunscreen, if not applied properly, it starts pilling off.\n\nThe texture was matte, so probably it felt on my face for a while post application. My biggest issue with this was that it irritated my eyes if I accidentally brushed over anywhere near my eye area (I didn't directly touch my eyes). And seeing as it happened multiple times, I think i was turned off this product, wanting to never purchase it.\n\nWhich won't be an issue coz I don't see this product anywhere. It's probably discontinued.\n\n**(2)Cosiq Airgel Nmf-15% Moisturiser For Oily Skin**\n\n**Price:** Rs. 599/- for 100 ml\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Aloe Vera Leaf Extract, Bacillus/Carrot Root Ferment Filtrate, Glycerine, Sorbitol, Propanediol, Hyaluronic Acid, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Sodium Lactate, Sodium Gluconate, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Betaine, Sodium Carbomer, Allantoin, Betaine, Sodium PCA, Sodium Lactate, Pca, Serine, Alanine, Glycine, Glutamic Acid, Lysine Hcl, Threonine, Arginine, Proline, Water, Saccharide Isomerate, Sodium PCA, Vitamin E, Sodium Gluconate, Menthyl Lactate, Menthol\n\n**Packaging:** Airpump in a Tube\n\n**Texture:** Lightweight Airy gel.\n\n**My Experience:** I was influenced to buy this from this Oily Moisturizer guide of one of the IG influencers. \n\nPros - Very affordable and comes in good quantity. It's a steal for its price. Very lightweight, blends easily , gives a matte finish but doesn't feel that it's sitting on your skin (like many matte products). \n\nIf your skin type is combination leaning to dry side, this won't be sufficient for you. As it states, it's great for oily skin as it feels nothing when you apply, and works wonderfully for Summers. \n\nCons: Tbh, None. It's not as great as some other moisturizers that I've used, but for the price, it's a great product.\n\nI might repurchase it again unless I get some k-beauty products on good discount.\n\n**3)Vaseline Gluta Hya Antioxidant SPF 50 PA+++ Sunscreen**\n\n**Price:** 699/- for 175ml\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Disodium Phenyl Dibenzimidazole Tetrasulfonate, Triethanolamine, Dimethicone, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Hydroxide, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Cystine, Glycine, Sodium PCA, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glutathione, Cyclopentasiloxane, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Polysorbate 20, Perfume, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Cyclomethicone, Petrolatum, BHT, Tocopherol\n\n**Texture:** Serum like lotion\n\n**Fragrance:** Yes\n\n**My Experience:** It's a wonderful sunscreen at a very decent price. \n\nPros are that it's  very lightweight, has a serum like texture that blends in seconds. It's claim of serum bursting into water and absorbing quickly, is true. It always gives a very dewy and shiny finish.\n\nCons - Very sticky, though it does feels normal after a few minutes. \nIt doesn't prevent tanning. My hands are quite tanned, and since its texture is like a serum, I did use quite a lot of product while applying it on my hands. There was no pilling, but no saving from tan.\n\nI would repurchase it for other seasons like winters or monsoons. For now, I've purchased Nivea sunscreen again, my HG for body sunscreen.\n\nDo share your experiences if you've tried these or similar products.\n\n",

    "body": "Here’s a comment I posted about Avant:\n\nAvant’s Deluxe Hyaluronic Acid Vivifying Face & Eye Night Cream (this was being sold in the FFF edit sale last week), we were suppose to get this last December for premium box but instead we got the Pro-Intense Hyaluronic Acid Illuminating Day Cream instead, it’s the same RV $134 and has equally crappy ingredients, I’ve seen hand creams/body creams with better/actual effective formulas.\n\nIngredients for the Avant Face & Eye Cream: aqua (water), Butyrospermum Parkii (shea) butter, glycerin (humectant) cetyl alcohol (texture enhancer, emollient), glyceryl stearate (emulsifying agent), dicaprylyl ether (emollient), propylheptyl caprylate (emollient), dimethicone (type of silicone occlusive), sodium hyaluronate (salt form of hyaluronic acid), niacinamide (Vitamin B3, excellent antioxidant has many beneficial properties), maris aqua (sea water, has more minerals than tap water), Prunus Amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil (emollient which contains lots of skin nourishing fatty acids), allantoin (skin soothing), tocopheryl acetate (vitamin e), peg-75 stearate (texture enhancer, emulsifier), ceteth-20 (texture enhancer), steareth-20 (emulsifier) propylene glycol (humectant, texture enhancers), disodium edta (too lazy to explain this one) sodium polyacrylate (thickening agent, texture enhancer), xanthan gum (thickening agent), lactic acid (when used at this kind of low concentration most likely it’s being used as a pH adjuster), parfum (fragrance), potassium sorbate (preservative), ethylhexylglycerin (preservatives) CI 15985 (orange dye) (FD&C Yellow No. 6), CI 17200 (red dye) (D&C Red No. 33).\n\nHere’s the ingredients for a $134 moisturizer.  It doesn’t take Einstein to figure out all the products from Avant are crap, even if this were $5 it would still be crap. There’s nothing wrong with the ingredients, its just the formulation and ingredients for the moisturizer isn’t worth more than $5, it has no high levels of any active ingredients/patented technology (almost all moisturizers at that price point has patents). If this were ingredients for a dollar store hand cream, then i would buy it, unfortunately it’s $134.  Avant products AREN’T EVEN WORTH the $12 Boxycharm add on/pop up price.\n\nLook at the ingredients for Acure Radically Rejuvenating Whipped Night Cream ($15.99 on iherb.com) \n\nWATER/AQUA/EAU, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CETEARYL OLIVATE, SORBITAN OLIVATE, SCLEROCARYA BIRREA (MARULA) SEED OIL, NYMPHAEA ALBA ROOT EXTRACT, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-1, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-2, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-1, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-9, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-11, COPPER PALMITOYL HEPTAPEPTIDE-14, HEPTAPEPTIDE-15 PALMITATE, PALMITOYL TETRAPEPTIDE-7, PALMITOYL TRIPEPTIDE-1 (PEPTIDE BLEND), FERULIC ACID, ASCORBIC GLUCOSIDE (VITAMIN C), COCONUT ALKANES, PSEUDOALTEROMONAS FERMENT EXTRACT (GLACIAL GLYCOPROTEINS), SALICYLIC ACID COCO-CAPRYLATE/CAPRATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ASPARTIC ACID, LINOLEIC ACID, LINOLENIC ACID, LECITHIN, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, LACTIC ACID/GLYCOLIC ACID COPOLYMER, CURCUMA LONGA (TURMERIC) ROOT EXTRACT, SYMPHYTUM OFFICINALE CALLUS CULTURE EXTRACT.\n\nBesides the fact that this has way more antioxidants/age prevention/hydrating ingredients.  This ingredients list for a $16 moisturizer might look familiar to some people because it’s like 95% the same as a certain Drunk Elephant Moisturizer(it’s just missing a few amino acids at the end of the ingredients list but all the important ingredients are exactly the same, even the peptides are the same).  Looks a thousand times better than all the crappy $130 Avant Moisturizers, and this is just one example, there’s CeraVe, Elf, tons of Korean brand moisturizers, all around or under $20. \n\nDECIEM’s hand cream $16 for 100ML\nAqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Propanediol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Copper Lysinate/Prolinate, Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Methylglucoside Phosphate, Proline, Alanine, Serine, Pseudoalteromonas Ferment Extract, Tremella Fuciformis Sporocarp Extract, Tocopherol, Betaine, Cellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Sodium Phosphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Parfum (Fragrance), Limonene, Linalool.\n\nThere’s copper peptide (the next big thing in anti aging), snow mushrooms, amino acids, algae ferment, and Plantago Lanceolata which can reduce dark spots, all this from a hand cream, people were using this as a facial moisturizer cos it’s that good. \n\nMoisturizers which are around $134\n\n- Guerlain’s Abeille Royale Creams (has patent on formulas and also the frigging jar the moisturizer comes in) \n\n* Sisley Black Rose Cream Mask (really this needs no introduction) \n\n* Charlotte Tilbury’s Night Cream\n\n* Dior Capture Totale Firming and Wrinkle Correcting Cream (Again patented formula, with a lot of research and clinical trials)\n\n* Lancer Skincare the Nourish (Dr. Lancer dermatologists for Hollywood Stars) \n\n* Fresh Creme Ancienne Moisturizer (Literally made by hand in a Monastery in Europe) \n\n* Chanel Le Lift Restorative Cream (clinical and in vitro testing, patented formula) \n\n* Caudalie Premium Cru Rich/Normal Cream (again patented formula, developed with Harvard Medical School) \n\n* If you check out CultBeauty the Eve Lom holiday set (the one with the Moisture Cream and cleanser (all full size) are basically the same RV as the stupid Avant moisturizer. \n\nThe list can go on forever, also Anti pollution micellar water from Chanel only costs $45. If you take a look at the ingredients for Avant’s Micellar Water it’s missing a very crucial ingredient that the majority of “high end/effective” micellar water contain, PEG-6 Caprylic/ Capric Glycerides.  Seriously this is not even worth $1. \nLastly someone from this subreddit did some research on this company, I think she concluded it was being used to launder money. But the fact that they’re selling you crap for $100+ is enough proof for me.\n\nNow the 111skin products we get from boxycharm or Ipsy are NOT the same as the ones sold in retail stores or 111skin’s online site.  The hydra gel moisturizer that came from Ipsy for example has a completely different ingredients list from the “real” moisturizer.\n\nIngredients from 111skin Cryo Activating Hydra Gel Ipsy version: \nAloe Barbadensis Gel, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Butylene Glycol, Isohexadecane, Dipropylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond / Amande Douce) Oil, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Betaine, Lecithin, Pyrus Malus (Apple / Pomme) Fruit Water, Allantoin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Hydroxyacetophenone, Trehalose, Propanediol, Glyceryl Caprylate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Aluminium Dicetyl Phosphate, BHT, Tetrasodium EDTA, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol, Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow / Achillée) Extract, Xanthan Gum, Menthol, Menthyl Lactate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Fragrance / Parfum, Limonene, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Linalool.\n\nIngredients from 111skin’s site for the Hydra Gel:\nAQUA / WATER / EAU, NELUMBO NUCIFERA (LOTUS) ROOT WATER, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, GLYCERIN, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND / AMANDE DOUCE) OIL, SODIUM ACRYLATES COPOLYMER, CARBOMER, TETRAHEXYLDECYL ASCORBATE, ETHYLHEXYL PALMITATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, BETAINE, LECITHIN, PROPANEDIOL, BENZYL ALCOHOL, HORDEUM VULGARE (BARLEY / ORGE) SEED EXTRACT, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PRUNUS PERSICA (PEACH / PÊCHE) JUICE, PYRUS MALUS (APPLE / POMME) JUICE, TRITICUM VULGARE (WHEAT / BLÉ) SEED EXTRACT, DISODIUM EDTA, PANAX GINSENG ROOT EXTRACT, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, TRIHYDROXYSTEARIN, ACHILLEA MILLEFOLIUM (YARROW / ACHILÉE) EXTRACT, SODIUM HYALURONATE, MENTHOL, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, ALOE VERA LEAF EXTRACT, GLYCERYL UNDECYLENATE, MENTHYL LACTATE, XANTHAN GUM, GLUCOMANNAN, FRAGRANCE / PARFUM, BENZYL SALICYLATE, LIMONENE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL.\n\nSee the difference? The Ipsy one although it advertises that it’s made with lotus water, there’s no lotus anything in the ingredients. It’s full of texture enhancers and solvents, IMO they were mainly trying to copy the “gel texture” of the real moisturizer.  The real moisturizer that’s $200 isn’t that much better. No expensive ingredients or actives....Check out the Rovectin Lotus Water Cream, made from 75% lotus flower extract (I’m assuming extracts holds a lot more nutrients than lotus root water), and it’s $20 but it goes on sale for $10, has similar light texture etc etc.  Usually the “made for beauty boxes 111skin products” will have “Made in China for 111skin” on the packaging. The real products use to be made in Bulgaria and now I think it’s made in UK, and some are made in the US.  Even if the ingredients line up like the 111skin vitamin c serum from Ipsy and the old formula of the vitamin c from 111skin’s site, the texture, colour, smell are completely different.  The real one had a serum like texture, transparent, had some kind of smell (I forgot the smell, I compared the products like a year ago).  The Ipsy version has the texture of water, yellow tint, no smell I think. Even the real products from 111skin are total ripoffs...what the hell does that say about the “fake” ones? \n\nTL:DR - both Avant and 111skin products are crap, 111skin sends out fakes to beauty boxes but even the real products are crap.  Avant is a sketchy company and their products aren’t even worth the $12 add on price.  It doesn’t matter if Avant’s website looks legitimate, every MLM website looks a thousand times more legitimate than Avant but it’s still a scam.",

I hope I've followed all the rules!\n\nHere is the deal:\n\nSo, I have been on the hunt for a daily mist that does more than just \"this makes my skin so hydrated throughout the day!\" That's nice and all, however the reality is: It **should be** hydrating as I'm literally spraying my face and saturating it with liquid. In most of the more famous \"thermal water\" mists, its literally just water and pressure.\n\n\n**a note** I'm not bashing water mists, I own one! I think they are great for what their purpose is, pure hydration. I just find it easier to put some bottles water in a fine mist spray bottle, tbh.\n\n\n**So, what are you getting at here?**\n\nI have skin that (like many of us here) isn't flawless, spotless perfection. So I have been on the hunt for a mist that does more than simply hydrate, be cause we all deserve a mist that can help us with skin problems too, right? I think that some of the issue is, when looking for a mist, we all just assume that **hydration is all we are supposed to get from a mist** & that just didn't sit right with me. I feel like we should at least get a little bit more. Whitening/brightening effects, acne control, sebum control, pore minimizer, etc. I wan't all a mist has to offer!\n\n\n**You said you were on a hunt, did you find anything? Or are you just smack talking?**\n\nThis is why I'm here. I found a few mists that I would like to share and hope to get some recommendations for more! I hope to compile some type of list, so any and all suggestions are welcome. I would especially love some mists from brands that we may not see that often because I'd love to broaden my horizons!\n\n\n**Here are the mists I found so far and their ingredients:** (I hope anyone can add to this)\n\n\n**BENTON Honest TT Mist**\n\nIngredients: Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tee Tree) Leaf Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Extract, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycerin, Altharea Roea Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Poly Glutamic Acid, Aspalathus Linearis Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Psidium Guajava Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract\n\n\n**ELENSILIA Escargot Botanic Garden Bee Venom Lavender Mist**\n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Sodium Citrate, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil,Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Chloride, Chlorphenesin, Adenosine, Magnesium Sulfate, Citric Acid, Glycosaminoglycans, Bee Venom, Honey Extract, Royal Jelly Extract, Propolis Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Polygonum Multiflorum Root Extract, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Extract, Phellinus, Linteus Extract, Angelica Gigas Root Extract, Morus Alba Bark Extract, Paeonia Lactiflora Root Extract, Sophora Angustifolia Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Galactomyces, Ferment Filtrate, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil\n\n\n**Snail White SYN-AKE Mist**\n\nIngredients: Snail secretion filtrate,deionized water, SYN-AKE (dipeptide diaminobutyroyl benzalymide diacetate) Alpha arbutin, dipotassium glycyrrhizate, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Morus nigra fruit extract, rubus idaeus (raspberry extract) Prunus Avium (sweet cherry extract) fragaria vesca (strawberry fruit extract\n\nHonorable mention: I have **TFS Bamboo Water, sebum control mist.** I like it, it controls some oil, hydrates and doesn't have a strong scent.

    "body": "I’m at my wit’s end. My HG moisturizer is hard to come across, as it’s constantly in and out of stock and not really talked about.\n\nMy skin is oily, dehydrated, sensitive, triggered by fungal acne triggers (if they are high up on the ingredient list), very sensitive with redness and acne-prone, generally clog-prone. \n\n\n\nI had finally found ONE moisturizer in the past decade that suited my needs perfectly, the Cell Fusion C Calming Down Cream. \n\n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Methylpropanediol, Methyl Trimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Trehalose, Algae Extract, Eclipta Prostrata Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Turmeric Extract, Malt Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Kudzu Root Extract, Aloe Vera Leaf Extract, Chlorella Minutissima Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Rosemary Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Oat Kernel Extract, Pteris Multifida Extract, Artichoke Extract, Undaria Pinnatifida Extract, Lepidium Meyenii Root Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Extract, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Jojoba Seed Oil, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Titanium Dioxide, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Butylene Glycol, Polyglyceryl-2 Caprate, Allantoin, Sucrose Stearate, Fructooligosaccharides, Stearic Acid, Methyl Diisopropyl Propionamide, Aluminium Oxide, Beta-Glucan, Glyceryl Caprylate, Polyquaternium-51, Squalane, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Maltodextrin, Saccharide Hydrolysate, Ceramide NP, Cholesterol, Cholesteryl Macadamiate, Palmitic Acid, Guaiazulene, Saccharide Isomerate, Hydrolyzed Lupine Protein, Fragrance, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone\n\n\n\nBeautiful texture, green color which cancels redness and leaves a blurred finish, locks in moisture without clogging.\nHeavy esters or triglycerides and fatty alcohols which would trigger breakouts for me are far down the list, diluted in a lightweight base (lightweight emollients such as Methylpropanediol, methyl trimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol; all good because my skin does not like heavier silicones like Dimethicone in higher concentrations.)\n\n\nPlus all the soothing ingredients like Centella components, chamomile, guiazulene, mandecassoside etc. \n\n\n\nIs there anything at all out there that has a similar structure or performs similarly? It’s so frustrating when the one product you would use religiously is seemingly irreplaceable…\n\nProducts that haven’t worked:\n\ndr g blemish cream (due to silicones)\niunik centella gel cream, isntree aloe vera gel, beplain cicaful calming gel (I think gels aren’t really for me, they make me itchy and don’t calm my skin enough)\n\n",

    "body": "**Full product name:** [Nature Republic California Aloe Fresh Powdery Sun Stick SPF 50+ PA++++](https://imgur.com/a/eh4pxrF) (24g of product) \n\n\nHi everyone!! I don’t think I’ve seen a review on here for this one, and no one mentioned it in the recent thread about sunscreen sticks, so I figured I should finally post something. \n\n**About Me:** combo, sensitive, acne-prone skin. Sunscreens that I truly like and have repurchased are Canmake Mermaid UV gel & Skin Aqua UV milk, although I have tried many. I like different finishes for different reasons, but generally prefer something more satin. \n\n**Price:** I bought this on yesstyle for $22 at the end of last year, and it’s currently $17 there. It’s 25,000 ₩ on the Korean Nature Republic site, which is about $20 USD, so I would just wait to find it on sale but overall it’s kind of expensive imo. \n\n**Ingredients:** \n\nThere are pictures online of an older packaging, so I think this has been around for a while and then was reformulated and repackaged. Here are the current ingredients from YesStyle - \n\nButylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Polyethylene, Dimethicone, **Octocrylene**, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Silica, **Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Octinoxate)**, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, **Ethylhexyl Salicylate (Octyl Salicylate)**, **Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus)**, **Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb S)**, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ozokerite, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract (0.2 ppm), Morinda Citrifolia Extract, Hibiscus Rosa-Sinensis Flower/Leaf Extract, (-)-alpha-bisabolol, Lauryl PEG-9 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sea Water, Water, Butylene Glycol, Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Application:** This product is alcohol free and contains a lot of silicone, which is obvious. It has a veryyyy silky slippery powdery feel, similar to a silicone makeup primer. Sometimes the thought of touching my face with sunscreen lotion hands grosses me out lol, so I like how easy and clean gliding this on my face is. Upon application, it diminishes a little bit of the shine on my face, but it’s pretty subtle and I couldn’t get a good picture of this effect. \n\n**Finish:** I would say it’s a satin finish, but will depend on your skin type. It might mattify oily skin a little, but for dry skin I suspect it would leave the tiniest sheen. Because it’s so slippery, makeup does glide on top pretty well but if you’re trying to spot conceal blemishes or something then that might be a negative point because the makeup won’t be able to stick to a specific spot. If I apply makeup it will emphasize dry skin flakes a tiny bit, even if I don’t use face powder. I didn’t notice any foundation separation issues though. \n\n**Effectiveness:** I’ve found most Korean sunscreens are not water-resistant and I don’t think this one is either. I use it for first application on days where I’m not going outside much, or for reapplication later in the day. If you’re going to sweat or swim, I would choose something else just to be safe. I haven’t noticed any freckles or sunburns, but again, I don’t really use it for strong sun exposure anyway. I also don’t think this has been independently tested after all the sunscreen drama last year (yet? If it has then please let me know!). \n\n**Smell:** As the name implies, it has an aloe and “fresh/clean” scent. It doesn’t bother me and fades pretty quickly. \n\n**TLDR:** I would give this a 3/5 rating. If you’re looking to try your first satin-finish sun stick, I think this is a decent option, especially if you can get it on sale. It’s pretty average and I like it enough to keep using, but it’s not so amazing that I’ll repurchase. \n\nI think I’ll try the isntree airy sun stick or the make p:rem one next, if anyone has a review for those!",

I have hooded lids (full Korean).\n\n**Fragrance is not a deal-breaker for me in wash-off products, although I am wearier of essential oils than I am of synthetic fragrance. Will be bolding main fragrance ingredients.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kzfesai0y6251.jpg?width=425&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df6aa8bee3c981d106a4ee4e3d071a26002ea80a\n\n**Cost:** 8 oz - $24 (Ulta)\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Coco-Glucoside, Coconut Alcohol, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Glycerin, Carbomer, Isopropyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Citric Acid, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, **Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil,** Propylparaben, Triethanolamine, **Amyris Balsamifera (Amyris) Bark Oil, Bulnesia Sarmientoi Wood (Vera Wood) Oil, Cymbopogon Martini (Palmarosa) Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens (Sweet Scented Geranium) Flower Oil, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Oil, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil, Mimosa Tenuiflora Bark Extract, Ormenis Multicaulis (Wild Moroccon Chamomile) Oil, Piper Nigrum (Pepper) Fruit Oil, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Oil,** Fd&C Yellow No. 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n**Texture:** A pale yellow, milky, lightly foaming cleanser of medium thickness.\n\n**Efficacy:** Acceptable as a one-step travel cleanser. Pretty good at removing sunscreen and makeup if you take the time to massage it in. Felt like a godsend before being completely spoiled by AB first cleansers. That was when I thought a little bit of waterproof mascara being left over giving me slight raccoon eyes when I woke up in the morning was \"acceptable\" and \"as good as it's gonna get\".\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** No. Has gentle surfactants but **it also has TWELVE different essential oils.** One of which is endangered and need active conservation according to Wikipedia, which I personally don't feel comfortable using:\n\n>*Bulnesia sarmientoi* was listed as [endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species) in the 2018 publication of the [IUCN Red List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List), due to the [deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation) of [Gran Chaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Chaco#Conservation_issues) and a strong global demand for its wood, extracts, and [essential oils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil) since 2001.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulnesia_sarmientoi#cite_note-IUCN-1) IUCN estimates indicate that over three generations the global population will decline by around 50%.\n\nRequires much more massaging to remove waterproof makeup which may be harsh on sensitive skin and cause more redness.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy. Not too strong.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No, it's a 2-in-1. However, it does not always get rid of everything on the first try, so another cleanse may be necessary.\n\n**Repurchase?** No. It did not bother my sensitive skin too much, but I'm cutting out all essential oils from my skincare + not effective enough as a first cleanser.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Naive Botanical Olive Cleansing Oil 230mL / 7.8 oz\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ovky561y6251.png?width=207&format=png&auto=webp&s=fecf9195af66872bce90dabfe904de2a500678a5\n\nI found out about this [here, ranked #4](https://my-best.net/15468). I wanted something with the highest cleansing power that washed off cleanly & is affordable.\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $14 on eBay before pandemic started. A little less than $7 in Japan. Even at double the price for me in the US, I have had this since **July 2019** (June 2020 now) and I am only *halfway through* it because of how incredibly effective it is with small amounts. I would run out of other cleansing oils relatively fast because of how much it takes to remove all my layers of waterproof makeup. Am shocked tbh.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, ethylhexyl palmitate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, glyceryl tri (caprylic acid / capric acid), PEG-8 glyceryl isostearate, sorbeth tetraisostearate-30, olive leaf extract, olive fruit oil, squalane, BG Water, cyclohexane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid bisethoxy diglycol, **perfume.**\n\n**Texture:** A cleansing oil of medium thickness, not overly greasy. Smooth, spreads very easily. Not super thin like something like Kose Softymo Speedy.\n\n**Efficacy:** Not drying at all on my very dry skin. SUPER effective at removing waterproof sunscreen and makeup. Takes absolutely NO TIME AT ALL, which is very different from other cleansing oils that required me to massage it in for a while. Color me beyond impressed. This is honestly the best first cleanser I've used so far. ZERO residue of any trace of makeup after removal.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes and no. It did not bother me personally but it does contain fragrance. I'm unsure if the current ingredient list is accurate as the Japanese ranking site states it contains essential oils but the list from Yesstyle does not.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy, woodsy. Not so strong that it is super bothersome.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Absolutely. As soon as it becomes affordable again when the pandemic dies down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Moistage W Cold Cream 270g / 9.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tcxvpzp1y6251.jpg?width=249&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0996cc355ecab1a721c0c6316ef76089e89c8b6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q416df74y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd8cd5a3d8cf58c3c0822eb9da142611c5826bc\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $16 on eBay. Currently about $19 on [Yesstyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/kracie-moistage-w-cold-cream-270g/info.html/pid.1069419619). Very cost-effective bc of its huge size.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, water, polysorbate 65, microcrystalline wax, glycerin, DPG, glyceryl stearate, dimethicone, stearoyl glutamate Na, stearic acid, polysorbate 80, beeswax, xanthan gum, olive oil, squalane, hydrogenated castor oil hydroxystearate, silk extract , Ethanol, hydrolyzed collagen, cetearyl alcohol, EDTA2Na, methyl paraben, ethyl paraben\\*\\*, perfume.\\*\\*\n\n**Texture:** A rich, thick white cream.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a huge NO from me, dawg. This is terrible. It barely removes anything waterproof and leaves a heavy residue. However, if you're the type of person who doesn't mind using a more stripping cleanser afterward to wash this off, or using a washcloth, I guess I can see it as being, um. Acceptable?\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** It is gentle but slightly fragranced. No reaction from my skin other than disgust at being left in a thick film after wash off.\n\n**Scent:** Very light floral.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** YES.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter 76g / 2.7 Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/znms9m83y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45f6d28d2958c8133b26a2ab363b88bcf71d065e\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $13.65 on Amazon. Currently [$14.85 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F165210/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea  (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, **Parfum, Aqua, Linalool, Limonene,** Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Citric Acid.\n\n**Texture:** A thick, opaque white balm, not overly greasy or waxy.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a good first cleanser. Quite travel friendly but I have not traveled with it in weather that would melt it so I don't know if it would leak through. It removes everything quite well, no complaints here. It still is not as good as the Kracie botanical olive one, takes longer to break down sunscreen and makeup, and may leave behind a slight amount of waterproof mascara if you aren't thorough enough with massaging/letting it sit on the skin long enough to melt everything.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Has not bothered mine, but fragrance is pretty strong. \n\n**Scent:** Strong floral. Although not strong enough to CHOKE on like some Korean products - those of intimate with Korean skincare - you know what I'm talking about. /sideyes my mom's side of the skincare in the bathroom\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** No, I don't like the scent and the packaging. It's hard to close properly on first try. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# (Not A First Cleanser But) [Equate Eye Makeup Remover](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Beauty-Oil-Free-Eye-Makeup-Remover-5-5-oz/39139097) 5.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfnqtmh5y6251.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05638b521fa8a76a4fe2673625e2b750241a492f\n\n**Cost:** $4 \n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Chloride, Dipropylene Glycol, Poloxamer 182, Allantion, Tetrasodium Edta, Benzalkonium Chloride, Glycerin, Cucumber (Cucumis Sativus), Fruit Extract, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium Phosphate. \n\n**Texture:** You gotta shake it before use. Watery but has silicone slip and thickness. \n\n**Efficacy:** I've used this as a first cleanser with a cotton pad in a pinch on extra lazy nights. It pretty works well to remove things pretty well although it WILL leave a residue obviously that you have to wash off. Honestly can't really tell the difference between this and the Neutrogena one and it's cheaper so. I use it to remove eyelash glue and waterproof mascara that I put on them. \n\nIt doesn't magically whisk away a mess of water-resistant lash glue residue + waterproof mascara on top of THAT (i don't really think anything can) but it's adequate, cheap, fragrance-free, oil-free and prolongs the wear on my beloved Miche Bloomin falsies (Girly Flair is the most popular bc of Pony Makeup but that style is horrible for me - it's SUPER fragile and breaks so easily compared to the other styles) by 10x. \n\nI just pour some in my palm and poke the lashes in a little puddle of it for a bit till the mascara comes off and then remove the glue with my fingers afterward. I don't wash them off afterward and whatever residue it leaves behind does not interfere at all with the next coat of mascara I put on them lashes.\n\n(Gonna write a separate review, but FYI - I prefer [DUO quick drying lash glue](https://www.ulta.com/duo-quick-set-lash-adhesive-clear?productId=pimprod2003529) in the purple label more than the super famous Japanese [D-Up Eyelash Fix](https://www.amazon.co.jp/D-UP-%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A2%E3%83%83%E3%83%97-4946324013622-D-U-P-%E3%82%A2%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC/dp/B0012VQTO2/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=d-up&qid=1590969259&sr=8-5) that's touted as #1 globally. I find that it's SOOO much quicker drying than D-Up and makes the lashes stick BETTER, longer, and stands stronger to tears. Plus it's latex-free too, for sensitive eyes. And way cheaper! I regret getting extra back ups of the D-Up thinking it'll be the best thing ever. There are still some cons that D-Up has an upperhand on, but I'll talk about that in that review post.)\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell yeah. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMini-Review on the **Garnier Skin Active Micellar Cleansing Water (Pink Cap):** This was just a sample so I ran out of it pretty fast but I remember being surprised that it actually was pretty effective at removing waterproof makeup. Scent-free, I quite liked it I think. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water, For Waterproof Makeup (Blue Cap), 13.5 Fl Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4fb7kb6y6251.jpg?width=556&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b56036478b358bd5043af8f80652b63a71cb7f9f\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $6.59 on Amazon. \n\n**Ingredients:** AQUA/WATER, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, ISOHEXADECANE, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DECYL GLUCOSIDE, POLYAMINOPROPYL BIGUANIDE. F.I.L.# D178190/1 \n\n**Texture:** Watery, greasy. I hate this. I got it mainly to remove waterproof sunscreen from my neck and chest at the end of the day without taking a whole damn shower. Leave a very unpleasant, greasy residue that I cannot stand on my skin. No. \n\n**Efficacy:** I only tried removing my makeup with this several times and it was okay I think. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Definitely. \n\n**Repurchase?** No. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Sensibio H2O 500 ml / 16.7 fl oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3q1ucyc8y6251.jpg?width=443&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ffe3ed17780adf84d930a94d27ae29416decdc52\n\n**Cost:** $15 on Amazon.com\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (aqua), Peg-6 Caprylic/capric Glycerides, Cucumis Sativus (cucumber) Fruit Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Propylene Glycol, Disodium Edta, Cetrimonium Bromide. \n\n**Texture:** Watery, very light! Refreshing. Doesn't leave a greasy gross residue like above. I still splash water on top of the skin before toweling off and I still can feel a slight film. Ideally, I would like to wash it all off bc Lab Muffin says it's still not the best to leave surfactants on the skin, but most nights I can't be bothered and it shouldn't be *that* bad if people in places with harsh water just leave it on the skin, right? \n\nI guess a way to deal with that would be to wipe away using a toner/water/spray with a cotton pad or something but idk, that's more unnecessary garbage I feel. And more rubbing sensitive skin. \n\n**Efficacy:** This is fairly new. Got it for the same reason as the Garnier blue cap. It removes my waterproof sunscreen from my neck just fine with a baby wipe or cotton pad. But for everyday, I much prefer a cleansing oil to reduce the amount of tugging and rubbing on my skin as well as disposable wipes or pads. I tried it for removing waterproof mascara from my falsies like the Equate one, but it was okay, similar, but not as good and not as \"conditioning\" on my falsies to keep them soft. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** For me, yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** Yes! \n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext on my Wish List!!:\n\n\\- Muji Sensitive Cleansing Oil 400 ml\n\n\\- Muji Mild Cleansing Oil 400 ml \n\n\\- Muji Mild Milky Cleansing 200 ml \n\n\\- More cleansing gels (first cleansers NOT second cleansers) (I've tried Kikumasamune one before and I really liked that one for heavy, non-waterproof makeup days! Also Innisfree Jeju Bija cleansing gel - but this dried my skin out a bit when used as a LONE first cleanser but for some odd reason was fine when followed up with an actual second cleanser! So strange. That was years ago tho. Much earlier than Kiku.)\n\n\\- DHC Deep Cleansing Oil\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------\n\nHope that helps! \n\n(Ugh I have so many review posts and other posts I wanna write and I can't get them off my mind but I gotta wait for the big sunscreen & ceramide/pseudo-ceramide/urea creams review posts bc I'm so damn extra and gotta wait til I can take more Before & After photos months apart and compare winter vs summer performances. /eyeroll \n\nBUT I WANNA TALK ABOUT MORE SKINCARE RIGHT NOOOWWW SDKFJSD32kfd#@! But don't want to make claims or claim favs without *absolute* thorough testing either.. Sigh, the struggle!!!)",

Currently hot and humid.\n\n**Reviews-**\n\nHello everyone. I have been planning on doing this comparative review for a really long time but was too lazy to write it all. Finally got the mental energy to sit and write it down.\n\nPlease do note that I tested these sunscreens in different seasons. I have used all of them for more than a month, though for some, the use has not been very regular because of the lockdown. Kindly factor that in however you may want to.**The review is strictly based on my personal experience- so ymmv, will differ for different people. Please do take it with a pinch of salt.**\n\n**1. Neutrogena Ultra sheer dry touch sunblock SPF 50**\\- This is the sunscreen I have used the longest amount of time for. Very budget friendly. Provides adequate protection. However earlier when I was not aware of the three finger rule, I would use the same quantity as I would with a moisturiser- it suited me and gave me a matte finish. However, when I began using the required amount, it dried my skin. Every time.  I no longer use it now. The consistency is a like a cream but it blends okay.Also since it is a chemical sunscreen, I have not faced any white cast issue with this.\n\nIngredients-[Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Homosalate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/homosalate), [Benzophenone-3](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/benzophenone-3), [Ethylhexyl Salicylate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-salicylate), [Octocrylene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/octocrylene), [Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyl-methoxydibenzoylmethane), [Silica](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/silica), [Styrene/​Acrylates Copolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/styrene-acrylates-copolymer), [Potassium Cetyl Phosphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-cetyl-phosphate), [Beeswax](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cera-alba), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Dimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone), [Caprylyl Methicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylyl-methicone), [Cetyl Dimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-dimethicone), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Sodium Polyacrylate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-polyacrylate), [Behenyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behenyl-alcohol), [Xanthan Gum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/xanthan-gum), [Chlorphenesin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/chlorphenesin), [Acrylates/​C12-22 Alkyl Methacrylate Copolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-c12-22-alkyl-methacrylate-copolymer), [Dimethicone/​PEG-10/​15 Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone-peg-10-15-crosspolymer), [Ethylhexyl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-stearate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Disodium EDTA](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [BHT](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Chlorhexidine Digluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/chlorhexidine-digluconate), [Ethylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylparaben), [Trideceth-6](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/trideceth-6), [Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/diethylhexyl-2-6-naphthalate)\n\n**Price and Availability**\\- Rs 650 for 88ml. easily available on e commerce sites like Nykaa, Amazon etc.\n\n**2. Innisfree Daily Mild Sunscreen SPF 50 PA ++++-** I got this last year during lockdown because this is the only budget friendly Korean sunscreen I knew of then. Really light lotion like texture and sits well on the face without piling. Gives a semi-dewy finish. However felt a little greasy on my face during humid season. Did it protect me adequately? I actually do not know because I wore it outside only a few times. I did not tan but the exposure to sun was not a lot so cannot be sure. Has a nice fragrance but when has that protected us from…anything. It has atleast three sunscreen filters and percentage is mentioned. But I am not sure if they are sufficient? No white cast with this either. I enjoyed using it except for the greasiness (which is not much but can still be felt).\n\n**Ingredients**\\-Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate 3.5%, Ethylhexyl Triazone 3.0%, Methylpropanediol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine 2.5%, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, Cetearyl Alcohol, C20-22 Alcohols, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Behenyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Tromethamine, Fragrance, Carbomer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polyisobutene, Saccharide Hydrolysate, Fructooligosaccharides, Ethylhexylglycerin, Pullulan, Caprylyl/​Capryl Glucoside, Sorbitan Oleate, Tocopherol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, C14-22 Alcohols, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Cetearyl Glucoside, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract\n\n**Price and availability**\\- Rs 700 for 50ml. Usually on discount so can be bought for around Rs 500 too. Can be purchased from Nykaa, Boddess, Amazon etc.\n\n**3. The Blessing Tree Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++-** Currently my HG. I have worn it a lot. Provides adequate protection. Has a lotion like texture but is thicker than the Innisfree one. Provides a demi matte finish. Does not feel greasy to me. Has a weird smell but that’s okay. It does not bother me much. Since it is a hybrid sunscreen, it does give a tiny amount, almost negligible white cast which settles down fast too. **WRP.**\n\n**Ingredients-** Octyl Methoxycinnamate, Oxybenzone, Titanium Dioxide, Octocrylene, Avobenzone, Zinc Oxide Lotion\n\nInactive Ingredients: Aqua, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Diisopropyl Adipate, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Propanediol, Diethylhexyl Syringylidenemalonate, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Niacinamide, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Perfume\n\n**Price and Availability**\\- Rs 249 for 100ml on Amazon.\n\n**4. Lóreal Paris Aqua Essence UV Perfect Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++-**  Can't speak enough about its amazing consistency and texture. So light and absorbs easily. Haven’t had the opportunity to wear it often since I bought it this year. The first time I wore it, it stung my eyes. The next time it did not sting my eyes but felt greasy because the weather was humid. I dont think the sunscreen is to be blamed for that. It’s major con (and everyone knows that) is the quantity for the price it is sold. No white cast. Might think of repurchasing but not sure about it.\n\nIngredients- Aqua, Alcohol Denat, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Isopropyl Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Propylene Glycol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Styrene/​Acrylates Copolymer, Glycerin, Drometrizole Trisiloxane, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Tocophérol Acétate, Phenoxyethanol, Stearic Acid, Adenosine, PEG-8 Laurate, Palmitic Acid, Ammonium Polyacryldimethyltauramide/​Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Limonene, Linalool, Benzyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Acrylates C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Geraniol, Disodium EDTA, Ceteth-10, Potassium Hydroxide, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Parfum/​Fragrance (F.I.L. C161957/​2)\n\n**Price and Availability-** Rs 515 for 30ml. Usually available on a discounted price of 400 something on Nykaa.\n\nVerdict- I will continue purchasing The Blessing Tree sunscreen. This sub introduced me to this budget friendly option and I am so grateful! The other sunscreens mentioned here are also good, never broke me out (my skin is not sensitive so maybe that’s why) so it totally depends on what you are looking for. I am anticipating queries about Oxybenzone and Co ‘s safety- please do read up on it. They are safe. The only issue with older chemical sunscreen filters is their instability. The newer ones are more stable so I’d definitely explore some of the newer filters in the future. **Other than that- it is more important to wear sunscreen, even if it offers very basic protection than to not wear sunscreen at all.** I hope this review will be helpful! Please ask away anything you would like to in the comments. I will try my best to answer them. (I will also post this under the sunscreen thread).",

    "body": "Warning: Long post because I might be slightly insane. I think I put way too much thought into researching products than necessary...\n\nI’ve been curious about the hype surrounding peeling gels lately and began hunting through information on the interwebs where the general consensus amongst industry experts like [The Beauty Brains](http://thebeautybrains.com/2014/02/cure-natural-aqua-gel-look-at-the-label/) and [Colin’s Beauty Pages](http://colinsbeautypages.co.uk/skin-peeling-from-peeling-gels/) seems to be that they function on the mechanism of the acrylates/C10-30 and akyl acrylate crosspolymer (specifically referring to the formula of Cure aqua peeling gel) balling up as the water evaporates when rubbed again skin. \n\nHowever, the comment sections and many other blog posts insist that the gel *does* remove dead skin, many even insisting that their skin has never been better while using the gel. [This](http://www.labmuffin.com/2014/02/fact-check-friday-do-peeling-gels-really-peel-off-my-skin/) photo experiment reveals that gels still ball up when rubbed on a non-skin surface - albeit more slowly - and concludes that they function more as a physical exfoliant as the beads are gently rubbed, especially when mixed with oil on the skin. \n\nAnyway, I was doing my nails last night and used this [gel cuticle remover](http://www.amazon.com/Sally-Hansen-Cuticle-Remover-0-9oz/dp/B003VDGIU4/ref=sr_1_4_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1459262400&sr=8-4&keywords=gel+cuticle+remover)(not affiliate link) from Sally Hansen to remove my cuticles and noticed that the formula begins balling up when I am scraping my cuticles with a wooden stick. I tried a blob on my hand, began to rub it, and it balls up as well! It occurred to me that this could somehow be similar to peeling gels, so I looked up its ingredient list. \n\n\n**Sally Hansen gel cuticle remover:** Water, **Trisodium Phosphate**, **Polyethylene**, Butylene Glycol, Laureth 4, **Acrylates/C10 30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer**, **Urea**, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, **Sodium Hydroxide**, Disodium EDTA, Actinidia Chinensis (Kiwi) Fruit Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Extract, Melaleuca Altemifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, 1 2 Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Fragrance, Potassium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Green 3, Yellow 5 Lake\n\n\n**Cure natural aqua gel:** Water (activated hydrogen water^lol, non-acidic and purified), glycerin, **acrylates/C10-30, alkyl acrylate crosspolymer**, dicocodimonium, chloride, steartrimonium bromide, aloe barbadensis leaf extract, gingko biloba extract, rosmarinus officinalis/rosemary leaf extract, butylene glycol\n\n\nOk, so they both have acrylates/C10-30 and alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, which doesn’t mean anything yet. It just means that they both ball up. The cuticle remover also has trisodium phosphate and sodium hydroxide, which makes the formula very basic (~pH12-14) and breaks down dead skin (i.e. the cuticle) and urea which softens skin. The peeling gel does not have such elements to facilitate the breaking down of skin (imagine the horror! Us pH lifers will fall over catatonic). I checked out the ingredient lists of other cuticle removers, and the basic functioning formulas are to include either basic cleaning agents like potassium hydroxide/sodium hydroxide and/or gentler AHAs to exfoliate dead skin off. I also checked the ingredient lists of other peeling gels - they are all very different, but they all seem to contain the basic mechanism of some kind of plasticky compound that will ball up when the water evaporates. \n\n*I’m not sure what to make of all of this, but here are my questions:*\n\nWhy does my cuticle remover contain acrylates/C10-30 and alkyl acrylate crosspolymer when the basic compounds are enough to dissolve dead skin? \n\nIs it just to affect the consistency of the product? But there are so many other ways to make a gel formula without it balling up! \n\nOr does the balling up make consumers think that it’s all dead cuticle coming off instead of just *some* dead cuticle coming off? The cuticle gel does work - my cuticle comes off, but what I mean is if the balling-up action gives the *impression* that more gunk is being removed than not?\n\nJUST LIKE HOW THEY MAKE CONSUMERS THINK THAT ALL THE BALLS ARE THEIR SKIN COMING OFF WITH PEELING GELS?!\n\nI'm having an existential crisis, u gaiz. \n\nTo be fair, I do think that peeling gels probably work, but just not as advertised. I’ve personally not used one yet as I don’t need another product in my routine. I believe the ingredients just ball up, physically exfoliate the skin, and dead skin cells start to adhere to the balls. The stickiness of the balls is what differentiates peeling gels from regular scrubs, as scrubs essentially lift some dead skin and move it around the face and hence give the impression that they are less effective. Some peeling gels have fruit enzymes and AHAs that claim to exfoliate skin, so I can see how those have both physical and chemical mechanisms to make skin smoother. \n\nI don’t know, what was my question/concern again? I really would like people with a chemistry background to weigh in on this (I vaguely remember titration in high school and that's about it) It’s burning a hole in my brain. Am I completely off-base here, or does this absurdly random connection I made have any merit? People with peeling gel experience - what do you think? \n\n...\n\nI think I just spent my breakfast period attempting to debunk the peeling gel myth for the *nth+1* time by comparing it to a cuticle remover. Thank god I mostly work from home. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME.\n",

Because a lot of us here are more informed than the average consumer, products are often developed by look and feel. Test markets reveal all kinds of weird things consumers think makes a product *seem* like it is working more so than, if it actually is. \n\nI used to work for a cosmetics company that also had a shampoo line. People would try to return the shampoo all the time because there was \"not enough foam\" (p.s.-that's often a GOOD thing in a shampoo and was also in this case) because to them, more foam=more clean, even if that isn't the case. Later when said company was sold, new company made the shampoo more \"foamy\" because, people are dumb but, I am sure they sell more of it, so.\n\nAs for peeling gels, I personally think they are bogus but, I just don't use them.

Almost all cuticle gels and callus removing products are full of sodium hydroxide (which you listed as an ingredient). This is lye, and the pH is high, very high. As in, burn your skin off and kill you high pH. It's the exact same chemical used to emulsify fat and oils to create plain soaps. (I used to buy sodium hydroxide because I made soap.) the pH is so high that you use vinegar to counteract it if it gets on your skin. This is how it literally dissolves skin anywhere you put it. \n\nTd;dr : Don't put sodium hydroxide on your face! Sodium hydroxide is buffered to some extent in these products, but at the least it will harshly remove your moisture barrier as it emulsify/soaponifies it... At the worst, you will get a serious chemical burn and scarring on your fragile facial skin!",

    "body": "Skin type: Oily, acne-prone  tho years of skincare I think my skin is now normal to oily (esp in t-zone).\n\nI already have a solid routine from my trial and error journey but I can't help myself to try new things out. After all, skincare for me is therapeutic and I don't wanna get bored doing it.\n\n**TL;DR** I love the Oxecure Ultra Gentle Moisturizer.  Oxecure cleanser irritated my skin. I still love Human Heart Nature Nourishing  Cleanser.\n\n**Oxecure Ultra Gentle Moisturizer***Ingredients:*  Water,  Glycerin, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, C15-19 Alkane,  Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/vp Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polydecene,  Propanediol, Glyceryl Stearate, Phenoxyethanol, PEG-100 Stearate,  Squalane, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Chlorphenesin,  Phytosteryl/Octyldodecyl Lauroyl Glutamate, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA,  Panthenol, Alpha-glucan Oligosaccharide, Potassium Hydroxide,  Maltodextrin, Polymnia Sonchifolia Root Juice, Ceteareth-25, Propylene  Glycol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Cetyl Alcohol, BHT,  Lactobacillus, Pantolactone, Behenic Acid, Ceramide NP, Cholesterol,  Ceramide NS, Ethylhexylglycerin, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract,  Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide EOS, Caprooyl Phytosphingosine,  Caprooyl Sphingosine, Ascrobyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Glyceryl Oleate,  Lecithin, Tocopherol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Calendula  Officinalis Flower Extract, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Chamomilla  Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Hypericum Perforatum  Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract, Tilia Cordata Flower Extract\n\n*Notable ingredients:* 5 types of ceramides - Ceramide NP, Ceramide NS, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide EOS paired with Cholesterol and fatty acids - Caprooyl Phytosphingosine & Caprooyl Sphingosine to mimic skin's barrier function.\n\nAlso has glycerin, panthenol, pantolactone, lactobacillus, squalane, and aloe extract.\n\nFor reference I've tried the well-loved **Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream** which unfortunately broke me out. I also hate its texture and how it sits on top of my skin. Then there's the **Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Soothing Gel** which gave me a more pleasant experience than the cream. I have gone three bottles of it already. So yea, I loved it but I also found it boring. Like it's just your regular moisturizer - *Oh no, OP discovered how moisturizer works.*\n\nAnd oxecure moisturizer came into the picture. From the list of ingredients above it is way moooore extensive than the ceramide gel so I was afraid it would break me out. Fortunately, it didn't. In fact, I like it better than the ceramide gel! It is lightweight but you'll know you have applied it unlike with the gel which absorbs completely with my skin. Nevertheless, I still like it for that coz I feel like the previous products I have applied are sealed. It also doesn't pill with my sunscreen. One drawback - it is expensive. 700 pesos for 75 ml.\n\nAlso soothes my skin when it is irritated especially when the horror of using the Oxecure cleanser happened.\n\n**Oxecure ph 5.5 Gentle Cleanser***Ingredients:*  Water,  Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Cocamidopropyl Betaine,  Glycerin, Sodium Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate,  Cocamide MEA, Citric Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Oat Amino Acids, Potassium  Sorbate, Disodium EDTA, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Ethylhexylglycerin,  Ceramide 3, Garcinia Mangostana (Mangosteen) Peel Extract, Centella  Asiatica Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Sctutellaria  Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinesis Leaf Extract, Chamomilla  Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root  Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Aloe  Barbadensis Leaf Juice\n\nSurfactants: Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES), Cocamidopropyl Betaine (CAPB), Sodium Lauroyl Oat Amino Acids\n\nFrom the first week of using it, I really liked it. It didn't dry my skin out. However, days after my skin started to turn red and patchy whenever I used it. I don't know which ingredient/s sensitized my skin. I'm pretty sure not the SLES and CAPB as they are present to Celeteque cleanser (which I liked). And considering it has lot of hydrating and moisturizing ingredients, kinda bummer this turned out to be a holy fail for me. My body enjoys it now tho. Still, for me it is worth trying coz who knows it might work perfectly for you.\n\nA hunt for a cleanser started. I was using Celeteque Hydration Cleanser for years already. I didn't have any problems with it except that sometimes I feel like it kinda dries my skin especially when my skin is retinizing from tretinoin use. Still I should've stuck with *if ain't broke, don't fix it* mantra.\n\nSo one day I was at Watsons, just the usual window shopping of products. And I stumbled upon Human Heart Nature products and saw the **nourishing** variant cleanser. It brought back memories when I was just starting with skincare. When I was hopeless and felt like every products I used were not helping with my skin concerns, that cleanser gave me hope. I experienced the real definition of gentle cleansing after trying harsh scrubs and whatnot on my face.\n\n*Ingredients:*  water, decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside, glycerin, Solanum lycopersicum  (tomato) fruit extract, carrageenan, tocopherol, sodium lactate, sodium gluconate, dicaprylyl ether, glyceryl oleate, hydrogenated palm  glycerides citrate, parfum, levulinic acid, sodium levulinate, phytic  acid, p-anisic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid\n\n*Surfuctants:* decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside - derived from coconut so be warry if you're sensitive to it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo fast forward I bought a bottle of it. I used it for a week before giving my verdict. And now I can say that it is still the gentlest cleanser I have ever used. My skin feels supple whenever I use it. Although it has now a different packaging from what I can remember, it's still my first love. That feeling when everything feels right.\n\n*Hoy vevs iba na 'yan.*",

    "body": "Hiya,\n\nI hope you enjoy the below reviews. I'm just a regular consumer buying everything with my own money - i.e., nothing sponsored, etc. Note, I've bought all of them on sale for around AUD$15-20 because I like sales haha. \n\nProducts:\n\n1. PKY - essence toner;\n2. PKY - mist toner;\n3. Secret Key - fresh nature toner - milk brightening one;\n4. Benton - Aloe BHA Toner;\n5. Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 Relief Toner; and\n6. Purito - Centella Green Level Calming Toner & the unscented version (Purito Unscented Centella Toner)\n\nMy skin used to be severely dry but is now slightly dry on the cheek areas and slightly oily on the t-zone during summer and slightly dry on the whole face in the winter.\n\nAlso note that the below two PKY products have different 'actives'/hero ingredients notwithstanding them seemingly being quite similar! I've bolded the plant extracts under the ingredient headers below.\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Essence Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495), Australian websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. *Note, this one is generally recommended for people with drier skin whereas the mist version is generally recommended for those with oilier skin* Friends with eczema have also used this with success. *.* I can use both year round without breaking out. I've had friends with oilier skin who've used this one and have broken out. YMMV.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** LOVE THIS. May repurchase this for the rest of my life. I've used this after breaking my moisture barrier, after chemical peels, after active masks, and also *after getting my face ablatively lasered (after the the initial few days of only using an ointment)*. It's REALLY benign in a godly way. If you want it to do anything other than hydrate or increase the penetration of your other actives, this isn't the product for you (note, it doesn't claim to do anything else apart from hydrate & calm really).\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a little bit thicker than water but not as thick as the Purito centella toners. Won't run off your hand/face like water will but will eventually run off.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** None at allll, even when I broke my moisture barrier.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? Yes**/I have rebought this 4 or so times so far.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Mist Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance. This is in a spray bottle and is better suited to oily skinned persons.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL.

This one is more for people with slightly oilier skin too. It's a lighter formula than the essence one.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Decent hydration, I prefer to use this in the toner stage instead of after my skincare but I have enjoyed using it as a 'refreshing' spray during the day.\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a nice mist, doesn't run on the face. Feels like a spray of water?\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a spray bit on top. I've had no issues with it but one mate had a couple that didn't spray properly.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** Unsure. I've rebought it once but haven't gone to use this one as much as I have the PKY essence toner or the Purito Unscented Centella Toner. I also don't like mists a whole bunch as they can go onto your clothes (if you're out) or jewellery if you're wearing any. But, I did go through a phase of keeping it in my handbag and using it when out and about for a bit of hydration.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Coptis Japonica Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Secret Key - Fresh nature Toner (Milk Brightening)**\n\n**What is it:** Hydrating toner that's meant to brighten your skin.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx.

Couldn't use it long enough to notice anything. \n\n**Smell:** A very strong scent that I could barely use it. I think I used it around 5-10 times before binning it - I couldn't even put up with the scent of this to use it on other parts of my body.\n\n**Feel:** really watery.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Fortunately (given the high fragrance), no reactions to this. If you had any irritation though, I'd expect some sort of reaction.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? No**, given I threw mine out.\n\n**Ingredients:** Not a comprehensive list given there's a generic list on yesstyle then a list below it for the main ones in the milk one but here -\n\n700ppm) \\[**sic**\\], 1, 2-Hexandiol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata Extract, Nonoxynol-12, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Tremella Fuciformis Extract, Allantoin, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Cucumber Extract, Propylene Glycol, Tomato Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Rice Extract, Lanoline, Tea Tree Leaf Water (9, Sciadopitys Verticillata Root Extract, Pumpkin Extract, Papaya Fruit Extract, Oleth-10, Viola Tricolor Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Ethanol, Glyceryl Stearate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Chamomilia Recutita Flower Extract, Morus Alba Bark Extract, Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Lemon Extract, Oleth-5, Sodium Hyaluronate, Potato Extract, Pomegranate Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Sap Extract, Bean Extract, Aloe Vera Leaf Water (9, Broccoli Extract, Glycerin, Green Tea Extract, Plantago Asiatica Extract, Hollyhock Root Extract, Witch Hazel Extract (9, Phenoxyethanol, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Mineral Oil, Ulmus Campestris Extract, Carrot Extract, Polysorbate 80, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rose Damascena Flower Water (9, Korean Raspberry Extract, Milk Protein Extract (9, White Willow Bark Extract, Psidium Guajava Fruit Extract, Witch Hazel Extract, 4-Terpineol, Algae Extract\n\nand then it says the main ones in the milk version are -\n\ngalactomyces ferment filtrate, pomegranate extract, physalis alkenkengi extract, milk protein concentrate, raspberry extract, pasque flower extract, potato extract, carrot extract, pumpkin extract, rice extract, usnea extract, broccoli extract\n\nso who really knows what's in it...\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Benton Aloe BHA Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating toner which is meant to gently exfoliate with 0.5% salicylic acid.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$23. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/benton-aloe-bha-skin-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1053033537), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** people with sensitive and dry skin as it's quite rich.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** on and off since mid 2020, still using it randomly to just use it up.\n\n**My thoughts:** Per Google (may not be accurate), it has a pH of 5.5 which is too high for there to be any noticeable exfoliation with 0.5% BHA present. I've not noticed any calming effects. It is definitely hydrating but given it's advertised as a BHA toner I'm quite disappointed at the lack of BHA efficacy here. I would much rather use the purito centella toner to hydrate and calm my skin as the centella has other benefits such as helping to stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent. \n\n**Feel:** Similar to the PKY essence toner. Not as thick as the purito centella toners.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a pump on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **No**, almost threw it out but am trying to use it up.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nAloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Water (80%), Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Beta-Glucan, Polyglutamic Acid, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Portulaca Oleracea (Green Purslane) Extract, Psidium Guajava (Guava) Fruit Extract, Salicylic Acid (0.5%), Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract (200mg), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice (200mg), Arginine, Pentylene Glycol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Polysorbate 20, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**E**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804)**tude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 relief toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$25 for 180mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/etude-house-soon-jung-ph-5-5-relief-toner-180ml-180ml/info.html/pid.1058586258), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone. It adds light hydration with benign ingredients - akin to the PKY toners but very minimally more expensive. It'd be good if you have irritated and/or dry skin.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** I used it once/twice a day until I used it up. Bought it in December 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Pretty decent. I'd recommend this to the same group of people who'd use the PKY essence toner. Nothing ground breaking. I prefer the calming nature of the Purito Unscented Centella Toner or even the PKY essence toner if you want zero actives (if you consider centella an 'active').\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent. \n\n**Feel:** A watery toner. \n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** No but for no fault of the product. I just prefer using the Purito Unscented Centella one as it's just as benign, a bit cheaper, and has the benefits of centella.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, Propanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Madecassoside, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Polyglycerin-3, Disodium EDTA\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**Centella Green Level Calming Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804) **& the** [**Centella Unscented Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380)\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating and calming toner - may also stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$30 but I've always bought it on sale for approx. AUD$20-25 for 200mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380), [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml)\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone however this is best suited to those with any sort of irritation, acne, or redness. That is, if you have basically perfect skin you're probably not going to notice much of a difference but if you have irritation etc then you'll likely fall in love. Also good if you're wanting to help stimulate collagen production especially for the low price point - target ages for this is probably mid twenties and up.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** religiously since April 2020, sometimes twice a day.\n\n**My thoughts:** *BLOODY EXCELLENT*. I'm on my second bottle of this. My first bottle was the first listed one (scented) and then they released the unscented one so I bought that! It's incredible. I love it. In my opinion, it's partially why my skin is able to tolerate me using actives so much. It's excellent to use before actives as it doesn't interact with anything and really good to use after an 'active' mask or a clay mask etc. I switched to the unscented one to just reduce the risk of irritation. \n\n*also studies, which I haven't read but have seen derms I trust on insta etc, say that* ***centella can help stimulate/produce collagen... a big yes from me given it's a calming ingredient that shouldn't purge you or break you out*** *(unless you're allergic/sensitive to it)!*\n\n**Smell:** The scented one smells herbaceous (akin to Asian herbal medicine - I don't mind it but others may). The unscented one doesn't really smell like anything / I don't notice any scent. \n\n**Feel:** thick/fat/heavy water. Not a watery toner. Enjoyable.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Neverrrrrr, this helps me reduce the side effects from using actives such as retinoids, AHAs, BHAs, etc.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **Yes** & I have. Will probably rebuy for life.\n\n**Ingredients:** 4 variants as they've got the scented and unscented versions, and then those with and without witch hazel\n\nnon-witch hazel unscented version -\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract (strengthens skin barrier), Butylene Glycol (humectants), Pentylene Glycol (skin-conditioning agents), Dipropylene Glycol (humectants), 1,2-Hexanediol (stabilizers), Trehalose (humectants), Sodium Hyaluronate (natural moisturizing factor/ humectants), Hamemelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiaticoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiatic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Madecassic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Panthenol (strengthens skin barrier), Carbomer (viscosity increasing agents), Allantoin (skin protectants), Arginine (skin-conditioning agents), Portulaca Oleracea Extract (skin-conditioning agents), Ethylhexylglycerin (skin-conditioning agents), Disodium EDTA (stabilizers)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope these reviews were useful & feel free to ask any questions / start any discussions :)",

    "body": "I rarely see this sunscreen being talked about on this sub and it breaks my heart! I feel so happy with my purchase that I decided to write an in-depth review. I was recently on the hunt for a new sunscreen because I got too tired looking up which reformulations of Biore Watery Essence were good and I honestly preferred something Korean (I’m Korean so it’s easier for me to look up information and Korean products tend to arrive faster in Canada than Japanese products imo).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Skin Type:** Slightly oily but dehydrated, flaky around my mouth. I’m on tretinoin 0.025 which I use every 2-3 nights.\n\n**Skin Tone:** Fair-medium, I wear a no. 21 in terms of Korean foundations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile this sunscreen is touted as being a gel, it looks like a lotion at first glance. It is white and appears creamy in the tube. However, it spreads on my skin completely colourless and does not feel heavy. This sunscreen appears to be completely chemical and contains no zinc or physical sunscreens, so I imagine this is why there is no white cast. It is slightly thicker than Biore Watery Essence, but still sits very light on the skin. For that reason, I think this might be good for people with dry skin who like the finish of Biore but want something less drying. (Biore lists alcohol as its second ingredient, while Etude House lists alcohol as its fourth ingredient.)\n\n>**Ingredients:** WATER, ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE, HOMOSALATE, ALCOHOL, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE, DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE, ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE, SILICA, NIACINAMIDE, CAPRYLYL METHICONE, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, DIMETHICONE/VINYL DIMETHICONE CROSSPOLYMER, AMMONIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE/VP COPOLYMER, PROPANEDIOL, SACCHARIDE HYDROLYSATE, OCTYLDODECANOL, ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, TROMETHAMINE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, ADENOSINE, HYDROXYPROPYL METHYLCELLULOSE STEAROXY ETHER, CENTELLA ASIATICA EXTRACT, PORTULACA OLERACEA EXTRACT, HOUTTUYNIA CORDATA EXTRACT, CURCUMA LONGA (TURMERIC) ROOT EXTRACT, ECHIUM PLANTAGINEUM SEED OIL, SALVIA HISPANICA SEED EXTRACT, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF EXTRACT, BAMBUSA VULGARIS WATER, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL UNSAPONIFIABLES, CARDIOSPERMUM HALICACABUM FLOWER/LEAF/VINE EXTRACT, GLYCERIN, PHENOXYETHANOL, ETHYL HEXANEDIOL, IRIS FLORENTINA ROOT EXTRACT, CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA (MATRICARIA) FLOWER/LEAF EXTRACT, TOCOPHEROL, FRAGRANCE\n\nAs you can see from the ingredients list, there is a ton of good stuff in the latter half of the list including niacinamide, adenosine, centella, aloe, and a bunch of other extracts. We all know that all this might not mean much if there’s only 0.000001% of it in there, but I do feel like my skin is calm and happy with this product. With Biore, I never broke out or became dry but I also felt like my skin was… chemically? And for some reason, while Biore dried down to a lighter sheen I also found myself more oily in the afternoon compared to Etude House. I guess my dehydrated skin was over-compensating for the drier finish. There is fragrance in this gel, but I don’t particularly notice any scent. If there is one, it’s unoffensive to say the least.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am prone to acne, hence the tretinoin, but I don’t think I clog too easily. I have never broken out with this product, but YMMV if you have more acne-prone skin than I do. Also, this sunscreen is not sweat or waterproof, but it’s perfect if you’re sitting by a window all day or it’s not too humid where you’re located.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI recently went to Korea and Etude House had BOGO sales for ALL their sunscreens. You bet I stocked up and got my family some sun protection gifts! I bought 2 jumbo sized tubes (150 mL) for 25,000 won or around 23 USD and 2 regular sized tubes (50 mL) for 12,000 won or around 10 USD. It is priced more expensively online, but it’s cheaper than Biore for me on eBay shipping to Canada.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll in all, this is the perfect sunscreen for me :) Please consider this if you’re on the hunt for a sunscreen.",

Also the price is insanely good; hopefully eBay offers similar pricing. Good sun care luck to us all.",

        "body": "I have dry skin and I loved it!!! It is not greasy nor drying and I would really recommend this to people who hate the feeling of sunscreen.\n\n\n(Honestly, I do not get why the biore one is so popular... it is drying due to the alcohol, it contains lemon extract (which is very irritating to the skin) and the scent is too strong. My sensitive skin hates it! But I guess that the biore is good compared to US sunscreens (Im from Europe so I am more spoiled with UV filters))\n\n\nAnyways, I love the way the etude sungel applies on my skin. It works to well under make up and it feels like I have applied nothing!!I also love the fact they have a jumbo sizes version of the sungel  Just most chemical filters STING my eyes like hell. So I had to stop using it. (My eyes hate ethylhexyl metoxcinamate and homosalate, the only chemical uv filters I can use are tinascorb I think...)\n\n\nBut I bought this for my mom (extremely dry skin) and my sister (oily acne prone skin) and they both love it. On a side note tho, my friend who has lots of flower allergies (so many she cant count) had an allergic reaction to it. Not sure if it is the fragrance or one of the extracts at the end of the ingredient list.",

    "body": "I must admit, I bought this without giving it a lot of thought, as this was before I really began to do a lot of skincare and Asian beauty research.  But boy am I glad I did!  It’s also the first time I’ve ever used a cleansing balm and aside from pictures and descriptions, I didn’t really know what to expect!  So let's get to it!!\n\n---\n##**Packaging:**\n\n\nI really wish I took a picture of this thing before I started using it because it was so pretty!  Here’s what it looks like now after about a month of use:  http://imgur.com/defsUXI and  http://imgur.com/dTm3jSt\n\n\nEven though it comes in tub form, it provides a little spatula to keep it sanitized.  As you can see, I like to spatula only one side so I can still have a section that is un-touched and extremely smooth looking!! \n\n---\n##**Application:**\n\n\nI use this as the first cleanser in my double-cleanse routine at night, and the MRCS as my second.  The directions say to massage this product onto your face and then tissue it off.  I actually didn’t know these were the directions when I started using it so I always just washed it off instead of tissue-ing it off and it’s worked for me.  I only found out about the actual instructions later after reading skinandtonic’s review of the original lol.  I imagine tissue-ing it off would help with make-up removal immensely, but I haven’t tried (or needed to).\n\n---\n##**Smell:**\n\n\nThis cleanser doesn’t have any added fragrance (yay for you peeps with this sensitivity!), but it does have a faint, fresh floral scent.  I personally like it a lot!\n\n---\n##**Performance/Results:**\n\n\nOverall, this is one of my top cleansers; the Su:m37 MRCS is #1, and this is #2.  Compared to my old Shiseido White Lucent Cleansing Foam (which had a pH of 9.5, yikes!!), this cleansing balm is AMAZING.  It makes my face feel extremely soft and smooth after cleansing and I don’t get that dry, squeaky, tight feeling that I used to get with the Shiseido cleanser.  I think it might actually be slightly more moisturizing than the MRCS!  I have really dry skin in general, so this was a huge plus.  It also doesn’t leave behind any greasy residue like some cleansing oils or OCM can.  Finally, if you get it in your eyes, it doesn’t sting but it does blur your vision for a few minutes (I imagine this is because of the oil residue?).  It’s not really a problem for me, since I can wash it off after a few tries or I just use my MCRS right afterwards and it takes care of that issue.\n\n\nAs a make-up remover, I’d say it’s pretty good.  You may need a dedicated make-up remover for those really hard to remove make up though (I’m looking at you Kiss Me Mascara).\n\n---\n##**Ingredients:**\n\n\nThis is kind of the main reason I LOVE this cleanser so much!  It has a pretty damn rockstar ingredients list.  The full list can be found here: http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_4575161484.html \n\n\nI’ve included an analysis of some of the ingredients below.  It’s a massive wall of text, but the TL;DR is that they’re all pretty great. \n\n\n- *Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride:* This is the triglyceride fraction from coconut and is not the entire coconut oil, so it should be less comedogenic than straight-up coconut oil.  Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride has also been shown to be a non-irritating and non-sensitizing solvent, is an acceptable vehicle for topical applications [1], and is just a great overall moisturizer.  Additionally, it’s anti-inflammatory properties may actually reduce the risk of breakouts.  Finally, it has some occlusive properties to help resist water loss!\n\n\n- *Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil (Argan oil):* I don’t really need to go into this much, everyone knows about the moisturizing benefits of argan oil! It’s also got some medicinal uses against rheumatism and the healing of burns apparently.\n\n\n- *Oenothera Biennis Oil (evening primrose oil):* Evening primrose oil is rich in fatty acids, including linoleic (LA), oleic, and y-linolenic acids (GLA), that help repair the skin and improve the skin’s barrier function.  These fatty acids also have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, acne reducing and moisture retention properties!  However, it appears that evening primrose oil’s stabilizing effect on the stratum corneum barrier works only with a water-in-oil emulsion formulation (which I believe Banila Co. Clean It Zero Purity is, phew!) [2]. It also looks like it has some anti-irritant properties as well [3], so I have no idea why cosdna gives it an irritant rating of 2.  I imagine the anti-inflammatory properties should also make it more likely to help prevent acne instead of causing it, and LA is also supposedly very beneficial for acne-prone skin.  So again, not sure why cosdna rates it as 2 on acne.  Those that are acne prone, please let me know if evening primrose oil breaks you out.\n\n\n- *Portulaca oleracea extract (a type of succulent):* Seems to have wound healing properties [4], muscle relaxant properties [5], and analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. \n\n\n- *Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (Licorice root):* I think it’s pretty widely accepted that licorice root is an awesome active for skincare purposes.  It’s got anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and brightening properties!\n\n\n- *Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract (green tea):* Antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties!  Please note that most research seems to agree that green tea has potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties while applied topically; however, I’m not sure that the anti-carcinogenic properties are really that effective when used topically (compared to drinking it!).  There does seem to be some research that shows green tea extract can also prevent collagen breakdown and reduce UV damage to your skin [7 & 8].  \n\n\n- *Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract:* Who doesn’t love aloe?\n\n\n- *Beta-Carotene:* good antioxidant/helps protect against sun damage [9 & 10], but this benefit is dose dependent!  Too much can actually generate oxidative damage (e.g. cell and tissue damage) [11].  I’m going to assume that because this is rather far down the ingredients list that it’s probably within the optimal amount to be beneficial.\n\n\nThe rest of the ingredients all look pretty solid, but I only had time to do a quick search on them. I don’t really see any “bad” ingredients.  Sources will be provided in comments since this post is already huge.\n\n\n---\n##**Overall Summary:**\n\n\n\nPros:\n\n- gentle and FAN-Freaking-TASTIC ingredients (unless you’re actually allergic to one or more of them…)\n\n- non-stripping\n\n- non-greasy\n\n- moisturizing \n\n- not messy \n\n\nCons:\n\n- a little pricey\n\n- I can’t figure out the pH of this thing because I don’t think pH strips work for this mostly oil based cleanser.  But that’s not really the fault of the cleanser…\n\n---\n**Would I recommend this product?**  Hellz-to-the-yeah!!\n\n\nThanks for reading, it's my first review post, hooray!\n\n\nEdit: argh how the hell do you format this thing?!\n",

    "body": "**Personal Info:**\n\nI live in nothern europe, so currently cold, windy and dry Climate. My Skintype is sahara desert dry, prone to closed comedones plus some light hormonal acne. Sadly im also super prone to hyperpigmentation. My main Goals are barrier health, hydration, acne & Hyperpigmentation management and getting rid of the damn stubborn CC\\`s... I also follow a kinda skincycling routine wich includes a non AB Retinal product.\n\nIn **Bold** will be the product name + how long i have been using it\n\nin *italic* will be the ingredients i liked\n\n\n\n**Axis-Y Sunday morning cleanser: (using for a month now)** *green tea extract, centella extract, allatonin*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Coco-Betaine, Butylene Glycol, Potassium Cocoate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Benzoate, Polyquaternium-67, Xylitylglucoside, Citric Acid, Anhydroxylitol, Propanediol, Xylitol, Betula Platyphylla Japonica Juice, Glucose, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Disodium EDTA, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Agrimonia Eupatoria Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Dipropylene Glycol, Allantoin, Perilla Frutescens Leaf Extract, Saponaria Officinalis Extract, Sodium Acetate, Pentylene Glycol, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Kigelia Africana Fruit Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Natto Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxycinnamic Acid, Rutin\n\nTexture:\n\na balmy texture, foams up to a dense and soft foam\n\nExpirience:\n\nI picked this up because I wanted to change from my old clenaser to something that felt like it had a bit more cleansing power, yet was not stripping. As far as i can tell it seems to accomplish that. It foams up nicely, cleans well and doesent seem to strip my Skin. After washing it off it feels almost as if there is a slight layer on my Skin, but i dont mind it/ think that it contributes to the non stripping?\n\n(4/5)\n\n**Cosrx Propolis Toner: (about a month 1/2 of use)** *propolis, honey extract, panthenol*\n\nIngredients:\n\nPropolis Extract, Honey Extract, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Cassia Obtusifolia Seed Extract, Panthenol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride\n\nTexture:\n\na waterlike texture, thats just a bit thicker\n\nExpirience:\n\nTo be honest im not overly impressed... its a nice hydrating toner for sure but i didnt notice anything outstanding that would have me choose it again. But it gets a pluspoint for being reasonably priced so i migth pick it up again to reach free shipping...\n\n(3/5)\n\n**Holika Holika Aloe Waterproof Sungel (3 Months of use)** *Aloe*\n\nIngredients:\n\nAqua, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Niacinamide, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Caprylyl Methicone, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hippophae Rhamnoides Fruit Extract, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract, Rosa Canina Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Extract, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Juice, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Pentylene Glycol, Behenyl Alcohol, Poly C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Decyl Glucoside, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, T-butyl Alcohol, Tocopherol, Ascorbic Acid, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Ceramide Np, Phytosphingosine, Parfum\n\nTexture:\n\na thin cream Texture, not runny but almost there\n\nExpirience:\n\nIt comes in quite a big size for a Sunscreen, you can find 80 - 100 ml Tubes online for around 15-17 Euros! Wich honestly was the sole reason why i bougth it xD i figured my skin would be fine with the Ingredients and i just hate tiny sunscreens! And well... that was exactly what it is like, its decently moisturizing and doesnt irritate my Skin. But if you have sensitive Skin be careful, it does have Fragrance, smells kinda like very artificial Aloe. You can smell it but only upon first apllication, it doesnt linger. I have been using 1 bottle for 3 months and still have enough for another month at min. so a win!\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n**Purito Dermide Cica Barrier Sleeping Mask: (3 months of use)** *Squalane, Centella Extract, Jojoba oil, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Ceramide*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract(250,000Ppm), Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Squalane, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Butylene Glycol, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Panthenol, Ceramide NP(3,000Ppm), Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyacetophenone, Sodium Carbomer, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract\n\nTexture:\n\nA thick Cream, feels quite emmolient\n\nExpirience:\n\nI love, love, loe this! Its the first moisturizer that i found that feels like it actually does its job well on my Skin. As a nigthtime moisturizer it keeps my Skin hydrated all through the Night and has my wake up nicely glowy. I love to use this when my Skin is irritated, it really soothes it quickly. Always have this on my Shelf, you would have to pry it out of my dead cold hands, to seperate me from it. One Bottle last me about 2 months.\n\nHG!\n\n(5/5)\n\n**Mary & May Blackberry Cream Essence: (4 months of use)** *Jojoba oil, ceramides, lotus water, centella*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Nymphaea Caerulea Flower Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit Extract, 1,2-hexanediol, Methlypropanediol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Hydrolyzed Gardenia Florida Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Trilaureth-4 Phoshate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Pvm/Ma Copolymer, Cyanocobalamin, Ceramide Np, Maltodextrin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopherol\n\nTexture:\n\nthin, watery but creamy? (just realized i suck at describing textures haha)\n\nExpirience:\n\nA really nice hydrating and moisturizing Toner, feels like a great balance of the two. Acts nicely as a layer with other Skincare because it absorbs really well. I like it, a bottle lasts me about 2 months.\n\n(4/5)\n\n**Abib Quick Sunstick Protection Bar: ( 3 months of use)** *Aloe, Centella, Ceramides*\n\nIngredients:\n\nOctyldodecanol, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Dibutyl Ethylhexanoyl Glutamide, Dibutyl Lauroyl Glutamide, Diisostearyl Malate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dextrin Palmitate, Octocrylene, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Saccharide Isomerate, Maltodextrin, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethyl Hexanediol, Ceramide NP, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol\n\nTexture:\n\nA translucent stick, glides on smooth, feels a bit occlusive on skin\n\nExpirience:\n\nNicely moisturizing Sunstick, feels good on my Skin and well... does its Job xD I really like the curved shape of it, it relly helps with the application. I just use it for reapplication of my sunscreen, but also sometimes when my Skin gets really dry during the day ( tho its not the best for that)\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n**Numbuzin No.2 Protein 43% creamy Serum: ( 4 months of use)** *Oat protein, Ceramides, cholesterol, fatty acids, ferments, Rice protein*\n\nIngredients:\n\nAvena Sativa Protein Extract, Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Poly C6-14 Olefin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Erythritol, Limnanthes Alba Seed Oil, Sodium Chloride, Allantoin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Adenosine, Dextrin, Theobroma Cacao Extract, Pantolactone, Ceramide NP, Cholesterol, Palmitic Acid, Oryza Sativa Seed Protein Extract, Stearic Acid, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Lactobacillus Ferment, Glycine Soja Protein, Hydrolyzed Lupine Protein, Glucose, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Sweet Almond Protein, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Myristic Acid, Hydrolyzed Pea Protein, Arachidic Acid, Lauric Acid, Sodium Succinate, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance\n\nTexture:\n\nVery thick serum, really is creamy like the name says\n\nExpirience:\n\nSooo repairing and soothing, does wonders for my barrier. It really helps keep my Skin moisturized and helps keep my transepidermal waterloss in check. Love it so much! HG!\n\n(5/5)\n\n**Purito Aha Bha Refreshing Solution: (1 month of use)** *Glycolic acid, Salcylic Acid*\n\nIngredients:\n\nSalix Alba (Willow) Bark Water, Butylene Glycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid (7%), Tromethamine, Water, Salicylic Acid(2%), 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Citrate, Arginine, Caprylyl Glycol, Citric Acid(0.28%), Hydroxyacetophenone, Pentylene Glycol, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Disodium EDTA\n\nTexture:\n\nlike water, it put 2-3 drops on a thin cotton pad and swipe over my Face with it\n\nExpirience:\n\nSince it has only been a month i cannot say too much about how it has worked (and i feel its hard to tell what effects on my skin is retinal and whats from this product) but my comedones are reducing in size and developing into breakouts. But the effects of these ingredients are well studied in these concentrations so i would say its save to say it works. Its my first time using glycolic acid and i can say it packs a punch for sure! So be careful, its intense, so far im using it once a week on my exfoliation day and i dont think ill be moving up.... Might also be the fact that its a combo product, but i have been using salcylic acid and mandelic acid in combo before, and that felt less sensitizing. So im attributing that factor to the 7 percent glycolic acid, since it is the smallest molecule size of all Aha\\`s.\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow lets move to quick first impressions of a few products i just started trying, wich i have seperated from the review portion because i just havent been using them long enough to really speak about the effects on my Skin: (these will also be shorter impressions with less info)\n\n\n\n**Neo:labs liquid enhancer Pycogenol:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Propanediol, Hydrogenated Poly C6-14 Olefin, 1.2-Hexanediol, Methylpropanediol, Glycerin, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Saccharum Officinarum Extract, Jojoba Esters, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Salvia Sclarea Oil, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa Root Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Theobroma Cacao Seed Extract, Melaleuca Altemifolia Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, C18-36 Acid Triglyceride, Coprylyl Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, C12-18 Acid Triglyceride, Squalene, Sodium Polyacrylate, Tromethamine, Albatreus Contuena Extract, Paimitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Phytasteryl Macadamiate, Citric Acid, Phytosterol, Dextrin, Tocopherol, Butylene Glycol, 4-Terpineol, Pentylene Glycol, Octonediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\nExpirience:\n\nBougth this because of the tea tree extract, oil and 4- terpineol for the antimicrobial and antiinflammatory benefits , plus it also promised balancing the water-oil contend of the skin. So far i have been using it for a week and it feels nicely moisturizing, but i cannot say if it has helped with my breakouts. Smells strongly like tea tree, wich i dont mind.\n\n**Isntree Spotsaver Mugwort Ampoule:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nArtemisia Princeps Extract, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth-26, Erythritol, Betaine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Piper Methysticum Leaf/Root/Stem Extract, Panthenol, Propanediol, Beta-Glucan, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Allantoin, Carbomer, Tromethamine, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\nExpirience:\n\nThis i got because i heard amazing things about mugwort and it was on a 50 % Sale, so i got it for a steal! So far i like the simple ingredient list an it seems soothing and hydrating.\n\n**RNW Der.Ceramide Cream:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Ceramide NP, Panthenol, Caprylyl Methicone, Glycerin, C12-16 Alcohols, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Ceramide NS, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Ceramide AS, Ceramide AP, Oligopeptide-1, Ceramide EOP, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Betaine, Arginine, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Carbomer, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Arachidyl Glucoside, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Stearic Acid, Adenosine, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium EDTA\n\nExpirience:\n\nIm really intriged by this brand an was debating between this and the Ceramide serum, but got this Cream. At first i was intimitaded by the essential oils and the strong smell it has (herbal, but to my nose very pleasant) so i patchtested it on my cheek. The Patchtests went fine and i have been using it on my whole face for 4 days now and i must say im impressed.\n\nIf you have oily skin i feel you could hate it but for my dry skin... the texture is amazing. Its a THIIICK cream, like an ointment, very balmy. Upon apllication it feels nice to spread it and it sinks in so well for the thick texture. The cream surprisingly dries down velvety and leaving a protective shield over the Skin. I also love that it has 3 % Panthenol, 3% ceramides and cholesterol and fatty acids.... so perfect ingrdients for skin barrier repair! Really a potential HG...\n\n\n\n",

The one I got was delayed for a while and then apparently the place I purchased it wouldn't send it by surface mail when it was sent back since it's banned from airmail.  It was a bit frustrating it took 2 months to figure that out, but I'm hoping my latest attempt goes better.  Now there's the Ceramidin mist to consider and winter is coming....",

And who posts an entire review for simply one sheet mask???\n\nSomeone who has completely fallen in love with it. \n\nFirst of all, I loved how fitting the sheet mask was. One common complaint of all is how One size of sheet mask doesn't fit every face, but this one was perfect for me.\n\nBut that's not why I'm writing this review. It's because post usage, till few days, my skin looked so plump. It has never looked this good before. \n\nOf course, I would give some credit to the Olay serum and Neutrogena Moisturizer for reducing the appearance of pores, but that plumpness and brightness and glowing skin after using this mask was....Love!!!\n\nI can see myself using this mask before some big event, as I'm not too fond of makeup and prefer it minimal. \n\n**WRP** Definitely yes, and I recommend it too.",

Love this sheet mast, I just wish it came in a face mask version too because I find sheet masks a bit wasteful.",

    "body": "Given the recent info about the shadiness that is Sunday Riley, I've seen a bunch of people mention they want to find an alternative for Good Genes. This inspired me to finally write a review on a potential replacement that I really enjoy, **Makeup Artist's Choice BellEvolve Lac-luronic Serum**. I have never tried Good Genes, nor do I plan to (not trying to spend that much on a single 1oz product) but given the fact that that both are lactic acid serums, I feel like comparing the two products is pretty reasonable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients**: Purified Water, Lactic Acid (15%), Glycerine, Panthanol, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (licorice root extract), Aminopropyl Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Polysaccharide Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Potassium Sorbate\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a 15% lactic acid serum, so I wouldn't call this a beginner product, and has a considerably higher acid percentage than Good Genes, so if you are a GG user that's something to keep in mind. I think my favorite part that initially drew me to it was that the serum is 50% hyaluronic acid so it's hydrating even though it's very exfoliating. It also is super brightening due to the licorice and vitamin c derivative.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso it smells like very expired milk, which if you've used other lactic acid products in the past you might be used to, but I was **not**. Very worth it though, and the smell does fade after a bit. The consistency is kinda runny, similar to Hada Labo gokujyun premium lotion if you've used that before. On the website they say to use a cotton pad, which I tried initially, but I don't think the serum is quite thin enough for the cotton pad to be the best method. It kinda fell off the cotton pad and went on unevenly because it was too thick to be absorbed by the pad. So now I use 3 pumps into my hands and just kinda swipe it on/pat it in until it is off my hands. It takes a few minutes to fully absorb (when it absorbs the old milk smell dissipates), but that could also be due to the fact that I use a good bit of this with the 3 pumps. Another thing to note it that it definitely does initially sting. Nothing major, and not unbearable by any means. I think that just comes with using a higher strength acid product. I've used this serum for months now and it still does sting a tiny bit. The stinging does subside when it absorbs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis serum saved my ass during my recent tretinoin purge. I started using tret again after a few years of not. I knew a purge was inevitable, but I figured it wouldn't be that bad and I wouldn't care that much because I was older and had a better self esteem than when I was younger and know my appearance doesn't define my worth and a bunch of shit reasons that ended up not mattering at all once my face blew up in a way that I hadn't seen since high school. I know you're supposed to cut back on other actives when you introduce tret to your routine so that you don't overexfoliate, but after being miserable and feeling sorry for myself for a solid 2 months, I decided to pick this guy back up and use it sparingly to help the purge heal quicker and to deal with the PIE that the purge was leaving behind. It. Helped. So. Much. I'm thankfully on the other side of the purge with no scarring, and I think this serum is at least partially responsible for that. I am very PIE prone, and while I know that time is the biggest healer of that, this has helped a lot. I continue to use both tret and the serum each 2 times per week for maintenance and brightness. The way my skin feels the day after I use this serum is the way I want my skin to look everyday, but I haven't really upped my usage because I'm still wary of overexfoliation. That being said, I think 2 times a week is enough to see results. The texture on my cheeks and my pore size have improved a ton. I have genetic very large pores on my nose, so nothing is going to make then disappear entirely (another thing I'm trying to be ok with), but this serum at least makes them look like they are not full of gunk, and makeup goes on much more smoothly now instead of clinging to each pore or pooling in the pores.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSide note, I've also used the Gly-luronic serum from the same line, and that is an awesome serum as well. Having used both, I think the Gly-luronic serum is better for zapping acne, and the lac-luronic is better for texture, brightness, and making your skin look better after a breakout/when a breakout is on the mend. The Gly-luronic is stronger for sure, and stings a good bit more that the lac-luronic. I think the Gly-luronic helped a bit more with pore appearance, but I think I'll continue to repurchase the lac-luronic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHopefully this was helpful! I recommend this serum all the time on the sub, but I never see any one else talk about it, so I wanted to share my experience.",

But once I misplaced it during a move and stopped using it for a couple of weeks, my results zapped away and so I wanted to find something actually made for the face and that would give lasting results.

Is helping to keep my skin hydrated during the day (I have Combo/Oily, Hormonal Acne, slightly sensitive skin) \\*\\*\\*Been doing this for a month now :)\\*\\*\\* \n\nThis routine that I created has products that are lightweight and have a water consistency but charged with powerful, refreshing, and moisturizing ingredients that the skin needs for summer. My key was to look for products that didn't overwhelm my skin with soo much on, and ingredients that help bring and keep moisture on my skin. :)  Hope it can help someone :)  [https://youtu.be/7J4dyttVxSk](https://youtu.be/7J4dyttVxSk)\n\nI first start my **water-based Cleanser**\n\nWhich is the **1.** **Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser**\\- formulated with purifying botanicals, this low pH formula works to soothe, refresh, and soften without the stripping feeling. It is light, slight bubbles and it gently cleanses my skin. It contains Tea tree oil (an antibacterial) that helps with acne-prone sensitive skin. \n\nNext up **Toner**\n\n**2. Roundlab Mugwort Calming** Toner is just a refreshment for my skin. Because my skin gets extra sensitive due to the heat which also triggers my acne, I like using a toner that has Mugwort in it. This plant extract has anti-inflammatory properties that help heal skin sensitivities and acne. **\\*I leave it on the fridge so is cool when I'm applying it\\***\n\nFollow with **Essence**\n\nUsing the **3. Dewytree Vitalizing Snail Essence Water**\n\nIs a lightweight yet powerful essence that hydrates softens and plumps the skin. It has beneficial ingredients like snail secretion, adenosine, and aloe leaf extract that will target skin concerns like redness, irritation, wrinkles, and acne. \n\nThis feels soo good on my skin and I sometimes add a second layer of this essence. It is so watery which helps my skin absorb it quickly and gives a refreshing burst of moisture. \n\nMy second layer of hydration is **my moisturizer**\n\nNow, this moisturizer is my go-to for SUMMER!   \nIt hydrates, soothes, and calms my face and also my entire body! **4. Nature Republic 92% Aloe Vera Gel**. This baby over has been my holy-grail since 2015! \n\nIt has 92% California Aloe Vera leaf extract that helps soothe and moisturize the skin without the sticky feeling. Its gel consistency is perfect for fast-absorption and refreshing feel. I apply a decent amount all over my face, my body, and my hair!! It makes it soo smooth. \\*\\*This one has alcohol and fragrance, so probably if you have very sensitive skin I don’t recommend it. But there’re other brands that carry Aloe vera gel moisturizer, like **Instree 80% Aloe Vera Gel** which is better for sensitive skins. \\*\\*\n\nAnd lastly, I like to seal all that moisture that I just applied to my face and I do it with my Sunscreen\n\nI use the **5. Missha All Arounf Safe Block Sebum Zero Sun EX SPF 50+/PA +++**\n\nIt protects me from UVA & UVB Sun Rays and is a high-performance, lightweight, fast-absorbing sunblock that controls oil and shine during the day. **\\*I'm running out and everywhere I go to buy it is out of stock! Don't know if they discontinued it :(\\***\n\nOh and I almost forgot I also hydrate my lips with the **6. Laneige Lip Glowy Balm.** Just love a good hydrating gloss with a smell of berries and a little bit of tinted color on your lips. \n\nOPEN FOR OTHER PRODUCT SUGGESTIONS! :)\n\nKeep yourselves hydrated in this heat!! Lots of water!! :)",

I'm listing the prices converted from the retail price in Korea so you can see whether you're outrageously overpaying if you do decide to go look for any of these online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SIDMOOL**\n\nMost products from this brand seem to fragrance-free. They're quite popular in Korea, it looks like. Sensitive skin-friendly, mid-range to very affordable price, good performance/rave reviews. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mu73nuoc8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3671e9c6328bb8cab34a24366fac08d06ace645f\n\n1. **Pure Bifida 95 Ampoule - 30ml/24,600 Won ($20.94)**\n\n*Bifida Ferment Lysate, Sodium Hyaluronate, 1,2-Hexanediol.*\n\nBifida ferment is the \"star\" ingredient that makes up most of the famed Estee Lauder night recovery serum if you didn't know (although it matters which strain was used apparently, same with SK-II & their dupes). It's said to strengthen your skin barrier over time and provide very slight, gentle exfoliation. Reviews for this Sidmool serum I have read on the Hwahae app do confirm that many people felt their skin became \"stronger\"/less sensitive. Many also said their skin tone & texture improved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pmd5qi5e8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9d487bb091642b6ee3ea1e20e2b1f4cc276b0e4\n\n2. **Skin Sauce D Panthenol Ampoule - 12ml/11,800 Won ($10.04)**\n\n*Water, Panthenol, Pantolactone, Xanthan Gum, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root (Chinese Skullcap) Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root (Tree Peony) Extract.*\n\nPanthenol is a great barrier repairing ingredient. Research shows using 5-10% is the best for skin penetration. It's said to be very healing. Note the tiny size, however. 12 ml = 0.4 oz.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kc56mwli8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af5deb3f6d7af94d6cd14851695dd3a721e599c8\n\n3. **Madagascar Real Moisture Cream - 80g/23,800 Won ($20.26)**\n\n*Centella Asiatica, Glycerin, Hydrogenated lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Paeonia Suffruticosa (Tree Peony) Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis (Chinese Skullcap) Root Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ethyl Undecylenate, Polyglutamic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Erythritol, Sorbitol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic acid, Asiatic acid, Astaxanthin, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Beta-Glucan, Panthenol, Vaccinium Angustifolium Fruit Extract, Punica Granatum Fruit Extract, Ficus Carica Fruit Extract, Morus Alba Fruit Extract, Ginkgo Biloba Nut Extract, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol.*\n\nThis lightweight gel-cream (Koreans call watery/hydrating creams \"soo boon cream\" meaning \"moisture cream\") is a crowd-pleaser, starring centella and many other soothing ingredients such as Chinese skullcap extract, allantoin, licorice root (the soothing component, not the skin-lightening), and madecassoside. It also has polyglutamic acid, beta-glucan, and hyaluronic acid as humectants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qi4q3uak8ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0af940dc986ca78892585f4a03d2fd7b23a3b96a\n\n4. **Honey Peptide Moisture Pack - 40ml/9,800 Won ($8.43)**\n\n*Honey Extract(40%), Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycerin, Glycereth-26, Hyaluronic Acid, Sorbitol, Propolis Extract,Royal Jelly Extract, Human Oligopeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-11, rh-Oligopeptide-2, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Beta-Glucan, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Origanum Vulgare Leaf Extract, Caffeoyl Tripeptide-1, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Glycine Max (Soybean) Seed Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Butylene Glycol, Sucrose, Fructose, Glucose, Trehalose, Panthenol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Allantoin, Gardenia Florida Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Glucosylrutin, Arginine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\nA lightweight, gel-textured sleeping pack. This has been #1 for sleeping packs for a while now, too. Reviewers say this is very hydrating. It's absolutely *stuffed full* of humectants: honey, glycerin, hyaluronic acid, sugars, beta-glucan, collagen, and peptides. Some soothing ingredients as well, allantoin, licorice root & extracts. Very dry skinned people said it wasn't enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xfr8w5oo8ku31.jpg?width=630&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfdcfdfe41ba52ad5d588187902b7d00420478a4\n\n5. **Calendula Ampoule Moisture Cream - 80ml/16,800 Won ($14.30)**\n\n*Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Glycerin, Calendula Officinalis Flower Water, Butylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ceramide NP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide NS, Ceramide AS, Ceramide AP, Cholesterol, Glyceryl Stearate, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Curcuma Longa (Tumeric) Root Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Water, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Xanthan Gum, Dipropylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Heptyl Undecylenate, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\nA gel-cream with skin-soothing calendula flower as the star. Other soothing, anti-inflammatory extracts make an appearance here, as well as ceramides.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f7f77tcs8ku31.jpg?width=280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd7d7db952d0ec115a2a39a569a337f661ac0789\n\n6. **Idebenone Firming Ampoule - 32ml/24,800 Won ($21.11)**\n\n*Rosa Canina (Dog-Rose) Fruit Extract, Glycerin, Propanediol, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydroxydecyl Ubiquinone, Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Adenosine, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Human Oligopeptide-1, rh-Polypeptide-11, rh-Oligopeptide-2, Acetly Hexapeptide-8, Copper Tripeptide-1, Ethyhexylglycerin.*\n\nIdebenone is the synthetic version of the powerful antioxidant, CoQ10/ubiquinone. CoQ10 molecules are really big though, so it has trouble penetrating. Idebenone has smaller molecules so it can do the job better. I heard that the patent on idebenone ended recently, so maybe we can see more of this goodie in future products.

It's a nice, basic peeling gel.

Which surprises me, personally, as the Korean skincare community is going through a major \"EWG is best source/natural is better\" moment right now. But hey, I guess if it works, it works. Fragranced with orange essential oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oz9arxe39ku31.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff34a25e8bccfe68e01a8ccc85e304df7b1b0826\n\n9. **Saccharo Ferment Therapy Essence - 60ml/24,800 Won ($21.11)**\n\n*Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Polyglutamic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Saccharomyces/Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Allantoin, Human Oligopeptide-1, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Water.*\n\nI think some of Missha fermented products use Saccharomyces. Whenever you see a ferment ingredient/whatever extract, that means that plant has been fermented to make the nutrients in it more bioavailable for us. Supposedly the fermentation process releases lots more goodies than just using the extract alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/myfq67u59ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecfc805f707759f790b86d6dd65460379b6c9674\n\n10. **Saccharo Ferment Sparkle First Ampoule - 100ml/49,000 Won ($41.70)**\n\n*Galactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Polyglutamic Acid, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract.*\n\nGalactomyces = SK-II, Bifida = Estee Lauder, though which strains are trade secret or something.

The surfactants in this (Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate & Disodium Lauroyl glutamate) are extremely gentle surfactants often used for cleansers targeted toward babies and sensitive skin. They're more expensive but provide a bunch of non-stripping foam. We see a lot more of these sort of surfactants in recent years because of the bad rep Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and Sodium Laureth Sulfate have gotten, which are used widely because of their cheap cost (whether they are gentle or not depends on the formula and what other surfactants they have been mixed with).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s8jz1gqk9ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1943c1bb896d85a41596a26febcc48e6a47a684\n\n15. **Dr. Troub Skin Returning Cleansing Milk - 200ml/13,600 Won ($11.57)**\n\n*Water, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Glycerin, Decyl Glucoside, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Diheptyl Succinate, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Milk Protein Extract, Allantoin, Tocopherol, Citric Acid, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n\\[First Cleanser\\] This is a popular cleansing milk that you use like you use an oil cleanser (rub into dry face with dry hands). to remove sunscreen and makeup. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1w3vw2xp9ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b0abeef20e0d4ee0787e6101c376d2e70fbb4c3\n\n16. **Galatokside Real Peptide Barrier Moisture Soo Boon Cream - 50ml/29,800 won ($25.36)**\n\n*Copper Tripeptide-1, Glactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Paeonia Suffructicosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Pentylene Glycol, Betaine, Human Oligopeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-11, rh-Oligopeptide-2, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid, Ceramide NP, Sucrose, Fructose, Glucose, Polyglutamic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium PCA, Beta-Glucan, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Trehalose, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Tocopherol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Carbomer, Adenosine, Arginine, 1,2-Hexanediol.* \n\nA nice, soothing cream with tons of humectants/peptides, and centella components. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u3ur5mms9ku31.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=480295636783722d34de21a551c16f1fd5a2c4d5\n\n17. **Madagascar Centella Skin - 150ml/14,800 Won ($12.59)**\n\n*Centella Asiatica Extract(97%), Butylene Glycol, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol.* \n\nRemember that toners are referred to as \"Skin\" in Korea (Japan = lotion).

I thought there would be more ferments in this, given the name, but I guess not. Thermal water does have a light soothing effect/deposit minerals onto your skin. I thought it was just boring water in a can too, but Labmuffin has a post on it; It's interesting. Korean Pasque Flower is called \"Hal-mi-Kkhot\" meaning \"granny flower\", lol.

This one seems just loaded. Lots of soothing/calming stuff in here as well.

For example:\n\n**Revox Just Vitamin C 20 % serum** \\- €3, 95 (30 ml)  \nAqua, Ascorbic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Propylene Glycol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Phenoxyethanol, PPG-1-PEG-9 Lauryl Glycol Ether, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA\n\n**Revox Just Hyaluronic Acid 5 % serum** \\- €3,95 (30 ml)  \nAqua, Sodium Hyaluronate, Propylene Glycol, Panthenol, Xanthan Gum, PPG-1-PEG-9 Lauryl Glycol Ether, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium Edtá\n\nThe extremely low price makes me kind of cautious, would love to hear your thoughts on these products. Thanks!",

    "body": "&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5svy4nn82qq41.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=22e5bd1a6fbb989892255f7012fd7d555f5e4ed4\n\n**Then I Met You The Giving Essence**\n\nEvery so often…I come across a product that just takes my skincare routine to a whole new level. Sometimes I see amazing results, sometimes really good results for an exceptionally good price, or it’s even just the texture/feel/experience of the product that makes it really special. The Living Cleansing Balm (also from Then I Met You) was one of the first products for me that fell into this category…The Giving Essence is another.\n\nThere are a lot of things about this essence that remind me of all the others I have tried in the past (especially those considered “first essences”). The Giving Essence has a very thin/watery consistency that absorbs nicely and layers well. You’ll find some fermented ingredients here along with brightening and hydrating ones too…again pretty much par for the course for a lot of essences. But, it’s what Then I Met You has done to heighten some of these benefits that makes it truly unique.\n\nRight out of the box this essence really interested me. The glass bottle is painted in a similar fashion to the Birch Milk Refining Toner…but this time the paint kind of fades away/tapers off to reveal the bright pink hue of the essence itself. This really is some unique packaging that I don’t think I have seen before. \n\nThat pink color comes naturally from the Black Chokeberry Extract in the formula. In addition, there are just so many hydrating and antioxidant rich ingredients here (and in high concentrations) it would be hard to list them all. But some of the standouts include Galactomyces/Aspergillus/Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrates (the first three ingredients), Ellagic Acid (a powerful antioxidant and anti-aging ingredient), Red Algae Extract, Turmeric Root Extract, and Eggplant Extract (excellent for calming and soothing the skin). \n\nIn addition, Polyglumatic Acid is here…which might be the most interesting one on the list. Polyglumatic Acid has been trending in skincare for the past couple of years…but I don’t think I have used a product that featured it in a higher concentration (or at all that I remember). Basically, it is a humectant/peptide that holds 4-5 times more moisture compared to Hyaluronic Acid. \n\nThis highly concentrated and well-formulated essence made it’s intentions clear with the first application. Just a 5-6 drops of product and…how do I describe it…it’s like a total bomb of hydration and cooling! I honestly don’t know how Then I Met You pulled this off. Each time I use it I look into my palm like “How in the world does this little bit make my skin feel/look like I did a full 7 Skin Method?” It truly is IN-CRE-DI-BLE how hydrating The Giving Essence is. As a bonus, the Black Chokeberry provides a natural/tart scent that is very faintly cranberry-like…so refreshing. I found myself doing a total of two layers to include my face and neck.\n\nAll of the lovely fermented ingredients are also in full force providing some great brightening effects, not only right out of the gate…but over time as well. I really started to see these benefits take shape in this (my 4th) week with the product. Supported by a vitamin c serum as well as some chemical exfoliation (from the Birch Milk Refining Toner) many of the dark spots/areas of hyperpigmentation on my skin have improved. And generally, my skin has just looked more even-toned and “happy” I guess LOL!\n\nBehind the scenes this essence uses a lot of antioxidants and skin supporting ingredients that don’t really provide a “wow” factor…but are just as great to have. I feel like my skin has become a bit more resilient in the face of chemical/physical exfoliation as well as having a better ability to hold onto moisture throughout the day. Once again, everything seems to just be…happy.\n\nSo clearly, I love this product! But just like the Birch Milk Refining Toner we have to talk about the cost. This essence comes in at $50.00 USD for 100ml. Although nowhere near as pricey as something like the SK-II Essence…The Giving Essence isn’t cheap. But because of the concentration of ingredients, the immediate AND long term benefits, and the need to only use a small amount per application I think this product is 100% worth every penny. Considering the formulation…I could absolutely see this essence being sold by a more “luxury” skincare brand for $75-100 USD. I’ve never used a high-end essence from brands like SK-II, Amore Pacific, or Tatcha. But to be honest…I don’t think I need to now. \n\nI really poured over some of my reviews of favorite skincare products from the last year or so thinking about what I loved about them. For me…finding a product that combines effective ingredients, real/lasting results, and a unique experience usually means it is a winner. I have tried and loved quite a few in my day (LOL!)…but I have to say that The Giving Essence is in all honesty the best skincare product I have ever used. \n\nFor someone like me who struggles to keep skin hydrated to prevent excess oil/sebum production while also tackling hyperpigmentation it doesn’t really get any better than this essence. I could totally see myself moving away from hydrating toners and lightweight serums in favor of this one product. Cleanse, Exfoliate, The Giving Essence, Moisturize/SPF…done. Of course, I am a total skincare nerd with a closet full of stuff so that wont be happening anytime soon LOL!\n\nThose with dry skin will also love this essence for the same reasons. That burst of hydration is something I haven’t experienced before and it really is long lasting. \n\nI’m kind of glad that I got a chance to try a lot of other essence products before finding this one. I feel like without knowing the performance of products like the Missha Time Revolution First Treatment Essence, Secret Key Starting Treatment Essence, Neogen Real Ferment Micro Essence, and May Coop Raw Sauce (aka the ones I’ve liked LOL)…I wouldn’t be able to realize how The Giving Essence is all of those and more. When I do finally retire from the skincare reviewing world…I’ll be taking The Giving Essence with me.\n\nThere aren’t too many products I use that “call” me to my routine each morning and night but The Giving Essence is truly one of them and it is the highlight of my current skincare routine.\n\nBottom line, if you can…you should. \n\nFull Ingredients List: \n\nGalactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Aspergillus Ferment Extract Filtrate, Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Propanediol, Niacinamide, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Ellagic Acid, Aronia Melanocarpa Fruit Extract, Polyglutamic Acid, Glycerin, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Morus Alba Root Extract, Allantoin, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Ribes Nigrum (Black Currant) Fruit Extract, Rubus Coreanus Fruit Extract, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract, Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Betaine, Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit Extract, Aristotelia Chilensis Fruit Extract, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Gardenia Jasminoides Fruit Extract, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Xanthan Gum, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Water, Methylpropanediol\n\nWhere To Buy (Then I Met You Site - $50.00 USD 100ml): \n\nhttps://thenimetyou.com/products/the-giving-essence",

    "body": "I’ve been on the search for a good FA safe moisturizer, literally EVERY single recommended moisturizer either has Squalane or fatty alcohols or niacinamide & im very sensitive to each one ): an example of what I have used: \n\n•Cerave = clogged pores CCs & itchiness \n•Vanicream = loved on Accutane, but post it makes me SO RED. FLUSHED. \n•Krave Beauty Oat cream = wanted to love ): but I think the Squalane gradually broke me out after 4 weeks of use. I also ALWAYS felt so oily. But it never made my face red which I was so happy about but...alas. Also not hydrating enough.\n•Timeless Squalane = instant CCs\n•Benton Aloe = never did anything for me but make me sticky. \n\nI DO LOVE, My Hada Labo premium. I use it everyday. If I could use it by itself I would but without another moisturizer on top my skin is super tight. \n\nI was going to get Avène products but THEY ALL HAVE SQUALANE OR NIACINAMIDE ): \n\nI came across a YouTube named Kelly Driscoll & she made a video discussing FA safe K-beauty products & one stood out & it’s called Kosmetic Immunity Luminous Skin-Defense Moisturizer by JKossmune. I imputed it into sezia.co, COSDNA & both sites came up absolutely safe. Even inputted it into Skincarisma & there’s not a single ingredient that can irritate the skin. \n\nHere are the ingredients: (copy & paste onto the sites to see for yourself the results will shock you!)\n\nWater, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Isononanoate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nHOWEVER, the main ingredient is called Beta-Glucan. Which, from what I’ve researched is ferment derived yeast ****BUT*** DONT GO YET. I got this from another redditor I came across: \n\n“Beta glucan, if derived from oats, grains or mushroom is definitely fungal acne safe. The Klairs toner doesn't pose a problem for FA sufferers, so I'm inclined to think the beta glucan in it isn't yeast-derived.\n\nThe Isntree HA toner which is FA safe as well contains beta glucan, again it poses no threat to FA at all.\n\nJkosmmune's beta glucan is specifically derived from Schizophyllan mushroom. Iunik's beta glucan is also confirmed to be a mushroom-derivative.”\n\nI just ordered it on Amazon, so WE SHALL SEE. If you guys are interested I’ll update! <3\n\n****UPDATE****\nSo it’s been about 2 weeks using it, I can’t tell if it’s breaking me out or not, not in fungal acne but tiny whiteheads....I feel like it’s giving me the same reaction as the Krave Oat & I’ve come to the conclusion that it might be the high combination of the butylene glycol & glycerin. \nHOWEVER!! To not discourage anyone, this has indefinitely made my skin SO SMOOTH AND SUPPLE. If you have dry skin I HIGHLY RECCOMEND!!!!!. Seriously. Or even if you have oily skin! My skin was terribly oily, I’m sure from dehydration, but my skin I promise you doesn’t get as oily as it did before. I don’t even have to blot, not in a mattifying way...but that your skin is literally GLOWING. My skin has such a bounce & evenness to it now, besides these pesky whiteheads (they’re not cystic or pustular at all, just the small whiteheads with slight redness & get filled quickly & then disappear after 2 days...they’ve just been just somehow constant since the Krave Oat moisturizer & I cant get it under control) I will update again! <3",

    "body": "Hey everyone! As it appears there was enough interest, I've decided to write reviews on the Benton Honest TT Mist and Tosowoong Apricot Seed Cleansing Oil (review coming soon). In the interest of space (nobody wants to read a post that long) I've decided to review the mist first, and will follow up with a review of the cleanser later.\n\n Why these two products specifically? Well, it's mainly because I never see them mentioned on here. We all know this sub can be a bit of an echo chamber, and there's a consensus that it would be nice to move away from that. I'm not trying to claim that Benton or Tosowoong are lesser-known brands (because that would be  ridiculous) However, these two products never seem to show up in people's routines or suggestions, and I thought they might be something new for people to hear about. I am not a blogger, and I purchased these products with my own money. So without further prologue, here is the first review:\n\n**Benton Honest TT Mist**\n\nSo something you have to know about me is that my skin is dry. I don't mean it could use a bit of extra moisturizer every now and again, I mean it's the freaking Sahara at noon pretty much constantly. I use TO's Hyaluronic Acid + B5 day and night, and don't like to apply it on a dry face for fear that the HA will suck all the moisture out of my skin. I could just dampen my skin with water, but where's the fun in that? It also seemed like a good opportunity to hydrate my skin while also adding some other beneficial ingredients. Enter the Benton Honest TT Mist...\n\n**Packaging:** The mist comes in a 40ml white plastic tube with a black plastic lid and nozzle. As a frequent air traveller, I must point out that this makes the mist suitable for carry-on bags (yay!) It's simple, utilitarian packaging...not pretty, not ugly. My one personal qualm about it is that it's significantly taller than most of my other products, so it throws the whole aesthetic off a bit. It's definitely not a huge issue, but as a semi-professional photographer, it makes me cringe just the slightest bit. \n\n**Ingredients:** Good news, sensitive skin folks! According to cosDNA, the only potential acne trigger in the Benton Honest TT Mist is butylene glycol, which scores a 1. Tea tree leaf water is the star of the show, as it makes up 80% of the whole product. While we all know about tea tree oil's antibacterial acne-fighting powers, tea tree water is mentioned less frequently. That's probably because it's significantly less powerful than its hard-hitting cousin...it may have some acne-fighting properties, but I don't expect much from it besides hydration and perhaps some soothing effects. However, it is nice to see Benton trying to replace water with other potentially beneficial ingredients. Sodium Hyaluronate (a form of hyaluronic acid) is listed as the fifth ingredient, so I expect some extra hydration from the mist. Tea tree extract is listed sixth, so I was also hoping for a bit of acne control. Following those are aloe leaf juice and extract, so we can expect some soothing action as well. \n\n As always, YMMV, so here is the full ingredients list: \n\nMelaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Water, Water, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Polyglutamic Acid, Aspalathus Linearis Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Psidium Guajava Fruit Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract \n\n**Price:** I got mine from Soko Glam for $11 (which works out to about 28 cents/ml) It's available from Jolse for the same price.\n\n**Use and Performance:** This product *should* be pretty easy to apply. Just point at your face, close your eyes, and spray away. I say *should* because application was one of the most disappointing aspects of the mist. The nozzle forces the product out in a very hard, fast spray, and it's rather uncomfortable to use. To get around this, you can spritz some into your hand and pat it onto your face, or you can do what I do and either apply it from much farther away or very slowly, gently press the nozzle down part of the way to get less product. This is definitely a big detractor, because something so simple as a mist shouldn't involve multiple strategies to avoid feeling like you're standing in a torrential downpour when you apply it. \n\nI've used the Benton Honest TT Mist for a little over a month now. I generally apply it before and after my HA serum, as well as after sheet masks. It has a light, unoffensive scent that if you think reeeally hard might be the scent of very diluted tea tree oil. I've noticed that my skin is a bit more hydrated on the whole, and I seem to lose moisture less quickly than I normally would, as I don't find myself reaching for my moisturizer in the middle of the day as often. I credit this to a combination of the mist itself and the fact that I'm adding extra hydration before and after my HA serum. I haven't seen any changes in my acne while using this product, so I'm guessing that the tea tree oil is in an insignificant enough quantity to render it unnoticeable. I think I was secretly hoping for a bit more of an impact on my acne, but it's definitely not a shock that it didn't do much in that department. Surprisingly, my favorite use of the mist has been after sheet masks. I feel like a lot of masks leave my face with this tacky, partially dry feeling after I've patted the essence in. On a whim, I spritzed the mist on after a sheet mask one day, and that sticky, nasty feeling was way less noticeable! The mist is also nice and soothing, thanks to the anti-inflammatory properties of the tea tree water and aloe. I think if I were to get a sunburn or irritation from overexfoliation, I would reach for this to calm it down a bit. \n\n**Final Thoughts**: This is a decent product. It's got a short, simple ingredients list that should be relatively non-irritating. It delivers on its promise in terms of hydration, and packs an extra dose of soothing action for angry skin. Given the ingredients list, the lack of an impact on acne shouldn't be surprising, but in case you're still hoping this is a magical acne zapping mist, I'm sorry to say that this is not the product you are looking for. It's a simple, hydrating mist. Nothing more, nothing less. The design flaw on the nozzle is the biggest detractor from the product...it's unpleasant to apply, and for a product that's not a total *wow*, that might put me off from repurchasing it. If you're looking for a one-trick pony mist that will add a little extra hydration to your routine at a low cost, then this would be a great choice for you. If you're easily put off by difficult application or are looking for something with a bit more oomph in terms of brightening, acne-fighting, or other benefits, then I would suggest a different product. \n\n**My Rating: 3/5**\n\n\nEdit: This is my first attempt at writing a detailed review, so please feel free to give feedback and ask for more information\n",

It was one of the first AB products I purchased this past December, and I wasn't sure if I was using it correctly because it didn't seem to be doing much for me except add a little hydration after about a month of using it. I have dehydrated skin so I was trying to introduce products that I could layer for hydration, and even with HA, this product didn't really do much for me. I do appreciate that aloe is in the ingredients, but it didn't seem to help much when I had allergic reactions/sensitive flare-ups when I was trying to figure out which ingredients in AB products my skin preferred. It's definitely convenient for days that a spritz of hydration is needed during the day, though! Thanks for your review - it's nice to know that I was getting similar results as somebody else!",

    "body": "I’m going to be honest; I never quite used sunscreen on my lips until a month ago. At the beginning of last year, I learned to religiously apply sunscreen in the morning and reapply after two hours in the sun. I gently smoothed it over my face, and rubbed it on my arms, legs, and the back of my hands. I was the subject of judgmental stares during swim season as I would be the only dude who applied sunscreen on his whole body, rather than just his face and shoulders. I made sure every part of my body that would see UV light was coated in a liberal layer of protection. Every part except my lips.\n\nGranted, my lips were always on the dry side, so I applied some SPF 15 Chapstick every now and then. But it was not broad spectrum. \n\nDo not neglect your lips! Skin cancer on the lips is not impossible (http://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/lip-cancer-not-uncommon). Furthermore, UV rays will certainly thin the skin on the lips and accelerate aging. And, worst of all, while 94% of 299 beachgoers were cognizant of the risks of UV damage, only 69% demonstrated an awareness of the risk of lip cancer.\n\nThe best part about protecting lips is that it’s so fast, easy, and cheap. A few glides of a $3 balm, a quick smushing of the lips, and they’re protected. However, *reapplication should be much more frequent*, because the sunscreen can be rubbed off when eating and drinking.  \n\nHere are some recommendations to get started. These are some of my favorites, but there are certainly many more options:\n\n* **Banana Boat Sport SPF 50 Sunscreen Lip Balm** [I recommend buying from Target for ~$3 a stick]: It has a pretty standard, Chapstick-esque texture, but I find it’s more moisturizing. The lip balm’s also water-resistant for 80 minutes, which is pretty freaking awesome. Broad-spectrum protection is assured from avobenzone stabilized with octocrylene. There’s also the added benefit of the antioxidants vitamins E, C, and A (in the forms of tocopherol acetate, ascorbic acid, and retinyl palmitate). It’s entirely fragrance free, and it’s slightly sweetened for all you compulsive lip-lickers (though one probably shouldn’t bite chunks off the balm!) \n\n\t*Ingredients*: Active: Avobenzone (2%), Octocrylene (10%), Oxybenzone (6%), Other: Petrolatum, Polyethylene, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Trimethylsiloxyphenyl Dimethicone, Microcrystalline Wax, Isopropyl Myristate, Cocoa Seed Butter, PEG-8, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ascorbic Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Silica, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Saccharin, Propylparaben, Butylparaben\n\n* **NIVEA a Kiss of Smoothness Hydrating Lip Care SPF 15** [I recommend buying from Target for $2.99 a stick]: This is much more emollient than Banana Boat’s balm, and definitely feels very rich on the lips. UVA protection is assured from avobenzone stabilized with octocrylene. Antioxidant properties make only a small presence from a sprinkling of shea butter in the formula. The product is ever so lightly fragranced.\n\n\t*Ingredients*: Active: Avobenzone (2.5%), Octinoxate (6.0%), Octocrylene (1.8%) Inactive: Octyldodecanol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Microcrystalline Wax, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Cetyl Palmitate, Myristyl Myristate, Polyglyceryl-3 Dilsostearate, Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Simmondsia Chinenesis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, C20-40 Alkyl Stearate, Beeswax, Fragrance.\n\n* **Shiseido Sun Protection Lip Treatment SPF 35** [$22.00 from Shiseido.com; uncertain how expensive it is at the department store]: $22 is definitely a major splurge for a lip product, especially when other great lip balms are much cheaper, but if one wishes to splurge, this is a good option! This features a combination of octinoxate and titanium dioxide for broad-spectrum protection. It provides a moderate amount of hydration, and leaves a faint (and I do mean faint, but definitely noticeable upon closer inspection) white cast, which can be a good and a bad thing. For those who wish to lighten and brighten their lips a little, this is a quick way to do it while getting sun protection. IMO, it looks particularly good on Asians (which is probably why Shiseido, a Japanese brand, created this!) However, if applied on chapped lips, minerals can collect in flaky parts and create white splotches. I recommend using a lip scrub and applying a thin layer of an emollient lip balm underneath if this is a problem. This product is moderately fragranced with the same scent Shiseido uses in their other sunscreens. This used to be labeled as SPF 36 and PA++, but I'm quite certain the formula didn't change.\n\n\t*Ingredients*: Active: Octinoxate (7.4%), Titanium Dioxide (5%), Other: Trioctanoin, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Triisostearin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Polyethylene, PEG/PPG-36/41 Dimethyl Ether, Microcrystalline Wax, Stearyl Glycyrrhetinate, Glutathione, Zinc Myristate, Thiotaurine, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Diisostearyl Malate, Sodium Magnesium Silicate, Glycerin, BHT, Fragrance\n\n\nAs a final note, I've used lip balms with SPF as a sunscreen stick for other parts of my body (like the back of my hands) in a pinch. It works pretty well, but it feels pretty gross cause it's been all over the mouth haha.\n\n**Good luck and godspeed with all sunscreen-related endeavors!**\n",

Crown's](http://eye-crown.com/index.html) mascaras and I think it's awesome that they came with a cape and lash comb(the crown).The brand from what I've seen is pretty new like their fb and twitter posts start in like may of this year.\n\n\nI know these have been out for a long time now but I only recently came across them. *L'Herbiflore* [Home Of The Mermaid](http://www.lherboflore.com.tw/product_list.aspx?series=1&classid=11) and [Fashion Traveler](http://www.lherboflore.com.tw/product_list.aspx?series=1&classid=23) mask collections really caught

They products have ingredients such as placenta extract, ubiquinone,dif froms of HA, ceramides, hydrolyzed collagen, royal jelly extract, phytosphingosine,  Neosolue™-Aqulio, retinyl palmitate, tripeptide F, oil soluble licorice extract, ascorbyl tetraisopalmitate,etc.\n\n\n\nAlso I checked this out yesterday for someone  and even thought they made a post about it afterwards in case you guys haven't seen it the Rosette Ceramide Gel has been discontinued.According to [cosme](http://www.cosme.net/product/product_id/289770/top) - \"This product has ended production or renewal. (However, some stores may still be on sale.)\" . From what I could get from some comments the gel has stopped production this april while the lotions from the line have stopped been produced since last fall.The entire Ceramide line is gone from the lineup on the Rosette's site.",

    "body": "Peach & Lily - Pure Peach Retinoic Eye Cream\n\nAnother eye cream review...from someone that should not be reviewing eye creams.\n\nReally though, I need to stop buying eye specific skincare and I think the Peach & Lily Pure Peach Retinoic Eye Cream will be the last one (at least for a good long while).\n\nI’m lucky enough that I don’t (yet) tackle many of the issues that eye products are meant to address. I’m not seeing any lines or wrinkles in that area really...and the slight darkness/bagginess I have has been there since I was a tiny human.\n\nSo, I fear that any amazing benefits or results might be a bit lost on me. At least that seems to be the trend since no eye product I have tried has truly wowed me.\n\nWhat I do like about the Pure Peach Retinoic Eye Cream is that it features so many ingredients I love in a product that is lightweight and absorbs beautifully. Niacinamide, ginseng, bamboo, and several antioxidant rich greens are here.\n\nAlso, Bakuchiol is in the formulation which is said to be a more “natural” and gentle alternative to Retinol. From what I’ve read and heard from skincare professionals...we need more studies/research before making that claim with confidence.\n\nMy experience with this product is that it hydrates my eye area really well and plays nicely with the other products in my routine. That in addition to the nice dose of antioxidants makes this a fine product for me...I just can’t say for certain that it is doing much more than that.\n\nA little bit goes a really long way here so I’ll probably have this bottle in my routine for quite some time. But, I don't think it is something I would come back to...I guess the same could be said for all eye products (for now).\n\nLike I said...not the best person to be reviewing this one lol!\n\nFull Ingredients List: Water, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Bambusa (Bamboo) Textilis Stem Extract, Arctium Lappa (Burdock) Root Extract, Morus Alba (Mulberry) Leaf Extract, Prunus Persica (Peach) Fruit Extract, Bakuchiol, Rosa Rubiginosa Seed Oil, Daucus Carota (Carrot) Sativa Root Water, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Spinacia Oleracea (Spinach) Leaf Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Acetyl Octapeptide-3, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Extract, Apium Graveolens (Celery) Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Sorbitan Olivate, Lactuca Scariola Sativa (Lettuce) Leaf Extract, Ceramide Np, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ferulic Acid, Tocopherol, Panthenol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Adenosine, Cetearyl Olivate, Hydrogenated Rapeseed Alcohol, Betaine, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyglyceryl-4 Oleate, Glyceryl Olivate, Glyceryl Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Asparagus Officinalis Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Phosphoric Acid, Corallina Officinalis Extract\n\nWhere To Buy (Peach & Lily - $42.00 USD - 20ml): [https://www.peachandlily.com/products/pure-peach-retinoic-eye-cream](https://www.peachandlily.com/products/pure-peach-retinoic-eye-cream)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nl18p3drb6p51.jpg?width=1098&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c564fa513071af08b08743c2da57e8bd991bf14e",

I don't like having things around, and I don't even know that I'd like a floral scent, but I still look at them every now and again since they're so cute.  :/\n\nI love the Bring Green packaging as well - you can tell I've spent time on Olive Young's site.  I don't need any of it, but I do like to look at it every now and then.\n\nI'm happy Aromatica has a new line.  Everything I've tried from them, with the exception of a hair oil that I dislike the smell of and a physical sunscreen, has been pretty good.  The cica-panthenol oil from their new line seems interesting as does the glow sleeping mask - it's also less than 1/2 the price of the one I was going to use if my current sleeping mask ever runs out.  So that's something to consider.  :)",

Looking at the quantity, Rs. 1200/- is not a bad price.)\n\n**Claims:** SPF 45, PA+++, UV protection, Water resistant\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Berry Blossom Complex, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Glyceryl Stearate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Cetearyl Olivate, Sea Water, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Cetearyl Alcohol, Nylon-12, Sorbitan Olivate, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Polyacrylate-13, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Malpighia Emarginata (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Panthenol, Polyisobutene, PEG-100 Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycerin, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Fragrance, Sorbitan Stearate, Disodium EDTA, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, Polysorbate 20, 1,2-Hexanediol, BHT, Sorbitan Isostearate, Propylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract\n\n\n**Type:** Chemical Sunscreen\n\n**Using since:** More than a month\n\n**Packaging:** Tube\n\n**Texture:** Cream-like texture. Wouldn’t recommend it for oily skin as my combination skin doesn’t enjoy it on certain days.\n\n**Fragrance:** Citrusy. Mild but you can't escape it \n\n**My Experience:** I had my doubts since it was SPF 45, but I’ve never gotten tanned since I started using it. \nZero white cast. Never pilled.  I could feel its effect stays for longer hours. Blends easily.\n\nThe only problem I have is that it’s too heavy for my combination skin. Two fingers worth sunscreen  feels too much. It blends into the skin easily, but I constantly feel that there’s something on my face at least for an hour,so I touch my face to try to blend more, but no product residue is left. If combination or oily skin are using it, I’d recommend to either skip moisturizer or use it during winters.\n\nIt gets settled in after a while , skin feels smooth enough to use makeup.  I’ve accidentally touched my eyes while blending and yeah, it stung, a lot. \n\n**Reapplication:** Feels greasy. It settles into a dewy finish after a while.\n\nThe website beautytalk claims it to be meant for dry skin, that I kinda agree. I heard good reviews about this product and apart from feeling greasy, It did what it claimed to – No tanning, pilling or white cast, and if you can avoid touching your eyes, no stinging  too. \n\n**Repurchase:** WNRP, as not suitable for my skin. But it’s a good product.",

Part of the reason that I am so specifically critical of this brand is that they also sell an expensive oral supplement for hair, which I think is inappropriate for any cosmetics brand to do, but it is especially worrisome from a tiny one that is so loose with their claims for other products.\n\nOn the other hand, seldom does a company make it this easy to read their labels with some kind of confidence, so I thought it might be interesting to share. On the website product pages they do a couple of bullet-point type \"contains X% of Y\" that I call advertising claims for ingredients, but when compared to the full ingredients list it becomes obvious just how far they're stretching. In one case it is obvious that the claim percent is probably how much of the material as supplied they use, the rest are less clear.\n\nI want to say that despite the cleanwashing and the painfully bad sciencewashing this brand does, these may not be bad products to use, though they all range between somewhat and ridiculously overpriced. However, they are pushing the limits of language use in advertising/marketing to the flimsiest edge of reason and legality, and their \"science\" is a mish-mash of misleading puffery, long debunked fearmongering misinformation, and some other stuff I think they pulled out of thin air. Given all of the aroma chemicals in some their ingredients lists, I'd love to know how they would define \"synthetic\" in relationship to fragrance.\n\nThey have filed a patent application both World and US for stirring ingredients together at room temperature to make their products, which has got to be some troll level BS, or maybe a shady sidestep attempt to patent protect the cosmetic products ingredients lists or formulas without actually doing anything patentable. They are not Skinceuticals making a breakthrough with C E Ferulic. I mostly skimmed these because reading such patent apps is a good treatment for insomnia.\n\nWorld patent app here: https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2019165115A1/en\n\nUS here: https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200375877A1/en\n\nThe US version removes claims 8-17 as compared to the World version.\n\nNo idea where the hyperbaric chamber nonsense fits into this, but I laughed very hard at what seems to be a cut & paste definition of a pressure chamber from somewhere else. The patent app doesn't mention needing a hyperbaric chamber, despite the website claims.\n\nLast thing that I can't let go of: A quick lab test is not a clinical trial. In this case it \"proves\" that the 3 main products used in sequence will clean some synthetic sebum out of standardized hair samples in a lab.\n\nOh, and they've registered a trademark for Cold Processed. Yeah. https://uspto.report/company/Act-Acre-Inc\n\nAnyway. Enough of my judgemental rambling. On to the real reason for this: the labels!\n\nThey start as expected, but everything under 1% is listed alphabetically for most of their products. There are a few I didn't include here. I've formatted them to italics at the point where they go alphabetical to make it more obvious.\n\n**Act+Acre Stem Cell Serum** (for the scalp)\n\nAdvertising claim amounts: 2% apple stem cells, 2% bamboo and pea extract\n\nIngredients list as of April 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, *Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (ALOE), Bambusa Vulgaris Leaf/Stem Extract (BAMBOO), Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Citric Acid, Plant-Based Collagen, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glucosamine Hcl, Glycereth-26, Lecithin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate (RADISH), Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract (APPLE), Pentylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Extract (PEA), Propanediol, Quercus Petraea Fruit Extract (OAK), Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hydroxide, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Xanthan Gum*\n\nNote: Raw material manufacturers have been trying to make plant stem cells happen in cosmetics for well over a decade. I have not tried any and have no plans to do so. PhytoCellTec's SDS for their apple stem cell extract on Lotioncrafter's site gives the amount as 9% of the whole solution as supplied.\n\n**Hair Cleanse**\n\nAd Claim: 2% Apple amino acids, 0.045% Baobab oil (they say it supports a healthy scalp microbiome, not sure how that applies in a rinse off)\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Sodium Cocoyl Apple Amino Acids, Triethyl Citrate, Sorbitan Oleate Decylglucoside Crosspolymer, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, *Acrylates Copolymer, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil (BAOBAB), Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Oil (AMARANTH), Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil (AMYRIS), Aquilaria Agallocha Wood Oil (AGARWOOD), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Caprylyl Glycol, Cistus Ladaniferus Leaf/Stem Extract (ROCKROSE), Citric Acid, Cocamide Mipa, Dimethyl Heptenal, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil (CARDAMOM), Gamma-Nonalactone, Glycol Distearate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil (SUNFLOWER), Hexenyl Acetate, Hexylene Glycol, Ionone, Juniperus Virginiana Oil (CEDARWOOD), Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil (LAVENDER), Menthyl Ethylamido Oxalate, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil (MORINGA), Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Pogostemon Cablin Oil (PATCHOULI), Potassium Sorbate, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract (ROSEMARY), Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Steareth-4, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Vanillin, Viola Odorata Flower/Leaf Extract (VIOLET), Xanthan Gum* \n\nNote: Oils are only put in shampoos for making label claims.\n\n**Scalp Detox**\n\nUndoubedly misleading as heck ad claims: 4.55% Aloe & Calendula Extract, 2.73% Botanical Blend (either of those could mean anything)\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil (SUNFLOWER), Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil (SOYBEAN), Isostearyl Linoleate, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil (BAOBAB), Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil (MORINGA), *Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract (ALOE), Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Oil (AMARANTH), Calendula Officinalis Extract (CALENDULA), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil (ORANGE), Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil (COCONUT), Ocimum Basilicum Hairy Root Culture Extract (BASIL), Vetiveria Zizanoides Root Oil (VETIVER)*\n\nNote: Calendula is frequently extracted in sunflower seed oil for commercial use, and oil soluble aloe extracts are also widely available. The process for how they claim to stir this formula together is in the patent application as Working Example 3. A version of the hair cleanse is example 1. Anyway, I would guess that it is probably 80% or more C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate.\n\n**Conditioning Hair Mask** (also called Restorative Hair Mask)\n\nAd claims: 2% castor oil, no other % claims but mentions shea butter and panthenol benefits\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Isoamyl Laurate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Glycerin, Diheptyl Succinate, Triethyl Citrate, Arachidyl Alcohol, Di-C12-15 Alkyl Fumarate, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, *Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil (AMYRIS), Aquilaria Agallocha Wood Oil (AGARWOOD), Arachidyl Glucoside, Behentrimonium Chloride, Behenyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Nut Extract (SHEA BUTTER), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Ceteareth-20, Cetrimonium Chloride, Cistus Ladaniferus Leaf/Stem Extract (ROCKROSE), Citric Acid, Dimethyl Heptenal, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil (CARDAMOM), Ethylhexylglycerin, Gamma-Nonalactone, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract (SUNFLOWER), Hexenyl Acetate, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Ionone, Juniperus Virginiana Oil (CEDARWOOD), Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Pogostemon Cablin Oil (PATCHOULI), Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil (CASTOR), Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract (ROSEMARY), Sclerotium Gum, Sodium Hydroxide, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Vanillin, Viola Odorata Flower/Leaf Extract (VIOLET)*\n\nNote: The star here is Crodabond CSA INCI: Hydrogenated Castor Oil/Sebacic Acid Copolymer. It does have a tiny amount of plain castor oil too. Hard to say how accurate that 2% claim is.\n\nTheir **Hair Oil** doesn't have the detailed ingredients list that would show off their obvious fragrance inrgedients, as it would crush the \"just 5 natural ingredients\" idea, but they also say their squalane is squalene in the ad copy and I am petty enough about that kind of thing to put this here. \n\nAd claim from website: 5% plant-based squalene, 5% Argan oil\n\nList: Limnanthes alba (meadowfoam) seed oil, Squalane, Argania spinosa kernel (argan) oil, Crambe abyssinica seed oil phytosterol esters, Fragrance\n\nNote: As far as brand cohesiveness, this is an odd choice given the detailed ingredients lists of the other products that include the names of aroma chemicals and carefully avoid using the word \"fragrance\" but it is probably the most honest.",

    "body": "I have been wondering about BeautyNetKorea's house brand, Eyenlip, since it first launched. The prices are rock-bottom for most items (sunscreen for $2, BB cream for $3 -- plus shipping). The box of 10 masks was $1.90 when I bought it. It's hard to pass up a mask for 19 cents (plus shipping). Note: This was a promotional price. It looks like they're $2.29 today (April 18, 2018), but more varieties are available than when I purchased.\n\n**Packaging:** The box has that velvety feel and the sheet masks each have a matte background with colorful flowers that are glossy. It appears to be heavily borrowing from the packaging of the [Jayjun Anti-Dust](http://en.jayjun.co.kr/img/main_visual_antidusttherapy_en.jpg) sheet masks. The packaging is nicer than expected. Ingredients are listed in both Korean and English, but instructions are only in pictograms for those who don't read Korean. It's a sheet mask -- it's not that difficult.\n\n**Ingredients:** (I couldn't find these listed in English online, so here they are)\n\nWater, Glycerin, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Betaine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Polysorbate 20, Snail Secretion Filtrate (25g), Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Flower Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Pinuis Palustris Leaf Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract (Tea Leaf), Camellia Japonica Seed Extract (Camellia), Honey Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Hamamelis Virgniana Leaf Extract (Witch Hazel), Phenoxylethanol, Fragrance\n\nI just wanted to list them here for anyone who wants them. I'm not the world's best ingredient analyzer.\n\n**Use:** The first thing I noticed about the mask is how drippy it is. I left the mask on a flat surface for a couple of days so it could absorb the essence better. When I took it out of the pack, it was dripping into the sink -- something most masks don't do. \n\n**Fit/Material:** The mask fit OK, and would work for fiveheads like me. Others may need to fold it over on the forehead. The eye holes seemed smaller than average for sheet masks. The material is fairly thin on this one and it's translucent. Because the eye holes covered my eyebrows and the mask was drippy, I had serum running into my eyes, which was a first for me.\n\n**Fragrance:** The serum has a fairly robust rose fragrance. It's not overwhelming for me, but it is reasonably strong. The rose scent wasn't overly fake or perfumy, but it's definitely there. \n\n**Serum:** I found the serum didn't absorb into my skin as well as other masks I've used (including Innisfree, Mizon, Tosowoong, Leaders, Dermal Korea, MBD, etc.). I was patting for quite some time after I removed the mask. Despite how much was in the mask, I still had leftovers for my next couple of routines. The serum wasn't overly sticky, but I did need to put on moisturizer to make it dry down better. \n\n**Results:** The hydration level I got from this was OK. I didn't break out and my skin felt soft. It was overall a \"meh\" mask for me.\n\nI'm not sure if I'll repurchase or not. Summer is coming and I tend to mask more when it's hot, so these might be a nice way to mask more often at a low price.\n\n**Score:** 3/5",

        "body": "I’ve tried all three of the eyenlip sheet masks once so far, and the salmon oil one is my favorite; my skin felt softer and better hydrated after I used it. I had similar results with the hyaluronic acid mask, but not as pronounced. My experience with the snail essence mask was about the same as your experience.\n\nDid you get a slight itching sensation with the snail essence mask? It wasn’t bad enough that I felt the need to take the mask off immediately and it didn’t leave any irritation, but I definitely had light itchiness on my face a few minutes after putting the mask on. It could be coincidence because my face frequently itches at random.\n\nEdit: Also, thanks for this review! When I was initially looking at buying these masks I had a hard time finding any reviews on them. I hate spending money on untested products, so it’s good to get some reviews out there on these masks.",

What started off being a rather negative review about the Peach & Lily Skin Shield Blurring Primer has now become a review about me lol! Let’s get into it…\n\nThe Skin Shield Blurring Primer is a product that had me a little confused when it was announced last month. A primer product from Peach & Lily just didn’t seem in line with the brand’s product launches up to that point.\n\nBut, the marketing and product description sold me on this product’s ability to be used without makeup while still having a great benefit/impact to the skin. So...I went for it.\n\nEven though the Skin Shield Blurring Primer has a thin, lightweight, and creamy consistency...it is to be used after sunscreen. Peach & Lily uses their patented VoluSmooth complex in this primer which is said to be a natural alternative to silicone. \n\nAside from the VoluSmooth, this product contains centella asiatica, aloe leaf extract, and ceramides. There are quite a few fruit extracts as well for a boost of antioxidants (aka a great pairing with sunscreen).\n\nMy first impressions of this product weren’t that great. I filmed my first use of the Skin Shield Blurring Primer for social media and found it hard to mask my slight disappointment. I wanted to give the product a fair shot/proper time in my routine.\n\nBeing a cosmetic product intending to fall more on the makeup/skin blurring side of things...I expected to see a difference in my skin in terms of pore masking and tone evening pretty much immediately. However, my skin honestly looked the same...maybe (just maybe) a slightly different finish than what my sunscreen had already provided.\n\nAnother pain point was that the bottle cap started cracking and splintering pretty much from day one. It wasn’t a huge issue as it didn’t impact the product inside...but it was just kind of a bummer to see from the brand (and I’d hate to step on one of the plastic shards).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rt1p4lboolj51.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f4007f2e7a0f85366c19b8fd69add876e96644c6\n\nThe serum/primer itself also looks a bit odd in that it separates fairly drastically as it’s being dispensed. Certain bits are creamy while others are totally clear/watery. I’m not sure if this inconsistency impacts the result, but the Skin Shield Blurring Primer just doesn’t look or feel...finished. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y8gf8y0polj51.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48c0975832ca5b32790023cc4cd05692f2937953\n\nAs for how makeup applies over it or the end result with a full makeup application...I can’t speak to that because I do not wear makeup. Which is why I think it was a mistake for me to even give this product a try. \n\nI love sharing my thoughts on skincare products, trying new things, and finding items that really work for my skin. But adding this extra step into my routine where I had not had something before seemed a little excessive in the long-run. Especially for a product that didn’t seem to be doing much of anything.\n\nSure, there are some soothing and antioxidant ingredients in the formula...but I have to think they would have a hard time getting through sunscreen/other products to do their work. At that point, I should just stick to an actual serum that provides what I need.\n\nSo in the end...this might be the primer/serum hybrid that all makeup wearers have been waiting for. That just isn’t me and I don’t think I see the value of this product in my current routine/lifestyle. \n\nFull Ingredients List: Water (Aqua), C13-15 Alkane, Diethylhexyl Carbonate, Dipropylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-3 Polyricinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin) Isododecane, Synthetic Beeswax, Mica, Sodium Chloride, Myrciaria Dubia Fruit (Camu Camu) Extract, Bambusa (Bamboo) Textilis Stem Extract, Arctium Lappa (Burdock) Root Extract, Morus Alba (Mulberry) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassic Acid, Phytosphingosine, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Fragaria Vesca (Strawberry) Leaf Extract, Ceramide Np, Ceramide Ns, Ceramide As, Panthenol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Asiaticoside, Tocopheryl Acetate, Butylene Glycol, Cholesterol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Caprylyl Glycol, Disteardimonium Hectorite, 1,2-Hexanediol, Asiatic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Phosphoric Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ceramide Ap, Propylene Carbonate, Ubiquinone, Microcrystalline Wax, Propylene Glycol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Ceramide Eop\n\nWhere To Buy (Peach & Lily $34.00 USD): [https://www.peachandlily.com/products/skin-shield-blurring-primer](https://www.peachandlily.com/products/skin-shield-blurring-primer)",

        "body": "What a weird product. I personally would never use anything containing butters/oils/waxes over my sunscreen for fear of dissolving it- I mean that’s how oil cleansers effectively remove sunscreen anyway, right? Same reason I don’t use any makeup with oil/wax over my sunscreen.\n\nBesides, I don’t know why you would combine the serum/primer step in the first place. If you want actives to do work you probably want them closer to your skin, and I feel like so many AB sunscreens already serve as a sort of primer. This seems like it’s trying to replace two products and probably not being 100% successful in replacing either. \n\nI don’t get the point of a natural alternative to silicone, either. What’s the point? It’s not as if the myriad forms of silicone are dangerous or ineffective. I mean they might as well just say silicone-free, because many people don’t enjoy the feel of silicone based primers. But saying you have a natural alternative to silicone with no further explanation is tantamount to saying instead of silicone we included other ingredients- a pointless statement, truly.",

    "body": "Hello there! I was fortunate enough to receive the newly reformulated All-Day Airy Sunscreen by Klairs. I've been using it for just over a week now. Here's what I think:\n\n**Texture:** Super light and \"airy\" for sure. It's not greasy or watery. It feels like a moisturizer, so it's probably best for those with normal or dry skin. I have dry skin and can skip my (light) morning moisturizer when I use this. \n\n**Finish:** This product didn't leave any whitecast on me. It dried down to a slightly dewy, radiant finish. Somehow I look glowy without looking greasy, which doesn't usually happen for me with sunscreens! It soaked in really quickly and applied easily.\n\n**Wear:** While this goes on great, I've noticed that it starts to pill if you're a frequent face-toucher or by the end of the day. For this reason I haven't tried to put makeup over it yet. I also don't think it's the best for reapplication, though I haven't tried (I've been sick and haven't been out much haha). It just starts to pill if you handle it too much.\n\n**Sun protection:** The UV protection was rated by three different clinical trial institutions to confirm the SPF and PA ratings. The sunscreen is rated as SPF50+ and PA++++. After the debacle with their last formulation, Klairs seems to have stepped their game up (thankfully).\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! This would probably be my favorite sunscreen if it weren't for the pilling. It's great for short-term wear, but unfortunately breaks down as the day goes on.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Vegan and cruelty free\n* Free of bad alcohols (contains two moisturizing, beneficial alcohols)\n* Free of essential oils and fragrance\n* Contains niacinamide, glycerin, and aloe, among other beneficial ingredients\n* Utilizes 4 different chemical and broad spectrum UV blockers\n\nAqua (Water), Dibutyl Adipate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Polysilicone-15, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Polyglyceryl-6 Stearate, Cetearyl Olivate, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Panthenol, Silica, Sorbitan Olivate, Dipropylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Poly C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate, Polyglyceryl-6 Behenate, Allantoin, Caprylyl Glycol, Stearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Adenosine, Cetearyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Butylene Glycol, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Lepidium Meyenii Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Berberis Vulgaris Root Extract, Morus Nigra Fruit Extract",

    "body": "Disclaimer: I am not a doctor, or a dietician. This is my own experience based on years of research and experimentation. You should see a doctor and get professional medical advice. Take from this post what you will. \n\nSo this is my story.\nI have been dealing with IBS for as long as I can remember. The diarrhoea, bloating, flatulence, cramps, incredible pain at times, all of it affecting me every single day. \nIn 2013 I went to my GP and she referred me to a gastroenterologist, which I was on a waiting list for about a year before I got to see. After seeing him, he then referred me to a dietician to work with me on a low FODMAP diet, which made me realise just how bad living with IBS is, because a few days in on the low FODMAP diet, basically all of my symptoms went away. I slowly introduced the different foods back into my diet and realised what my particular triggers were (soy milk, silken tofu, cauliflower being amongst the worst foods I could ever put in my body, amongst a few others) but eventually I got to a point where it was at a manageable level, I still had symptoms everyday but they were at a lower level than I had previously been living with. \nAnd yet, I still suffered everyday. Waking up everyday feeling like your guts have been kicked in and then about 6 to 7 trips to the toilet all morning is still better than what my life was like before, but that is still no answer. \nI went back to another gastroenterologist because I felt like there had to be more options.\nWe did stool samples that confirmed that there were no abnormalities, no serious conditions and that it was definitely IBS like I had been diagnosed with a few years earlier. \nHe referred me to try Iberogast, which apparently helps a lot of people with IBS, unfortunately for whatever reason it actually made all my symptoms worse, so I gave it up after trying to use it for about 2 months. \nI went back to just dealing with the problems every day. \nI’m also a gay man, and a product called “pure for men” promised to keep people clean ready to have fun came out. I decided to give it a shot, because why the hell not. It was a fibre supplement and I didn’t really expect much out of it.\nTo my absolute and utter shock, taking 3 capsules twice daily completely took away all my symptoms, and after my whole life never passing a solid stool, I was jumping for joy when a beautiful solid stool was what was coming out of me, and only once to twice a day. Not to mention the fact that I could have fun and it was completely mess and worry free. \nBut there was a problem, pure for men was expensive, especially for what the product was made of. \nSo it became my mission to find out how to make this wonder product myself. \n\nI first tried following the recipe I found here \n\nhttp://agingbull.com/474/pure-for-men-is-not-a-scam-but-it-is-a-rip-off-save-your-money/\n\nWhich is a recipe for making it yourself, but it was lacking one of the ingredients (aloe Vera extract) \n\nThis recipe gave me some relief, but did not provide anywhere close to the results I had experienced using Pure for men. \n\nSo I ordered a pack of aloe Vera leaf extract powder and experimented with a few different ratios, which surprisingly affected the results I got drastically. \n\nThen came the week that I tried a particular ratio. I bloody hit the jackpot! \n\nI give to you the recipe that works for me, and has completely taken away all my symptoms and gives me the most beautiful solid stools only once to twice daily. \n\nPsyllium Husk Powder 60%\nAloe Vera Leaf Extract (powder) 20%\nChia Seeds (ground /powder ) 10%\nFlaxseeds (ground/ powder) 10%\n\nMix the above together well to ensure it is well combined. \n\nSo if you make up a batch of 100grams, follow the above with the percentages as grams, or make smaller or larger batches following that ratio. \n\nI take 1 level teaspoon (it works out to be around 2.5 grams) twice daily shortly after my breakfast and dinner. \nI put the mixture into a glass, add enough water to make it drinkable, and shot it down, followed by a few glasses of water. \nI won’t lie, the taste of it is pretty awful (because of the aloe Vera powder) but I got used to it after a couple of weeks, and to be quite frank, I don’t care how bad it tastes, it has literally changed my life forever. \n\nI really hope that this could help others out there, and that this may work for you. Using this everyday and avoiding my extreme trigger foods essentially leaves me symptom free. \n\nPlease let me know how you go if you try this, and if you have any questions. \nI’d also like to know if this helps people with other kinds of IBS, if you do try it and it works with constipation or fluctuating IBS please let others know. \n\nPeace out and enjoy your beautiful poos. ❤️\n\nTL/DR\n\nAfter years of IBS I have discovered that taking a the below recipe (1 teaspoon twice daily after meals) has completely taken away all of my symptoms. \n\nPsyllium Husk Powder 60%\nAloe Vera Leaf Extract (powder) 20%\nChia Seeds (ground /powder ) 10%\nFlaxseeds (ground/ powder) 10%",

    "body": "Thought I'd review this since I wasn't able to find many reviews online!\n\n**Purpose of purchase:** I wanted a larger size, cheap sunscreen for daily application during non-hot seasons and indoors. And I was running out of my Biore Watery Gel. So I bought the [MISSHA All Around Safe Block Total Moisture Sun Gel](http://missha.ee/en/catalog#!73/products/497) after seeing it mentioned in a comment here that it was 250 ml, biggest Asian sunscreen size I've seen. I generally prefer a higher spf, but I figure SPF 30/PA+++ is fine for when I'm only going to be in the car for short periods or in a building. I'm in Canada and work in Healthcare so sometimes I don't see the sun before or after work anyway. :|\n\n**Purchase:** On [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/MISSHA-Around-Block-Total-Moisture/dp/B014FE4XWM), from Jolse. Packaging was great, lots of bubble wrap in a box, took 28 days to arrive.\n\n**Ingredients:** ([CosDNA link](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_1c09208285.html), though I'm lucky that my skin doesn't react to much so I wasn't too concerned.)\n\nWater, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butylene Glycol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Alcohol Denat., Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Glycerin, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Behenyl Alcohol, Silica, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Carbomer, Caprylyl Glycol, Fragrance(Parfum), Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Myristyl Myristate, Brassica Campestris (Rapeseed) Sprout Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Rosa Davurica Bud Extract, Juniperus Communis Sprout Extract, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Palmitate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Limonia Acidissima Extract.\n\n**Previously used:** Biore Watery Gel, Shiseido Senka, and Biore Face Milk. Never tried the Watery Essence, figured I'd be fine with the gel since it was cheaper. In the morning during the winter, I'd rinse with warm water, put a thin layer of Cerave Moisturizing Lotion on under the Biore Watery Gel. I used Senka without any moisturizer underneath. I moisturize under Biore Face Milk, and only use this during active and/or extremely hot summer days.\n\n**REVIEW, FINALLY:** I like it. The gel smells a little florally and I find it very slightly unpleasant, but it goes away in 20 min or so. Because it's a gel, it doesn't need to be shaken up so it decants easily into a smaller container. When I first apply it, it feels weird, like I was rubbing a lot of gel cleanser on my face. It takes longer to absorb than the Biore watery gel, and feels like it probably has less alcohol. I look \"dewy\" for maybe about 20 min, and after that I can't feel any trace of it on my face. It's definitely not matte, but not dewy. Doesn't feel \"velvety\" either. My skin just feels nicely moisturized but not covered in goo, and I'd have to say looks closer to being dewy than matte. I don't think this would be suitable for anyone with oily skin. Mine is slightly dry and felt great with no moisturizer under it.\n\nI'm pretty happy with this purchase, as it's economical and suits its purpose. I would like to have something higher SPF for hot summer days that aren't sweltering and I'm not going to be active, as I feel like Biore Face Milk is excessive for this purpose and annoying expensive for the tiny 30 ml bottle. I'll probably either order a replacement Biore Watery gel for that, or try something slightly more matte than the watery gel. I'm interested in the new formulations, but will wait for the price to fall before I even consider ordering.\n\n**My Routine:**\n\nAM:\n\n* rinse w/ warm water\n* Cerave moisturizing lotion + Biore watery gel, OR just Missha All Around Safe block\n\nPM:\n\n* The Face Shop Bright Rich cleansing oil (totally meh about this, trying to use it up because the store doesn't take returns), OR\n* Muji Sensitive Skin cleansing oil\n* Cerave Hydrating cleanser\n* Mizon AHA & BHA Daily Clean Toner (for pH adjusting)\n* CosRX BHA blackhead power liquid\n* CosRX AHA 7 whitehead power liquid OR The Ordinary Advanced Retinoid 2%\n* The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%\n* Ole Henrikson Truth Serum (vit C, a sample that I'm meh about)\n* Humidity Cezanne skin conditioner coercive (1-2 layers depending, also layer on lips)\n* First Aid Beauty ultra repair cream (really like this but pretty expensive, looking for replacement)\n* Aquaphor on lips\n\nI do wait times when I have time, otherwise it's 30 seconds between or less really. No pilling even then.",

There are some 2M views for that reel.\nIn comments, the mom(not sure if she's the mom) says that she is using eyetex supreme kajal for the baby. Just out of curiosity I googled the ingredients in eyetex supreme kajal. Here is it:\n\nINGREDIENTS. Composition : Ricinus communis (Castor) Seed oil, Copernicia cerifera (Carnauba) Wax,polyethylene, Ozokerite, Bis- Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, PPG-3 Benzyl Ether Myristate, Aloe barbadensis leaf Extract & Canola Oil, Propylparaben, Methylparaben, May contain CI 77266, CI 77268:1.\n\nJust saw that the last two ingredients ie: Carbon black, the long term exposure can cause accumulation in lungs, leading to lung diseases.\nShould we appreciate applying kajal on babies, even though it is socially popular in Kerala? My personal opinion is no, I dont support irritating their gentle skin and eyes with such artificial compounds.\nHow much we try to get babies to have beautiful brows and eyelashes using these, it is all genetics in the end.\nPlease tell your opinion, apart from warding off evil eyes(this is what I have heard), is there any significance to this?",

Also parabens (both the types that you have listed) are really bad. A lot of cosmetics have them, and they are linked with many health issues including cancer. Even if you are using the homemade kajal without all these preservatives, it still might cause mild irritation to the baby’s eyes. At the cost of what benefits? Nothing.

Or if you really need kajal for infants then make it from scratch at home. It’s doable. And never use any foreign things (organic or otherwise) in the eye of an infant.

    "body": "Hello all!\n\nHere's my review of Disguise Cosmetic's Sorbet after using it for more than 2 weeks. I have tried to cover it in as great a detail as possible but for any query, do post it in the comments! I'll also be copy-pasting the review in the Moisturiser mega thread.\n\n* **Product Name:** Diguise Cosmetic's C+C Sorbet\n* **Review Type:** Rave, sort of.\n* **Price (range):** Rs 400 for 50 g\n* **Availability in India:** Online, easily available at Disguise, Nykaa, Sublime and many other online platforms\n* **Skin info:** Combination. Oily T zone. Is now normal to dry in winters. (26 yo F)\n* **Climate:** Continental, hence at the moment slightly cold and dry.\n* **Ingredient list:** This is the inci list on their website that can be accessed [here](https://www.disguisecosmetics.com/pages/in-key-c-c-sorbet). I like that they have mentioned the function of each ingredient within brackets.\n\nAqua (Hydration), Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer (Texture and Film-Forming), Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate (Emollient and Structure), Hydrogenated Polydecene (Emollient), Trideceth-10 (Emollient), Isopropyl Myristate (Emollient), Olive Oil Glycereth-8 Esters (Emollient), Dimethicone (Texture), Propanediol (Emollient), Olive Seed Oil (Skin Replenishing), Betain (Skin Soothing), Seaweed Extract (Skin Repair), Green Tea Leaf Extract (Anti-Inflammatory and Antioxidant), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract (Hydration and Soothing), Avocado Fruit Oil (Skin Soothing), Tocopheryl Acetate (Antioxidant), Disodium EDTA (Chelating Agent), Phenoxyethanol (Preservative), Ethylhexylglycerin (Preservative), Fragrance, CI 19140 (water soluble yellow pigment), CI 42090 (water soluble blue pigment)\n\n* **Moisturiser type:** Gel, but slightly on the thicker end.\n* **Special info:** Disguise makes lovely lipsticks. It is a cruelty free brand that is managed by \"three scientists\" as per them. I did check their credentials and they all have some experience in the cosmetics industry. Also an Indian brand that I actually like (yes rare, i know). There customer service is good and they are very helpful. I have dm'd them on instagram many times and they have responded within 24 hrs.\n* **Experience & opinion:** As we have been collectively mourning the unavailability of the Simple light hydrating moisturiser for quite some time, I thought that I should be very judicious with my only bottle of Simple light moisturiser and buy something that I can use alternatively with it. While I like the Simple moisturiser, it was also proving to be inefficient with the arrival of winters. During day time it was sufficient but when I would apply it at night, in the morning my skin would be dry and flaky near my lips and nose. And that's another reason why I wanted to purchase something nourishing but not greasy. In the meantime I also got COSRX's honey sleeping mask, and for some reason, Honey which works for most people, did not work for me. I got small bumps on my otherwise clear skin, so I stopped using it and again was looking for something that would calm my skin and help remedy this.\n\nDisguise's sorbet in that sense became my solution to all of this. I have used their lipsticks which i love and was eyeing the Sorbet. They market it is as [\"ultralight cooling and calming balm\"](https://www.disguisecosmetics.com/products/c-c-sorbet). The inci list is good if not great. You may notice that it is a silicone heavy moisturiser, which I thought would make it occlusive enough. I have been using it for the last two weeks, and it has actually really helped me tackle all the problems I was facing. I use it during my night time routine after my innisfree green tea seed serum. While Simple was not enough for dry winters, Sorbet is. **Like I mentioned, it is a light but an occlusive moisturiser.** It also calmed my skin and my skin has gone back to how it was before I started using COSRX honey sleeping mask. The texture is nice and light and the moisturiser does not feel heavy at all. Well at least to my skin. I have been enjoying using it so much. Perhaps the only downside is that it has fragrance and dye (last ingredients) but that's not an issue for me since the product has been working well for me. The main con for me is that it is too small in size. I am already at the verge of finishing it given that I only use it during night and that too for the past 2 and a half weeks. However, Disguise collects the empties to reuse them/recycle them, which I guess is a good thing though too much of a hassle. If only they can bring a big sized tube to this, it would be wonderful. I also understand that silicone heavy moisturisers can give the impact that they are working when infact it is just silicone. However, since my skin was suffering before using this and this calmed it down (or did nothing so the skin came back to how it was), it worked for me atleast. My skin is not dry when I wake up and neither is it aggravated at the moment.\n\n* **Repurchase Status:** Might be HG is there is a bigger sized tube for it.\n\nI do not know if it can be used as a primer since I dont use makeup.\n\nAlso would love to know other suitable options to Simple Light moisturiser!",

Lots of Korean products since I checked out Shin-Okubo and the sales lady was... very persuading, haha.\n\nI did pick some stuff which I haven't seen here (correct me if I'm wrong) and I will slowly post reviews once I use them.\n\nMy haul:\nhttp://imgur.com/vUwSmtq\n\nI forgot to photograph other stuff I'd already bought and used like DHC lipbalm, Kiss me Heroine mascara, Kate eyeshadow, Canake eyeshadow primer, super cute headband from Tokyu Hands (purple and mint)...\n\nFirst of all, a cleansing balm. I normally use **Shu Uemura ultime8 sublime beauty cleansing oil** (+ either Hada Labo cleanser or a cheapo German one as 2nd cleanser) and I looove it. It even gets rid of the Kiss me Heroine mascara!\n\nI was browsing in a Ainz&Tulpe shop in Harajuku and saw this and thought it sounded interesting:\nhttp://imgur.com/vkwSH00\nhttp://imgur.com/gbuebKz\nhttp://imgur.com/kyXv536\n\n* Cationic surfacant free (I'd to google this)\n* Fragrance free\n* Colorant free\n* Paraben free\n* Alcohol free\n* Mineral oil free\n\nAnd it was pretty cheap 1620 yen for 100 g. It comes with a little plastic spoon (hidden under the lid).\n\nThis is how it looks undisturbed:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/l8bdfJ2\n\nOn the spoon:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/X62ZlJT\n\nOn skin (slightly massaged in):\n\nhttp://imgur.com/o7159Vs\n\nI put on the following:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/1KTo3LU\n\n* Liquid foundation (Chifure)\n* One-day tattoo super black eyeliner (only thing my oily eyelids will not destroy)\n* Guerlain red lipstick\n* Shu Uemura purple eyeshadow\n\nYou have to use it on dry skin, take a small amount of the balm  and massage it onto the skin. Then rinse with warm water.\n\nBefore rinsing:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/mv3ah\n\n(You can see it took off my foundation, lipstick and eyeshadow but the eyeliner remains)\n\nAfter rinsing:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Azg4jIJ\n\n(Yay, eyeliner is gone!)\n\nMy skin hasn't freaked out yet (it felt soooft). Their lotion apparently is pretty popular but since it is a new product I haven't found any reviews on it.\n\nhttp://alovivi.jp/shopdetail/000000000068/ct24/page1/order/\n\nMy skin: Dehydrated but oily (nose and forehead). 28 years old, live in Germany.\n\n**Ingredients (Google translated):**\nEthylhexyl palmitate, triethylhexanoin, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, polyethylene, isopropyl palmitate, PEG-5 glyceryl triisostearate, aloe vera leaf extract, sodium hyaluronate, squalane, comedocasphospholipid, hydrogenated lecithin, lysolecithin, Lime fruit juice, orange juice, lemon juice, grapefruit fruit extract, hawthorn extract, jujube fruit extract, apple fruit extract, water soluble proteoglycan, water soluble collagen, yuzu fruit extract, pearl barley seed extract, Argania spinosa nuclear oil, olive fruit oil, Jojoba seed oil, tocopherol, water, BG, phenoxyethanol\n\nAnd: Isn't this Sailor Moon blush beautiful??\nhttp://imgur.com/ZnXvDYw",

What started off being a rather negative review about the Peach & Lily Skin Shield Blurring Primer has now become a review about me lol! Let’s get into it…\n\nThe Skin Shield Blurring Primer is a product that had me a little confused when it was announced last month. A primer product from Peach & Lily just didn’t seem in line with the brand’s product launches up to that point.\n\nBut, the marketing and product description sold me on this product’s ability to be used without makeup while still having a great benefit/impact to the skin. So...I went for it.\n\nEven though the Skin Shield Blurring Primer has a thin, lightweight, and creamy consistency...it is to be used after sunscreen. Peach & Lily uses their patented VoluSmooth complex in this primer which is said to be a natural alternative to silicone. \n\nAside from the VoluSmooth, this product contains centella asiatica, aloe leaf extract, and ceramides. There are quite a few fruit extracts as well for a boost of antioxidants (aka a great pairing with sunscreen).\n\nMy first impressions of this product weren’t that great. I filmed my first use of the Skin Shield Blurring Primer for social media and found it hard to mask my slight disappointment. I wanted to give the product a fair shot/proper time in my routine.\n\nBeing a cosmetic product intending to fall more on the makeup/skin blurring side of things...I expected to see a difference in my skin in terms of pore masking and tone evening pretty much immediately. However, my skin honestly looked the same...maybe (just maybe) a slightly different finish than what my sunscreen had already provided.\n\nAnother pain point was that the bottle cap started cracking and splintering pretty much from day one. It wasn’t a huge issue as it didn’t impact the product inside...but it was just kind of a bummer to see from the brand (and I’d hate to step on one of the plastic shards).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/glrjk9kholj51.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c1e4e9ced2967f94e30c59552f27823a3ce6c0db\n\nThe serum/primer itself also looks a bit odd in that it separates fairly drastically as it’s being dispensed. Certain bits are creamy while others are totally clear/watery. I’m not sure if this inconsistency impacts the result, but the Skin Shield Blurring Primer just doesn’t look or feel...finished. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hliiy1aiolj51.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e0d9445538f4b5a9af0ec2a41644752d9868bab5\n\nAs for how makeup applies over it or the end result with a full makeup application...I can’t speak to that because I do not wear makeup. Which is why I think it was a mistake for me to even give this product a try. \n\nI love sharing my thoughts on skincare products, trying new things, and finding items that really work for my skin. But adding this extra step into my routine where I had not had something before seemed a little excessive in the long-run. Especially for a product that didn’t seem to be doing much of anything.\n\nSure, there are some soothing and antioxidant ingredients in the formula...but I have to think they would have a hard time getting through sunscreen/other products to do their work. At that point, I should just stick to an actual serum that provides what I need.\n\nSo in the end...this might be the primer/serum hybrid that all makeup wearers have been waiting for. That just isn’t me and I don’t think I see the value of this product in my current routine/lifestyle. \n\nFull Ingredients List: Water (Aqua), C13-15 Alkane, Diethylhexyl Carbonate, Dipropylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-3 Polyricinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin) Isododecane, Synthetic Beeswax, Mica, Sodium Chloride, Myrciaria Dubia Fruit (Camu Camu) Extract, Bambusa (Bamboo) Textilis Stem Extract, Arctium Lappa (Burdock) Root Extract, Morus Alba (Mulberry) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassic Acid, Phytosphingosine, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Fragaria Vesca (Strawberry) Leaf Extract, Ceramide Np, Ceramide Ns, Ceramide As, Panthenol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Asiaticoside, Tocopheryl Acetate, Butylene Glycol, Cholesterol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Caprylyl Glycol, Disteardimonium Hectorite, 1,2-Hexanediol, Asiatic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Phosphoric Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ceramide Ap, Propylene Carbonate, Ubiquinone, Microcrystalline Wax, Propylene Glycol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Ceramide Eop\n\nWhere To Buy (Peach & Lily $34.00 USD): [https://www.peachandlily.com/products/skin-shield-blurring-primer](https://www.peachandlily.com/products/skin-shield-blurring-primer)",

It doesn’t blur; if anything, one could argue that the glow emphasizes pores.

    "body": "Peach & Lily - Pure Peach Retinoic Eye Cream\n\nAnother eye cream review...from someone that should not be reviewing eye creams.\n\nReally though, I need to stop buying eye specific skincare and I think the Peach & Lily Pure Peach Retinoic Eye Cream will be the last one (at least for a good long while).\n\nI’m lucky enough that I don’t (yet) tackle many of the issues that eye products are meant to address. I’m not seeing any lines or wrinkles in that area really...and the slight darkness/bagginess I have has been there since I was a tiny human.\n\nSo, I fear that any amazing benefits or results might be a bit lost on me. At least that seems to be the trend since no eye product I have tried has truly wowed me.\n\nWhat I do like about the Pure Peach Retinoic Eye Cream is that it features so many ingredients I love in a product that is lightweight and absorbs beautifully. Niacinamide, ginseng, bamboo, and several antioxidant rich greens are here.\n\nAlso, Bakuchiol is in the formulation which is said to be a more “natural” and gentle alternative to Retinol. From what I’ve read and heard from skincare professionals...we need more studies/research before making that claim with confidence.\n\nMy experience with this product is that it hydrates my eye area really well and plays nicely with the other products in my routine. That in addition to the nice dose of antioxidants makes this a fine product for me...I just can’t say for certain that it is doing much more than that.\n\nA little bit goes a really long way here so I’ll probably have this bottle in my routine for quite some time. But, I don't think it is something I would come back to...I guess the same could be said for all eye products (for now).\n\nLike I said...not the best person to be reviewing this one lol!\n\nFull Ingredients List: Water, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Bambusa (Bamboo) Textilis Stem Extract, Arctium Lappa (Burdock) Root Extract, Morus Alba (Mulberry) Leaf Extract, Prunus Persica (Peach) Fruit Extract, Bakuchiol, Rosa Rubiginosa Seed Oil, Daucus Carota (Carrot) Sativa Root Water, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Spinacia Oleracea (Spinach) Leaf Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Acetyl Octapeptide-3, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Extract, Apium Graveolens (Celery) Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Sorbitan Olivate, Lactuca Scariola Sativa (Lettuce) Leaf Extract, Ceramide Np, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ferulic Acid, Tocopherol, Panthenol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Adenosine, Cetearyl Olivate, Hydrogenated Rapeseed Alcohol, Betaine, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyglyceryl-4 Oleate, Glyceryl Olivate, Glyceryl Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Asparagus Officinalis Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Phosphoric Acid, Corallina Officinalis Extract\n\nWhere To Buy (Peach & Lily - $42.00 USD - 20ml): [https://www.peachandlily.com/products/pure-peach-retinoic-eye-cream](https://www.peachandlily.com/products/pure-peach-retinoic-eye-cream)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nsx4ky6ob6p51.jpg?width=1098&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=286e4316987d70bf7911feacbd7c512e74369313",

Sharing a Quick Review of my experience.\n\n**Skin Type:** Combination skin, Oily T-zone\n\n**Climate**: Hot & Moderately Humid\n\n**Age:** 30\n\n**1) A'Pieu Pure Block Waterproof Sun Cream SPF50 PA+++**\n\nhttps://maccaron.in/en/products/apieu_pure-block-waterproof-sun-cream-spf50pa/13146/\n\n**Price:** 730 for 50gm, but is mostly available for around Rs. 450 bucks.\n\n**Usage Time:** 2 weeks\n\n**Current AM/PM Routine:** Angel Face wash<Rovectin Toner<Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel<A'Pieu Sunscreen \n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, Cyclohexasiloxane, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Glycerin, Octocrylene, Sodium Chloride, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Sorbitan Isostearate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Fragrance(Parfum), Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Silica Dimethyl Silylate, Dimethicone, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Butylene Glycol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Punica Granatum Extract, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Vanilla Tahitensis Fruit Extract, Citrulline, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Prunus Domestica Seed Extract, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract\n\n**Fragrance:** Even though it's listed as an Ingredient, didn't feel any.\n\n**Texture:** Liquid\n\n**Finish:** Matte\n\n**My Experience:** This was the most heartbreaking Sunscreen ever. You may wonder why!!\n\nWell, have you ever found a perfect match only to have one  flaw ruin everything? That's my journey with this Sunscreen.\n\nThis Sunscreen has everything - Waterproof, Sweatproof, Sandproof (I don't know such thing exists), Non-greasy, adequate sun protection, like it checks all the boxes to become your HG.\n\nExcept One. Horrible white cast \n\nIt gave a matte finish on my combination skin, very comfortable to wear but have such a white cast that it was so difficult to blend. The white cast is difficult to ignore on my fair skin, it almost felt as if I've dabbed too much powder on my face.\n\nI've not yet found a sunscreen under this budget that felt so amazing on skin, but the white cast is just too loud on my face to ignore. Sadly, I won't be purchasing it again. Hoping they reformulate and do something about the white cast.\n\n**WNP:** WNRP\n\n.\n--------------\n.\n\n2) **CeraVe Sunscreen Stick SPF 50 | 0.47 Ounce | Mineral Sunscreen for Kids & Adults**\n\nhttps://amzn.eu/d/ieRcTnv\n\n**Price:** Available for Rs. 2000 on Amazon, before discounts. I bought it Rs. 800 from an IG thrift store.\n\n**Type:** Mineral Sun Stick\n\n**Ingredients:** Active Ingredients: Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide\nInactive Ingredients: C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Paraffin, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Ozokerite, Dimethicone, Beeswax, Polyethylene, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6 II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, BHT, Carbomer, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Isostearic Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Xanthan Gum\n\n**AM/PM routine:** I've mostly used it for re-application since months, so do not remember the exact routine.\n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\n**Usage Time:** Quite inconsistent with this coz I don't like the finish.\n\n**Claims:** Water Resistant, Non-comedogenic, suitable for sensitive skin and children.\n\n**My Experience:** This is my first ever sunstick, and will probably be my last. I thought using sunstick is supposed to be a smooth experience, but I didn't enjoy the experience this brought.\n\nFirst, It gives off a white cast, then post application, I've to blend it with my fingers. I thought I wouldn't need to blend in case of sun stick. \n\nSecond, There was a mild tugging of skin involved . The application ain't as smooth as I would've expected.\n\nThird, The feel of it on skin was not comfortable. It felt sticky.\n\nNot to forget, I could see tiny particles getting stuck on the stock, maybe from my skin itself during application or external forces. That made me question the hygiene using a sunstick.\n\nAll of this pretty much turned me off. I found myself not reaching for it daily.\n\n**WRP:** WNRP\n\n.\n.\n\n3) **Derma Co. Hyaluronic Invisible Sunscreen Gel with Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E - 50g**\n\nhttps://thedermaco.com/product/hyaluronic-invisible-sunscreen-gel-with-hyaluronic-acid-vitamin-e-50g\n\n**Price:** Rs. 599/- for 50g\n\n**Ingredients:** Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Octyl Methoxycinnamate, Octocrylene, Octyl Salicylate, Tocopheryl Acetate, PEG-8 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides (and) Water (and) Octyldodeceth-25 (and) Sodium Hyaluronate.\n\n**AM/PM Routine:** Angel Face wash<Rovectin Toner<Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Cream<Derma Co Sunscreen \n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\n**Texture:** Transparent gel\n\n**Finish:** Matte\n\n**Usage Time:**   Approx a month\n\n**Claims:** Can be used as primer base for makeup, Ideal for all skin types \n\n**My Experience:** I hated it. From the moment I bought it, It used to pill. Prior to this, I never understood when people commented on their Sunscreen pilling, but this Sunscreen introduced me to what pilling means.\n\nI could also never understand if I blended my Sunscreen properly. I tried different ways, twice also used it on my hands, thinking maybe it was me who wasn't blending properly leading to all the pilling. But no, It pilled everywhere. \n\nAs a person wearing specs, it Sunscreen pilling on your glasses and in this summer heat mixing with your sweat is just gross. \n\nSo No, I'm never getting it again and never recommending anyone to get it. Proper to this, I've used Conscious Chemist SPF 30 Invisible Sunscreen, that was so comfortable and never once pilled. So there are probably good invisible sunscreen out there, just not this one \n\n**WNP:** WRNP",

This is my first sunscreen stick. I love the matte finish it gives on me. I've Oily Sensitive Skin, I applied it around my eyes as well and it didn't sting. It doesn't leave a white cast on me. And I do swipe it 5 times on each spot. I didn't use it a lot, as I don't go out that often. But I do like to use it for reapplication whenever I'm outside. I do love this a lot more than their sunscreen in tube (which leaves me looking like greasy mess).",

YMMV BUT here are my results\n10 days in a row, if you skip two days (you'll see it) you'll have to start over...smh. There's no Vitamin C if you want something extreme..everything is \"natural\" and heck this really smells like oatmeal and feels...quite wet and soothing. The mask is quite transparent, so if you have acne or redness you should be able to see it underneath \n\nI will now type out the ingredients \n\nWater, Glycosy Trehalsoe/Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate (Trehalose), Xanthan gum, MethylParaben, Phenoxyethanol, Tranexamic Acd, D-Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Alpha-Arbutin, Allantoin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hyaluronic acid, Frangrance (HAHA OATMEAL FRAGRANCE). \n\nSo. as we can see here This IS SOME PRETTY cheap stuff. \nI believe it's around $10 usd or 300 if you're in Taiwan. So would I buy this? NO haha my mom buys this for me and I am 100% appreciative. I think it's most effective for anyone who's skin is mildy oil with a few pimples at times. IF YOU have a bit of extreme acne (borderline cystic or pretty much cystic ;A;) it doesn't break me out. \n2/5 I use this when I run out of my vitamin c stuff (dr wu or dewytree) \n\nThank you for reading ;A; ",

I was afraid that it would be too rich for my skin and would break out, but not at all! I haven't had any pimples, blackheads or congested skin from this product. It nourished my skin and it helped lighten my spots faster while making them completely disappear!\n\nI clearly saw a before and after with this serum, with it some of my scars that had been there for a long time are gone, I'm so happy. I did not notice that I had a brighter complexion but basically I do not have a dull complexion, moreover this product is not enough on its own to moisturize, as it is nourishing I needed other products to hydrate. It mixes well with other products but I didn't use any active ingredients with this serum.\n\nThe only reason I won't buy this product is that it's out of budget... But it comes in a nice heavy 50ml glass bottle and it lasts super long so if you have the budget it's a good investment.\n\nAlso it didn't remove all my scars because I keep having pimples in the same places so before I can even hope to fade some scars I already have another pimple appearing but it's not the fault of the product it's just my skin.So I think it would be better to use it coupled with an anti-acne/anti-pimples treatment or if you no longer have this kind of problem at all just spots to treat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/75v0djllg7591.jpg?width=633&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f0b5eafcd614ee676307d0a0b144ff67ddcdb96\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2me0aa7og7591.jpg?width=661&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6fbcbed142e03156eb1de72c0795d828852cf1cc",

    "body": "My Skin: Old, Oily, Acne-Prone, Mild Rosacea\n\n[This site](http://myphamhanquochcm.com/cham-soc-da/mat-na/mat-na-bi-heo-elizavecca-milky-piggy-carbonated-bubble-clay-mask.html) has some nice pics of the mask. Just to be clear, I didn't buy it from there. \n\nI usually use either Freeman's or Queen Helene's clay mask. They do a nice job but I hate having to use a face cloth to get the masks off. Lazy people like me don't want to scrub, plus it probably isn't great for my skin. So I was looking for something else to try and decided on the Elizavecca Milky Piggy Carbonated Bubble Clay Mask. How could I not with that name?\n\n**Packaging:** Tub with spatula. It comes with an inner lid that I guess help keep it fresh. The inner lid is a little tight and sometimes doesn't seem to want to let me into the product. I'm going to count opening it as exercise.\n\n**Texture:** A cross between pudding and jelly. It's weird. Seriously weird. And it is grey which adds to the weirdness. It's a grey, lumpy, jiggly mass with little air pockets. \n\n**Smell:** Yes. Oh yes. It has an odd smell. I don't know how to describe it. It isn't really pleasant but it isn't horrendous either. Kind of earthy or maybe like some sort of herb I guess. I have had multiple people sniff it but they are as useless as I am in describing the smell. We are nasally challenged.\n\n**Instructions:** You smear it over your face (a thin layer works well), wait 5 minutes, add water and massage for 2 minutes then rinse. Sounds simple. Ha!\n\n**Use:** As you smear this on your face it will begin to bubble. I've only used it twice but there is no way I could cover my entire face before it starts to bubble up. I tried. I will try again. It is like a race I will never win.\n\nOnce it bubbles it does tickle a little. Resist the urge to scratch. And you can hear it bubbling. A strange experience. Plus it makes your face a lumpy, grey, bubbling mess. Which is cool. Especially for scaring others. Or dogs.\n\nAdding water takes away the foam and makes it creamier as you massage. Adding more water makes it feel more like a foam cleanser. I wonder how much of the cleansing effect is from this step. \n\nRinsing isn't that easy. It seems to take a LOT of rinsing to get the product off my face. I've decided this is now a pre-shower product as I am tired (after just 2 uses) of having to clean my sink after rinsing this off. Plus I won't have to keep scooping handfuls of water over my face while yelling \"why won't this get off my face!\" It is easier to remove than a normal clay mask but that doesn't make it easy. \n\n**Results:** I think it does a nice job of cleansing. My skin doesn't feel as dry as it does after the Queen Helene mask. I know some people who have reviewed this seem to think that because it doesn't dry and get that tight on the skin feeling that it doesn't cleanse as well. I'm less sure.\n\nI really need to use it more before I decide if it is repurchase worthy. It definitely will be fun at Christmas when I make others try it. Nothing says the holidays like a family photo of people with grey, lumpy, bubbly faces.\n\nETA: \n\n**Ingredients:** green tea extract, aloe vera leaf extract, matcha powder, charcoal powder, pomegranate extract, fermented soy extract, alantoin, peony root extract, oregano leaf extract, white willow peel extract, portulaca extract, cinnamon extract (found list online and am going to try and check vs container)",

    "body": "Ladies and gents. Today was a great day. Today I received my Gudetama sheet masks in the mail.\n\nNow I will admit 100% I bought these because they're aodrable and I love Gudetama. The ingredients list isn't bad, but it's nothing exceptional either:\n\nWater, methylpropanediol, 1,2-hexanediol, butylene glycol, egg yolk extract, albumen extract, aloe vera leaf extract, green tea water, tea tree leaf water, cypress water, calendula officinalis Extract, Sodium hyaluronate, allantoin , panthenol, trehalose, PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil, carbomer, tromethamine, ammonium acryloyldimethyltaurate/ VP copolymer, xanthan gum, caprylyl glycol, disodium EDTA, ethylhexylglycerin, ethyl hexanediol, phenoxyethanol, perfume\n\nIt looks like a pretty standard moisturising mask, no fancy amazing ingredients. I also love that there's egg yolk in the ingredients! How sweet!\n\nOnto the actual performance!\n\nGuys. The fit on this is TERRIBLE. And the material it's made of is so thick and... unyielding? It's so hard to get it to sit right, it often hangs in places and won't really stay in the contours of your face. I don't know if anyone else feels this way but when the mask material itself isn't physically in contact with my face and instead sort of hangs off I feel like it might as well not be there in terms of effectiveness. This mask does that a lot. Also the amount of mask between the nose and lips is super long! Overall very uncomfortable to wear.\n\nI wouldn't say the mask is soaked in essence, but it's not super dry. I think the texture and thickness of the mask material makes is seem drier than it actually is. The mask has a sort of sweet floral scent, I personally don't think it's overpowering but I'm rarely bothered by fragrance in products. There's only a few dribbles left in the packet afterwards, so it's not one of those masks that seems like it has enough essence for two masks.\n\n[PICTURES!](http://i.imgur.com/sTMU97Y.jpg) It's so cute omg. Skincaretertainment at it's finest.\n\nI left it on about 30 minutes, the sheet felt quite dry but my face was still very wet with essence so I think it just felt dry because of the mask material. I patted in the remaining essence and it ends up with a nice, non-sticky finish. \n\n[My face immediately afterwards if this is useful?](http://i.imgur.com/vkuYzzQ.jpg) (sorry I didn't think to take a before) (also WARNING this is super high resolution, you can see all my pores and stray eyebrow hairs!) (also ignore the spot on my lashline lol)\n\nAs you can see I have a little PIE on my cheeks but nothing major, and no active pimples. My skin tends to lean normal nowadays, but is in the drier side. The mask wasn't super brightening or anything but it was very soothing and made the redness on my face less apparent. I wouldn't say it's HEAVY moisture, but it's quite nice and hydrating without being heavy. I think it would be really nice for the summer, very soothing and not too heavy - but there are probably better options for those with very dry skin or during harsh winter months. I think it would also be nice for people with oilier skin due to the non-heavy finish.\n\n**OVERALL:** I'd give this mask about 3/5. Firstly it's adorable, like Gudetama is hugging my face. I actually liked the effects, my skin tends to get flushed easily and it felt nice and soothing. It wasn't too heavy, most masks are really sticky afterwards and I liked that this wasn't, especially with the weather heating up. I just wish the fit and material were better! However, I will use up the rest of the ones I have.\n",

I'm extremely clog prone and have found that hydrating toners work well for me. However, the liquid composition doesn't make them well suited for putting over Differin or other actives.

I also have Hada labo Perfect gel, which is the Japanese version of the gel cream. Unfortunately, hyaluronic acid has never been a really great moisturizer for me and  so far it didn't do much except for break me out in worse CC bumps  so far (persistent micro CCs in large numbers  are my main issue.

Between those and your comments, I’m going to pass on that and stick with Avene until SSS one is released. \n\nI hear you on the hyaluronic acid. I’m not sure if my skin cares for it.

The Timeless 20% Vitamin C is a good one.\n\nI'd also recommend switching to a stronger sunscreen.  3% zinc oxide and 3% titanium dioxide is quite low, even if it is SPF 30.  You want strong UVA protection.  That's going to be your #1 defense against wrinkles.\n\nNiacinamide could be an easy thing to add to your routine.  It's in CeraVe PM (if you want to switch from the Trader Joe's one) or The Ordinary sells a 10% niacinamide serum.\n\nYou could also switch the retinol to tretinoin (the prescription strength version).  My sebaceous filaments went away with tretinoin, plus it's the gold standard for anti-aging.   You can get plain tretinoin from a doctor, or a compounded tretinoin cream with 4% niacinamide from Yoderm or Curology.\n\nSounds like you're off to a good start though!",

(they have ZERO cast)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAveneis not gonna work if you use it as a spray since it creates nothing like a mist but more of a 'splater' on the skin. It feels like a dry oil when you rob it in but it does not absorb as well as an oil, it leaves a clear sheen to the skin :/\n\nDucraycomes ou ike a light white cream. It does not dry down oily nor matte. it would be more suitable for normal to dry skin, but does as i said leave a slight white cast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLa Roche-possay UltraCome out of the tupe looking yellow it has ZERO white cast\\*. It does however leave a barely noticable yellow tint on pale skin (no prob. for non-vampires :P..). It is looks shiny and it does not dry - EVER. It balls up if you apply powder over it, so no chance to mattefy it :/\n\nDermaThis is not available to most of you since it is a local brand. It de dry down a bit but but it still looks greasy :/If they make a spf 50 for the face it might be better but spf 30 is too low in the summer for me.  \n\\*(It sound like it leaves a cast on deeper skin tones see comment by 'whyiskalegross')\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think i will test the La roche-possay anthelios **shaka fluid** out next because it is suppose to be non-sticky and non-oily.

Sometimes I see amazing results, sometimes really good results for an exceptionally good price, or it’s even just the texture/feel/experience of the product that makes it really special. The Living Cleansing Balm (also from Then I Met You) was one of the first products for me that fell into this category…The Giving Essence is another.\n\nThere are a lot of things about this essence that remind me of all the others I have tried in the past (especially those considered “first essences”). The Giving Essence has a very thin/watery consistency that absorbs nicely and layers well. You’ll find some fermented ingredients here along with brightening and hydrating ones too…again pretty much par for the course for a lot of essences. But, it’s what Then I Met You has done to heighten some of these benefits that makes it truly unique.\n\nRight out of the box this essence really interested me. The glass bottle is painted in a similar fashion to the Birch Milk Refining Toner…but this time the paint kind of fades away/tapers off to reveal the bright pink hue of the essence itself. This really is some unique packaging that I don’t think I have seen before. \n\nThat pink color comes naturally from the Black Chokeberry Extract in the formula. In addition, there are just so many hydrating and antioxidant rich ingredients here (and in high concentrations) it would be hard to list them all. But some of the standouts include Galactomyces/Aspergillus/Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrates (the first three ingredients), Ellagic Acid (a powerful antioxidant and anti-aging ingredient), Red Algae Extract, Turmeric Root Extract, and Eggplant Extract (excellent for calming and soothing the skin). \n\nIn addition, Polyglumatic Acid is here…which might be the most interesting one on the list. Polyglumatic Acid has been trending in skincare for the past couple of years…but I don’t think I have used a product that featured it in a higher concentration (or at all that I remember). Basically, it is a humectant/peptide that holds 4-5 times more moisture compared to Hyaluronic Acid. \n\nThis highly concentrated and well-formulated essence made it’s intentions clear with the first application. Just a 5-6 drops of product and…how do I describe it…it’s like a total bomb of hydration and cooling! I honestly don’t know how Then I Met You pulled this off. Each time I use it I look into my palm like “How in the world does this little bit make my skin feel/look like I did a full 7 Skin Method?” It truly is IN-CRE-DI-BLE how hydrating The Giving Essence is. As a bonus, the Black Chokeberry provides a natural/tart scent that is very faintly cranberry-like…so refreshing. I found myself doing a total of two layers to include my face and neck.\n\nAll of the lovely fermented ingredients are also in full force providing some great brightening effects, not only right out of the gate…but over time as well. I really started to see these benefits take shape in this (my 4th) week with the product. Supported by a vitamin c serum as well as some chemical exfoliation (from the Birch Milk Refining Toner) many of the dark spots/areas of hyperpigmentation on my skin have improved. And generally, my skin has just looked more even-toned and “happy” I guess LOL!\n\nBehind the scenes this essence uses a lot of antioxidants and skin supporting ingredients that don’t really provide a “wow” factor…but are just as great to have. I feel like my skin has become a bit more resilient in the face of chemical/physical exfoliation as well as having a better ability to hold onto moisture throughout the day. Once again, everything seems to just be…happy.\n\nSo clearly, I love this product! But just like the Birch Milk Refining Toner we have to talk about the cost. This essence comes in at $50.00 USD for 100ml. Although nowhere near as pricey as something like the SK-II Essence…The Giving Essence isn’t cheap. But because of the concentration of ingredients, the immediate AND long term benefits, and the need to only use a small amount per application I think this product is 100% worth every penny. Considering the formulation…I could absolutely see this essence being sold by a more “luxury” skincare brand for $75-100 USD. I’ve never used a high-end essence from brands like SK-II, Amore Pacific, or Tatcha. But to be honest…I don’t think I need to now. \n\nI really poured over some of my reviews of favorite skincare products from the last year or so thinking about what I loved about them. For me…finding a product that combines effective ingredients, real/lasting results, and a unique experience usually means it is a winner. I have tried and loved quite a few in my day (LOL!)…but I have to say that The Giving Essence is in all honesty the best skincare product I have ever used. \n\nFor someone like me who struggles to keep skin hydrated to prevent excess oil/sebum production while also tackling hyperpigmentation it doesn’t really get any better than this essence. I could totally see myself moving away from hydrating toners and lightweight serums in favor of this one product. Cleanse, Exfoliate, The Giving Essence, Moisturize/SPF…done. Of course, I am a total skincare nerd with a closet full of stuff so that wont be happening anytime soon LOL!\n\nThose with dry skin will also love this essence for the same reasons. That burst of hydration is something I haven’t experienced before and it really is long lasting. \n\nI’m kind of glad that I got a chance to try a lot of other essence products before finding this one. I feel like without knowing the performance of products like the Missha Time Revolution First Treatment Essence, Secret Key Starting Treatment Essence, Neogen Real Ferment Micro Essence, and May Coop Raw Sauce (aka the ones I’ve liked LOL)…I wouldn’t be able to realize how The Giving Essence is all of those and more. When I do finally retire from the skincare reviewing world…I’ll be taking The Giving Essence with me.\n\nThere aren’t too many products I use that “call” me to my routine each morning and night but The Giving Essence is truly one of them and it is the highlight of my current skincare routine.\n\nBottom line, if you can…you should. \n\nFull Ingredients List: \n\nGalactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Aspergillus Ferment Extract Filtrate, Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Propanediol, Niacinamide, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Ellagic Acid, Aronia Melanocarpa Fruit Extract, Polyglutamic Acid, Glycerin, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Morus Alba Root Extract, Allantoin, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Ribes Nigrum (Black Currant) Fruit Extract, Rubus Coreanus Fruit Extract, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract, Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Betaine, Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit Extract, Aristotelia Chilensis Fruit Extract, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Gardenia Jasminoides Fruit Extract, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Xanthan Gum, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Water, Methylpropanediol\n\nWhere To Buy (Then I Met You Site - $50.00 USD 100ml): \n\nhttps://thenimetyou.com/products/the-giving-essence",

    "body": "**Supergoop! Play Lip Shield SPF 30**\n\nSPF focused lip balms are something I have learned to not live without...especially after seeing the difference that protecting the sensitive skin on lips from sun exposure can have.\n\nFor a couple of years I have bounced between various products but had pretty much landed on the Sun Bum Lip Balm SPF 30. Each one is flavored and offers some nice protection.\n\nWhile I did find those lip balms to be fairly hydrating...there is always a slight thin/nearly oily feeling about them that never really amounted to much in terms of long lasting hydration. \n\nLuckily, the Supergoop! Play Lip Shield SPF 50 took things to the next level.\n\nFeaturing a fairly similar UV protection “cocktail”...the difference really lies in the feel and skincare centric results. \n\nSupergoop! adds amazing hydrating/nourishing ingredients such as Coconut Oil, Soybean Oil, Sunflower Seed Oil, Shea Butter, and Avocado Oil to create a formula that just feels really nourishing without being too thick/greasy.\n\nI feel totally comfortable layering it throughout the day and the benefits seem to build over time. My lips have felt more soft and crack resistant in the weeks since incorporating this product into my routine. \n\nWhile quite a bit more expensive than my previous go-to from Sun Sum (these balms from Supergoop! come in a 3-pack for $19.50 USD)...I think I am totally fine with trading off the more affordable and fun flavored Sun Bum Lip Balm for something that provides both sun protection and skin benefits.\n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nActive Ingredients: \n\nHomosalate-10%, Octocrylene-10%, Octisalate-5%, Avobenzone-3%\n\nInactive Ingredients:\n\nCocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Ozokerite wax, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, HelianthusAnnuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Tocopherols,Persea Gratissima (Avocado)Oil,Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil,Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, NaturalFlavor, Stevia Rebaudiana Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis(Rosemary) Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil\n\nWhere To Buy (Supergoop!

Always get trial sizes of expensive products!\n\nSo I think Sunday Riley shot themselves in the foot with posting fake product reviews, not only in terms of PR, but also by creating false expectations. I knew about the fake reviews, but I was still intrigued, so I bought  three samples from eBay. \n\nI decided to use it every night until I finished it, which really streamlined my routine. GG is a gel cream that never seems to fully absorb, so I’d wash my face, put on eye moisturizer and GG, and follow it up with some marula oil. Although it’s technically an active, it feels moisturizing.  \n\nAfter a couple of days, I was like: when does the magic happen? My skin felt and looked fine, but it was in no way transformed. I thought perhaps I wasn’t using it enough, so I stepped it up to morning and night. Still no noticeable improvement.\n\nIt’s possible I got bad/fake/expired samples, so I ordered two more from a different vendor. Just confirmed for me that GG is nothing more than an insanely overpriced moisturizer. \n\nVerdict: Definitely would not repurchase. I have a little bit left, and I’ll probably use it up in the next week or two. \n\nIngredients:\n\nAqua, Opuntia Tuna Fruit Extract, Arnica Montana Flower Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris Leaf Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Leuconostoc/ Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Caprylic/ Capric Triglyceride, Squalane, Lactic Acid, PPG-12/ Smdi Copolymer, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Phenyl Trimethicone, Disiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Stearyl Glycyrrhetinate, Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Chlorphenesin, Sodium Phytate",

    "body": "About a year ago, I cut a foot off my hair with promises to grow it back better. I shaved the underside and deep conditioned with every wash it because it was all broken off, started washing my hair less (once every 3 or 4 days now), stopped using heat products, get haircuts every 8-10 weeks, and  tried buying better shampoos/conditioners for my hair.\n\n\nAt that time, I bought an olive oil shampoo/conditioner pair from Regis Designline and it seemed to work well. I've used it for a year now and my hair seems tired of it, so I tried purchasing some new ones after asking my hair dresser for a suggestion. I've tried Healthy Sexy Hair Soy Moisturizing Shampoo ( which is supposedly sulfate free and has argon oil in it) and also Paul Mitchell's Super Skinny line. Healthy Sexy Hair made my hair feel strawlike and Paul Mitchell's made it oily within a day, and feels almost waxy when it's drying. \n\n\nI've never dyed or permed my hair and have med-course and straight-wavy hair. I'm half Cambodian, half white, so I'm wondering if my hair chemistry is different from what they make products for. When doing at home masks, my hair seems to like olive oil. Since trying these shampoos, my hair has gotten frizzier, I've noticed new split ends that weren't there before, and is more tangled. Any suggestions to try?\n\n\n\n**Healthy Sexy Hair Soy**\n\n\nWater (Aqua, Eau), Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycol Distearate, PEG-4 Rapeseedamide, Sodium Chloride, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Acrylates Copolymer, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Fragrance (Parfum), Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Glycerin, Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone, C11-15 Pareth-7, C12-16 Pareth-9, Trideceth-12, Disodium EDTA, Magnesium Chloride, Magnesium Nitrate, Potassium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Sodium Benzoate, Panthenol, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Ammonium Chloride, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, PEG/PPG-18/18 Dimethicone.\n\n\n\n**Paul Mitchell's Super Skinny**\n\n\nAqua (Water, Eau), Sodium Myreth Sulfate, Cocamide MIPA, Alcohol, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Isoceteth-20, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Algae Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Leaf Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Polyquaternium-10, Trideceth-12, PEG-150 Distearate, PEG-3 Dioleoylamidoethylmonium Methosulfate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone, Triethyl Citrate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, C11-15 Pareth-7, C12-16 Pareth-9, Magnesium Nitrate, Bisamino PEG/PPG-41/3 Aminoethyl PG-Propyl Dimethicone, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Parfum (Fragrance), Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool\n\n\n\n**Regis DesignLine Olive Oil**\n\n\nwater, olea europaea (olive) leaf extract, sodium laureth sulfate, disodium lauroamphodiacetate, PEG-10 olive glycerides, cocamide mea, cocamidopropyl betaine, polysorbate-80, polyqaurternium-4, hydrolyzed wheat protein, PEG-12 dimethicone, olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, fragrance, methylparaben, propylparaben, diazolidinyl urea, green 5, yellow5\n\n",

They have different lines, so I would check out their lighter stuff intended for wavy hair (their curly stuff would just weigh your hair down and be gross).\n\nEven though your hair is wavy, you should checkout r/curlyhair. There are lots of wavy girls over there that could help you out.  \n\n\nEdit: I forgot to say to keep away from sulfates and silicones for sure. Sulfates are harsh and damaging. Silicones coat your hair and keep moisture from it, and without heavy cleaners like Sulfates, silicones cause gross build up on your hair.",

It definitely is mild as far as the retinol goes, but that seems to work best for me to keep the flaking at a minimum. I'd recommend it as a good introduction to retinoids. It's very light and absorbs quickly, but leaves the skin feel smooth, soft, and hydrated. However, I've never used it alone. It's always been applied with other serums and/or vitamin C. If my skin is feeling very dry that day, I'll follow up with a moisturizer or oil.  For $3, it's definitely worth a try. The Vitamin Shoppe also carries a vitamin C cream and an aloe vera cream (which seems to be the same as this cream minus the retinyl palmitate).\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nIngredients: Water, Cetearyl Olivate, Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride, Sorbitan Olivate, Shea Butter Ethly Esters, Glycerin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopheryl (Vitamin E), Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A), Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D), Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hydroxide, Acrylates / C10- 30 Allkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tetradodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin",

    "body": "Sorry i really had problems with the title. I have just noticed that a lot of AB products tend to have more types of peptides but also almost always contain copperpeptides (specifically copper trieptide-1 made them fat/thicc on the ingredient lists).   \nWhy is that?   \ni heard some conflicting things about copper peptides and L-ascorbic acid. It's fine to mix l-ascorbic acid with AB copperpeptide containing products because the amount of copper peptides is too low to cause problems. But if the amount of copperpeptides is too low to cause problems doesn't that mean the copperpeptide is useless in the formula?  \nAnd does it mean the overall concentration of peptides is too low or just the copperpetide(s) (they tend to be close on the ingredientlist).   \nI mean i can see they don't contain a lot of copperpetides since they are not blue-ish like the ordinary copperpeptides serum but still. I am just cofused......  \n\n\nfyi i usually don't worry about concentrations of peptides since the concentrations needed to work are so low but the copperpeptides + l-ascorbic acid made me a bit confused.  \n\n\n\\+  \n\n\nAnybody know what all the sh-peptides are for in the last one???

        "body": "The most important thing to understand is to not assume one ingredient is good or bad because it all comes down the the **formulation of the product**. Ultimately you'd need to consult with a cosmetic chemist (ie: [LabMuffinBeautyScience](https://www.youtube.com/@LabMuffinBeautyScience)) to understand the relationships because it all ***depends***. \n\nInevitably the question is how much do you trust the brand, because it is not in their best interest to spend time and money on research and development of formulations or sourcing/buying/incorporating ingredients that don't work or cause problems. \n\nCopper peptides are short chains of amino acids that can help maintain skin structure by boosting collagen and elastin production. When applied topically, copper peptides can act as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, and can help soften the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Copper peptides can also help treat scarring, pigmentation, and redness caused by inflammation.\n\nAccording to a board-certified dermatologist, copper peptides are a type of peptide that acts as a messenger to instruct skin cells to perform various functions, such as building collagen and elastin, reducing inflammation, and maintaining hydration.\n\nCopper can oxidize ascorbic acid (vitamin C), causing it to break down too rapidly and resulting in diminished benefits. However, some recommend using copper peptides with vitamin C, as peptides work synergistically with vitamin C to trap moisture and improve the skin's texture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Different strengths of copper can oxidize ascorbic acid, which diminishes the effectiveness of vitamin C\n* Peptides work synergistically with vitamin C to trap moisture and improve skin texture  \nTo achieve maximum benefits, you should use copper peptides consistently for at least 3 months.\n\n**From Board Certified Dermatologists:**\n\n**The Incredible Case For Copper Peptides (& ascorbic acid)**\n\n>[Video from dermatologist](https://youtu.be/lJQJ3i8KCnU)\n\n**What are Copper Peptides?** \n\n>[Video from dermatologist](https://youtu.be/iGAdOBnu3AU)\n\n**INCI Decoder**\n\n>Decode skincare ingredients fast with our science-based but easy-to-understand explanations.

I Shampoo/Condition my hair 2-3 times a week and dried with a T-shirt. Everything was going great until a week ago where I noticed my hair didn't feel the same anymore. I don't know how to describe it, but it almost feels rough and in need of conditioner? and my ends feel drier that normal. I am not sure whats happening my first thought was damage since I've been growing it out for almost a year without a trim or a cut. Now i'm starting to think that there is some sort of build up?
