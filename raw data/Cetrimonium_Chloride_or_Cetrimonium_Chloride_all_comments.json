So here I have a guide to moisturising/non drying body washes with experience test to see whether it‚Äôll work for you or not.\r\n\r\nSo how do you find one? Its simple as you only have to find some ingredients i.e. Polyquaterniums(also referred as polyquats or PQ) OR  Guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride(GHPC, let it stay on skin for a minute or two). \r\n\r\nThese are film forming agents that will form a protective layer on your skin. They have been around for a long time, intensively researched and can be used on your whole body including skin(including face) and hair. Since the silicone scare happened, their usage have increased exponentially. You‚Äôll find them in your hair masks, shampoo, conditioners and even some face washes.\r\n\r\nSo you need to find one specific polyquat in your body wash i.e polyquaternium-7 (also written as polyquat-7 or PQ-7). This is the gold standard polyquat to help moisturize and soften the skin in body washes. Polyquat-10 will also do but PQ7 is the gold standard.\r\n\r\nSo now I‚Äôll come to the test. This test is based on YOUR experience. So ik due to current pandemic situation you don‚Äôt wanna spend on unnecessary things. So I‚Äôve mentioned the list of all body wash I could find with PQ7 and I‚Äôm sure that you would have used atleast one from them and if you felt that below mentioned products worked for you in the past and you left them thinking them to be too commercial or it moisturised or at the very least it was non drying to your skin, then Polyquats and GHPC are your gold ingredients to find in a bodywash. I will also mention some common tips that helped me after the products list.\r\n \r\nI went through whole body wash section on nykaa for this list. \r\n\r\nProducts list(including cheapest and expensive):\r\n\r\n1.\tPalmolive (absolute relax, morning tonic, luminous oils, sensual)\r\n\r\n2.\tNivea (Fresh pure, protect n care, energy, cool kick) \r\n\r\n3.\tCamay Paris (lavande, romantique, cr√®me n strawberry, hypnotique, dynamique)\r\n\r\n4.\tBody Cupid (24k gold, beautiful rose)\r\n\r\n5.\tKaya (colloidal oat, tea tree n honey)\r\n\r\n6.\tBoro Plus (neem lavender, almond turmeric)\r\n\r\n7.\tSwiss Tempelle (tulsi&iris)\r\n\r\n8.\tWow (ubtan, rose otto, acv, peach & strawberry, pineapple n coconut, lemon n pine, pine n rose, melon n cucumber, green apple, valencia orange, cherry blossom, lavender n chamomile, tea tree n mint, wild aqua)\r\n\r\n9.\tAll nykaa wanderlust series(PQ7 + silicon oil)\r\n\r\n10.\tSolimo by Amazon (fresh lavender, sweet apricot, lemon n tea tree, cool menthol, antibacterial with SA)\r\n\r\n11.\tMamaearth (all PQ22 based)\r\n\r\n12.\tDettol all variants (PQ10 + BHA)\r\n\r\n13.\tPlum BodyLovin shower CREAMS (All are PQ7 based)\r\n\r\n14.\tSt. Botanica (peach n avocado, strawberry n vit e, argan oil)\r\n\r\n15.\tLove Beauty & Planet all range (cetrimonium chloride & GHPC based)\r\n\r\n16.\tSt. D‚Äôvence (ocean drop, pink salt, hemp n aloe, lime n basil, Alphonso mango)\r\n\r\n17.\tMan Arden (Pacific prince, tahitis exotic, lemon n mint, energising, bergamot n cedarwood, arabian oudh)\r\n\r\n18.\tSedure whole range (PQ is unconfirmed)\r\n\r\n19.\tOlay whole range (GHPC based. Needs to stay on skin for some time)\r\n\r\n20.\tSuperdrug (coconut n white peach, fruity coconut)\r\n\r\n21.\tAveeno daily moisture (PQ10 + GHPC), skin relief(GHPC Based)\r\n\r\n22.\tThink skin by big bazaar (neem, total moisture)\r\n\r\n23.\tLocal companies in your city.(usually found in supermarkets like dmart, big bazaar)\r\n\r\n24. Cetaphil restoraderm(GHPC)\r\n\r\n25. NMFe body wash(GHPC derivative)\r\n\r\n26. The skin cottage, whole range (PQ7 based. Some have different PQ)\r\n\r\n27. Moisturex body wash (PQ67 based)\r\n\r\n28. Sirona therapeutic body wash (GHPC)\r\n\n29. Dermadew body wash(PQ10) \r\n\n30. Parasoft moisturizing shower gel(GHPC+SQ8)\r\n\r\nTips: While rinsing out, try not to rub your skin. Use the softest towel you have. If possible only pat dry and avoid rubbing towel rigorously.\r\n\r\nConsidering the nature of polyquats, these products mostly will work the same for you. So that means you have so much fragrance options to choose from.üòá The list may or may not have fragrance free options. I haven't checked for fragrance. \r\n\r\nIf you are new to trying these ingredients, I personally recommend Nivea Fresh Pure for first timers. It has the softest foam ever. Very mild, fresh aquatic fragrance and has been on market for years. \r\n\r\nThere can be an instance where these products are not moisturising enough for you but they‚Äôll be atleast non drying.\r\n\r\nAlways prefer to shop offline as most of nivea and some other brands are always on BOGO(like in dmart and big bazaar). Also be on the lookout for local companies in supermarkets bcz they will be even cheaper. (find PQ7)\r\n\r\nIF YOU HAVE A PRODUCT WITH ABOVE MENTIONED INGREDIENTS (PQ7, PQ10 OR GHPC) AND NOT IN THE LIST ABOVE THEN MENTION THEM BELOW SO THAT EVERYONE CAN HAVE MORE OPTIONS. üòá",

    "body": "I‚Äôm about to drop a lot of information here, but please read! I learned a lot about how to properly use sulfates and silicones, so I want to share!! \n\nSo here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned from Sarah Tran, who has thigh length hair. \n\nEdit: People have brought up genetics. Of course genetics is a huge factor in hair length, but the point of this post is to maintain *healthy* hair, so that it will grow with minimal breakage and split ends. I bring up her length because it is *healthy* as well as long. \n\nAlso note: silicones and sulfates won‚Äôt directly contribute to hair growth, but will make your hair stronger and less likely to break and fall out, indirectly resulting in longer fuller hair\n\nFirst off, silicones and sulfates are NOT bad. In fact, if she didn‚Äôt use silicones, she couldn‚Äôt protect her hair and have such long hair without split ends. The way most people USE silicones is bad though. \n\nThink about it like this: If you have a pair of high heels that are comfortable and you love them, but your friend asks you to go jogging, the shoes are not the problem, the *use* is.\n\nSilicones do the following: \n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair which makes it easier to detangle \n\n-Provides UV protection\n\n-Seals in moisture to prevent dryness\n\n-Makes hair look shiny\n\n-Reduces frizz and adds definition to curls\n\n-Softens and smooths cuticle\n\nSilicones do all these amazing things!!!! However, there are 4 types: airy, friendly (easy to wash out), resilient, and NO GO silicones\n\n*\n#Airy silicones: \nThese evaporate out of the hair after 10 minutes to a few hours. These do not have any negative effect on hair:\n\n-Cyclomethicone \n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n*\n#Friendly silicones:\nThese wash out of the hair with sulfate free shampoos:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate) \n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n*\n#Resilient Silicones:\nThese do NOT build up on the strand, but are non soluble and *require a sulfate* to remove:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone -Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n*\n#NO GO Silicones:\nThese require multiple washes with sulfate shampoo to remove. NEVER USE THESE!:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone \n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone \n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18 \n\n-Cetyl Phosphate \n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiylamodimethicone \n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n*\n#Mild Sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nThese are Best used to remove airy and friendly silicones and in your regular, daily mild shampoo. These do NOT remove resilient silicones. \n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate \n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n*\n#High Strength HARSH sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nTreat these exactly like harsh sulfates and avoid them when looking for a regular, daily mild sulfate-free shampoo. BEST USED FOR REMOVING RESILIENT SILICONES:\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate \n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n*\n#SULFATES that remove silicones:\nThese strong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Mild sulfates May require more applications to remove resilient silicones:\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n*\n#Also here is a list of cationic (anti-static) ingredients:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n*\n#So basically:\n\n1. Get a good sulfate free shampoo\n\n2. Get a good shampoo that HAS sulfates\n\n3. Use airy and friendly silicones ALL the time\n\n4. Use resilient silicones once or twice a month. This will protect your hair more than friendly silicones. Resilient silicones must be washed out with a SULFATE shampoo at the max FIVE DAYS AFTER APPLICATION\n\n*\n#And one last thing!!! Avoid these ingredients in hair care products: \n\nhttps://airtable.com/shrXz5xqoqRg8yKI2/tblol3s4T5YH103yY\n\nIt is hard to find a product with NONE of these ingredients, so make sure that these

        "body": "Hi! Guys please do your research and don't trust everything you hear. Having thigh length hair is a great achievement but it doesn't make someone a science expert, so posting this on a science sub is so misleading. \n\nI'm seeing some red flags. First off, no scientific sources. Second, commonly demonized ingredients in the push for \"clean\" beauty are again demonized here without proper given cause. And third, there are a few things that stuck out to me as glaringly false from what research I've done. Lastly, fourth, the phrasing at all of \"no go silicones\" and just the incorrect categorization of silicones that assigns them value (better to look at the truer category names: volatile, amine-modified, etc.)\n\nMost ingredients on that \"blacklist\" have little or absolutely no evidence of being bad. \n\nAnd the thing that strikes me as absolutely false is the list of cationic surfactabts as static causing, when most research and literature says the exact opposite - that they're anti static ingredients. Give me a minute and I'll add a few sources for the anti-static claim for cationic surfactants.\n\n> The widely used cationic surfactant docosyltrimethylammonium chloride was overall well performing, especially when it came to reduction of friction force and reduction of flyaway hair during combing. It was superior to the other cationic surfactant tested regarding reduction of frizz. This study suggests that the silicones and protein derivatives showed less promising results regarding the overall manageability. Preliminary data has implications that the efficiency of anti-frizz is correlated with cationic charge and high hydrophobicity of the conditioning agent. \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DYduaceeTnvMJ \n\n> Behentrimonium¬†chloride¬†and Cetrimonium¬†chloride¬†are known to be very effective hair conditioners with detangling,¬†anti-frizz, and¬†anti-static¬† \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3D0FbAuscGO8AJ",

        "body": "I would also like to make a comment on phrasing! If she has thigh-length hair, that's probably at least partially because of genetics. If the terminal length of your hair is way shorter, no amount product is going to fix that, at least not to that extent.  No product will ever make my shoulder blade-length hair thigh-length, and have it be healthy (as much as I would love that). I know there's some research with using brown rice water (I think) to improve the terminal length, but I'm not sure how accurate it is, how much it's been tested, or the details.\n\nNot a scientist, so please correct me if I'm wrong!",

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as¬†caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as¬†green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

    "body": "^*(last updated 4.5.14: they changed the trader joe's formula, it's off my list!)*\n\nConditioner only washing: washing your hair with conditioner only and cutting shampoo out of your regular routine. This is, as far as I can tell, the gentlest way to cleanse your hair. People with dry, damaged, or brittle hair may find this particularly beneficial, as well as people with very dry, sensitive or oily scalps (over production of oil can be a result of overdrying or irritation). Seems to be able to be adapted for any hair type. \n\nUPDATE: [A pic of my day 2 hair; about 2 months since my last shampoo](http://i.imgur.com/sSSrdLQ).\n\n[From this article on shampoo:](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3002407/)  ‚ÄúMany persons feel that they do not have good hygiene unless they bathe daily. Technically, it is not necessary to shampoo the hair daily unless sebum production is high. Shampooing is actually more damaging to the hair shaft than beneficial.\" \n\n*****\n##How \n*****\nI CO-wash every 2-3 days, sometimes 4-5 if I'm using dry shampoo, deep condition my ends once every 1-2 weeks and before shampooing, and shampoo around every 4-6 weeks or when I get some kind of serious crud in my hair.  My scalp is also naturally oily, which means I'm always going to have to cleanse more often than people with dry scalps. When I first started doing it I CO-washed every day and shampooed weekly-biweekly, but the longer I do it, the longer I can go in between. A good dry shampoo can do wonders, too.  \n\n**Method**  \n\n 1. Thoroughly wet your hair, which can take a minute if your hair is low porosity or very thick.  \n\n 2. Get yourself a generous handful of conditioner and saturate your roots with it. Use the pads of your fingers (no nails) to massage the conditioner all over your scalp. Make sure you thoroughly massage every inch. This is easier with your head hanging upside down. Get some more conditioner if you need to, there's no such thing as too much.  \n\n 3. Rinsing after this step then working a second round of conditioner all through your hair is sometimes recommend. I've experimented and find it (personally) unnecessary. I just work some more conditioner into the length of my hair and finger comb it through. When I deep condition this is when I use it.  \n\n 4. Let your hair soak for the rest of your shower. I'll often take a bath and read for a while with the conditioner in my hair. Letting it sit for at least 5 minutes is an important part of the cleansing process; your oil needs time to dissolve into the conditioner.  \n\n 5. Thoroughly rinse your hair, massaging the scalp again as you do. Easier with your head upside down, but I'm not coordinated enough to keep the water from going up my nose so I just tilt my head way back and lift it in sections to help work my fingers through.  \n\n**Tips**  \n\n - Before you start this method, it's a good idea to use a clarifying shampoo to remove any build up. There are many ingredients in many haircare products that are difficult to remove and require stronger chemicals.  \n\n - Wash your face or anywhere you're concerned about acne/sensitive skin after you're done rinsing.  \n\n - If you're worried about an adjustment period, start out alternating CO-washing and shampooing with a gentle poo, and slowly increase the proportion of CO-washes.  \n\n - Comb through your hair with a wide toothed comb while the conditioner is in. It's easier to detangle and your hair is more elastic during this phase, which means less breakage, and it'll preserve your natural texture.  \n\n - Scratching/irritating/overheating your scalp causes it to produce more oil.  \n\n - I squeeze out all the excess moisture and let my hair air dry. A lot of others recommend drying with an old tshirt or microfiber towel. Terry cloth tends to rough up your hair and promote frizz and tangling.  \n\n*****\n##Why  \n*****\nThere are multiple ways this method can work to clean your hair. The first is by dissolution, the principle that oil dissolves oil. This is how the oil cleansing method works, which has been very popular in Asia for thousands of years, and historically they've placed a much higher value on hygiene than in the West. This is much gentler than surfactant based cleansing. The oils, humectants, and fatty alcohols in a good CO-wash bond to the oils on your scalp and roots (the soak), distribute them throughout your hair, and rinse away clean with gentle agitation (the scalp massage.)\n\nThe other way CO-washing can cleanse your hair is actually the same as shampoo: many conditioners still contain surfactants. I prefer to go mostly surfactant free, but some of them have certain benefits (just discovered [cetrimonium chloride](http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/curl-products/curlchemist-what-is-cetrimonium-chloride), [it's pretty spiffy](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ls6zx/advice_on_a_heat_protectant_without_silicones_and/cc4h5r0), though I'm being cautious because there are some [allergen concerns](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/701258/CETRIMONIUM_CHLORIDE/)). Some surfactants have conditioning properties, lift the cuticle and allow it to absorb moisture, and some will lightly coat your hair, lending slip and shine.  \n\nWith this method it's VERY IMPORTANT to **avoid anything that builds up on your hair!** This means checking what's in the products you're putting on your hair and doing your research. **UPDATE:** Check out /u/smbtuckma's [guide on silicones](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/) for more info on determining what will and won't work for your totally customizable routine! **Waxes** can build up and make your hair look dirty, particularly if it's fine; they can lend definition to curls though and are not drying. **Fatty alcohols** are emulsifiers (bind oil and water) and help provide slip to a conditioner, something you want, but can cause build up, particularly with waxy sebum, so they shouldn't be too high on the ingredient list; I haven't experienced an issue with them.\n\nQuick list of...\n\nDrying alcohols: Denatured alcohol, SD alcohol 40, Witch hazel, Isopropanol, Ethanol, SD alcohol, Propanol, Propyl alcohol, Isopropyl alcohol  \n\nFatty alcohols: Behenyl alcohol, Cetearyl alcohol, Cetyl alcohol, Isocetyl alcohol, Isostearyl alcohol, Lauryl alcohol, Myristyl alcohol, Stearyl alcohol, C30-50 Alcohols, Lanolin alcohol\n\n**Ingredients I look for:**  \n\n - **coconut oil** *(will actually penetrate your hair to moisturize, protects protein bonds, but usually very comedogenic; for more info on all the oils I mention check out [this guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1m014r/info_about_natural_hair_mask_ingredients_pt_1_oils/) )*\n\n - **jojoba oil** \n\n - **sunflower oil** \n\n - **glycerin** (humectant)\n\n - **honey** (humectant, can lighten your hair/enhance highlights, be careful if you're worried about preserving your color; in it's raw form has strong antibacterial properties)\n\n - **aloe** (humectant; acidic, which helps remove mineral build up and seal the cuticle; contains protein(amino acids), if your hair starts to show signs of [protein overload](http://www.curlynikki.com/2012/06/can-i-over-condition.html)(crunchy, brittle, less elastic) cut back; extremely under studied with highly contradictory information out there, so experiment for yourself and draw your own conclusions)\n\n - **cetrimonium chloride** (cationic surfactant, increases tensile strength when combined with heat)\n\n - **panthenol** (significantly improves shine and manageability)\n\n*****\n##Who  \n*****\nAs far as I can tell, this method can work for pretty much anyone as long as you're willing to experiment to find the right conditioner. My scalp is oily, my hair is extremely fine, low porosity, bleached, dyed, henna-ed, dry, and extremely fragile. This method cleanses my scalp and roots thoroughly and nourishes my length, leaving everything soft, shiny, stronger than it ever has been in my life, and really enhances my natural texture. My scalp also seems to be producing a LOT less oil than with any other method I've tried. I've seen glowing write ups on this method with every hair texture, thickness, and density; from what I can tell it started with the curly community.\n\nThe biggest obstacle seems to be **knowing your hair type** and what works for it:  \n\n - Fine or thin hair is going to need a very light product that rinses very clean.  \n\n - Chemically colored hair will eventually be stripped by oils that penetrate your hair (coconut oil, olive oil, sunflower seed oil) so should avoid those in regularly used products\n\n - Low porosity hair doesn't like too much protein (makes it crunchy, brittle, less elastic; this is specifically in reference to hydrolyzed protein, other types won't absorb) and seems to need an extra boost from humectants to absorb moisture, especially since (if you opt for a surfactant free route) you're no longer lifting the cuticle to help it. Still needs some protein/strengthening treatments,  you have to find a balance for your hair [More on this over at Curly Nikki](http://www.curlynikki.com/2012/06/can-i-over-condition.html).  \n\n - High porosity hair typically loves hydrolyzed protein (you need that word to be in front of the protein ingredient for it to be absorbant) and much more readily absorbs, and loses, whatever you put on it. Needs more attention from products that coat/seal in moisture and smooth the cuticle. \n\n - Wetter/oilier sebum is the easiest to remove and really lends itself to this method.  \n\n - Thicker/waxier sebum might do better with a conditioner that contains more emulsifiers, such as surfactants. Jojoba oil is also a good ingredient to look for, because of it's chemical structure it can really effectively penetrate and combine with what's on your scalp. I've read that build up from fatty alcohols is particularly an issue with waxy sebum.  \n\n*I would love to hear some feedback on waxier sebum and high porosity hair!*\n\n**I do NOT recommend this method to anyone experiencing issues with dandruff.** Dandruff is often a fungal infection called melassazia in your scalp's yeasts. I recommend visiting a doctor or certified trichologist to find out your cause; I've read about successfully treating it naturally with raw honey, coconut oil, aloe, hemp oil, and tea tree oil, but this really all depends on what kind of dandruff you're dealing with, and a lot of the evidence is anecdotal or under studied.  \n\n*****\n##What  \n*****\nCO-Washing:  \n\n - **Mane n' Tail Conditioner** *(wow, gotta say, this stuff might be my new favorite! Contains cationic surfactants (good, conditioning ones), coconut oil, glycerin, and hydrolyzed protein. I've been alternating it with the Trader Joe's conditioner lately, and myt hair has been perceptibly healthier. I think I finally found my protein balance!)*\n\n - **Sukin Organics Nourishing Conditioner** *(100% carbon neutral and cruelty free. Contains cetrimonium chloride, aloe, and hydrolyzed protein. Good slip.)*\n\n - **As I Am Coconut CoWash** *(Lightweight, leaves my hair very bouncy and shiny with LOTS of texture. Great slip, very moisturizing, rinses clean.)*\n\n - **Tresemme Naturals** *(haven't used it but often recommended, contains drying alcohols low on the list, NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\n - **Giovanni Brazilian Keratin & Argan Oil Ultra Sleek Conditioner** *(haven't tried, recommended)*\n\n - **Suave Naturals** *(haven't used, often recommended, range of options, some have NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\n - **As I Am Cleansing Pudding** *(haven't tried, made for this, NO PENETRATING OILS)*   \n\n - **Curl Junkie Daily Fix Cleansing Conditioner** *(haven't tried, made for this, contains yucca, NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\n - **Darcy's Botanicals Daily Cleansing Conditioner Cream** *(haven't tried, made for this, contains wax, label says NO SURFACTANTS but it has BTMS, a very mild cationic, NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\n - **Jessicurl Hair Cleansing Cream** *(haven't tried, made for this, NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\n - **Curly Q's Curlie Cutie Cleansing Cream** *(haven't tried, made for this, NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\nDeep Conditioning:  \n**Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner** *(contains shea butter, aloe, panthenol, and coconut oil, some of my favorite ingredients; NO SURFACTANTS, also contains emulsifying wax so should be used sparingly)*, **Cold pressed coconut oil** *(will actually penetrate your hair, protects protein bonds, but a little bit goes a very long way! Also very comedogenic for most people, be careful of it near your face. Excellent as a pre-poo treatment. Not ideal for chemically colored hair, because of it's penetrative abilities it can remove the color molecules.)*  \n\nShampooing:  \n**Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Moisture Retention Shampoo** *(uses the gentlest surfactant on the market, decyl glucoside, NO PENETRATING OILS, [break down here](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1l4sjc/product_recommendation_community_survey_shampoos/cc0o2kz))*  \n\nClarifying Shampoo:  \n**Malibu Swimmers Water Action Shampoo** *(no sulfates but still effective combo of surfactants and ingredients that remove mineral build up, panthenol, smells like orange push pops...)*\n\nDry Shampoo:  \nThe best one I ever tried from the store was **Dove.** I prefer to just make my own with arrowroot powder and cocoa powder. Corn starch is popularly recommended and the ingredient in most of these dry shampoos that soaks up the oil, but I find that the arrowroot is finer and disappears better.",

        "body": "So, /u/SnooSnooCookie asked me about a specific conditioner, [Matrix Total Results Color Care Conditioner](http://www.google.com.au/imgres?um=1&safe=off&client=firefox-a&hs=G7g&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&hl=en&biw=1280&bih=878&tbm=isch&tbnid=1Qc4icCLLeYB4M:&imgrefurl=http://www.beautyofnewyork.com/shopping/DYH0200911KK0158.htm&docid=vQoU3xg8hp02dM&imgurl=http://www.beautyofnewyork.com/upload/2011/matrix-total-results-color-care-soin-couleur-conditioner-10-1.jpg&w=221&h=550&ei=7rktUrOVBIbPkQWjmoCwCA&zoom=1&ved=1t:3588,r:1,s:0,i:80&iact=rc&page=1&tbnh=194&tbnw=80&start=0&ndsp=30&tx=10&ty=102), for COwashing. Here's a break down of it with some helpful resources for you guys.\n\nGenerally, I'll just google the ingredients in a product one by one; eventually you start to remember what's good and what's bad.  I'd say MAYBE it'd be a suitable COwash, but I think you can do a lot better, especially for the price. Here's the ingredients list:\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Cetyl Esters, Isopropyl Myristate, Isopropyl Alcohol, Parfum/Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol, Lauryl PEG/PPG 18/18 Methicone, Helianthus Annuss Seed Oil / Sunflower Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Linalool, Chlorhexidine Digluconate, Citric Acid, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Dodecene, Poloxamer 407, Hexyl Cinnamal, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Iso-Methyl Ionone \n\n -  Cetearyl Alcohol is a fatty alcohol, meaning it's moisturizing. Fatty alcohols cause build up issues for some people, particularly those with waxy sebum. I prefer to see them farther down the ingredient list, things are listed in the order of largest quantity to smallest, but this isn't a deal breaker; lots of frequently recommended COwash are very heavy on fatty alcohols. \n\n -  Behentrimonium Chloride is an emulsifier (binds oil and water), antistatic agent, and mild cationic surfactant. Basically, this means it will both condition and clean your hair. Popular ingredient in co-wash conditioners (I, personally, am super sensitive to surfactants so avoid them, but most people don't have this issue.)\n\n -  Glycerin is a humectant (attracts water) and one of my favorite hair care ingredients. Be careful of it in leave ins if you're in a low humidity climate, without other products or humidity to provide moisture it'll actually attract water out of the interior of your hair. In a co-wash, this helps both clean and moisturize your hair.\n\n -  Cetyl Esters are a wax used to thicken products, waxes can build up on your hair and make it look dirty after awhile. This may not be an issue if you're hair isn't easily weighed down (mine is) and in combination with the behentrimonium chloride. Only way to know is trial and error.\n\n -  Isopropyl Myristate is used as an emollient and helps make a product slippery (a good thing for COwashing), however I'm finding conflicting information on it and nothing solid about it's application to hair. Generally, it's an accepted moisturizer, however there's solid information on it's potential for irritation and clogging pores. There's also some discussion that it can be drying. I dunno. This is a confusing one. I'd just try to avoid it.\n\n -  Isopropyl Alcohol is a drying alcohol. It's difficult to avoid drying alcohols entirely, but good to do if you can. You definitely don't want it this high in an ingredient list. [This page has a handy list of drying alcohols, fatty alcohols, and silicones](http://www.wikihow.com/Determine-if-a-Hair-Product-is-Curly-Girl-Approved).\n\n -  Parfum/Fragrance is the bane of my existence. I'm usually super sensitive to it. It can mean almost anything, companies aren't required to report their personal fragrance blends, so they're frequently drying/irritating. They're also in freaking everything. Damn near impossible to avoid, so just aim for low on the ingredient list.\n\n -  Phenoxyethanol is a preservative, it keeps your product from getting moldy.\n\n -  Lauryl PEG/PPG 18/18 Methicone is a silicone; generally, silicones are the top thing you want to avoid with COwashing. This one, however, is a [water soluble silicone](http://www.curlynikki.com/2012/08/water-soluble-silicones-101.html), so it MAY be ok to use with this method. There's really conflicting information about the role that cones play in hair care, some studies say they only simulate the appearance of health and block the absorption of moisture, others say they help protect hair from heat damage and can help act as humectants. The only way to know what works for you is trial and error. I would think that, combined with surfactants, water soluble silicones MIGHT be ok for SOME people. I don't mess around with them because my hair is so easily weighed down. Again, [this page has a handy list of which silicones are and aren't water soluble](http://www.wikihow.com/Determine-if-a-Hair-Product-is-Curly-Girl-Approved).\n\n -  Helianthus Annuss Seed Oil / Sunflower Seed Oil is a moderately penetrative oil, which means usually it's a GREAT ingredient for hair care and COwashing. However, penetrative oils can strip hair dye; proceed with caution.\n\n -  Tocopherol is vitamin E, it acts as a moisturizer and preservative.\n\n -  Linalool is a fragrance and byproduct of essential oils and vitamin E, generally not a concern unless you have eczema and it oxidizes.\n\n -  Chlorhexidine Digluconate is probably being used as a preservative here, it has antiseptic/antimicrobial properties. Some moderate risk for irritation.\n\n -  Citric Acid is an acidifier and preservative. Also removes hard water build up. Moderate acidity is great for hair care, it helps close the cuticle = make your hair shinier.\n\n -  Benzyl Salicylate related to salicylic acid, generally used as a fragrance ingredient. Some concerns about potential for irritation/developing a sensitivity to it over time.\n\n -  Limonene is used primarily as a fragrance in toiletry products; used commercially as a solvent, ie it strips oils. Some concerns about irritation and developing sensitivities to it.\n\n -  Butylphenyl Methylpropional is a fragrance with irritation and endocrine disruption concerns. It's use is heavily restricted.\n\n -  Dodecene is a known skin irritant, appears to be used as a thickener. Primarily used in the manufacturing of detergents.\n\n -  Poloxamer 407 is a gentle non-ionic surfactant. It's also hydrophilic, which means it attracts water molecules. Good ingredient for COwashing.\n\n -  Hexyl Cinnamal is a fragrance with some irritation and allergen concerns. Safe in small amounts (this qualifies).\n\n -  Citronellol is a fragrance with sensitizing concerns.\n\n -  Benzyl Alcohol is an aromatic alcohol with solvent properties, used as a preservative. Not a concern in small quantities.\n\n -  Alpha-Iso-Methyl Ionone is a fragrance with some allergen concerns in large quantities.",

I've had a pretty oily scalp my whole life, and I am used to waking up and starting my day with a shower/washing my hair. I have never been the type that could wash my hair at night and then just get up and go in the morning. But now, I see that as being one of the many perks/benefits of this COwashing method! But here is my question - how in the world do you sleep on your hair so that it is still wearable the next day?? Not referring to the oily hair, which would be diminished by this new hair-washing technique, but the crazy, tangly roughed-up looking hair that I wake up with? Any tips or advice on this? Like I said, I feel silly asking about this, but I cant remember a time where I didnt wake up and shower first thing in the morning before going to school/work, so I've never had to worry or think about \"bed head\".

    "body": "Hey there! So I have extremely damaged hair that is breaking off every time I brush it (got a straight perm when my hair was bleached). In an effort to save my hair, I have learned so much about hair care through research and hair care classes and I wanted to share all the information I‚Äôve gathered!\n\n#Understanding Ingredients in Hair Care:\n\n##Surfactants:\nSurfactants are the main cleansing agents in shampoos. They often end in -ate or ‚Äúglucoside‚Äù.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair. They often end in -entrimonium chloride, -quaternium, or ‚Äúmethosulfate‚Äù (note: if an ingredient says methosulfate after a word, it is an **anti-static** NOT a sulfate).\nAnti-static ingredient examples: Behentrimonium chloride, Cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-17, quaternium-22, Behentrimonium methosulfate, etc.\n\n##Ingredients to use with caution:\n**Note: this is NOT a list of ingredients to avoid, but to rather use with caution.**\n\nThat being said, there are some ingredients which I do try to avoid, such as formaldehyde releasing preservatives (Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, and Diazolidinyl Urea).\n\nCocomidopropyl betaine impurities may cause scalp irritation: https://www.healthline.com/health/cocamidopropyl-betaine#how-to-avoid\n\nCoco-Betaine to be used with caution (pg.6-12): https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/alkbet032014final_0.pdf\n\nCocomide DEA and cancer: https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/cocamide-diethanolamine-cocamide-dea-coconut-oil-diethanolamine-condensate\n\nSoyamide DEA irritates unless formulated to be non irritating (21): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581813486300\n\nIsopropyl alcohol or SD alcohol (Volatile alcohols drying in high concentrations): https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/good-alcohols-vs-bad-alcohols\n\nWitch hazel can be drying: https://www.healthline.com/health/witch-hazel-for-hair#safety\n\nTriclosan not recognized as generally safe by FDA: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan\n\nTriethanolamine toxicity: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/706639-TRIETHANOLAMINE-TRIETHANOLAMINE/\n\nPVP/VA mild skin irritation (15-16): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818309140719\n\nIsopropyl palmitate mild skin irritation: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isopropyl-palmitate#section=EPA-Safer-Chemical\n\nQuaternium-15 formaldehyde releasing: https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/quaternium-15/\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate only safe in low concentrations: https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/butylcarbamate_rr.pdf\n\nDMDM Hydantoin and formaldehyde: https://www.chemscape.com/blog/DMDM-hydantoin-shampoo\n(This is the ingredient that OGX got sued over)\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea and formaldehyde: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/701923-DIAZOLIDINYL_UREA/\n\nPolyvinyl acetate insufficient evidence of safety in cosmetic products: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/705158-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE/\n\n#How to use Silicones and Sulfates Properly:\n\nSilicones are great, as they do the following for hair:\n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair shaft, making hair easier to brush and detangle\n\n-Great heat and UV protectant\n\n-Seals in moisture, prevents dryness\n\n-Gives hair a shiny appearance\n\n-Softens and smooths the cuticle\n\n##Silicones to use only if using a strong sulfate shampoo regularly:\n\nThese are very difficult to wash out of hair, even with a sulfate surfactant:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone\n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone\n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone\n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18\n\n-Cetyl Phosphate\n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone -Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n##Volatile silicones:\nThese evaporate after 10 minutes to a few hours after application. (Volatile just means they evaporate quickly):\n\n-Cyclomethicone\n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n##Easy to remove silicones:\nThese condition the hair, provide UV protection, and wash out with sulfate free surfactants:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate)\n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n##Resilient silicones:\nThese silicones can be removed with a sulfate AND some sulfate-free surfactants:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n##Cationic ingredients List:\n(Anti-static ingredients)\nThese ingredients usually end in ‚Äú-imonium chloride‚Äù. These are in basically every conditioner to reduce static in hair:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate (this is NOT a sulfate, it‚Äôs an anti-static)\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n#Sulfates:\n\n##Mild Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are best used to remove volatile and easy to remove silicones. They can only remove resilient silicones with multiple washes, unless paired with many different sulfate free surfactants (a shampoo that has 3-4 or these in their ingredients list):\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n-Sodium Cocoate\n\n-Potassium Cocoate\n\n##Sulfate free surfactants that can remove resilient silicones:\n\nThese can remove resilient silicones, but not on their own, so usually a shampoo will use a combination of 2-3 of these:\n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate\n\n##High Strength Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are technically sulfate free, but they are **just** as thoroughly cleansing as sulfates, so they can still strip hair dye. Best used for removing resilient silicones\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n##Sulfates that remove resilient silicones:\n\nStrong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Do not use if you have colored hair, as it will fade your color\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n#Understanding Protein in Hair:\n\nHair is made of protein, proteins are made of amino acids and peptides. Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt‚Äôs best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this ‚Äúprotein overload‚Äù is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair. This just means putting a light weight oil on towel dried hair. I use the OGX coconut milk serum oil as my sealant:\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/coconut-milk-anti-breakage-serum-xlsImpprod2960061\n\n##Protein Products:\n\n**-Hask Keratin Protein Deep Conditioning

Hydrolyzed collagen, hydrolyzed wheat protein (5th and 6th ingredient)\n\n##I‚Äôve included this product list more for myself because it is very hard to find products with varying protein types and sizes.\n\n##The above information about protein and sulfates was found on Science-y Hair Blog!\n\n#Ingredients for Scalp Health:\n\n##Aloe Vera Gel:\n\nAloe is a great natural scalp soother and also helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it‚Äôs wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here‚Äôs a looong review post of many of the products I‚Äôve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I‚Äôm a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don‚Äôt wear makeup on a daily ‚Äì or even weekly ‚Äì basis. I‚Äôve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I‚Äôm in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I‚Äôm average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I‚Äôve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently‚Ä¶ boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it‚Äôs fine. This is many people‚Äôs holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It‚Äôs affordable, nice pump, doesn‚Äôt try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don‚Äôt love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It‚Äôs standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn‚Äôt remove all makeup, it‚Äôs as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don‚Äôt leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that‚Äôs fine, so I don‚Äôt know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it‚Äôs important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they‚Äôre pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it‚Äôs a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that‚Äôs about it. It doesn‚Äôt contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula‚Äôs Choice wouldn‚Äôt have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don‚Äôt think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It‚Äôs an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don‚Äôt really know if it‚Äôs very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don‚Äôt have the data. I hope it is, though. I‚Äôm also worried that it‚Äôll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It‚Äôs one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time‚Ä¶ And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN‚Äôs products, so beware. Just because it says it‚Äôs natural fragrance, doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt mess with your skin. The word ‚Äúnatural‚Äù isn‚Äôt even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we‚Äôve found we‚Äôre all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It‚Äôs a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn‚Äôt use it during the daytime. I‚Äôm not currently using it, because I‚Äôm trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn‚Äôt really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don‚Äôt know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol‚Äô retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn‚Äôt released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it‚Äôs even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don‚Äôt know. I think I‚Äôll wait a while longer to see if there‚Äôs any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn‚Äôt really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it‚Äôs a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn‚Äôt contain any preservatives. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin‚Äô. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You‚Äôve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you‚Äôre from Northern Europe. Anyway, it‚Äôs a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it‚Äôs great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don‚Äôt want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It‚Äôs called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you‚Äôre allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you‚Äôre allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It‚Äôs my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I‚Äôm too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It‚Äôs gel-like, but it doesn‚Äôt melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn‚Äôt seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn‚Äôt sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don‚Äôt buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn‚Äôt all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it‚Äôs called a night mask, it‚Äôs a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this‚Ä¶ right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don‚Äôt know. My skin is normal, so I don‚Äôt really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I‚Äôd appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I‚Äôve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn‚Äôt contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don‚Äôt really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention‚Ä¶ It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it‚Äôs bad for your skin. Anyway, it‚Äôs an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because‚Ä¶ I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I‚Äôll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it‚Äôs 10% glycolic acid it‚Äôs still very gentle, and that‚Äôs probably because it‚Äôs in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven‚Äôt used it recently because I‚Äôm using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn‚Äôt ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don‚Äôt have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I‚Äôm quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don‚Äôt need one, I‚Äôm just so extra. It‚Äôs a HG product for me, because it‚Äôs the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it‚Äôs great if you have sturdy skin, and you‚Äôre lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won‚Äôt oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of‚Ä¶ dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it‚Äôs not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you‚Äôre looking for a vitamin c product. It‚Äôs perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won‚Äôt cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn‚Äôt make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Av√®ne Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: ‚Ä¶why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there‚Äôs that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven‚Äôt seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven‚Äôt been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don‚Äôt particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I‚Äôll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so‚Ä¶\n\n**NAME:** Av√®ne Ysth√©al intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as ‚ÄúAv√®ne RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream‚Äù, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don‚Äôt know what retinaldehyde is, well, it‚Äôs one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol √† retinaldehyde √† retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Av√®ne‚Äôs lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don‚Äôt have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I‚Äôm only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I‚Äôve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you‚Äôre 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn‚Äôt seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They‚Äôve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you‚Äôre pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8‚Äôs retinaldehyde products, plus it was Av√®ne that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that I‚Äôll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

        "body": "The \"Bio-Protein Care and infused with Glutamic Amino Serum\" is not doing anything in the formula except giving their marketing people something to talk about.\n\nThe shampoo is also not having much effect on frizz as the only ingredients that might last through rinse-off include the Guar (cationic polymer) and maybe the dimethiconol (silicone).  Although in reality, the dimethiconol mostly gets rinsed away too.\n\nIn the conditioner, the ingredients that are having the greatest impact include the Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Dimethiconol/Silsesquioxane Copolymer, and Behentrimonium Chloride.\n\nThese are all ingredients you can find in other formulas. \n\nThe idea that the smoothing performance is unlike anything on the market is debatable. There are likely lots of products that can give you the smoothing effect of these products. However, using a combination of very good formulas (these are), an appealing fragrance, and solid marketing, you can come to believe it is the best you've ever used.  Just know that you haven't used everything and there are lots of products that you would be happy with if only you could test them on a blinded basis.",

Hair and climate details are:\n\n**Hair and scalp type:**\n\n3A/2C curls, very dry and course strands, low-porosity, silicone and protein sensitive, oily scalp. I am not sensitive to fragrance, and find the fragrance of these products very mild. However that might be different for other people.\n\n**Climatic conditions:**\n\nHot and Humid.\n\n**Age range:**\n\nTwenties.\n\n**Usage timeline:**\n\nThe Moisture Duo have been my favourite styling products for about two years now.\n\nThe Protein Duo was bought approximately a year ago and has been used intermittently for 6-8 months since then.\n\nThe Wash-Day products were also bought at around the same time, and I have regularly used the Cleansing Shampoo and the Conditioner every wash-day since.\n\n# ‚ú®Wash-Day Bundle‚ú®\n\n# üîπCleansing Shampoo\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua),Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Panthenol, Polyquaternium -7, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-73, Fragrance, Apple Cider Vinegar, Disodium EDTA, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Oil, Polyquaternium -10, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick gel that lathers into a thick foam.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit while massaging into hair, completely washes off on rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nIt is sulphate-free so it is only mildly cleansing. If you are not prone to a lot of build-up and don‚Äôt have dandruff, this is good enough. Does not strip off moisture from the hair strands and doesn‚Äôt dry out the scalp either. I use this as my regular shampoo and use a sulphate shampoo every once in a while to clarify any build-up since this shampoo isn‚Äôt enough for me.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nEven though this is a cleansing shampoo, the website clearly states that this is not a Clarifying Shampoo. They actively encourage using a sulphate shampoo if you are prone to build-up, which I thought was a refreshing change from the usual marketing of sulphate-free shampoos.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n## üîπEveryday Moisturising Shampoo\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua) Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium -7, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Panthenol, Phospholipids (and) Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Germ Extract, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/Palmitate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-73, Cetrimonium Chloride, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Fragrance Polyquaternium -10, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Citrus Aurantium (Neroli) Oil\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Mild to no lather.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit while massaging into hair, completely washes off on rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nI did not like this shampoo at all. It didn‚Äôt clean my scalp well at all and the strands felt weirdly brittle after washing. It isn‚Äôt hydrating enough to use without following up with a conditioner. However, if I am going to be using a conditioner anyway, the additional step is pointless for me. It might work for someone who needs extremely mild cleansing, but it is not for me. I stopped using after 2-3 washes at most, and switched full-time to the cleansing shampoo alone. Though the fact that this shampoo has proteins might be contributing to my dislike of it.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n1/5. Will Not Repurchase.\n\n## üîπHydrating Deep Conditioner\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Quaternium-87, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Phospholipids, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Polyquaternium -7, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/‚ÄãPalmitate, Polyquaternium-73, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Avena Sativa (Oats) Extract, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance, Tamanu Oil, Honey Extract, Goji Berries Oil, Taraktogenos Kurzii Seed Oil, Jojoba Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Oil, Disodium EDTA, Magnolia Grandiflora Bark Extract, Potassium Lauroyl Wheat Amino Acids, Nigella Sativa Seed Oil, Leptospermum Scoparium Branch/‚ÄãLeaf Oil, Capryloyl Glycine, Cysteine\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Low to medium slip.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit even after rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis conditioner is protein-moisture balanced, and this is the max protein my hair will tolerate. It doesn‚Äôt have a lot of slip, so if you are someone who detangles with conditioner, this one might be difficult to detangle with. My hair is always dry, and it felt softer immediately on the first use with this. It does tend to make hair a little greasy afterwards. But after adding styling products, it works out for me so I don‚Äôt really mind the greasiness. I have also used it as a deep conditioner and kept it in my hair for 30 minutes and then washed off. It didn‚Äôt make much of a difference in comparison with leaving it in for 5 minutes like I usually do, so I didn‚Äôt bother to do that again.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nFMC says the conditioner can also be used as a leave-in conditioner, though I have never tried this myself, and do not plan to try either.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n# \n\n# ‚ú®Protein Duo‚ú®\n\n## üîπLeave-in Cream\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Dicetyl Phosphate & Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Panthenol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Quaternium-87, Polyquaternium -7, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/Palmitate, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acids, Sodium PCA, Hydrolysed Milk Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Cetrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Polyquaternium-68, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Ceramide, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Fragrance, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Tocopheryl Acetate, Potassium Lauroyl Wheat Amino Acids, Nigella Sativa Seed Oil, Leptospermum Scoparium Branch/Leaf Oil, Disodium EDTA, Magnolia Grandiflora Bark Extract, Taraktogenos Kurzii Seed Oil, Capryloyl Glycine\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Thins out a little on emulsifying.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHeavy fragrance that lasts for the whole day. This is the only FMC product whose fragrance is too much for me.\n\n**Review:**\n\nI purchased the Protein Duo when I was still experimenting and figuring out the needs of my hair. I very quickly realised that my hair is protein-sensitive and this cream does not work for me. Thankfully I had only bought the 50g travel pack. It is very protein-heavy, not very hydrating. If your hair is already healthy, this may work well. However for very dry hair, this will not provide enough moisture.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nI know now that the cream doesn‚Äôt work for me in regular usage. However I do keep the 50g tube around for the rare moisture-overload days to give my hair a little boost of protein. I only need a tiny amount for that purpose, so the tube is going to last me a very long time.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n1/5. Will Not Repurchase. Didn‚Äôt work for me, might work for someone else.\n\n## üîπDefining Hair Gel\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Polyacrylate-2 Crosspolymer, Phospholipids (and) Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Polyquaternium -7, Polyquaternium-73, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Panthenol, Fragrance, Disodium EDTA\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nVery sticky, thick gel.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays for a few minutes, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis is a very strong-hold gel. It is a part of the Protein Duo, but it isn‚Äôt as protein-heavy as the leave-in cream. Even with my protein-sensitive hair, I was able to use it occasionally on days when I wanted some serious definition. If I used it 2-3 times consecutively, it caused protein-overload. Overall, a nice gel that gives pretty good definition and hold. I haven‚Äôt bought it again, though I might do so once my current hoard of gels is finished.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n3/5. May repurchase sometime.\n\n# \n\n# ‚ú®Moisture Duo‚ú®\n\n## üîπCurl-Quenching Hair Butter\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Extract, Salvia Hispanica(Chia) Seed Extract, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Quaternium-87, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Panthenol, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond Oil), Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Glycerin, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, PEG/‚ÄãPPG-8/‚Äã3 Diisostearate, Astrocaryum Vulgare Kernel Oil, Tocopherol, Olea Europea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Euterpe Oleracea (Acai) Fruit Oil, Mauritia Flexuosa (Buriti) Fruit Oil, Fragrance, Polyquaternium-73\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick white cream. Emulsifies into a thinner non-sticky cream.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nMild fragrance that lingers around for a few hours, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis one is an extreme boost of hydration. It is a heavy product, and tends to make hair greasy if too much is used. Since my hair is very dry, this works really well to keep it considerably soft and frizz-free. It doesn‚Äôt help me a lot with definition though, I don‚Äôt feel my hair is more defined on the days I use this butter as opposed to some other leave-in cream (usually the green Arata styling cream). Since it is heavy, it might weigh down wavy or fine hair. But for tighter curl patterns and/or coarser drier hair, this is great.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nThe product label mentions that it can be used as a one and done styling product. But for better definition, I prefer always using the gelly with it.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased. \n\n## üîπCurl-Quenching Flaxseed Gelly\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Extract, Sorbitol, Propanediol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Salvia Hispanica (Chia! Seed Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-73, Panthenol, Sodium Gluconate, Fragrance, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Vinegar\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThin to medium, non-sticky gel.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays for a few minutes, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis is protein-free and quite hydrating honestly. Has a lot of slip, so it is a nice experience to style. It doesn‚Äôt have a lot of hold. Curls last for a day or two maximum, and that is after all protective measures like a satin pillowcase, satin scrunchies, etc. If long-lasting curls are not a goal for you, and you don‚Äôt mind refreshing more frequently, I would highly recommend this. The Moisture Bundle would probably be my most highly recommended FMC products.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nThe product label mentions that it can be used as a one and done styling product. I do use it as my sole styler sometimes, and it works out fine.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n# \n\n# ‚ú®Miscellaneous Notes About Fix My Curls‚ú®\n\nFix My Curls website used to have the full ingredients list of their products on the product pages prominently displayed. However during their recent website update, they have replaced it with Key Ingredients. So, minus points for that from me.They do have a photo of the back label in the product images, which shows the ingredients, but I feel that is not good enough. I prefer having the ingredients easily accessible. \n\nThey always have some kind of sale, discount offers, freebie offers, etc on their website. A lot of Indian Curly Hair Influencers also have affiliate codes for FMC. If you are planning to buy anything, I‚Äôd recommend comparing prices from the official seller on Amazon and the website during sales.

I use FMC leave in cream, hair mousse & defining hair gel & quite like them as they don't weigh down my hair while making them soft enough. Provide moderate hold & don't make them look crunchy. \n\nI agree with your assessment that they don't provide much moisture. So sm1 with Frizzy or dry hair would need other more rich / moisturizing products.\n\nThe leave in cream & mousse are my more used products, I haven't quite figured out how to use the gel properly yet.",

    "body": "After seeing [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/r613jf/my_experience_with_prose_finethin_curlywavy_hair/) on here, I was inspired to share my thoughts about my experience with Prose.\n\n**My hair:** 2A, fine-medium strands and medium density. It's at about mid/upper back in length, and the only color I have is very very grown out highlights that are near the ends. I'm pretty oily at the roots, I wash my hair every 2 days or so, and cannot go longer than that despite my many attempts to try the hair training myth.\n\n**The goals I set with my subscription:** Oil Control, shine, volume, moisture\n\n**The ‚Äúfactors‚Äù they included based on my zip code:** UV protection, humidity, water hardness, pollution, wind. (who knows how much of this they actually factor in but whatever lol.)\n\n**Full Ingredients lists:**\n\n*Shampoo:*  Water, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Decyl- Glucoside, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Jasmin Flower Water, Propanediol Dicaprylate, Fragrance, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Tocopherol, PPG-Caprylyl Ether, Pyridoxine, Panthenol, Jujube Bark Extract, Peppermint Leaf Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Polyquaternium-10, Tropolone, Hydrolyzed Quinoa, Kale Leaf Extract, Citric Acid, Spirulina Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Hydrolyzed Pea Protein, Yucca Stem Extract, Arginine, Cannabidiol, Cocamidopropyl PG- dimonium Chloride, Grape Seed Extract\n\n*Conditioner:* Water, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Octyldodecanol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Chloride, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Fragrance, Cetrimonium Chloride, Birch Juice, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, PEG-7 Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Laureth-7, Polyquaternium-10, Tocopherol, Polysorbate 20, Poppy Seed Oil, Plum Seed Oil, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Cocamidopropyl PG-dimonium Chloride, Potassium Sorbate\n\n**(These lists look pretty basic to me. But I am curious on your thoughts on them.)**\n\n**The story:** I received the first order of Prose a few months ago. I genuinely liked the idea of customized haircare, so I was hopeful. Like many other people, they were *all over* my fucking IG ads, and this annoyed me but I (unfortunately) love trying new products way too much to ignore them üôÑ. The set was good. I loved the scent, I loved how my hair looked, and it felt healthy & clean with each wash. It was spring at the time, and there was enough humidity in the air for my hair to have some volume in addition to these other perks. As the weather got cooler, I noticed that the formula seemed almost too conditioning for winter where humidity was much lower. This lead me to believe they did not in fact update it based on the weather in my area. My hair was very flat and limp, and occasionally felt weighed down. There was absolutely no help with the sebum control, but that was to be expected.\n\n**Flash forward to yesterday's post-** I read that the OP had very similar experiences to me *but* experienced more shedding with this product. Andddd I got to thinking. ***I, in fact, was noticing a lot more shedding than I was used to.*** I can't really recall when this increase in shedding started, because my hair was shorter when I first started using it (tiny past shoulder length)- so less hair showed in my shower drain cover. Now, my ponytail just feels a bit less thick. I can't see any bald spots or anything like that, and it is not something very severe- but the combo of seeing a lot of shedding in the shower and this less dense feeling in my ponytail made me feel just a little off. Like something just wasn't quite right. \n\nToday I decided to wash my hair with a different shampoo, a higher end drugstore one from Target called ‚ÄúOdele Volumizing Shampoo‚Äù which I used before Prose. And yall‚Ä¶ The shedding was much less. Like, MUCH less. I am still shocked.\n\n\\***Let me just say\\*:**\n\n* ***I know that it is not common that a product alone causes more hairfall, and that usually there is a different or underlying reason.***\n* ***I recently had bloods and a physical and all is well with my health***\n* I highly doubt this product is actually harmful, so I am guessing that it simply caused more breakage to happen and that‚Äôs what I was seeing in the shower. But I will never really know.\n* ***This product caused no irritation or visible signs of it not agreeing with me, or I would have stopped using it.***\n* I normally would not jump to conclusions, but after seeing such a consistent amount of hairfall each time, it was too different of a result for me to not take into account. I am going to continue to use the regular shampoo and see if anything changes.\n\n**What's my point?:** Prose is ultimately a gimmick. They have very convincing ads that pray on people's fears about cosmetics and their hair health. My hair *looks* great with it, but I shed more for whatever reason and I'm not into that. I'm not sure I trust they are real chemists, either. \n\nThank you for reading!",

Got the product from Paytm ONDC for Rs. 199 (50% off coupon).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Quantity:** 150ml\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Packaging:** The cleanser comes in a cute pump packaging. Pump can be twisted to lock and unlock which will be helpful for travel. Refer to the image below:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cleanser packaging](https://preview.redd.it/vqxzomkuovuc1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=649c3171c0244b1d9614b79e9d103d984e140049)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cleanser texture:** The texture is creamy as the name suggests. Very similar to Cetaphil gentle cleanser, just a little more creamier. Consistency is runny just like Cetaphil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cleanser texture](https://preview.redd.it/ag9wyjnfqvuc1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6d8189d598a85417d5eb3b24cc7079240c65177)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven though it is Soap-free and very similar to Cetaphil gentle cleanser, it still lathers up quite well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Lathering](https://preview.redd.it/luyjpocoqvuc1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c058bb3a9a6ff7f29d07661e7861e8e7084c6833)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Experience:** The cleanser cleansed my face very well. Lathered up decently and the application on my face was very gentle. It felt as if I was applying a body lotion on my face. Skin felt soft and clean after wash and face was not stretchy or dry. I used this cleanser as second cleanser in my routine after removing off my sunscreen using micellar water. I did not face any breakouts or bumps on my face so far.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe  cleanser is fragrance free. However it has that medicinal smell like other simple cleansers. Smell is a bit different and weird but not overpowering or irritating at all so can be ignored.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll in all, it is a really good gentle cleanser which does not strip my face off of essential oil but still cleanses pretty well. It seems like a suitable replacement for my daily cleanser which is the simple refreshing facial wash. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlthough it has only been a couple of days since I started using it so take this review as an initial impression for now. Will update the post after using it for a longer duration or if I face any issues with the product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeel free to shoot your questions/queries and do let me know if I have missed out on anything since this is my first review here.\n\n&#x200B;",

    "body": "As a stylist, the most frequent question I get is ‚Äúhow often should I shampoo?‚Äù. My response always is \"first and foremost, it's important to know how to shampoo properly so when you do, it counts\".¬† From how shampoo works to the most common ingredients, I answer all of your shampoo-related questions below.¬†\n\n(This is the entire text from my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html))\n\n**How does shampoo work?**¬†‚Äã\n\nYou can think of the active ingredient in shampoo as being within [two categories](https://www.nycoproducts.com/resources/blog/simple-science-the-difference-between-soap-and-detergent/): (1) non-detergents (soap) and (2) detergents. Non-detergents are made from natural ingredients and act as an emulsifier¬†for oil and water. This makes it easier to rinse impurities away when it's washed out. Detergents are synthetic, man-made chemicals with¬†active agents (wetting agents) capable of lowering the surface tension of a liquid. These are known as [surfactants](https://www.hairstory.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-detergent/), and they do this by having a hydrophilic \"head\" and a hydrophobic \"tail\", which essentially allows¬†the shampoo to stick to oils and dirt in your hair. Those oils and dirt are then swept away when washed out. Another way to understand the difference between non-detergents and detergents: the former will leave a residue behind while the latter will not.[ ](https://www.hairstory.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-detergent/)[Simplifying Hair Products II](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-simplifying-hair-products-ii.html) breaks down the purpose of other ingredients you'll find in shampoos to make them effective and pourable (i.e. the opposite of powered shampoos that are becoming more popular).¬†\n\n**How often should I shampoo?**\n\n‚ÄãSome hair types will need to shampoo daily and others only need to wash once every ten days or so. Preference also plays a role here depending if you're trying to achieve a sleek look or a voluminous one. Shampooing less will condense your hair over time and allow it to hold more oils, which shampooing more will remove oils and promote a fuller look.¬†Think about the following factors as you keep reading through this post, and check out [Post-Workout Hair](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-post-workout-hair.html) to learn more tips and tricks for¬†managing your hair with a busy life.\n\n*Your hair's density*\n\n* ‚Äã*Fine:* Needs to be washed daily, particularly if you have skin that is more oily. People with this hair type often feel that their hair looks too flat if they try to style it without washing and drying it first.¬†\n* *Thick:* Can be washed¬†anywhere from once every three days to once every¬†ten days.¬†People with this hair type often feel that their hair looks too voluminous or puffy¬†if they wash too frequently. Thick hair¬†also takes¬†longer to blow dry and style, making it a nightmare to wash daily because of the amount of time it adds to your¬†routine.¬†\n\n*Your hair's condition/damage*\n\n* ‚Äã*Fine:*¬†If your hair is breaking due to damage you should try to shampoo less - every other day to every three days. Giving your hair a break from washing and styling can help with mitigating¬†damage. Use shampoos and conditioners that are moisturizing, even if they give a flatter look then you like.¬†\n* *Thick:* Damage to thicker hair shows more prominently because there is more of it. Straight hair will often appear to have many flyaways, while on curlier hair damage can be easier to hide. Since your styling routine is already longer because of how much hair you have, avoiding a full wash and blow dry (i.e. heat) for as long as possible can help with mitigating damage.¬†\n\n*The type of shampoo and conditioner you use*\n\n* *Fine:* If you aren't worried about damage, look for a volumizing shampoo and conditioner for day-to-day use. Clarifying shampoos will¬†help strip extra oil from your hair, but should only be used once a week alongside a shampoo made for daily use. Avoid clarifying shampoos if your hair is damaged.¬†\n* *Thick:* Look for moisturizing and hydrating shampoos to counteract your¬†volume.¬†[Co-washes](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/news/a56230/co-washing-benefits/) are also a great option for curlier hair, and can be used more frequently since they are a combination of shampoo and conditioner. They're¬†a¬†great option if you need to wash more because of your workout schedule or job.¬†‚Äã\n\n*Your Scalp*‚Äã‚Äã\n\nYour scalp is an important part of figuring out how, and how much, to shampoo. This takes trial and error, plus may change over time. Generally, you should wash as often as your scalp can handle it because, like the rest of your skin, it is constantly shedding¬† cells.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that washing your hair has no effect on the amount of oil produced by your sebaceous glands. This depends on hormonal and genetic factors, and the glands have no way of responding to oils on the surface of your scalp. The theory that you could \"train\" your scalp to be less oily was disproven in 1982 by [Kligman and Shelley](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13525782/).\n\nIf you're trying to avoid washing more frequently, then use a mixed boars bristle brush (BBB) to manipulate the scalp and softly remove cell build up. The Reddit page¬†[No-Poo/Natural Hair](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/)¬†is a good resource for advice on maintaining your scalp when shampooing less frequently.¬†‚Äã\n\n* *Signs you may be washing too much:* a scalp that feels dry or tight\n* *Signs you may not be washing enough:* ‚Äãexcessive product/oil build up‚Äã\n\n**What is the proper way to shampoo?**¬†\n\nTo help the shampoo work, emulsify it in your hands before applying. Start applying in at the back of your head, ending at the crown. Take around a minute to apply it. Similar to washing your hands, shampoo takes a few seconds to lift the oils and dirt.\n\n* *When you're looking for volume:* Pay attention to the sides and back of your head when¬†shampooing and rinsing, as these areas are commonly missed. For thicker hair, consider washing (or rinsing) in two sections. If you've gone 3+¬†days without washing, shampooing twice also makes sense.\n* *When you're looking to smooth/leave natural oils behind:* Generally, use a minimal amount of shampoo and rinse it out fairly quickly. Try conditioning your hair first, then shampooing and conditioning again. See the \"volume\" bullet above if you feel like you need a deep clean. This is helpful but not always necessary.\n\n**Shampoo Ingredients**\n\nMany people search for shampoo via the phrase \"shampoo without chemicals\". Technically, if the shampoo has water in it this will count as a chemical, so a better approach is to search for shampoos via ingredients. I've given you a list to consider below.¬†\n\n*Shampoo Without Silicone*\n\nSoluble silicone formulas can be washed out with gentler shampoos and conditioners that don't contain surfactants, and are capable of achieving the same results as non-soluble silicones.¬†Common names on the bottle include:\n\n* *Non-solu‚Äãble:* Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Amodimethicone, Pheryl trimethicone, Ceteraryl methicone, Dimethiconol, Stearyl dimethicone, Amodimethicone (non-soluble when Trideceth-12 and Cetrimonium Chloride are absent)\n* ‚Äã*Soluble:* Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone copolyol, Lauryl methicone copolyol, any silicone with PEG as a prefix\n\n*‚ÄãShampoo Without Sulfate and SLS*\n\nAs a rule of thumb, ingredients like Ammonium lauryl sulfate and Ammonium laureth sulfate tend to be easier on sensitive scalps than Sodium lauryl sulfate. To learn more about surfactants, check out [Simplifying Hair Products II](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-simplifying-hair-products-ii.html).¬†\n\n*Shampoo Without Parabens*‚Äã\n\nMost water based shampoos contain preservatives because without them they¬† will eventually grow mold or bacteria. Parabens are a type of preservative that are commonly used in hair products. According to The FDA \"scientists continue to review published studies on the safety of parabens. At this time, we do not have information showing that parabens, as they are used in cosmetics, have an effect on human health\" (Source:¬†[FDA, Parabens in Cosmetics](https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetic-ingredients/parabens-cosmetics)).¬†They're usually easy to spot on the bottle because they end in the word \"paraben\". Common non-paraben preservatives are shown in the list below. To learn more about parabens, check out this article published by Cosmopolitan:¬†[Wait, What Actually Are Parabens and Should You Avoid Them?¬†](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a28662211/what-are-parabens/)\n\n* [*Common names on the bottle:* Midazolidinyl urea, Iodopropynyl, Isothiazolinone, and Sodium benzoate](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a28662211/what-are-parabens/)\n\n*Shampoo Without Salt*\n\n[Sodium chloride](https://nutrafol.com/blog/15-shampoo-ingredients-to-avoid/) is another name for salt. It's used in shampoo and conditioner mainly to make the consistency thicker. A trend of \"salt shampoos\" has also been seen, where the benefits include being used as a [scrub](https://www.byrdie.com/what-are-salt-shampoos) for the scalp, plus being gentler on the environment. This has may have been influenced by the idea of adding [salt or sea water ](https://www.gourmandize.com/article-6582-put-salt-in-your-shampoo-to-solve-your-worst-hair-problems.htm)to your current shampoo. I wouldn't recommend adding sea water to your shampoo, as this could potentially generate¬†bacteria and mold in your products over time.¬†\n\n**Shampoo/Ingredients For Hair Care Concerns**\n\n*Hair Loss*\n\nFor assisting with hair loss, there are DHT-blocking shampoos plus ones with¬†ingredients that help with inflammation. Saw palmetto, also known as [Serenoa](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/039463201202500435),¬†naturally lowers the conversion of testosterone into Dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT¬†is a sex hormone that contributes to human developments such as body hair, but it can also make you lose your hair faster and earlier.¬†If you're experiencing any type of hair loss, the first place to start is with a doctor. You don't want to try different shampoos only to later find out a doctor would have pointed you in a different direction.¬†\n\n*Hair Growth*\n\nShampoos with biotin are frequently marketed as being helpful for hair growth. It is also¬†commonly added to shampoos claiming to reduce hair loss, but there is no [evidence](https://www.webmd.com/connect-to-care/hair-loss/does-biotin-really-prevent-hair-loss) that it prevents this. Consuming foods rich in healthy vitamins and minerals will help with overall hair health.\n\n*Dry Scalp*\n\nSome contributing factors to a dry or itchy scalp can't be solved with a shampoo. However, certain ingredients can offer relief.\n\n* ‚Äã‚Äã*Salicylic acid:* This can be found in drug store shampoos advertising scalp health. It will help remove¬†scalp cells causing dandruff while also moisturizing dry spots. Consider using it seasonally during dry winter months, or on a regular basis as needed.¬†\n* *Selenium sulfide:*¬†Formulated to control more serious dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp. It's also used¬†to treat pityriasis versicolour, a common fungal infection that causes small patches of skin to become scaly and discoloured.\n* *Ketoconazole:*¬†An ingredient that provides the same benefits as Selenium sulfide.\n* *Tea Tree Oil:* [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1360273/) have shown that tea tree oil effectively fights many types of bacteria, viruses¬†and fungi. These shampoos tend to be very calming and cleansing.\n\n*Naturally Grey Hair Turning Yellow*¬†\n\nUse two types of shampoo: (1) a purple shampoo and (2) a moisturizing shampoo. Grey hair tends to pick up unwanted yellow tones from the environment, and purple shampoo will help combat these tones. The moisturizing shampoo helps prevent your hair from becoming too dry, which can be exacerbated by purple shampoo. Check out [Purple Shampoo](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-purple-shampoo.html) for more insight on your options for these products.¬†",

    "body": "Hair Type: Thin, 2B/C Curl Patterns, Oily scalp, prone to hairfall\n\nSome hair background:\nSo I switched to using silicone and sulphate free haircare on a whim back in 2017. To my surprise, this changed my previously mostly straight hair to pretty curly. I learnt about CGM afterwards but since that seemed like a lot of effort, I just stuck to using CG friendly products and was happy with what my hair looked like. Cut to 3 months ago, when I moved to a new place with a really humid climate and my hair fall became like 10 fold. I tried going back to products that had worked for me in the past but nothing helped. Eventually, I thought, that the increased frizziness caused by humidity was the cause of the hair fall and since no product seemed to make my hair soft and silky like before, I decided to go back to silicones. A combination that helped my hair fall to some extent was Bblunt Intense Moisture Shampoo (the blue one) and Loreal Professional Serie Quinoa Protein Hair Mask (used this as conditioner after every wash). But this combination also did make my hair straighter than it had been in recent years. Decided to give the BBlunt Curly Hair range a try (the pink color one). This range does contain Silicones, so it is not strictly CG friendly but it has worked for me. I do not use any leave-in products to style my hair, but I don't mind some frizz. The curls I get from just these 3 products are pretty impressive, as good as any other CG friendly shampoo/conditioners I have used in the past. And my hair fall though still not as less as it was 6 months ago, is definitely better. Details below.\n\n1) Bblunt Curly Hair Prepoo (Pink and white tub packaging)\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Aloe Vera Extract, Cocos (Coconut)Water, Aayla mido propyltrimonium Chloride/Acrylamide Copolymer, Citric Acid, PEG-90M, Parfum (Perfume)\n\nThoughts: Definitely my favourite of the 3. I have been looking for a  pre-shampoo product to add to my routine. Oiling and Aloeing have not worked for me. I have previously used some hair masks that said they can be used before shower but they were thick and creamy and impossible to spread properly on semi-wet or dry hair. THIS product is everything I wanted. It is a gel-like consistency, spreads super easily. I usually brush out my hair before showering and this is when I lose the most hair. Since this product claims at helping in detangling I decided to use this before I brush my hair and the hair I lost was significantly less! During and post-shower, my hair maintains great slip!  This has the potential to be HG for me. It has a pleasant coconutty smell, but the fragrances in these products do not last too long, which is nice (The loreal mask makes my hair smell like a salon even 2 days later).\n\nRepurchase Status: WRP Definitely!\n\n2) Bblunt Curly Hair Shampoo (Pink Tube)\n\nIngredients: Aqua (Water), Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Cocamidopropyl Retain, Decyl Glucoside, Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Glycol Distearate, Glycerin, Acrylates Copolymer, Cocamide MEA, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipropylene Glycol, PEG-150 Distearate, Polysilicone-29, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-7, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Magnesium Nitrate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Menthol, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Acetamide MEA, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panthenol, Sorbitol, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acid, Cocoyl Sarcosine,TriticumVulgare (Wheat) Germ Acid, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Polysorbate-20, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Polysorbate-80, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Parfum (Perfume).\n\nThoughts: It is a shampoo that does its job. It cleans my oily scalp well without stripping it too much. It does not lather and spread as well as the blue BBlunt shampoo but that is to be expected as this one does not have SLS. One thing I have to mention is that near my roots this is the only product from the 3 that I used, and I noticed that the hair in that area did have some curls (usually hair close to my roots does not curl up), so this shampoo is definitely doing something right. Smells pretty fresh (like a cactus? or something softer than that lol) cant describe it. But again the smell does not linger post-shower.\n\nRepurchase Status: Maybe (I have a bunch of other shampoos lying around that I have to finish up first post-monsoon. If using any of those increases my hair fall again, will return to this)\n\n3) Bblunt Curly Hair Conditioner (Pink Tube)\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Amodimethicone, Behentrimonium, Methosulfate, Isopropyl Myristate, Dimethicone, Almond Oil, Polyquaternium-10, Silicone Quaternium, Polyquaternium-7, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Acetamide MEA, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Sorbitol, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acid, Cococoyl Satosire, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Acid, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Polysorbate-20, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Panthenol, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Magnesium Nitrate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, MAgnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Trideceth-12, Laureth-23, Laureth-4, Polyglyceryl-3 Caprate, Dipropylene Glycol, Perfume\n\nThoughts: When I first used it I felt like it was super light and would not do much conditioning, but to my surprise when I rinsed it out, my hair had great slip, and detangled very easily. Some of that I will say must be because of the prepoo, but this conditioner also must be contributing. I guess since I was using the super thick loreal mask as conditioner previously, that's why this conditioner feels very light to me, but if it's doing its job, then it's ok of course. This smells like something sweet... white chocolate or marzipan. Overall I like it, and in combination with the prepoo, my hair is a lot softer than the loreal mask. \n\nRepurchase Status: Probably (again have a bunch of conditioners, i wish to use up first)\n\nI am a bit confused that even with silicones, how do these products work so well in giving me curls. Maybe I just don't know enough about how silicones work. But if with continued use I feel like silicone buildup is weighing my hair down, I can use my Fix My Curls Cleansing Shampoo once in a while, I guess.",

But if with continued use I feel like silicone buildup is weighing my hair down\n\nThat's because silicones are not the devil that cg hair community paints them out to be... Silicones are nothing but emollients just like natural oils that cg community likes to sing praises about... Except silicones are better than natural oils at their job of calming down the frizz and are lighter. And about weighing down, would your hair feel weighed down if you continuously apply oil without washing it off? Yes, yes you will. And what are oils again? Emollients same as a silicones. You see the similarity and the comparison. It took me a while to get out of the influencer-fed info that SILICONES WILL ABSOLUTELY DESTROY CURLY HAIR... Because I use sulphate free shampoo (wow shampoo at that) and silicone conditioner and feel no difference.\n\nSome people cannot tolerate silicones because that's how their *individual* hair is... Just like some people can't tolerate hyaluronic acid or a niacinamide serum. But this fear of silicones and this blanket statement that silicones are bad for curly hair comes from lack of education and knowledge about them. And if you have any doubt, feel free to ask.",

    "body": "I have short wavy to curly hair that generally gets very frizzy. It is dry, with normal scalp. I have a lot (A LOT) of really thick hair. It is high porosity and takes hours to dry, even when chin lenght as it is now. The texture is very mixed, with some slightly wavy strands all the way up to kinky curly ones. I'd say most of it falls in category 2B.\n\n\nI have been wearing my hair curly and was getting fantastic results with a product by Rene Furterer, the Veloute Perfecteur de Boucles. It was a light, non greasy cream and I could use a fair amount of it without any adverse effects. Something in it really helps with curl formation, and all I had to do was put it into still rather wet hair, and let it dry. Perfect, consistent results every time. The hair was curly, light, perfectly hydrated.\n\n\nHere is the ingredient list:\n\n\n*Water, ethyhexyl palmitate, cetearyl alcohol, acanthus mollis leaf extract, amodimethicone, BHT, butylparaben, cetearyl glucoside, cetrimonium chloride, disodium EDTA, ethylparaben, fragrance (parfum), inulin lauryl carbamate, isobutylparaben, maltodextrin, methylparaben, persea gratissima (avocado) oil (persea gratissima oil), phenoxyethanol, polyquaternium-37, polyquaternium-68, propylparaben, trideceth-12.*\n\n\nA few months ago, they changed the line. Now the cream feels sticky and heavy, and although it still does promote curl formation (could be the acanthe extract, that is what the brand claims in their marketing), it makes my hair greasy and stringy and really just not nice. So, cue in another product hunt. Lots of money already into it, I'm not getting there... I now need a leave in, a defining curl cream and a gel to get lesser results, and I have to be so careful not to touch my hair under penalty of turning into a frizz ball.\n\n\nHere are the ingredients of the new, totally not improved product:\n\n\n*Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behenamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Acanthus Mollis Leaf Extract, Alpha Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, BHT, Butylphenyl, Methylpropional, Ceteareth-33, Citronellol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance (Parfum), Glycerin, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Hexyl Cinnamal, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Lactic Acid, Limonene, Linalool, Maltodextrin, Oenothera Biennis, (Evening Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Phenoxyethanol, Polyquaternium-68, Salicylic Acid, Sorbic Acid, Tocopherol, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Dissucinate.*\n\n\n**Is there anyone who is knowledgeable enough to take a look at the differences between old and new and maybe shed some light on how I can find another perfect product? My wallet and I thank you in advance.**",

It feels a little sticky to touch after application, but that goes away by the morning. After the first use, I did not rinse it off the next morning. It hydrated my hair *very,* my hair was extremely soft. However the amodimethicone in it made my hair kind off frizzy and difficult to manage. For the next 2 washes, I decided to rinse it off in the morning without any shampoo. That ended up working better for me.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. Intensely hydrates.\n2. Has some slip, you could potentially use it as a styling product if you have fine or wavy hair that doesn't like heavy products.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. It has fragrance. Heavy fragrance. *Almost-gave-me-a-headache* fragrance. C*ould-probably-be-used-as-a-perfume-if-you-tried-hard-enough* fragrance.\n\n**How I use it now:**\n\n1. I apply it on wash days as pre-poo. I leave it on for an hour and then wash off.\n2. Also I accidentally spilled some on my forearm once, and turns out it works fine as a lotion lol. So now sometimes I just put some on my arms if they're feeling extra dry. Probably a waste of product to use it like this, but it feels better than just leaving it on the shelf.\n\nAll in all, if you are okay with silicones and fragrance, I would recommend this. However I WNRP myself.",

    "body": "About my hair- 2a/2b dry coarse low porosity hair which is a little longer than my waist.\nI have always had a tough time finding a conditioner / mask , any mask loaded with silicones make my hair not clump to form waves and puff out. Matrix hydrasource mask was the only thing that has even come close to my hg but unfortunately they stopped selling the mask on retail basis and it is intended only for saloon purpose and with the pandemic I don't think I will be stepping into a salon anytime soon. So I was looking for an affordable alternative and someone in this sub mentioned this one. Now the coming to ingredients \n\nMatrix biolage hydrasource mask- \nAqua , Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, stearyl alcohol,Cetyl Esters, fragrance,  Phenoxyethanol, Isopropyl Alcohol, Aloe Barbadensis / Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Limonene, chlorhexidine dihydrochloride , sodium citrate, Hexyl Cinnamal, Coumarin, Linalool, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Alcohol, Hydroxycitronellal, Amyl Cinnamal. \n\n Loreal total repair 5 masque - \nWater, cetearyl alcohol, mineral oil, dipalmitoylethyl hydroxyethylmonium methosulphate, cetyl esters, lactic acid, phenoxyethanol , trideceth-6 , chlorhexidine digluconate, limonene, benzyl salicylate, amodimethacone, 2-oleamido-1,3-octadecanediol, fragrance,cetrimonium chloride, butylphenyl methylpropional , Hexyl cinnamal.(they have reformulated since the last time I used it about 2 years ago)\n\nMY EXPERIENCE:\n     Now coming to texture , the loreal one is tad bit thicker than the matrix mask and the slip provided is also lesser than the matrix mask. So I needed about 1.5 times  the amount as matrix one . The shine provided by both are same .They both act similarly when it come to making my waves form and hold. The loreal one is not as moisturising as the Matrix mask , and the frizz is also a little more than matrix mask.  So overall I would say  loreal total repair mask comes close to matrix by about 85%  . And it is costlier than the matrix biolage hydrasource mask, so I will again start my search once this one gets over.",

    "body": "I did bury the company name somewhat, but if you made it here, you'll find it. Everything I say here is my opinion based solely on their website content, and I've never tried their products or even heard of them before today. Part of the reason that I am so specifically critical of this brand is that they also sell an expensive oral supplement for hair, which I think is inappropriate for any cosmetics brand to do, but it is especially worrisome from a tiny one that is so loose with their claims for other products.\n\nOn the other hand, seldom does a company make it this easy to read their labels with some kind of confidence, so I thought it might be interesting to share. On the website product pages they do a couple of bullet-point type \"contains X% of Y\" that I call advertising claims for ingredients, but when compared to the full ingredients list it becomes obvious just how far they're stretching. In one case it is obvious that the claim percent is probably how much of the material as supplied they use, the rest are less clear.\n\nI want to say that despite the cleanwashing and the painfully bad sciencewashing this brand does, these may not be bad products to use, though they all range between somewhat and ridiculously overpriced. However, they are pushing the limits of language use in advertising/marketing to the flimsiest edge of reason and legality, and their \"science\" is a mish-mash of misleading puffery, long debunked fearmongering misinformation, and some other stuff I think they pulled out of thin air. Given all of the aroma chemicals in some their ingredients lists, I'd love to know how they would define \"synthetic\" in relationship to fragrance.\n\nThey have filed a patent application both World and US for stirring ingredients together at room temperature to make their products, which has got to be some troll level BS, or maybe a shady sidestep attempt to patent protect the cosmetic products ingredients lists or formulas without actually doing anything patentable. They are not Skinceuticals making a breakthrough with C E Ferulic. I mostly skimmed these because reading such patent apps is a good treatment for insomnia.\n\nWorld patent app here: https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2019165115A1/en\n\nUS here: https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200375877A1/en\n\nThe US version removes claims 8-17 as compared to the World version.\n\nNo idea where the hyperbaric chamber nonsense fits into this, but I laughed very hard at what seems to be a cut & paste definition of a pressure chamber from somewhere else. The patent app doesn't mention needing a hyperbaric chamber, despite the website claims.\n\nLast thing that I can't let go of: A quick lab test is not a clinical trial. In this case it \"proves\" that the 3 main products used in sequence will clean some synthetic sebum out of standardized hair samples in a lab.\n\nOh, and they've registered a trademark for Cold Processed. Yeah. https://uspto.report/company/Act-Acre-Inc\n\nAnyway. Enough of my judgemental rambling. On to the real reason for this: the labels!\n\nThey start as expected, but everything under 1% is listed alphabetically for most of their products. There are a few I didn't include here. I've formatted them to italics at the point where they go alphabetical to make it more obvious.\n\n**Act+Acre Stem Cell Serum** (for the scalp)\n\nAdvertising claim amounts: 2% apple stem cells, 2% bamboo and pea extract\n\nIngredients list as of April 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, *Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (ALOE), Bambusa Vulgaris Leaf/Stem Extract (BAMBOO), Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Citric Acid, Plant-Based Collagen, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glucosamine Hcl, Glycereth-26, Lecithin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate (RADISH), Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract (APPLE), Pentylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Extract (PEA), Propanediol, Quercus Petraea Fruit Extract (OAK), Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hydroxide, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Xanthan Gum*\n\nNote: Raw material manufacturers have been trying to make plant stem cells happen in cosmetics for well over a decade. I have not tried any and have no plans to do so. PhytoCellTec's SDS for their apple stem cell extract on Lotioncrafter's site gives the amount as 9% of the whole solution as supplied.\n\n**Hair Cleanse**\n\nAd Claim: 2% Apple amino acids, 0.045% Baobab oil (they say it supports a healthy scalp microbiome, not sure how that applies in a rinse off)\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Sodium Cocoyl Apple Amino Acids, Triethyl Citrate, Sorbitan Oleate Decylglucoside Crosspolymer, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, *Acrylates Copolymer, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil (BAOBAB), Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Oil (AMARANTH), Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil (AMYRIS), Aquilaria Agallocha Wood Oil (AGARWOOD), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Caprylyl Glycol, Cistus Ladaniferus Leaf/Stem Extract (ROCKROSE), Citric Acid, Cocamide Mipa, Dimethyl Heptenal, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil (CARDAMOM), Gamma-Nonalactone, Glycol Distearate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil (SUNFLOWER), Hexenyl Acetate, Hexylene Glycol, Ionone, Juniperus Virginiana Oil (CEDARWOOD), Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil (LAVENDER), Menthyl Ethylamido Oxalate, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil (MORINGA), Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Pogostemon Cablin Oil (PATCHOULI), Potassium Sorbate, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract (ROSEMARY), Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Steareth-4, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Vanillin, Viola Odorata Flower/Leaf Extract (VIOLET), Xanthan Gum* \n\nNote: Oils are only put in shampoos for making label claims.\n\n**Scalp Detox**\n\nUndoubedly misleading as heck ad claims: 4.55% Aloe & Calendula Extract, 2.73% Botanical Blend (either of those could mean anything)\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil (SUNFLOWER), Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil (SOYBEAN), Isostearyl Linoleate, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil (BAOBAB), Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil (MORINGA), *Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract (ALOE), Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Oil (AMARANTH), Calendula Officinalis Extract (CALENDULA), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil (ORANGE), Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil (COCONUT), Ocimum Basilicum Hairy Root Culture Extract (BASIL), Vetiveria Zizanoides Root Oil (VETIVER)*\n\nNote: Calendula is frequently extracted in sunflower seed oil for commercial use, and oil soluble aloe extracts are also widely available. The process for how they claim to stir this formula together is in the patent application as Working Example 3. A version of the hair cleanse is example 1. Anyway, I would guess that it is probably 80% or more C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate.\n\n**Conditioning Hair Mask** (also called Restorative Hair Mask)\n\nAd claims: 2% castor oil, no other % claims but mentions shea butter and panthenol benefits\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Isoamyl Laurate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Glycerin, Diheptyl Succinate, Triethyl Citrate, Arachidyl Alcohol, Di-C12-15 Alkyl Fumarate, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, *Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil (AMYRIS), Aquilaria Agallocha Wood Oil (AGARWOOD), Arachidyl Glucoside, Behentrimonium Chloride, Behenyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Nut Extract (SHEA BUTTER), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Ceteareth-20, Cetrimonium Chloride, Cistus Ladaniferus Leaf/Stem Extract (ROCKROSE), Citric Acid, Dimethyl Heptenal, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil (CARDAMOM), Ethylhexylglycerin, Gamma-Nonalactone, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract (SUNFLOWER), Hexenyl Acetate, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Ionone, Juniperus Virginiana Oil (CEDARWOOD), Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Pogostemon Cablin Oil (PATCHOULI), Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil (CASTOR), Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract (ROSEMARY), Sclerotium Gum, Sodium Hydroxide, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Vanillin, Viola Odorata Flower/Leaf Extract (VIOLET)*\n\nNote: The star here is Crodabond CSA INCI: Hydrogenated Castor Oil/Sebacic Acid Copolymer. It does have a tiny amount of plain castor oil too. Hard to say how accurate that 2% claim is.\n\nTheir **Hair Oil** doesn't have the detailed ingredients list that would show off their obvious fragrance inrgedients, as it would crush the \"just 5 natural ingredients\" idea, but they also say their squalane is squalene in the ad copy and I am petty enough about that kind of thing to put this here. \n\nAd claim from website: 5% plant-based squalene, 5% Argan oil\n\nList: Limnanthes alba (meadowfoam) seed oil, Squalane, Argania spinosa kernel (argan) oil, Crambe abyssinica seed oil phytosterol esters, Fragrance\n\nNote: As far as brand cohesiveness, this is an odd choice given the detailed ingredients lists of the other products that include the names of aroma chemicals and carefully avoid using the word \"fragrance\" but it is probably the most honest.",

I bought it for Rs.299 from amazon.\n* **Ingredients** : Allium Sativum (Garlic) Juice,  Fermented Oryza Sativa (Rice) Water, Macadamia Integrifolia Oil ,Trigonella Foenum-graecum (Fenugreek) Extract, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Protien , Soya Protien,Thymus Vulgaris (Thyme) Ext., Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice ,Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Ext., Phyllanthus Emblica (Indian Gooseberry) Ext., Vitamin E, Veg. Glycerine,Behentrimonium Chloride ,Cetrimonium Chloride ,Sodium Gluconate,Ceterath 21, Lanette Wax,Potassium Sorbate,Sodium Benzoate.\n* **Texture** : Has the consistency of a soft lotion. Neither too runny nor thick.\n* **Fragrance** : Ugh! I hate the fragrance of this , though fragrance is at the end of the ingredient list it has a very strong fragrance like the men‚Äôs perfume kind, sensitive nose people stay away as we are supposed to leave this overnight or atleast for one or two hours. Gave me a head ache when I left it overnight.\n* **My hair type** : 2A I guess. Not pin straight and has few waves , thin hair.\n* **Hair Concerns** : Dry ends and an oily scalp. Been facing hairfall for quite sometime. No dandruff.\n* **Review** : I totally fell for the ingredients ‚òπ. This was so not worth it.! The pump was not working at first so I sent them a mail and got no reply for few days then messaged them on Instagram and they said they‚Äôll send me a replacement for the pump which arrived after a week or so and ukw.. that didn‚Äôt work too so I had to transfer the product to another glass jar.  I have tried using this in 3 ways but nothing gave me any kind of results. Hairfall was still there didn‚Äôt notice change in texture of hair or anything as such except for the headache the fragrance gave me . \n\nFirst tried leaving it overnight, so I applied the lotion on my scalp and slept with a bun covered with a shower cap and took bath the next afternoon. This gave me headache so never repeated this process . \n\nSecond I did the same steps except for leaving it overnight I let it stay on my scalp for 3 to 4 hours and then took bath. I did this every 4th day and repeated it for 3 weeks. \n\nThird as I didn‚Äôt find any change in my hairfall and I hated the smell of this also I started missing my DIY hair masks so much as I felt like those made my hair look so much more healthier than this , I went back to using my DIY hair packs and mixed a spoon of this mask approximately into it and my hair felt so much better than all the past hair wash days.\n\n[Texture of the lotion](https://preview.redd.it/xdoi6tlztm371.jpg?width=4312&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=60a7382ed996671565b4f89879168d7084a03d00)\n\n* I will not be repurchasing it. There are much better products out there.\n\n* **My rating** : 3/10",

    "body": "Hi all!  I've been busy and thought I would follow the lead of other busy bloggers and combine some of latest reviews into one blog post.  None of these products were sponsored ~ I purchased them myself.   I do have affiliate and referral links but disclose in my blogs  &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n [Cleansing Review](\nhttps://beautyfindsforme.wordpress.com/2015/10/31/more-cleanser-reviews-cosrx-primary-raw-the-face-shop-doyouganic-cleansing-soap-plus-ciracle-revisited/)   &nbsp;&nbsp;\n  \n\n\n\n\nI did four cleansers in here ~ all with really LONG names:  The Face Shop Calming Seed Bubble Foam Cleanser, Primary Raw doyouganic cleanser soap, cosRX Low pH Good Morning Gel cleanser and a revisit with Ciracle Anti-Blemish Tea Tree Wash.  I also did a quick,unscientific comparison between cosRX & Ciracle as they are made by the same \"company\" - cosRX is the parent of Ciracle.  Lots of pictures plus how they performed    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n \n\n\n\n\n[Makeup cosRX Make Me Lovely Cream & A'Pieu Doramon EyeShadow Palette #1 My Daily](https://beautyfindsforme.wordpress.com/2015/10/27/instareview-cosrx-make-me-lovely-cream-apieu-doraemon-palette/)  \n\nswatches and all!    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nAlso, I've been reading here about requests on where to get unusual masks and hard to find masks ~ I subscribe to MaskGenie since day 1 (janaury of this year) and I have been so happy with this subscription service.  She ships directly from Hong Kong. I am not affiliated with her, nor do I make any money from mentioning her service.  These are unboxings, which means that I just give information about the masks, ingredients, and I might try one or two of them by the time I do the unboxing - if I do, then I mention the scent, texture, how it worked..\n\n\n* [October's MaskGenie Unboxing](https://beautyfindsforme.wordpress.com/2015/10/28/unboxing-october-2015-maskgenie/)\n\n* [See all of my MaskGenie Unboxings here](https://beautyfindsforme.wordpress.com/category/monthly-boxes/maskgenie-monthly-boxes/)     \n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n \nAnd finally ~ I will be reviewing this product more in depth on my blog by mid november, along with Innisfree Green Tea & Mint Hair Scaler and La‚Äôdor Perfect Hair Filler, but when I asked about this initially, there was interest in this product right away.  So, I will give you a quick rundown on Holika Holika Hair Rinsing \nVinegar From Nature  in Camellia    \n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nIngredients: Purified water, ethanol, vinegar, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, glycerin, Octyldodeceth-16, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Butylene Glycol, Cetrimonium Chloride, magnesium nitrate, magnesium chloride, Cyclohexasiloxane, silk amino acids, Ethylhexylglycerin, disodium EDTA, phenoxyethanol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, sodium benzoate , fragrance   \n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n \n\n \nI can assure you that this does not smell like vinegar at ALL!!  It smells like camellia flowers and it is not overpowering at all.  At first, when looking at the ingredient list, I thought this would be a conditioner, despite the name rinse.  However, it is a rinse ~ it is a watery product and I even put a spray pump on it, as I didn't want to waste it by pouring it into my hand (it is just like water).   I have to use a conditioner, this is not in replacement of one.  I use this product after I use a conditioner and this would be a detox product for my hair to remove build up and also bring shine back into my hair.  I don't think this would be a daily routine item for me, but every few days.   \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis is just an initial impression and hopefully, I will have more by mid November. \n\n",

I explained to her that I had never used it before and that it was not me.\n\nNow today, as I prepared to leave for a holiday in South Korea this morning - my mother asked me to buy another bottle of the hair treatment (without realising it was hair treatment). My sister saw and exclaimed \"so it was you using it!\". My mother explained that she had been using it for some time on her face and that it made it really nice - both me and my sister screamed internally and we had to explain to her that it was hair treatment.\n\nSo what I'm wondering at this point is - would be there be any harms in her using the hair treatment as a face wash? The ingredients are written in Japanese but I pulled the listing from Amazon Japan and have transcribed/translated them below:\n\n> water, isopentyl diol, behentrimonium chloride, glycerin, stearyl alcohol, dimethicone, behenyl alcohol, cetanol, DPG, maltitol, aminopropyl dimethicone, steartrimonium chloride, camellia seed oil, lactic acid, lemon extract, rose water , Royal jelly extract, soybean seed extract, isopropanol, isopropyl myristate, PEG-2 laurate, amodimethicone, SODIUM METHYL COCOYL TAURATE , salicylic acid, PPG-2-deces-12, EDTA-2Na, cetrimonium chloride, BG, tocopherol, Sodium benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Flavor, Red 227, Yellow 4    \n\nI punched them into CosDNA and can't see anything particularly of concern but I'm not an expert by any means but I was hoping to get input from people with more knowledge.",

I had to shampoo 3x and then my scalp would be dry again ugh.    \n\n\n\nI can't find the products recommended for dry sensitive scalp in my local drugstores so I buy products with similar ingredients cheap and accessible to me.    \n\n\n\nQuestion 1 : does this mean tea tree doesn't work for me? A lot of the recommended conditioners have all these ingredients of the petal fresh, this brand is really cheap and accessible to me too. Where did it go wrong?    \n\n\nQuestion 2 : the products recommendations page recommended tresemme naturals conditioner but It was discontinued and I read reviews that says it has to be used as a leave in and not a rinse conditioner. That baffled me!

Any others who use/ have used their products? \n\nHey, first time poster here but a huge fan of the sub! I've been through many products the last year or so trying to find new products for my hair that fit me. I have long silky and straight hair but it gets easily split ends and can get very tangled in the mornings..\n\nI have recently tried a new brand though - the biosilk shampoo and conditioner plus silk treatment. I have paid much for hair salon shampoo and conditioners but these did not work as good as the biosilk products. I'm very surprised how good they work for my hair, the shampoo and conditioner makes my hair instantly combable after showering, which I've never experienced before! So long story short, why does the products work for me? Are the ingredients good long term? Any others who use or have used the products? If so, what was your experience with them?\n\n\nIngredients in the shampoo:\nAqua/Water/Eau, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, Polysorbate 20, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Silk, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Symphytum Officinale Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Extract, Parfum/Fragrance, Benzyl Benzoate, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone.\n\nIngredients in the conditioner:\nAqua/Water/Eau, Cetyl Alcohol, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Amodimethicone, Hydrolyzed Silk, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol , Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Trideceth-8, Citric Acid, Benzophenone-3, Symphytum Officinale Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Extract, Fragrance (Parfum), Benzyl Benzoate, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol.\n\n\nI noticed the conditioner has citric acid and cetyl alcohol in it, I've heard acid can let good moisture in the hair as well as bad stuff..\nAre the ingredients good for my hair/scalp? Should I continue using it without worry?\n\nThanks for replies in advance!!",

I wash my hair in the morning so I don‚Äôt really have time to do a two-step routine for my hair, or I‚Äôm really too lazy for it.

So I‚Äôm actually considering co-washing instead. \n\nI‚Äôve had these two conditioners in my closet for a while that I have not used, and I‚Äôve looked through the ingredients list, would they be ok to use for co-washing?\n\n**[Redken Frizz Dismiss Conditioner](https://www.amazon.com/Redken-Dismiss-Conditioner-protection-smoothing/dp/B00UJZRO50)**\n\n> Aqua / Water / Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Paraffinum Liquidum / Mineral Oil / Huile Minerale, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Parfum / Fragrance, Isopropyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, PEG / PPG / Polybutylene Glycol-8 / 5 / 3 Glycerin, Pentaclethra Macroloba Oil / Pentaclethra Macroloba Seed Oil, Hexyl Cinnamal, BHT, Chlorhexidine Digluconate, Citric Acid, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone\n\n\nThis one looks quite fine to me? It seems to be a silicone-free conditioner and I read that Behentrimonium Chloride is quite good to have in a hair cleanser and it doesn‚Äôt seem to have any problematic ingredients in the top five.\n\n**[Klorane Conditioner with Pomegranate ](https://www.amazon.com/Klorane-Conditioner-Pomegranate-5-1-fl/dp/B000Q34W0K)**\n\n> Water (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Amodimethicone, Alcohol, Ceteareth-33, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Isopropyl Alcohol, Methyparaben, Punica Granatum extract, Red 4 (CI 14700), Trideceth-12\n\n\nIt seems the only problem for this one could be the Amodimethicone? Which I gather from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/?st=JGTIBFB0&sh=8c65316e) that it can be hard to wash off but does not cause a build up. I have briefly looked up the rest of the ingredients and they don‚Äôt seem to have serious red flags (except maybe the parabens). Is it still ok to use for cowash?\n\nI plan to shampoo with a sulfate-free shampoo once a week.",

    "body": "Deep conditioning is a best practice to incorporate into your hair routine. Even if you feel your hair is not damaged, deep conditioners still help maintain healthy looking hair over time. Choosing how often to deep condition and which products to use can be a challenge. Deep conditioners go by many names, but are often thicker and heavier in their ingredient concentration.\n\n(This is the entire text from my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-deep-conditioning-your-hair.html))\n\n**What hair types and styles need deep conditioning?**\n\n* Long hair that feels dry\n* Chemically altered hair (examples: hair that has been lightened, permed, relaxed)\n* Naturally dry hair\n* [Damaged hair](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---damage.html)\n* [Hair with frizz](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---frizz.html)\n* Swimmers that expose their hair to chlorine often\n* Beach lovers with sun-bleached hair\n* People with hard water, or who use well water\n* Anyone who frequently uses high heat to style their hair (ex: flat iron)‚Äã\n\n**What is the goal of a deep conditioning treatment for hair?**  \n‚ÄãThe two goals here are (1) hydration and (2) slip. Both help with the appearance and overall longevity of your hair's strands.¬†  \n\n\nHydration\n\n* Silky, flexible strands (versus dry, brittle ones) with more shine\n* Smooth¬†ends (versus puffy and frayed)\n* On curly hair - curls that form evenly (versus inconsistently)\n\nSlip\n\n* Reduces¬†[tangling](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-ii---tangles.html)\n* Reduces friction from¬†[traction damage](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---damage.html) (to help hair grow)\n* Reduces[ frizz](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---frizz.html)\n\n**How often should I deep condition?**  \nThis is unique to each person's hair type. Deep conditioning bi-monthly or monthly is common. If your hair is damaged, you can deep condition up to once a week. For more insights on how to fit deep conditioning into your routine, check out my post on [Hair Schedules](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-schedules.html).\n\n**What are the best ingredients for deep conditioners?**  \nBelow I've shared common ingredients you'll find in conditioner and/or deep conditioners. It's helpful to know what these ingredients are in case a company doesn't use the term \"deep conditioner\" on the product label. Other terms used for deep conditioning-related products are:¬† hair treatment, hair tonic, hair lotion and hair masque. You can also check out my post on [Hair Oils](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-oils.html)¬†for more insights on ingredient lists.\n\n* Panthenol\n* Glycerin\n* Amino Acids\n* Peptides\n* Cetyl alcohol or cetyl alcohol\n* Hydrolyzed proteins (ex: wheat, soy, keratin protein)\n* Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine\n* Quaternium-87\n* Behentrimonium Methosulfate\n* Behentrimonium Chloride\n* Dicetyldimonium Chloride\n* Distearyldimonium Chloride\n* Polyquaternium 55\n* Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride¬†\n* Polyquaternium-44¬†\n* Cetrimonium Bromide\n* Cetrimonium Chloride\n* Palmitamidopropyltrimonium Chloride\n* Laurdimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed¬†\n* Polyquaternium-4\n* Polyquaternium-10\n\n**How should you deep condition your hair?**  \nI've listed the process I recommend to my clients to help them get the best hydration and slip below.\n\n* Shampoo twice with clarifying shampoo, or use a regular shampoo plus a detox treatment, and¬†rinse well.\n* Ring out most of the water from your hair, and/or soak it up with a towel.\n* Apply conditioner or deep conditioner from roots-to-ends.\n* Massage conditioner and water into your¬†hair. Good coverage equals a better result. This can look like a combination of the¬†techniques below. You can read more about the squeezing and scrunching¬†technique [here](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a37304107/squish-to-condish/) in Cosmopolitan.\n   * untangling\n   * working in sections\n   * pressing root to tip\n   * gentle squeezing\n   * scrunching\n   * combing\n   * gathering all the hair together‚Äã\n* Let the deep conditioner sit for between 10-20 minutes on¬†thicker hair or¬†5 - 10 minutes on¬†finer hair.\n* Dunk hair in¬†water using a sink or cup, or just quickly rewet in the shower.\n* Use the techniques listed¬†above to press more water into the hair.\n* Do a final rise. On drier hair, this can be a quick rinse that leaves more conditioner residue.¬†On finer hair, you'll want to do a more thorough rinse to prevent the deep conditioner from weighing your hair down.¬†\n* Add leave-in products.\n* End with drying and/or styling¬† method of your choice:\n   * ‚ÄãAir dry (avoid this method if it will take more than one hour to dry)\n   * Diffuse or blowdry with¬†cold air\n   * Diffuse or blowdry with hot air and¬†[heat protection](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-protecting-your-hair-from-heat-damage.html)\n\n**Can you over-condition hair?**  \nIf you are experiencing hair that appears:\n\n* limp, flat or heavy\n* to have build up or residue\n* straighter than you'd like\n* greasy or too shiny\n\nthen you could be over-conditioning. Try cutting back on the amount of deep conditioning treatments in your routine, switching conditioners to one that is for volume, or lightly shampooing after you condition.

I see that the Sea Mineral Moisture deep conditioner has dimethicone in it too. \n\nOGX Argan Creme shampoo ingredients\n\n    Water , Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate , Cocamidopropyl Betaine , PPG-2 Hydroxyethyl Coco/Isostearamide , Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate , Glycol Distearate , PEG-12 Dimethicone , Hydrogenated Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil , PEG-23M , Polyquaternium-10 , Laureth-4 , Laureth-23 , PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate , Dimethicone , Fragrance , Diazolidinyl Urea , Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate , Tetrasodium EDTA , Yellow 5CI 19140 , Yellow 6CI 15985        \n\nOuidad Climate Control gel ingredients\n\n    Water (Aqua), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A), Panthenol (Provitamin B5), Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Actinidia Chinensis (Kiwi) Fruit Extract, Lawsonia Inermis (Henna) Leaf Extract, Wheat Amino Acids, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein/PVP Crosspolymer, Propylene Glycol, PEG-60 Almond Glycerides, Dimethicone Copolyol, Dimethicone, Polyquaternium-28, Glycerin, PPG-26-Buteth-25, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PVP/DMAPA Acrylates Copolymer, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Fragrance (Parfum), Methylparaben, DMDM Hydantoin, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone\n\nOGX Sea Mineral Moisture shampoo ingredients\n\n     WATER (AQUA), Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Deep Sea Minerals, Green Algae, Sea Kelp, Albumen, Panthenol, Dimethicone, Amodimethicone, Glycol Stearate, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-6, Polyquaternium-10, Laureth-4, Laureth-23, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cetrimonium Chloride, Trideceth-12, Tetrasodium Edta, Sodium Chloride, Fragrance, Citric Acid, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThanks for your help!

This is not a problem if you're happy with the way your hair looks, but if you want to change your hair colour it can take quite a while to get the red out of your hair. This is because henna creates a coating around your hair, and the longer you use it, the harder it becomes for other products (hair dye and sometimes even conditioner) to reach the hair. So definitely read about it before you use it, but with proper care, everything should be fine.",

Here is [a guide](http://www.mehandi.com/shop/hairindigo/black.pdf) on that. I haven't verified this but the lady who runs the website is doing her doctoral research in henna.\n\n[One of the blogs](http://blog.hennaart.ca/2013/10/natural-or-chemical-dye.html) I follow mentioned this:\n> Unfortunately, there are people out there that take advantage of consumers and market products that are not pure henna.  Many companies offer compound henna dyes that may contain metallic salts and chemical additives.  These can damage your hair or worse, react with a previous chemical dye.  \n\n[This page](http://www.hennaforhair.com/science/whatsinit.html) talks about marketed henna that may not be the real deal especially with metallic salts. \n\nGood luck with all of this, and let me know what you end up doing and how it turned out!",

There's a cleanser called \"Sham-Free Hair and Scalp Cleanser\" ($30 for 12oz.), a conditioner for all curl types called \"Terms and Conditions\" ($34 for 12 oz.) and a tone-correcting product for light-colored and grey hair called \"With or Without Hue\" ($36 for 12 oz.). I'm going to talk about the cleanser and the conditioner because I'm not very knowledgeable about tone correcting or color-treated hair. \n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\nSHAM-FREE: Aqua (Water/ Eau), Cetyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Chloride, Phyllanthus Emblica Fruit Extract, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Polyquaternium-7, Menthol, Selaginella Lepidophylla Extract, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Phyllostachis Bambusoides Leaf Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Oil, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone.\n\nTERMS & CONDITIONS: Aqua (Water/ Eau), Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Stearalkonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Selaginella Lepidophylla Extract, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Panthenol, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Phyllostachis Bambusoides Leaf Extract, Sodium PCA, Phyllanthus Emblica Fruit Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Oil, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone.\n\nI do think the ingredients look very promising. The conditioner seems to be great for curly and very curly hair but from the look of the INCI might weigh wavy hair down? Thoughts?\n\nPRICE:\nThese products are pretty expensive. DevaCurl products are usually around $25 for 12 oz. I suppose this is understandable because this is a one-woman enterprise. However, what doesn't help is the...\n\nSHIPPING:\nCurrently, the shipping is $9~ via USPS. Which is really a bummer because it bumps up the price of the already expensive products. However, it looks like curl-friendly salons might start selling them? Which would be helpful to at least those of us who live close to one. Or maybe curly girls who live in the same area could split the shipping among themselves?\n\nPACKAGING:\nThese products come in a soft plastic bag with a nozzle. These look cute but I don't know how easy they would be to use in the shower. For that price, maybe there should have at least been bottles?\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nI have been following Massey's updates about her line and am enthusiastic about the products. Just looking at the INCI I can tell they are very well formulated. However, the price might be prohibitive for quite a few of us.",

This led me to this subreddit and now I have been researching various ingredients in haircare. \n\nI would still like to use silicones in my hair but was wondering whether alkyl-quaternized ammonium salts (behentrimonium chloride, cetrimonium chloride, etc.) can be used with amodimethicone. I believe these are cationic surfactants so would they not be suitable in conjunction with amodimethicone as it would cause buildup?

However, the conditioner I want to try has many of those and amodimethicone in it. \n\nThese are the ingredients in Davines Love Curl conditioner: \n\nAQUA / WATER / EAU, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, GLYCERIN, BEHENTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, CETYL ALCOHOL, CETRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, DIMETHICONE, ORYZA SATIVA CERA / ORYZA SATIVA (RICE) BRAN WAX, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL, BENZYL ALCOHOL, DICAPRYLYL ETHER, PANTHENOL, PARFUM / FRAGRANCE, LAURYL ALCOHOL, AMODIMETHICONE, HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE, DISODIUM EDTA, SODIUM BENZOATE, POLYQUATERNIUM-10, CITRIC ACID, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS SEED EXTRACT / PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND) SEED EXTRACT, TOCOPHEROL, TRIDECETH-12, LIMONENE.\n\nSorry this is a lengthy post, but would just live to clear it up!",

The user reports in the internet (and I mean mainly rosaceagroup.org) report almost all better results then with Kataconazol. Only problem with Climbazole is that AFAIK you can not really buy OTC products in USA, because the FDA did not allow it's use (or made no rules I think -> not allowed to sell products with it), but there is no problem in importing the things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe thing that makes System 4 Clibmazole Scalp Tonic so interesting for me is not just climbazole (other active is piroctone olamine) , but it is a leave on product (what is much much better then a rinse product like a shampoo) & for me doesn't make my scalp dry, like many shampoos do & the hair do not look oily after applying & is easy to apply. So you can wash your hair with a really mild shampoo (e.g. a baby shampoo that is Malassezia safe without heavy sulfates, I now ordered  Bioderma ABCDerm Shampoo, hope i will get it today). The only bad thing is it really doesn't smell very good. And that you do not know the concentrations of the actives, but climbazole & piroctone olamine is effective in really really small amounts when it is a leave on product, so probably there will be enough in it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI plan to use this Tonic every day till all the Malassezia is gone on my scalp, then just every-some-days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy the way the whole line does look not so bad, with a lot of different products for different types of hair/scalp: [https://sim.fi/en-system4](https://sim.fi/en-system4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly I don't know how you guys in America order this the best, I am from Austria and ordered from nicebeauty.com. In Europe it should not be such a big problem, it is a company from Finnland.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:  Aqua, Alcohol Denat., Polyquaternium-28, Cetrimonium Chloride, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Climbazole, Piroctone Olamine, Salicylic Acid, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Propylene Glycol, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Menthol\n\nSo also Salicylic Acid for exfoliation.

    "body": "This is literally driving me crazy. I've more or less always had great hair, but in my 20's (I'm 26 now) I learned a routine that took care of it well. I'm not trying to boast or whatever, but every time I go to the salon I always get comments on the amazing condition of my hair. In the past four months or so for literally no reason, my hair is now *awful*.\n\nBackground:\n\nI have virgin waist length straight hair (fairly thick), I never do more than blowdry on low, or flat iron curl at 350 with heat protectant spray. I do a big cut once a year with trims in between. Before this happened, I was using Lush's honey I washed my hair shampoo bar with OGX's coconut milk conditioner and it was great. I wash every 3-5 days, only shampoo my scalp and roots where excess oils and product builds up and only condition the lengths of my hair. I'm not on birth control or any new medications. I live in a city with soft water, some of the best water quality in the world actually (Vancouver) and have lived here for five years. \n\nThe problem:\n\nI literally can barely get my fingers through my hair. It feels weighed down and film-y almost. I'm used to being able to go days without having to brush my hair, now it's like it's permanently tangled. It feels \"clean\" in the shower, but then it just sucks to manage as it gets dry. I can almost feel my hair tangling in the shower, it's like it's got no \"slip\" at all. I put in a golf ball size of conditioner every time. :/ My scalp is also a little more itchy than usual.\n\nWhat I've tried:\n\nClarifying with dish soap to completely strip my hair\n\nCutting out **all** protein containing products for two months to eliminate possible protein overload\n\nNot washing my hair for two weeks to reset everything\n\nCo-washing only with protein free conditioner\n\n  \nNothing works, and I'm getting pretty upset about this. It's been four months and I just can't fix my hair! The only thing that changed was I moved to a new apartment in December, roughly around when the problem started. But like I said, hard water in my city just doesn't exist. Could there still be something wrong with the water in my building? I'm desperate enough to try washing my hair with bottled water to see if it helps.  \n\n\nI'm currently using Lush's Jason and the argan oil shampoo bar and Inecto Naturals argan oil conditioner. I still shampoo only my roots, and only every 3-5 days. I also use batiste dry shampoo between washes sometimes. Here's the ingredients for each:\n\nShampoo - Sodium Lauryl Sulfate , Agar Agar (Gelidium Cartilagineum) , Water (Aqua) , Argan Oil (Argania spinosa) , Glycerine , Fragrance , Rose Absolute (Rosa damascena) , Geranium Oil (Pelargonium graveolens) , Rose Oil (Rosa damascena) , Sicilian Lemon Oil (Citrus limonum) , \\*Limonene , Coumarin , Citronellol , Geraniol , Red 33 \n\nConditioner - Aqua, cetearyl alcohol, cetrimonium chloride, Stearalkonium chloride, argan spinosa (Argan), kernel oil, parfum, stearyl alcohol, isopropyl, sodium benzoate, citric acid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've done hours of research, but I can't really find anything on my problem. I'm hoping someone here might have some insight because I don't know what to do at this point besides mourn my hair.",

Next time try a clarifying shampoo or even a tea tree oil shampoo. \nNot shampooing your hair won't help you either, that's allowing your hair to build up oils. \nIf you use sprays or waxes maybe eliminate them for awhile to prevent buildup. Only shampoo every second or third day. \n\nI'm gonna suggest getting a tea tree oil shampoo (I'm suggesting not drug store because the shampoos they sell are most like made of fillers like wax) and maybe some argan oil or a leave in conditioner to put only on the ends of your hair, away from the scalp. \n\nAlso consider getting a haircut soon, being able to feel and see your hair makes it easier to give advice. Researching on the internet is tricky bc a lot of the \"tips\" i see on instagram or those beauty blogs are often wrong about some things which is why i truly suggest talking to your hairdresser.",

I use a lot of moisturizer and oils on my hair.  I'm 4c so my hair probably behaves differently than many of you.  Mechanical cleaning with a brush is not an option for me, though I will occasionally use a goat hair brush to distribute sebum...does it?  Still not sure.\n\nI'm considering getting a soap bar (which I'd purchase), but I think that it could be fun making a cleanser myself, hence the question about these foaming surfactants.  Is this a DIY itch that I can scratch and still stay nopoo?\n\nI should add that I also use yucca root regularly and soapwort root sometimes.  Natural and slightly bubbly, but not I'm not sure if they're enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA:  Descriptions of each\n\nFoaming Oats (Sodium¬†Lauryl Oat Amino Acids) is a very mild anionic surfactant, containing 28% - 32%  active matter.¬† It has a very soft foam, making it a great choice for  foaming facial cleansers.¬† It is also a great choice for shampoos and  micellar waters.¬† With it's neutral pH (6.5 to 7.5), it will not sting  the eyes.\n\nFoaming silk (Sodium Cocoyl Hydrolyzed Silk Protein) is made from hydrolyzed pure silk fibers. This amber brown  liquid¬†is perfect for mild cleansing with its natural lathering  abilities. ¬†Excellent in hair care, skin and facial products.¬†\n\nFoaming Apple ( Sodium Cocoyl¬†Apple Amino Acids) is a very mild anionic surfactant, containing 29% - 34%  active matter.¬† It has the same lacy glove foam as Foaming Silk, making  it a great choice for foaming facial cleansers.¬† It is also a great  choice for shampoos and micellar waters.¬† With it's neutral pH (6.5 to  7.5), it will not sting the eyes.

My main troubleshooting technique is to find the heart of the real problem and I'm wondering what yours is. Why are you wanting a foaming cleanser? What are the needs you have in your routine that it could help with? You said you aren't sure if soapwort and yucca are foaming enough. What do you mean by that? \n\nCan you explain more about your routine? I haven't seen many people here with type 4 hair and I'm very interested! My understanding is that those with type 4 often don't produce much sebum, and what they do is difficult to spread. It certainly needs much more moisture, protein and heavy oils to help seal it.\n\nHave you considered using a comb instead of a brush? I vastly prefer mine, it flows through my curls sooo much easier than brushing and it cleans and spreads sebum very well.\n\nI saw a video once of a type 4c who did only water washing. She did scalp massage both dry and wet, and then would finger preen, not to remove sebum but to spread it. She did mention that it took a long time to spread it, but that she could feel it when it finally did. She called her hair 'anti-gravity' hair, and I've honestly loved the phrase and the hair type since. She discussed how much better her hair felt and how it held the curl definition more. I don't recall whether she did anything more, like moisture treatments, but I imagine she must have because even my 3b curls get dry without then. \n\nI've been interested in learning more about how type 4 can do natural haircare ever since then. I know it's possible because everyone did it before modern product took over the world, but it has even more specialized needs than type 3 curls do.",

    "body": "So far I co-washed two times.\n\nFirst time I did it the lush way - massage with water, put significant amount of conditioner on scalp, massage, wash, put significant amount of conditioner on hair from roots to ends, wait, wash. The hair was clean, I think it was too clean, there was more resistance when brushing vs after shampoo washing, there was significantly more hair left on my hands (and on the brush when brushing too I think) when applying the product. I think the hair was somewhat sticky and waxy, but not too much.\n\nThe second time I did it the easy way - massage with water, put significant amount of conditioner on scalp, massage (and in the process get a bit on the hair and ends too), wait, wash. The hair was clean enough (not shampoo-clean, but I think that's better for my hair and for my scalp's accomodation). There was more resistance when brushign vs after shampoo washing (and I think also vs the first co-wash). There too was significantly more hair left on my hands when applying the product, but because it was applied only once it was this much less hair loss. My hair is sticky, waxy. It looks good, but feels really bad, because of the stickiness.\n\nI used warm water.\n\nTo put this into perspective, if I brush my hair downwards while leaning down, the hair will literally stay in the air afterwards as if I gelled it or something. This effect is present to some extent after I shampoo-wash too, but not this extremely. It's also quite difficult to brush in the first place.\n\nThe conditioner somewhat sticks to the hair even while washing with it, the consistency of conditioner is gluey, sticky, it doesn't make my fingers run through my hair with conditioner applied run buttery smoothly, but rather the complete opposite, I'm scared of pulling my hair out this way... No hair loss when rinsing it off. \n\nMy scalp is also itchy as fuck now. My guess is the preservatives Methylchloroisothiazolinone and Methylisothiazolinone are to blame, but the thing is the shampoo has them too, so maybe not and the waxiness or whatever (co-washing in general) causes this?\n\nI'm pretty certain that the conditioner causes this. I didn't use any other product. When I wash with just shampoo from the same brand (it's SLES based, but it's the opposite of potent, I take few times more of it to achieve the same potency that normal SLS shampoos have, could be the conditioner is similarly \"potent\") and either don't use any other product or only few drops of oil it won't be like this and it's pretty much what I want.\n\nThe ingredients of the conditioner:\n> Aqua, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Behentrimonium Chloride, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Propolis Extract, Inula Helenium Extract, Humulus Lupulus Flower Extract, Helianthus Annuus Hybrid Oil, Cera Alba, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Chamomilla Recutita Oil, Geranium Sibiricum Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, PEG-12 Dimethicon, Pinus Sibirica Needle Extract, Pinus Sibirica Seed Oil, Pinus Sibirica Seed Oil Polyglyceryl-6 Esters, Xanthan Gum, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Panthenol, Niacinamid, Ceteareth-20, Citric Acid, Parfum, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, CI 15985, CI 19140, CI 42090, CI 14720.\n\nNote that Cera Alba (Bees wax), Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride (guar gum derivative) and PEG-12 Dimethicon (water-soluble sillicon) are in it. Could it be that the Bees wax is the problem? The two other ingredients are water soluble so shouldn't be... Cera Alba (Bees wax) is also in the shampoo, but probably in smaller quantity.\n\nIngredients of the shampoo:\n> Aqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Cocamide DEA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Propolis Extract*, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Glycine Soja Oil, Urtica Dioica Extract*, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Water*, Althaea Officinalis Root Extract*, Salvia Officnalis Oil, Carum Carvi Fruit Oil, Mel*, Saponaria Officinalis Root Extract*, Cera Alba, Panthenol, Niacinamid, Citric Acid, Parfum, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Benzyl Salicylate, Hexyl Cinnamal, CI 15985, CI 19140, CI 42090, CI 14720.\n\nShould I buy another conditioner, keep on using this one or switch to non-harsh shampoo? If I should switch conditioner, what ingredients should I be looking for except no wax and sillicon? No oils? Other surfactants (glucosides instead of kationic chlorides)? Something more oily? Something very minimalistic (just kationic surfactans like cetrimonium chloride and humectants like cetearyl alcohol)? Something with more humectants?  I wouldn't be super happy buying another conditioner just to find out it's trash and I have nothing to do with it.\n\nEdit: My hair is ~5inch/13cm long.",

        "body": "I'm no expert and this is just personal experience over the past several years but I would try an SLS-free shampoo & silicon-/wax-free conditioner to see if that helps. It sounds more like an issue with the conditioner ingredients or other products sticking to your hair and scalp then not getting washed out with the co-wash so it builds up on your hair more and more. I tried many conditioners to co-wash and also water-only but neither worked for me. My hair ended up stringy, heavy and waxy though not as quickly as you have experienced. I have very hard water where I live which can also add to the problem.  You can also look into an apple cider vinegar rinse as an alternative (lots of info on the side-bar).\n\nI have had good success with SLS-free shampoo plus silicon-free conditioner every second wash or so. I only have to wash it once a week with water-only rinses as needed in between washes and my scalp is much less itchy and dry than when I was using regular shampoo or co-washing. When particularly dry and itchy, I use jojoba oil on my scalp as a mask/cleanse before I shower, massage it in well, leave it on for 5-10 minutes then wash out . This also helps with any build-up of product on my scalp.\n\nIt will probably take some trial and error to find out what works for you and a bit of time for your scalp to transition. You may also need to use a clarifying shampoo to get rid of all the build-up on your hair before starting over to give you a clean start but not everyone needs that step.",

Iirc polyquats are even more difficult to remove than amodimethicone, but why bother? These ingredients impart shine and smoothness and are somewhat protective (among other things). Your hair does not contain living cells and does not require nutrients to be delivered into the inner core, nor does it require water inside the hair shaft. In fact, from my research less water in the hair shaft is ideal. So a layer of emollients will do more good than harm imo.\n\n\nObviously buildup will occur after some time, and when this occurs you can always use a clarifying shampoo. I was strictly no sulfates/silicones for a few years for my curly hair. Nowadays knowing the science behind things, I don't understand the movement.",

        "body": "There seems to be some disagreement about which cleansers remove which silicones. Amodimethicone is definitely one of the harder silicones to remove. My shampoo has that same cleanser, and some people describe it as essentially a sulfate while others say it's the most stripping of the non-sulfates but still weaker. If it were me, I would go by how my hair feels. If your hair seems gunky, sticky, or like it won't detangle the way it normally would, you can throw in a suave daily clarifying wash. If not, maybe your hair just likes being coated in silicone (or the shampoo is cleaning adequately) and you don't have to worry about it. The other thing to watch out for is that those heavy silicones tend to prevent oils from getting to your hair, so if you feel like your hair is really dry, or like the texture of it when unconditioned is getting worse, that may be a sign to switch conditioners or at least do a sulfate wash and use a silicone-free deep conditioner before you resume using the amodimethicone one.",

I've already switched to a SLS, silicone, and paraben free shampoo for the past 7 months or so.\n\nI'm 18, male, and my family doesn't have a history of seborrheic dermatisis (but I inherited \"hives\" from my father's side, so most of my body and sometimes face gets hives once in a while). My scalp doesn't redden anyway so that's probably irrelevant. I haven't experienced anything with my scalp until about April of 2015 where I just started getting white flakes (along with hormonal acne, etc.). It's almost been 2 years and I can't seem to get rid of it permanently. I live in a humid, polluted urban area in Southeast Asia. I've tried shampooing every other day, every two days, but nothing seems to help calm my scalp and remove the flakes. My hair gets oily when I do no-poo because of the environment that I live in.  I've used Head and Shoulders, CLEAR (Asian Brand), and many anti-dandruff shampoos, but it worsened if not did nothing for my itchy scalp. I don't consume meat (pescatarian), and eat a lot of carbs, veggies, fruits and moderate amounts of seafood, if diet has anything to do with my scalp balance. I've tried VCO, ACV, and none of them have helped as well. Nizoral, I did try, it kept my scalp in check for a couple of days, and then it went back to showing visible white flakes. I just used Nizoral to calm the itchiness as we speak. I don't know whether it's dandruff or a dry scalp. Here's a picture of my scalp if any of you could help\n\nThese are the ingredients of the shampoo that I've been using for the past 6 months. aqua (water), sodium cocoyl isethionate (coconut-derived), decyl glucoside (coconut-derived), sodium lactate (sugarcane-derived), sodium gluconate (sugarcane-derived), glycerin (vegetable-derived), Cocos nucifera (virgin coconut) oil, dicaprylyl ether (vegetable-derived), Persea gratissima (avocado) oil, olus (vegetable) oil, Aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf juice, guar gum, levulinic acid (rice or corn-derived), Mentha piperita (peppermint) essential oil, Mentha arvensis (corn mint) essential oil, coco glucoside (coconut-derived) , glyceryl oleate (coconut -derived), xanthan gum, charcoal (bamboo-derived), phytic acid (rice-derived), anisic acid (anise seed-derived), citric acid\n\nThis is my conditioner: aqua (water), cetearyl alcohol (vegetable-derived), cetrimonium chloride (vegetable-derived), Persea gratissima (avocado) oil, olus (vegetable) oil, Helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, Glycine soja (soybean) oil, capryloyl glycerin/sebacic acid copolymer (vegetable-derived), diheptyl succinate (vegetable-derived), Aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf juice, hydroxypropyltrimonium honey, hydrolyzed wheat protein, levulinic acid (rice or corn-derived), fragrance (all-natural), anisic acid (anise seed-derived) (I've tried co-washing once, but it didn't seem to help. I place the conditioner for around 5 minutes long)\n\nThese are local shampoos, under the brand \"Human Nature\"\n\nI would REALLY appreciate anyone's help here. It's embarassing because I have to wear specific light clothing, I've been wearing a cap lately just to prevent flaking from being seen. Should I:\n-buy a natural, imported/from the U.S./Europe shampoos like Rahua?\n-buy a mild (medium level: half synthetic, half natural) shampoo?\n-apply argan oil, or other oils\n-or just go to the dermatologist and get a medicated shampoo?\n\nPlease please help me.

    "body": "Hair Care History:  \nI have been using low-sulfate silicone-free shower gels as shampoo for a couple of months already while not using any conditioner. I only restarted using conditioner last Tuesday, because I finally found a 'cone-free conditioner. I can go almost a week without needing to wash my hair, is that a good sign?   \nMy sister has been using high-sulfate shampoos containing a bunch of 'cones, occasionally shampoos containing keratin as well, and accompanying conditioners. I think she might need a few more shampoo washes to get out all of the build-up out of her hair, but I'd love some advice here!  \n  \nHair Properties:  \nI was born with a full head of wavy/soft curl hair and have had waves and/or brushed out curls ever since my hair was long enough to be brushed. I always thought my hair was super frizzy, because it looked so unkempt after all the brushing I did. I found a kind of routine to keep it manageable: brushing while it was still damp after a shower would help form flatter and larger waves, so it would stay closer to my head.  \nI think my curl pattern right now is about 2b, but I think I might have some 2c potential, looking at some of my new-found curls. My hair is somewhere between medium and fine. The strands are somewhat thin, but they aren't brittle and my hair holds shape pretty well if I don't mess with it. I don't think it's very porous. I did the [Slip'n'Slide test](http://www.naturallycurly.com/texture-typing/hair-porosity) and that went about as smoothly going up as going down. My hair is medium-long, going a bit past shoulder length.  \nMy sister was born with curly hair, but has lost those curls by constantly brushing them out. She has what I think are a lot of flyaways on the top of her head, probably in part caused by curl-unfriendly hair cutting techniques. My sister has had her hair thinned out in the past, which I think is mostly cutting certain strands of hair shorter than others with the goal to remove volume. But I think in her case it had an opposite effect, the shortest hairs have the most curl and now they stand away from her head. What kind of styling product would she need to deal with these flyaways? There could also be some frizz involved.  \nMy sister's curl pattern is closer to 3a/b if you give her hair a chance to curl. Before CG it looked more like 2a. Her hair likes to form medium-sized ringlets. I think her hair is somewhat coarse, it is very thick and she has a lot of hair. Her hair holds shape better than mine, if she twists her hair into a ringlet with her fingers it will stay in that shape for hours. Her hair is very long, slightly past bra band length. Her hair feels more porous than mine doing the same test, but I‚Äôm not sure how to distinguish between medium and high porosity. Her hair is very dry. She has a lot of split ends and is probably in desperate need of a hair cut, but I'm not sure if that's wise to do now that we're adjusting our routines. Advice?  \n  \nCurrent Routine:  \n*Shampoo * : Sanex Advanced Dermo Repair (this is technically a shower gel)  \nIngredients: Aqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Coco-Glucoside, Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Sodium Chloride, Glyceryl Oleate, Parfum, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Salicylate, Polyquaternium-7, Allantoin, Caprylyl Glycol, Zinc Sulfate, Benzoic Acid.   \n*Conditioner * : Argan Care conditioner  \nIngredients: Aqua, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Parfum, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Citric Acid, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Magnesium Nitrate, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool.  \nI‚Äôm planning on running all these ingredients through the ingredient list of Tightly Curly, but if there‚Äôs something in these products that shouldn‚Äôt be in our hair, please let me know!  \n  \nWe used these products on Tuesday, combed our hair with a wide tooth comb after applying a lot of conditioner. Afterwards plopping it with a T-shirt and sleeping with our hair up in pineapple.  \n  \nI have also attempted  a deep treatment using 100% pure coconut oil on Wednesday. After application with a hair paint brush (is there a specific name for these things?) we let it sit under a shower cap and towel for an hour, then applied a bunch of conditioner and combed it through. Then rinsing it out in the shower using shampoo and conditioner, combed again. My sister plopped for 30-60 minutes, I think? And slept with a pineapple. I showered really late, so I slept with T-shirt plopping overnight (only 6,5 hours of sleep).  \n  \nResults?:  \nIt‚Äôs kinda hard to say what product did what, but this method is really working for me so far. Having curls is an immediate boost of confidence for me, because it feels like my hair is finally starting to look how it‚Äôs supposed to look. The problem is that I‚Äôm constantly playing with my curls. I‚Äôll twist them around my fingers, or pull on them to see them bounce. I think I lost quite some definition today because of this. Is there any way to get some of this definition back for second-day curls? Would it help if I scrunch in some water and/or conditioner and/or coconut oil?  \nMy sister had some mixed results. She has more wavish curls, but her hair came out very greasy on Thursday morning. I think she might not have rinsed everything out properly (long hair is a lot of hair), but I was also thinking about some other causes: Is this because of previous buildup? Should she attempt co-washing about every other day until it improves? It seems that washing with the shampoo could be a little harsh to do it so often, but it might be more effective?  \n  \nI would also like to have some advice on dealing with the weather. We live in the Netherlands and basically go everywhere by bicycle, so our hair is exposed to rain, fog and humidity quite often. My hair will attract the moisture and frizz. I‚Äôm not sure how much my sister‚Äôs hair is affected by it, because I find it difficult to distinguish frizz from curly flyaways. Are there any styling products we could use to help deal with this?  \n  \n[Pics!]( http://imgur.com/a/8Rnpj)  \n  \nAnd my final question!: How are we doing so far?  \n  \nTL;DR: Just started CG.  \nMy hair: medium-long, medium-fine, low-porosity, 2b-ish curls. How can I hold on to curl definition for 2nd day curls or bring the definition back? How can I combat weather-induced frizz?  \nMy sister‚Äôs hair: long and thick, coarse, more porous, 3a/b? curls. Only recently stopped using silicones and sulfates, how to ease the transition. Possibly still has some build-up, attempt co-washing more often? Has a lot of flyaways and probably also some frizz, advice on styling product? Needs a haircut, do it now or wait for routine to set in?  \nWe live in the Netherlands and this will influence product options available to us.  \n  \nSorry for the long post, I just wanted to share my excitement!",

I know this seems like a lot of terminology and work, but just keep trying new things, read the posts on naturallycurly.com and you'll get the hang of it in no time.",

    "body": "# Hair Oils\n\nPeople have used oil in hair care regimens for¬†thousands of years. One of the earliest recorded use cases was of the [ancient Egyptians](https://www.arabnews.com/secret-ancient-egyptian-beauty), who applied castor oil to their hair. It wasn't until 1950 that a scholar named Martin Levey suggested using the distillation process to extract¬†oils from plants in [prehistoric Mesopotamia](https://exarc.net/issue-2020-2/ea/ancient-distillation-and-experimental-archaeology). He published his findings in a paper called the [Evidences of Ancient Distillation, Sublimation¬†, and Extraction in Mesopotamia](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0498.1955.tb00466.x). With advances in technology, the¬†distillation process looks different today, but it's generally the same and is how the majority of the oils you use every day are made. In this post, I help you understand the different types of oils and which ones you should be using on your hair.  (This is the full blog but if you want to screenshot the ingredient lists, the post is a bit better organized on my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-recommended-product-ingredients.html))\n\n**Types of Oils**  \n*Plant Oils*  \n[These oils](https://cosmeticsandtoiletries.texterity.com/cosmeticsandtoiletries/june_2021/MobilePagedReplica.action?pm=1&folio=24#pg35) are pressed, crushed, and refined from the fatty portions of a plant or botanical. They are less aromatic and have the ability to sink into your hair shaft, unlike mineral oils, which can make them a more effective moisturizing ingredient depending on your needs.¬†  \n\n\n*Mineral Oils*  \nThese oils are made from¬†petroleum that is¬†[highly refined](https://www.chemicalsafetyfacts.org/mineral-oil/). They have a lower price point¬†compared to plant oils and essential oils, which can influence which brands will include them in product formulas. They're known to create a barrier on the surface of your hair shaft to lock moisture in.  \n\n\n*Essential Oils*  \nThese oils¬†are [distilled](https://www.thezoereport.com/p/oils-vs-essential-oils-the-biggest-differences-the-most-popular-uses-more-19442788) from leaves, roots, bark and other aromatic portions of plants. The distillation process turns the raw ingredients left over into a more concentrated, highly aromatic oil. They're used for their smell and are thought to have therapeutic benefits, but will irritate your skin if not heavily diluted with mineral or plant oils.¬†  \n\n\n*Silicone (not an oil)*  \nWhile not technically an oil, silicone provides conditioning qualities that are similar. There are two types to be aware of: (1) soluble¬†and (2) non-soluble. The main difference between them is that one can be broken down by water and the other cannot, meaning it requires harsher shampoos with surfactants to wash it away after continued use. You can tell the difference between them based on their ingredients, which I've listed below. You can also read more about silicones in my posts [*How Often Should I Shampoo?*](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html) and [*Ingredient Lists*](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-ingredient-lists.html).¬†‚Äã ‚Äã‚Äã\n\n* Non-soluble:¬†Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Amodimethicone, Pheryl trimethicone, Ceteraryl methicone, Dimethiconol, Stearyl dimethicone, Amodimethicone (non-soluble when Trideceth-12 and Cetrimonium Chloride are absent)\n* Soluble: Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone copolyol, Lauryl methicone copolyol, any silicone with PEG as a prefix\n\n**Oils for Hair with High Porosity vs. Low Porosity**¬†  \n‚ÄãFinding the right oil for your hair texture can be challenging, but if you can identify the porosity of your hair it will help guide the process. Genetics and they way you care for your hair are the biggest influencers of its porosity. Styling tools with high heat, coloring, perming and other hair care/services can cause your porosity to change. Although the signs of highly porous hair are not widely considered ‚Äúhealthy looking‚Äù, the benefit for some can be more volume and fullness.  \n\n\nHair with low porosity is considered to be ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù, but it comes with its own challenges. According to the [Science-y Hair Blog](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/oils-which-ones-soak-in-vs-coat-hair.html)¬†‚ÄúIf you have fine or soft hair which is easily over-conditioned, those same oils may make your hair feel greasy and lank unless used in very small amounts. Lower porosity hair may do better with blends of penetrating oils and less-penetrating oils.‚Äù The chart below will help you determine your porosity and show you what oils have been found to \"[penetrate the cortex](https://cosmeticsandtoiletries.texterity.com/cosmeticsandtoiletries/july_august_2021/MobilePagedReplica.action?pm=1&folio=DM5#pg51)\", or the second layer of your hair shaft that sits behind your outer cuticle.

    "body": "[Hair Oils](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-oils.html)\n\nI have been on a search to understand which oils penetrated the hair which does not. I hope you can find the right oil for you too! For me the answer was sunflower. Coconut-derived oil ingredients, which is in most products, do not work as well for my hair. This is the entire blog post but if you would rather see it a bit more organized check out [Hair Oils](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-oils.html). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Types of Oils**  \n*Vegetable Oils*  \n[These oils](https://cosmeticsandtoiletries.texterity.com/cosmeticsandtoiletries/june_2021/MobilePagedReplica.action?pm=1&folio=24#pg35) are pressed, crushed and refined from the fatty portions of a plant or botanical. They are less aromatic and have the ability to sink into your hair shaft, unlike mineral oils, which can make them a more effective moisturizing ingredient depending on your needs.¬†  \n\n\n*Mineral Oils*  \nThese oils are made from¬†petroleum that is¬†[highly refined](https://www.chemicalsafetyfacts.org/mineral-oil/). They have a lower price point¬†compared to vegetable oils and essential oils, which can influence which brands will include them in product formulas. They're known to create a barrier on the surface of your hair shaft to lock moisture in.  \n\n\n*Essential Oils*  \nThese oils¬†are [distilled](https://www.thezoereport.com/p/oils-vs-essential-oils-the-biggest-differences-the-most-popular-uses-more-19442788) from leaves, roots, bark and other aromatic portions of plants. The distillation process turns the raw ingredients left over into a more concentrated, highly aromatic oil. They're used for their smell and are thought to have therapeutic benefits, but will irritate your skin if not heavily diluted with mineral or vegetable oils.¬†  \n\n\n*Silicone (not an oil)*  \nWhile not technically an oil, silicone provides conditioning qualities that are similar. There are two types to be aware of: (1) soluble¬†and (2) non-soluble. The main difference between them is that one can be broken down by water and the other cannot, meaning it requires harsher shampoos with surfactants to wash it away after continued use. You can tell the difference between them based on their ingredients, which I've listed below. You can also read more about silicones in my posts [*How Often Should I Shampoo?*](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html) and [*Ingredient Lists*](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-ingredient-lists.html).¬†‚Äã ‚Äã‚Äã\n\n* Non-soluble:¬†Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Amodimethicone, Pheryl trimethicone, Ceteraryl methicone, Dimethiconol, Stearyl dimethicone, Amodimethicone (non-soluble when Trideceth-12 and Cetrimonium Chloride are absent)\n* Soluble: Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone copolyol, Lauryl methicone copolyol, any silicone with PEG as a prefix\n\n**Oils for Hair with High Porosity vs. Low Porosity**¬†  \n‚ÄãFinding the right oil for your hair texture can be challenging, but if you can identify the porosity of your hair it will help guide the process. Genetics and they way you care for your hair are the biggest influencers of its porosity. Styling tools with high heat, coloring, perming and other hair care/services can cause your porosity to change. Although the signs of highly porous hair are not widely considered ‚Äúhealthy looking‚Äù, the benefit for some can be more volume and fullness.  \n\n\nHair with low porosity is considered to be ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù, but it comes with its own challenges. According to the [Science-y Hair Blog](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/oils-which-ones-soak-in-vs-coat-hair.html)¬†‚ÄúIf you have fine or soft hair which is easily over-conditioned, those same oils may make your hair feel greasy and lank unless used in very small amounts. Lower porosity hair may do better with blends of penetrating oils and less-penetrating oils.‚Äù The chart below will help you determine your porosity and show you what oils have been found to \"[penetrate the cortex](https://cosmeticsandtoiletries.texterity.com/cosmeticsandtoiletries/july_august_2021/MobilePagedReplica.action?pm=1&folio=DM5#pg51)\", or the second layer of your hair shaft that sits behind your outer cuticle. Your porosity level is a good thing to keep in mind when¬†searching for new hair products.\n\n**Signs of Hair with**¬†**High Porosity****Signs of Hair with**¬†**Low¬†Porosity**\n\nHair that is:¬†\n\n* Dry, rough and /or dull\n* Full with volume\n* Coarser than usual (generally on the ends)\n* Tangling easily\n* Experiencing breakage\n* Air drying¬†within 15¬†minutes\n* Soaking up oil-based products quickly¬†\n\nFor oil treatments, use¬†**penetrating oils**¬†on your ends¬† and a¬†**mix of less penetrating oils plus penetrating oils**¬†from your roots to mid hair shaft\n\nHair that is:\n\n* Smooth and sleek\n* Flat and lacking volume\n* Heavier¬†with a¬†slick/greasy feel\n* Easily combed or brushed¬†\n* Not experiencing breakage\n* Taking 30¬†minutes or more to air dry\n* Unable to soak up oil-based products easily\n\n‚Äã  \nFor oil treatments, mix¬†¬†**penetrating**¬†and¬†¬†**less penetrating**¬†oils.  \n‚Äã  \n‚Äã*Sources:*¬†[*Enhancing Hair Health: Effects of Oiling, Inside and Out - Part I*](https://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/research/literature-data/article/21836362/cosmetics-and-toiletries-magazine-enhancing-hair-health-effects-of-oiling-inside-and-outpart-i)*, Cosmetics & Toiletries*  \n[*Enhancing Hair Health: Effects of Oiling, Inside and Out - Part II*](https://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/research/literature-data/article/21836386/cosmetics-and-toiletries-magazine-enhancing-hair-health-effects-of-oiling-inside-and-outpart-ii)*,¬†Cosmetics & Toiletries*  \n[*Oils - Which Ones Soak in vs. Coat the Hair?*](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/oils-which-ones-soak-in-vs-coat-hair.html)*, Science-y Hair Blog*  \n[*Beginner's Guide to Ingredients in Natural Hair Products*](https://www.texturedtalk.com/how-to-understand-ingredients-in-natural-hair-products/) *, Textured Talk*  \n[*15 Scientific Names for Common Ingredients in Natural Hair Products*](http://www.1blessednatural.com/2015/10/15-scientific-names-for-common-ingredients-natural-hair-products.html)*, 1Blessed¬† Natural Mag*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Penetrating Oils**‚Äã\n\nCoconut *(Cocos Nucifera)*¬†Oil¬†  \n‚ÄãSunflower¬†*(Helianthus Annuus)*¬†Seed Oil¬†Olive *(Olea Europaea)* Oil\n\n  \n**Less Penetrating Oils**\n\nArgan *(Argania Spinosa)*\n\n**Not Recommended** \n\nMineral Oil¬†  \nJojoba *(Simmondsia Chinensis)* Oil",

The collection is currently sold exclusively at Target, both in stores and online. The line contains 18 products and is not designed to be exclusive to any hair type.\n[Five beauty editors at Allure](https://www.allure.com/story/tph-hair-taraji-p-henson-review) ‚Äì including three who have Type 4 hair ‚Äì tested the products and had complimentary things to say.\n\n##Product Details\n* __Price:__ $9.99 + tax for 12 oz. (355 mL)\n* __Hair Type:__ Curly & Coily\n* __Appearance:__ White conditioner\n* __Texture:__ Thick (maintains shape when poured); non-greasy feeling\n* __Scent:__ Light natural scent ‚Äì shea butter, olive oil, sage oil; scent does not linger\n* __Marketing Spiel:__ Hustle & Co is an ultra creamy, suds-free conditioning cleanser that deeply refreshes while moisturizing your coils, curls, and waves. No side hustle (in this case additional conditioner) necessary- Hustle & Co delivers hydrating goodness into your hair without stripping your hair of its natural oils. To use, wet hair and apply a generous amount to hair and scalp. Massage in with your fingertips and rinse. Repeat if needed.\n\n##Ingredients (NOT CG-APPROVED)\nwater (aqua/eau), cetyl alcohol, glycerin, isopropyl palmitate, behentrimonium chloride, ISODODECANE, fragrance (parfum), cetrimonium chloride, AMODIMETHICONE, phenoxyethanol, laureth-4, guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-7, ethylhexylglycerin, panthenol, trideceth-3, trideceth-15, disodium edta, olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, aminomethyl propanol, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, salvia officinalis (sage) oil, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, limonene\n\n###Method\nFor each wash, I poured an Oreo-sized mount of conditioner. I spread the conditioner out over my scalp and massaged vigorously for about two minutes. I then took a paddle detangling brush to spread the conditioner down to my ends and undo knots for somewhere in the 3-5 minute vicinity. I rinsed for about one minute.\n\n##Results & Observations\n * The product spreads super-easily. I got great coverage and had no trouble brushing it down to my ends.\n* While my hair was saturated and even after rinsing*, my hair had a TON of slip and I could have detangled manually if I had wanted.\n* The product absorbs into my hair very quickly. Even  after three washings and trying longer-than-usual rinses, I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure that I had most of it out.\n* I would have expected my Overtone to bleed, but the water rinses out 99.7% clear. My color looks as good as it did on the day I applied it.\n* My hair feels soft and amazing now, wet or dry. \n* My hair is super, *duper* shiny.\n* I‚Äôm getting much better than average volume at the roots, which lasts through my second day.\n* Either I‚Äôm not rinsing well enough or the product is too heavy for my ends to support. I have 2b/2c hair on Day 1 and wake up with 1c hair on Day 2.  (Which I am totally willing to let slide for how nice my hair looks and feels.)\n\n#Conclusion\nI‚Äôm deeply impressed with the salon-like power of this product for its drugstore price. I‚Äôm ready to kick my existing shampoo and leave-in conditioner off the shelf and make TPH a permanent fixture in my shower.",

    "body": "So, 4 months ago i started taking care of my hair by going sulfate/silicone free and buying a water softener for my shower. I Shampoo/Condition my hair 2-3 times a week and dried with a T-shirt. Everything was going great until a week ago where I noticed my hair didn't feel the same anymore. I don't know how to describe it, but it almost feels rough and in need of conditioner? and my ends feel drier that normal. I am not sure whats happening my first thought was damage since I've been growing it out for almost a year without a trim or a cut. Now i'm starting to think that there is some sort of build up? What do you guys think? I have thick wavy/curly hair. Also, how do you know if your hair is moisturized? I always thought soft silky elastic hair = moisturized which is why I am writing this post because it no longer feels soft and silky, it feels rough.\n\nHeres the Shampoo  https://www.makeupalley.com/product/showreview.asp/ItemId=133656/Kirkland-Moisture-Shampoo/Unlisted-Brand/Hair \n\nIngredients: water sodium cocoyl isethionate cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine methyl isethionate disodium cocoyl glutamate sodium lauryl sulfoacetate decyl glecoside ammonium cocoyl isethionate divinyldimethicond/dimethicone copolymer disodium laureth sulfosuccinate helianthus annus (sunflower) seed oil lycium barbarum fruit extract aloe barbadensis leaf extract camellia sinesis leaf extract cucumis sativus (cucumber) fruit extract persea gratissima (avocado) fruit extract punica granatum extract melanin vitis vinifera (grape) seed extract glycol disterate glycerin fragrance quaternium-91 sodium cocoyl glutamate peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate amodimethicone panthenol polyquaternium-10 ppg-3 benzyl ether myristate chlorphenesin methyl gluceth-20 guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride c11-15 pareth-7 laureth-9 phospholipids hydrolyzed vegetable protein pg-propyl silanetriol c12-13 pareth-23 c12-13 pareth-3 trisodium ethylenediamine disuccinate trideceth-12 superoxide dismutase sodium ascorbyl phosphate tocopheryl acetate methylchloroisothiazolinone methylisothiazolinone\n\nConditioner: http://www.makeupalley.com/product/showreview.asp/ItemId=133657/KIRKLAND-MOISTURE-CONDITIONER/Unlisted-Brand/Hair\n\nIngredients: water cyclopentasiloxane cetearyl alcohol stearyl alcohol cetrimonium chloride behentrimonium methosulfate helianthus annus (sunflower) seed oil lycium barbarum fruit extract aloe barbadensis leaf extract camellia sinesis leaf extract cucumis sativus (cucumber) fruit extract persea gratissima (avocado) fruit extract punica granatum extract melanin vitis vinifera (grape) seed extract helianthus annus (sunflower) seed extract glycereth-26 dimethiconol divinyldimethicone/dimethicone copolymer fragrance gluconolactone cetrimonium bromide panthenol ppg-3 benzyl ether myristate jojoba esters quaternium-91 amodimethicone hydroxyethylcelloulose cetrimonium methosulfate sodium benzoate c11-15 pareth-7 peg-45m laureth-9 aminomethly propanol glycerin butyrospermum parkii ( shea butter) c12-13 pareth-23 c12-13 pareth-3 cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride (sunscreens) trideceth-12 citric acid ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate sodium ascorbyl phosphate butylene glycol hydrolyed soy protein tocopheryl acetate (vitamin e) hydrolyzed vegatable protein pg-propyl silanetriol\n\nedit: Some more info, My hair is just above shoulder length, when i get in the shower i use a wide tooth comb to get rid of knots then i soak my hair with warm water then lather the shampoo all over scalp and from root to end then rinse then i take a huge blob of Conditioner and use it the same way and leave it in for 1-2 minutes then rinse with cold water.\n\nThanks for the help!

        "body": "Lunar Tides (which I use myself and am very experienced with personally) is a true semi-permanent hair color, aka a 'direct dye', which means that it will stain and/or coat your hair hair. It won't hurt your hair at all because it doesn't open your cuticle, like permanent and demi-permanent color processing does. [Here's info from labmuffin on different types of hair color that goes into more detail.](https://labmuffin.com/how-does-hair-dye-work/)\n\nLunar Tides' description is right that it's non-damaging ‚Äî the ingredients indicate an intensive conditioner + color. That's it! So there's no need to wait to color or to use a second conditioner right before or after you apply the color. If you want deeper conditioning (and more intense color) just leave the Lunar Tides color on longer. (Careful though, the color can get pretty intense.)\n\nThe only thing to consider in terms of your hair's condition when applying the color is that you need to make sure you're applying it evenly, so lots of color coats ALL your hair, otherwise, you can get a patchy results. Lunar Tides' instructions will tell you to start with towel dried hair (so, slightly wet) and that helps with even application. You can also start with slightly wetter hair and leave the color on longer (I did this last time, it was fine).",

If your hair has mixed amount of damage (like roots are healthy but ends are fried) it might be a good idea to do a conditioning treatment first so that your hair all soaks up the dye evenly. It won't hurt your hair to skip this, but it might make the color turn out a bit better.",

    "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nI‚Äôm a bit of a haircare/hair science newbie, and I searched the sub and combed through the wiki to try to figure this out myself, but I‚Äôm still at a loss, probably because I just don‚Äôt quite understand which haircare ingredients do what. Anyway, all this to say that I‚Äôm sorry if this has been asked or covered before. I just couldn‚Äôt find it on my own. If there are any posts you think I should refer to, please link it below!\n\n\nI recently tried the Pureology Nanoworks Gold shampoo and conditioner set, and after rinsing out the conditioner, I could immediately tell that my hair felt softer. After drying, my hair was much smoother/less frizzy, had a lot of body, and was the shiniest I‚Äôve ever seen it. My parents, who have never commented on my hair, even said that my hair looked really healthy when we were FaceTiming. Given that the price of the products makes me want to cry, I‚Äôm hoping to get some help in figuring out what exactly is in it that my hair really loves, and I want to see if I can find those ingredients in other shampoos/conditioners. \n\n\nA little bit about my hair:\n\n\nI have thin, low porosity (I think), fine, black hair. My ends are drier and I have a very oily scalp. The oily scalp is very odd to me because I am extremely dry everywhere else on my body, but my scalp has always been oily.\n\n\nI wash and condition my hair every night, wrap in an Aquis microfiber towel for a while, remove the towel, spray It‚Äôs A 10 leave-in lite, then dry my hair with a hairdryer. I‚Äôve tried not washing my hair every day, but it just gets too oily by the second day and my hair gets stringy and looks limp. Sometimes I will use dry shampoo, but I find that it just feels like there‚Äôs a lot of gunk in my hair and I break out on my scalp. \n\n\nFor the past couple of years, I‚Äôve used Matrix Biolage Ultra Hydrasource Shampoo and ultra Hydrasource conditioning balm. I‚Äôve also used the Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo/conditioner set on the days I have to wash dry shampoo out of my hair because I feel like the tea tree helps with the breakouts. For deep conditioning, I used the briogeo don‚Äôt despair repair conditioning mask, but honestly that just felt like an everyday conditioner to me, and I would mix that in with the tea tree conditioner because I didn‚Äôt feel like the Paul Mitchell one did anything for my hair. Currently I‚Äôm using the living proof restore hair mask in the same way. When I ran out of the matrix set, I switched over to the Bondi Boost hair growth shampoo and conditioner because when I finally was able to get a hair cut, my hairdresser told me that I had lost a lot of hair. Although I think it was due to stress and the fact that I couldn‚Äôt go get my hair done because COVID and I live in a different state than my home state for grad school, so my hair got really long and I don‚Äôt think it was very healthy (but it also looked really good after the Pureology set, and it looks even better now that I got a haircut and feel like my hair is a bit healthier than before). The Pureology was used here and there throughout my time with these aforementioned products, mainly because I was trying to make the product last longer, but each time I use it, I notice an immediate difference. \n\n\nPlease let me know if there‚Äôs any other info you need to know about my hair, and thanks in advance for reading this post and for any insight you might have for me!\n\n\nShampoo Infredients:\n\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Glycol Distearate, Divinyldimethicone/Dimethicone Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, Glycereth-26, Panthenol, Parfum/Fragrance, Sodium Chloride, Ppg-5-Ceteth-20, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyquaternium-10, Amodimethicone, Peg-55 Propylene Glycol Oleate, Propylene Glycol, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Carbomer, C11-15 Pareth-7, Benzoic Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter/Shea Butter, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein Pg-Propyl Silanetriol, Laureth-9, Glycerin, C12-13 Pareth-23, Benzyl Alcohol, C12-13 Pareth-3, Trideceth-12, Helianthus Annuus Seed Extract/Sunflower Seed Extract, Magnesium Nitrate, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Acetate, Salicylic Acid, Isopropyl Alcohol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Melanin, Potassium Sorbate, Sorbic Acid, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Pentylene Glycol, Bht, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide.\n\n\nConditioner Ingredients\n\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Amodimethicone, Parfum/Fragrance, Isopropyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Panthenol, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter/Shea Butter, Benzoic Acid, Trideceth-6, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein Pg-Propyl Silanetriol, Potassium Hydroxide, Caramel, Cetrimonium Chloride, Sodium Chloride, Helianthus Annuus Seed Extract/Sunflower Seed Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Potassium Sorbate, CI 15985/Yellow 6, CI 14700/Red 4, BHT, Melanin, Pentylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin.",

I used to use Aussie products and for years 3 Minute Miracle was my go-to conditioner and it always treated me well.  About 1.5 years ago I switched to Nexxus Keraphix because I was hoping to add some weight to my hair.  It has always dried really light and fluffy, if that makes sense.  I liked Keraphix and it did what I was hoping, making my hair feel thicker and heavier.  However in about the last 5 months or so my hair suddenly became REALLY tangly.\n\nWhile I'm washing  and conditioning it it hard to get my fingers through my hair. I know you aren't supposed to brush wet hair, but I used to be able to slide a brush right through with no issues and now when I get out of the shower it is a nightmare getting a comb through it. Even a wide-tooth comb is hard as it knots up right away.  I'm 40 years old and this is a completely brand new thing for me.  I have no idea what is going on.  I have used dry shampoo and leave-in argan oil occasionally as well.  I've tried using a couple other random shampoo/conditioner combos to see if maybe it is the Keraphix for some reason, but the results were the same.  I have also been getting knots in my hair while I sleep which is a new thing, too.  Any thoughts or advice are welcome.  I feel like my hair is ruined!  Below are the Keraphix ingredients in case that is helpful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I've been reading more on the sidebar.

        "body": "I think the problem could be too much protein. Keratin is a protein and there are other proteins as well in those products. When your hair gets too much protein it causes issues- like making it dry, brittle, and tangly. You may consider a moisturizing deep treatment and switch to a shampoo and conditioner that doesn't include keratin or other proteins. Our hair needs the right balance of protein and moisture or it tends to tangle easily. So of course too much moisture can also be an issue so once you get to a balance you may want to rotate your current shampoo and conditioner with a moisturizing one to maintain the balance. \nI wouldn't worry much about brushing it wet. Use a detangling brush and have conditioner or detangler in while brushing. I've got curly hair and when it's wet it literally the only time curly hair can be brushed so that's how we detangle our hair. But once you get your hair balanced you should have an easier time detangling it when dry, assuming your hair is relatively straight.",

    "body": "**Background**\n\nI live in an area with very hard water (Minneapolis), and it‚Äôs definitely been tough on my hair. I had done the Malibu C hard water treatment packets in the past, and found them helpful. My tap water pH is 9 (!!!!! yes, nine!) and contains an average of 3.5 ‚Äì 4.0ppm of chlorine (not sure how that stacks up).\n\n I have caucasian 2a wavy-ish hair that is very fine and splits easily and is very prone to frizz if I don‚Äôt use the right products. It's virgin but damages easily. I almost never blow dry it, and flat iron it occasionally - 1x a week at most. Despite being fine textured, it can take wayyy more product than you would expect. \n\n^(Extra: I was previously using the Cantu shampoo and conditioner, doing a CGM-ish routine, but have decided to switch it up my hair care this year. I think the shampoo caused buildup over time, despite me not using silicones, because I did a single wash with Malibu clarifying shampoo and swimmers treatment and holy hell did it make my hair so much lighter and bouncier! So I‚Äôve decided to stop the CGM and look for a better routine for my hair. (That means anything goes as far as ingredients.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Problem**\n\nI got the Malibu C Hard Water Wellness Shampoo & Conditioner, thinking it would be the answer to all my life‚Äôs problems. I desperately wanted them to work for me, but I'm starting to realize that they are a total bust. :(\n\n**I‚Äôve used them for 1.5 months and I wash my hair 1-2x a week. As soon as I started using them, my hair became *noticeably more frizzy*, and over time it seems to be getting worse, not better.** My hair hasn‚Äôt been this frizzy since I had a stint living in a very humid island climate. The conditioner also doesn‚Äôt feel particularly conditioning to me.\n\nAt this point I‚Äôm kind of at a loss on what to do, since I don‚Äôt have a go-to shampoo/conditioner to go back to. I‚Äôm trying to figure out what the problem is so that I know what direction to go in with my next product. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Theories**\n\nI also tried HealthySexyHair Moisturizing Conditioner for one use, and that didn‚Äôt help the frizz. It was about the same. I see they both have glycerin prominently on the list. Could that be it? Another hypothesis I have is the shampoo may be too harsh on my hair, even though it‚Äôs supposed to be ‚Äúprotective‚Äù according to the manufacturer, and the conditioner isn‚Äôt ~~moisturizing~~ conditioning enough to combat the harshness. The pH of the Malibu C shampoo is supposedly 6.0-6.8, but I got that info from an Amazon review and can‚Äôt verify (it cited the manufacturer‚Äôs website but I can‚Äôt find it). (Not sure that shampoo pH matters relative to my tap water anyway...). Malibu C claims their shampoo is not harsh, very gentle, and can be used daily. According to the site, the purpose of the shampoo is to prevent minerals from attaching to your hair, as opposed to removing them. So I honestly can‚Äôt tell if the shampoo is harsh, or the conditioner just sucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** I‚Äôm trying to figure out what it is about these products that made my hair suddenly frizzy, so I can figure out what to avoid and/or look for in a replacement.

Alternatively, sulfonates can be thickened with salt (either monovalent NaCl or divalent MgCl2). Usually somewhere around 2-4 wt% is the transition point to networked worm-like micelle gels.\n\nGetting that much SCI to dissolve can be difficult. Definitely pre-dissolve SCI in CAPB first. It isn't an easy substance to work with, for sure and can contribute to an opaque product when cooked to room temp (around 20 ¬∞C or so).\n\nYour conditioner doesn't have an emulsifier fit for this system. Glyceryl stearate can be a great secondary emulsifier, but it is best used when paired with something that forms normal micelles like PEG-100 glyceryl stearate to bring the emulsion back into a place where it can be kinetically stabilized. Using both together helps promote lamellar networks that contribute to better emulsion stability. \n\nMany try BTMS or BTMCl because it provides thickening and conditioning. I'd use polyquaternium-10 and polyquaternium-7 in your conditioner, but save the polyquaternium-7 for your shampoo. Quaternized HEC tends not to play well with strong anionics (like sulfonates, which is what SCI is).\n\nI'm not sure the reasoning for avoiding sulfates, but sulfonates are basically the same, so if you worry about stripping, these both can be formulated to be gentler. \n\nChatGPT sucks and usually doesn't give good answers. I would try and learn more about how these ingredients work before making a complicated emulsion like a conditioner or shampoo. \n\nTry making a simple 3-5 ingredient hand wash that uses salt to thicken to get a feel for thickening, and test out a simple emulsion (like a 4 ingredient lotion) before wasting too much on expensive polyquats.\n\nAlso pH will matter a lot! Make sure you're pHing your product at the end appropriately. 0.25 wt% citric acid might not be enough to bring the pH down to the proper place. Always leave extra room for pHing and make up the difference in water.",

    "body": "# Protecting Your Hair from Heat Damage\n\nProducts that claim to reduce damage to your hair when used during styling with heat tools like blow dryers, curling irons and flat irons are considered heat protection. They can come in the form of sprays, creams, lotions and/or serums. In this post, I break down how to think about the temperature of your heat styling tools and the product ingredients that are best for heat protection.‚Äã (This is the full blog beside a diagram of all the heats listed below, the post is a bit better organized on my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-protecting-your-hair-from-heat-damage.html))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Effects of Heat Damage**The diagram below shows how hair reacts to different blowdryer temperatures. A good blowdryer can be judged by (1) how strong the air flow, or blow force, is from the device and (2) how hot that air can get. The cost of a blowdryer can range anywhere from $20 to $250+, with the more expensive brands often offering better quality tooling that produces those effects to a greater degree. Those factors matter because they can contribute to cutting your blowdry time in half,¬†which is a life saver when¬†you have an 8am meeting to get to. However, more powerful tools are only useful if you know how to use them. Often people mistakenly abuse a higher quality blowdryer by overheating areas of their hair, or by not concentrating on certain spots for long enough.  \n\n\nAt work and at home, I use a¬†[Dyson Supersonic](https://www.dyson.com/hair-care/hair-dryers/supersonic) blowdryer. I frequently use the \"fast drying and styling\" temperature (shown on the diagram below) on my own hair and with clients.¬† The \"cooler drying and diffusing\" setting is more commonly used on curly hair, while \"constant cold\" is for smoothing your blowdry with a blast of cool air right after it's done.  \n\n\nWhen considering the diagram below, imagine what a strand of hair looks like under a microscope (visual [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=hair+under+microscope&oq=hair+under+microscope&aqs=chrome.0.0i433i512j0i512l5j0i22i30l4.2387j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)). A healthy strand will appear smooth, while a damaged strand will appear rough and as though jagged shingles are coating the outside. Those jagged shingles are cracks in the hair's cuticle that are caused by overuse of heat and chemicals. I give an overview of the risks of different types of hair damage in my post [Hair Challenges: Part I](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---dry-hair.html) and [Part II](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-ii---build-up.html). In general, with heat damage your hair is more likely to break, tangle, have unexpected reactions to color, and adopt casts of green or orange by soaking up minerals from your tap water. These conditions make it¬†harder to grow and maintain your hair over time.¬†\n\n**‚ÄãHeat Protection Ingredients**Now that we have a little insight on how heat affects hair, let's look at some ingredients that can help create a barrier from that heat. According to [L'Or√©al](https://www.lorealparisusa.com/beauty-magazine/hair-care/damaged-hair/heat-protectant-for-hair.aspx),¬†their products are \"often¬†formulated to protect hair from temperatures as high as 450 degrees\", which means some products are designed to protect from heat all the way up to the \"danger zone\". There is more to maintaining healthy hair than heat protection alone, but when that is top of mind for you below is a list of ingredients that will help, plus a few to avoid.\n\n**Protein:**¬†found to prevent cuticle cracking¬†\n\n* P/DMAPA Acrylates Copolymer¬†\n* Protein polysiloxane copolymer\n* 2% glycerin (that is a lot for any formulation)¬†\n* Polyquaternium-55¬†\n* Hydrolyzed wheat protein¬†\n* Hydrolyzed vegetable protein PG-propyl silanetriol¬†\n* Hydrolyzed wheat protein PG-propyl silanetriol\n\n‚Äã  \n**Oils and Silicones:**¬†products that disperse heat, found to prevent cuticle cracking¬†\n\n* Sodium polystyrene sulfonate ([stable up to 576¬∞F](https://salonkhouri.com/blog/2018/04/10/whats-inside-killer-curls/))\n* Sodium laureth-40 maleate/styrene sulfonate copolymer¬†\n* Dimethicone\n* Amodimethicone\n\n**Conditioning Agents:**¬†not found to prevent cuticle cracking¬†\n\n* Polyquaternium-11\n* Cetrimonium chloride\n* Stearalkonium chloride\n* Quaternium 70 (Stearamidopropyl Dimethyl Ammonium Chloride)\n* Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine\n* Triglycerides, silicones, mineral oils and petrolatum\n\n*Sources:* [*How Hot is Too Hot for Healthy Hair?*¬†](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2012/02/how-hot-is-too-hot-for-healthy-hair.html)*by the Science-y Hair Blog*  \n[*The Cracking of Human Hair Cuticles by Cyclical Thermal Stresses*](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286849276_The_cracking_of_human_hair_cuticles_by_cyclical_thermal_stresses)*, Manuel Gamez-Garcia*",

None of my hair has ever been bleached, dyed, or chemically straightened, and I have used heat on it exactly once in the few years it's been since I shaved it all off. My scalp tends to be oily, and I get mild flakes which I've used T-Gel to combat for most of my life. \n\nMy current routine is a weekly shampoo with SheaMoisture Coconut and Hibiscus Shampoo, and daily/every-other day co-wash with either SE Strawberry or HE Freesia. Plop for 15-30 minutes (I get distracted), sometimes use some Raw Shea & Cupua√ßu Frizz Defense Styling Gel-Cream when it's damp.\n\nI'm wondering what ingredients are different to make me enjoy using SE, and dislike using HE. I can't actually *see* any difference on the days I use one or the other (so I should probably use HE for a week or two and see if there's a visible difference) but the texture, slip, and feel of HE is much nicer in my hair. \n\nComparing the ingredients with the copy&paste website, SE has Propylene Glycol as \"approved with caution\" and Cetyl Alcohol  as \"approved\". HE has Hydrolyzed Keratin, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, and Panthenol as \"approved with caution\" and Cetyl Alcohol and Stearyl Alcohol as \"approved\"\n\n\n\n. | Approved | Approved with caution\n---|---|----\nSuave Essentials | Cetyl Alcohol | Propylene Glycol\nHerbal Escapes | Cetyl Alcohol  | Propylene Glycol\n. | Stearyl Alcohol | Glycerin\n. | . | Hydrolyzed Keratin\n. | . | Panthenol\n\nSo, in an ideal world, this would mean that Stearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Keratin, or Panthenol are what is making the V05 feel icky. \n\nI have a feeling it isn't that simple.\n\nIf I could put this under a cut, I would, but this is V05 Herbal Escapes *Water (Aqua, EAU), Cetyl Alcohol, Stearalkonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Fragrance (Parfum), Glyceryl Stearate, DMDM Hydantoin, Linalool, Disodium EDTA, Citronellol, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate, Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Ext.

It's also not a pesticide that the lice can become resistant to, and dimethicone is well tolerated for skin, very few people are irritated by it.  In fact, some of the schoolchildren in this study showed improvement in their scalp health over the course of treatment: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4475297/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4475297/)\n\nIt looks like the active ingredient in Paranit is something else though, called Osmolone.  I haven't heard of it but it supposedly is not a pesticide but works by drying out and suffocating the lice.

There are not many in the recommended products list, and adding semi-permanent dye to my conditioners, as the guide recommended worked very badly (I had color in it months later!). So I went on a search for approved conditioners and this is what I found!\n\n*My hair:* Definitely wavy and not curly, relatively fine, color-treated but weirdly protein sensitive despite that (????), naturally dry, high porosity, long. My coloration isn't dramatic - I basically go from a dark blonde to having honey-colored highlights. \n\n**Pura d'Or ColorHarmony Purple Conditioner** - This one is nicely pigmented - I can leave it on 3-5 minutes and be toned, though I usually leave it 7-10 - and moisturizing. My hair generally feels nice and soft afterwards. It has glycerin, though not high on the list; regardless it works best for me if I use it within the 30-60 dewpoint range. It has some protein, but not too much - my hair has never gotten strawlike after it as long as I moisturize adequately. I really recommend it. \n\n*Ingredients**:*  Decolorized Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice\\*, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract\\*, Glycerin\\*, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetearyl Alcohol (1-Hexadecanol, 1-Octadecanol), Colocasia (Taro) Esculenta\\*, Biotin, Avena Sativa (Oat) Bran Extract\\*, Citrus Aurantium (Orange) Peel Extract\\*, Ethylhexyl Olivate, Squalane, Bambusa (Bamboo) Vulgaris\\*, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil\\*, Keratin, Biotin, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Saponins, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Zinc Sulfate, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower Oil\\*, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil\\*, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Oil\\*, Xylityl Sesquicaprylate, Citric Acid, Ext. Violet 2 (CI 60730). \n\n**dHue Cool Blonde Conditioner -** This one is less pigmented - reports are that it doesn't tone well for certain people - and has more protein; overall I enjoy it less and find it more drying, but I have it in my arsenal because it's glycerin free and I need it for \\~30 and 60+ dewpoints. I've kind of just worked out how to use it - every 2nd or 3rd wash, leaving it in for 10 minutes, followed by a moisturizing, protein-free conditioner (so I condition twice overall *on top of* a leave-in). With that in mind, it works perfectly fine; it tones decently and my hair still looks nice. \n\n*Ingredients:*  Water/Aqua/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Distearyldimonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Silk Amino Acids, Hydrolyzed Silk, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance (Pa\u001drfum), Citric Acid, CI 60730, Acid Violet 43 (Ext. Violet 2). \n\n**Note on the Shampoos:** The shampoos associated with these conditioners have questionable ingredients for CGM and are pretty drying. I do find they're good clarifying shampoos every month or two, but wouldn't personally use them on a regular basis since my hair is already dry.\n\nHope this helps!",

Though, I guess if people are using clarifying shampoos, I should have guessed there would be conditioner...\n\nIngredients-\n\n* Water,\n* Cetyl Alcohol,\n* Stearalkonium Chloride,\n* Cetrimonium Chloride,\n* Fragrance,\n* Glyceryl Stearate,\n* DMDM Hydantoin,\n* Hydrolyzed Collagen,\n* Benzyl Salicylate,\n* Disodium EDTA,\n* Butylphenyl Methylpropional,\n* Linalool,\n* Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde,\n* Benzyl Benzoate,\n* Hexyl Cinnamal,\n* Limonene,\n* Citronellol,\n* Yellow 5 (Cl 19140),\n* Polysorbate 20,\n* Blue 1 (Cl 42090),\n* Propylene Glycol,\n* Stearyl Alcohol,\n* Steareth-21,\n* Tocopheryl Acetate,\n* Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract,\n* Panthenol,\n* Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Extract,\n* Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Peel Extract,\n* Ascorbic Acid,\n* Actinidia Chinensis (Kiwi) Fruit Extract,\n* Niacinamide Biotin\n\n**tl;dr** Is co-washing with this going to be harsh since it's clarifying?

    "body": "Hi everyone, I was wondering if someone could help me understand something about how Lush state their ingredients. I found out that I have a fragrance allergy to geraniol specifically. I know that lavender essential oil has geraniol as a natural component to it. However, some Lush products that have lavender oil in don't list geraniol in their ingredients and some do. \n\nFor example:\n\n**Sleepy Body Lotion Ingredients  -**  Oat Milk, Almond Oil, Lavender Water, Lavender Flower Infusion, Organic Jojoba Oil, Glycerine, Fair Trade Organic Cocoa Butter, Stearic Acid, Organic Illipe Butter, Triethanolamine, **Lavender Oil**, Benzoin Resinoid, Tonka Absolute, Ylang Ylang Oil, Water (Aqua), Titanium Dioxide, Cetearyl Alcohol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Tin Oxide, \\*Benzyl Benzoate, \\*Benzyl Cinnamate, \\*Cinnamal, \\*Coumarin, \\*Eugenol, **\\*Geraniol**, \\*Limonene, \\*Linalool, Perfume, Colour 45410, Colour 42090 \n\n**American Cream Conditioner -**  Water (Aqua), Vanilla Pod Infusion, Propylene Glycol, Whole Fresh Orange, Cetearyl Alcohol & Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Strawberries, Perfume, Cetearyl Alcohol, Honey, Cupua√ßu Butter, Vanilla Absolute, Clary Sage Oil, **Lavender Oil**, Benzoin Resinoid, Cetrimonium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Coumarin, \\*Linalool \n\nCan anyone explain to me why that is? Is it that American Cream (my favourite conditioner) really doesn't have geraniol in it or is it that if there is a low quantity of lavender oil Lush doesn't declare all of the natural by-products of the essential oil? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope my question makes sense and would appreciate an answer as I really don't want to stop using American Cream :'(",

        "body": "AHA's can potentially alter how the hydrogen bonds respond to water, essentially making the hair more water resistant.  This is a phenomenon that has been documented when using [at least 5% of a carboxylic acid](https://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/testing/efficacy/article/21837243/your-hair-on-acid-the-influence-of-carboxylic-acids) (AHA's are in this category of acids), however given the list of ingredients you shared, the first AHA ingredient is malic acid at #11 of 29 ingredients.  It's highly unlikely that the amount of malic acid is 5% or higher in that formula.  What I see above it on that list are almost all cationic ingredients, which are really helpful for conditioning damaged hair, but they're nothing new or unique and wouldn't change it from the inside.\n\nAs for the Omega 9, I have never heard of this being marketed as a bonding ingredient.  [Their website says](https://www.wella.com/professional/en-EN/ultimate-repair/behind-the-science/omega-9):\n\n>With time and all the different stressors, hair loses its natural surface lipids. These lipids help protect the integrity of the cuticle. Omega-9 is a bio-identical lipid, targeting the hair surface. It does not only coat the surface but also penetrates the cuticle and on its way fills the spaces to re-create a protective barrier. This reduces cuticle lifting and is noticeable in a smoother feel, less frizz and less breakage.\n\nIt's true that hair loses its natural surface lipids, this is the F-layer or lipid layer of the cuticle, composed of 18-MEA fatty acid.  Oils can't really stick to hair to condition it unless this layer is in decent shape, because oils attract oils.  However I don't know enough about the molecular structure of oils to confirm whether Omega-9 is bioidentical to 18-MEA.  So far as I know, there's no way to replenish the 18-MEA/repair the lipid layer once it's damaged. [https://new.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/qljifi/comment/hj3jvun/](https://new.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/qljifi/comment/hj3jvun/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nThe animations they're providing are just dumb and completely uninformative, which also makes me skeptical of these claims that accompany it, although that could just be because they have a crappy website team, who knows.  I would love to hear from any chemists who have deeper knowledge than I do, but I think it's unlikely that this product does much beyond what a normal conditioner for damaged hair can do.",

    "body": "I struggle so much with my hair. It is very fine, but there is plenty of it. It is wavy and prone to breakage and frizz. It is color treated (because I have some greys) and I rarely use heat to style. The one upside it that is tends to be very soft (except when I pick the wrong product and dry it out). \n\nI am getting so turned around and confused with all the hair care advice I read. I am currently using [HairStory](https://www.hairstory.com/products/new-wash/) and it is going alright, but that s\\*&t is expensive. I made the mistake of using a leave-in that came in an Ipsy bag ( [FoxyBae Magic Daily Leave In Hair Mask - 12-in-1](https://www.foxybae.com/products/12-in-1-magic-daily-leave-in-hair-mask)). It was good the first time I used it but now my hair is feeling a bit grubby (so I guess I need to use a clarifying shampoo). I like to wash my hair ever other day, but on day two I always have to wear it in a ponytail. I'm tired of fighting it every day and spending a fortune on stuff that never seems to work. \n\nI have tried CG method, untold products for decades, products for curly hair, products for wavy hair, products for fine hair...). If I don't wash my hair frequently my scalp itches, so I have never managed more than three days. It takes my hair a long time to air dry, so I hate washing it because I have to go to work with wet hair or sleep with wet hair. \n\nI just want my hair to be moisture/protein balanced and not weighed down. I don't like complicated hair routines and prefer to use little or no product outside of shampoo and conditioner. I occasionally use [L'anza Bounce Up Spray](https://www.ulta.com/healing-oil-bounce-up-spray?productId=xlsImpprod18041073) and that seems to be magic. I have [Olaplex](https://olaplex.com/) 3 and it worked great the first time and has had diminishing returns since. I also have Olaplex 6 and it feels heavy in my hair. \n\nI tried that hair in water test and it never sunk despite leaving it in the cup for over an hour; however, I hear that this test may not be that helpful. Again, I get conflicting information. \n\nI am currently eyeing the [Verb Ghost line](https://www.verbproducts.com/products/smooth-shine-duo?variant=32294608240729). Ingredients below. Should I try that one? Or is there something else that could work for me? Please help.

I‚Äôve use the shampoo and conditioner for about six months, and I‚Äôve tried the hair mask and oil from the same line. The Ghost hair mask is very light, so if you felt weighed down by others, definitely try that one. I use the oil sparingly at night any time my ends feel dry and I always wake up to super soft hair. I bought one of those [shampoo brush things](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074ZDXFL6?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share) for a scalp massage while shampooing and that feels nice and I think my roots are less greasy for longer.

I buy a gallon at a time of shampoo for my family and their sample sizes of gel and treatments have all been extremely high quality and affordable.

        "body": "The answer really depends on your hair type and your hair routine. I have dry 3a hair and the vanicream conditioner is my one holy grail product behind K18 which helped restore it after coloring (not fragrance free, but that was a while ago). I also only use it 1-2 times per week and wash my hair with the vanicream shampoo about once per week. I shampoo just my scalp with a little bit, then rinse out, lather again, let sit then rinse out again.\n\nI wrote a post about this before, but I have tried several fragrance free brands: curlsmith, honest, desert essence, little twig, probably another one I'm forgetting and it's very strange but the vanicream turns my hair soft and hydrated and makes really beautiful curls. I use the vanicream shampoo because I have itchy scalp and dandruff and that takes care of it way better than any other product like TSAL (though that‚Äôs second best for me). As far as hydrating and thicker, try the curlsmith brand!\n\nWe're here cause of fragrance, but different products for different types of hair and needs are going to react VERY differently. \n\n(If you know all this then pls just disregard lol) If you haven‚Äôt already I highly recommend researching the kind of porosity your hair is which will determine how much moisture/protien balance you need, what kind of products will help versus weigh down your hair or make it more tangled.\n\nMy hair is 2b/3a curly and low-porosity, which means it is very very difficult for my hair to absorb moisture. Several years ago I stopped using silicones and overly occlusive oils in my hair products because it was creating a seal on my hair that kept moisture out. Silicones would make detangling super easy and make my hair feel soft and luscious for a few days (because it is literally coating my hair) and then it would feel like literal straw dust and get sticky and dried out.¬†\n\nFor some people who have high porosity or normal porosity though those ingredients will help keep the moisture in and make it easy to comb through and they won‚Äôt have problems.\n\n(I know that the cera-ve doesn‚Äôt have silicone, but this is just info in general about ingredients) When you switch to a product without silicones because you‚Äôre removing the layer of coating, it will feel dry and stringy and tangled for a while until the moisture can soak in and natural oils can return. Someone with hair like mine will find that it becomes really soft and smooth and hydrated, but if you‚Äôre someone who might really benefit from the occlusive, it will still feel really dry and tangled.",

I've read mixed opinions on whether cowashing can remove certain \"weak\" silicones such as amodimethicone (which seems to be the only cone in most of my hair products). Cetrimonium chloride seems to be the ingredient most highly cited as something able to remove weaker silicones, but I'm not sure if others exist. I have heard that cocamidopropyl betaine also gets the job done, and I do own a weak shampoo for kids that only contains cocamidopropyl betaine as its primary cleansing agent, but I feel nervous about using it on my hair on a near-daily basis.

    "body": "So, to start things off: I have curly, low-porosity hair that's on the coarse side, and although I love my curls at times I've been really wanting to experiment with doing a silk press. Of course, I want to make sure I won't be damaging my hair in the process or ruining my curls, so I've been doing my research and looking around for my holy grail heat-protectant - one that can tolerate high-heat (around 425 F), has water-soluble silicones, no proteins, and no drying alcohols. I've already found a heat-protectant that I plan on trying soon (Discover Found Avocado Oil Heat Protectant Spray), however I'm still looking for a hydrating, heat-protectant leave-in conditioner to use prior to blow-drying. It's been a long search, and although I haven't found the perfect product I think I've come close enough with some of these. I'm open to some exceptions, such as using Amodimethicone because from my understanding it creates a thin film over the hair, doesn't build on top of itself, and mainly builds in damaged areas in the cuticle. Proteins are something I'd highly prefer to avoid as my hair seems to like getting as much moisture as it can get, but in really small quantities I may be fine. Also trying my best to avoid drying alcohols. So with all that in mind, I'd love to get some second-opinions on these products and which would be the best fit for what I'm looking for. I've left some notes on these, so I hope that won't confuse anyone lol. Any other product suggestions would be highly appreciated.

I hope to get feedback on this question because it‚Äôs driving me absolutely bonkers. Ingredient recommendations are also VERY welcome. \n\nI‚Äôm trying to formulate a leave in conditioner for dry, curly, color treated hair. My water percentages were starting off at 60% and have continued to drop with each attempt, along with a few ingredient changes but nothing drastic. \n\nEvery end product is constantly leaving me with powdery, waxy, yet oily feeling hair.  I thought BTMS-50 was so amazing at conditioning hair üòÖ. Only plus side is that the first three attempts had absolutely no slip but with the addition of the Natrasil, guar gum, the food grade kind and glycerine, my slip is passable. But I still have waxy feeling hair. I also switched from a oil Infusion of olive oil, coconut and sunflower oil to simply just coconut oil and the oiliness is slightly more tolerable.\n\nI‚Äôm so confused because my hair loves products with BTMS-50 and Cetearyl Alcohol and right now it‚Äôs hating it. It just sits on top of the hair and leaves lots of residue and no moisture. \n\nI really do not want to include  Cetrimonium Chloride do to the irritation it can cause even at its low percentage. But I am looking into Caprylic/Capric Tryglyceride and Propanediol Dicaprylate for additional ingredients. \n\nThis is my most recent draft of that formulation, this is now the 6th attempt. I removed the Cetearyl Alcohol and the Hydrolyzed Silk Protein in this version.

The BTMS was way too slippery and light on its own. Can you try just a plain 5-7% BTMS & water experiment and see what happens?\n\nSomething to consider -- maybe pare this formula down to a super super simple version to get the balance of your conditioning agents sorted out without so many things to measure (and extra costs). Like just go down to water (sum up your whole water phase and use that %), BTMS-50, your main oil (in this case, coconut). Maybe the capuacu butter too, and if you're just messing with the texture and not intending to use it, you can skip the preservative until you know what ratios you like.

Or should I not use the butter? I just figured since so many products have it it might be good. \nI also have coconut oil, avocado oil, almond oil, castor oil, olive oil, aloe vera gel, vitamin E, etc. I was thinking of just mixing everything together and seeing what happens lol",

There are a lot of products on the market that contain a lot of chemicals, many of which have by now become familiar sights in ingredients lists. There are an awful lot of them derived from coconut and palm exclusively, but there are also a lot of them that can be derived from other sources. There isn't any regulation currently in place (at least in the United States, that I am aware of) that requires manufacturers to disclose the source of their chemicals, which can lead to a lot of companies falsely claiming that their products are coconut and/or palm free, when they are just the opposite. Some of the chemicals you will see are things like Vitamin A-palmitate. This one in particular can be tricky as it can be found naturally in beef fat, or it can be derived from coconut or palm plants. You see it a lot in milk, particularly milk that is 2% or less milk fat, which would make you think that it is derived from beef fat, but when you start digging, you find out that it is far more readily available (and therefore cheaper for dairies to buy in the quantities they use) to acquire a palm derived version. Now, devil's advocate here, it may be simply that the dairies do not actually know that they are adding a palm derived product into their milk, as they are likely going through a bulk supplier.\n\nI have also come to realize that there are a lot of companies who advertise things as being coconut and/or palm free and are completely unaware that the chemicals they use come from those sources.

However, on your ingredients list I would put the 1% mark at Triethanolamine. TEA is primarily used in cosmetics as a pH adjustor, so it would be unusual for it to be present at greater than a 1% concentration. Just ahead of TEA on the ingredients list is the emulsifier Polysorbate 20, and it's a safe bet that's present at greater than 1%. So I would guess TEA and everything below it on the ingredients list is used at less than 1%. Note that anything present <1% may be listed in random order; that's permitted under US and EU labeling regulations.\n\nSome of these ingredients will probably not be available from suppliers that serve the DIY/maker market, so you may need to figure out substitutions. Again, I don't know much about hair products, but I know POI has lots of hair product formulas and advice, so you won't go wrong using it as a resource.",

    "body": "Hello hair science experts! I have a mystery on my hands. \n\nI impulse bought a new conditioner recently and noticed something very odd about it: when I'm using it, it actually seems to make my hair rougher and more tangled. The effect is instantaneous: the tangling actually happens in the shower, before I've even rinsed it off. \n\nIt's the [L'Or√©al Paris Total Repair 5 Restoring Conditioner with ceramide](http://www.lorealparisusa.com/en/Products/Hair/Hair-Care/Shampoo-Conditioner/Advanced-Haircare-Total-Repair-5-Restoring-Conditioner.aspx#ingredients). Here are the ingredients:\n\n>AQUA / WATER / EAU ‚Ä¢ AMODIMETHICONE ‚Ä¢ BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE ‚Ä¢ BEHENTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE ‚Ä¢ PARFUM / FRAGRANCE ‚Ä¢ DIPROPYLENE GLYCOL ‚Ä¢ PHENOXYETHANOL ‚Ä¢ BENZOIC ACID ‚Ä¢ TRIDECETH-6 ‚Ä¢ HYDROXYPROPYL GUAR ‚Ä¢ POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE ‚Ä¢ LINALOOL‚Ä¢ HEXYL CINNAMAL ‚Ä¢ ARGININE ‚Ä¢ GLUTAMIC ACID ‚Ä¢ BENZYL SALICYLATE ‚Ä¢ SERINE ‚Ä¢ CETRIMONIUM CHLORIDE ‚Ä¢ BENZYL ALCOHOL ‚Ä¢ LIMONENE ‚Ä¢ HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN ‚Ä¢ AMYL CINNAMAL ‚Ä¢ CITRONELLOL ‚Ä¢ 2-OLEAMIDO-1,3-OCTADECANEDIOL ‚Ä¢ ALPHA-ISOMETHYL IONONE\n\nFor context, my hair is long, straight, and usually normal (neither dry nor oily). I don't heat style it or use styling products, and I always brush it before getting in the shower. \n\nI think the conditioner is primarily to blame, as the tangling doesn't happen until I apply it, but I did also get the shampoo from that line. [Product info and ingredients here.](http://www.lorealparisusa.com/en/Products/Hair/Hair-Care/Shampoo-Conditioner/Advanced-Haircare-Total-Repair-5-Restoring-Shampoo.aspx)\n\nObviously I'm not going to continue using this stuff, but since I'd like to avoid having to unclog my shower drain any more than I already do, it'd be nice to know what ingredient(s) could have caused this so that I can avoid them in future. \n\nThanks for reading this. I appreciate any help you can give!",

I always need to add oil in afterwards and even that doesn't work well. I try to avoid heat whenever possible so I usually let it air dry and rarely use heated tools.\n\nSo I was shocked when I tried the Nizoral Deep Conditioner after some Nizoral for some scalp issues. My hair turned out amazingly shiny and smooth and has just the right weight to it. I only air dried it with a little bit of air dry cream.\n\nSo my question is, do you think it is one of the ingredients or the combo of ingredients that is doing it? The scent is ok, but I'd like to find something similar with a different scent. It's only like $11 so I may be able to live with the scent if it's saving me money and making my hair look great.\n\nWater, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Ceteareth-20, Cetrimonium Chloride, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Panthenol, Allantoin, Arginine, Polysorbate 80, Tocopherol, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Menthol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Ascorbic Acid, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid.

Shea butter is interesting because it‚Äôs a fairly rich lipid, but I‚Äôve found not as heavy or waxy in feel as something like cocoa butter. \n\nUltimately I think this is a very personal process requiring a lot of experimentation and has to do with your hair texture, condition, the season/environment you live in, AND the combination of products you use.\n\nFor me, someone with fine, curly hair that‚Äôs been thinning for a long time and has lived in multiple climates, what works for me now is very different for what my hair needed say a decade ago. \n\nFor instance, recently I‚Äôve started using a very light hair oil (squalane) and experimenting with using between 1 to 3 drops on my hair at different levels of dryness. 1 drop is my magic number, and my hair looks best with it if I apply to either 70% dry hair or fully dry. If I apply earlier in the drying process or a drop more, my hair will be soft and shiny, but a lot flatter at the roots than I like. \n\n Love that you‚Äôve found something that‚Äôs doing you right :)",

    "body": "Hello guys. I have low prosoity hair but in some way the STRENGTHEN & RESTORE TREATMENT MASQUE from Shea Moisture was a miracle for me. My hair is not good in elasticity at all and I know that an increase of moisture should be the solution of this problem  (I've already tried with the Manuka Honey one and some deeply moisturizing mielle products) but for me it was the opposite. I've never used any protein for year but now if I don't use them my hair lacks of elasticity, they tangles a lot and seems very dry, thin and lifeless. So, since I used this deep conditioning mask for almost 2 months now (1x week), all this troubles disappeared.  \n\n\nTalking about the mask itself, I have used this one (from iHerb):  \n\\->  **SheaMoisture, Jamaican Black Castor Oil, Strengthen & Restore Treatment Masque, 12 oz (340 g)**   \n( Water, cetearyl alcohol, cocos nucifera (coconut) oil, glycerin (vegetable), butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter\\*‚ô•, stearyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, behentrimonium methosulfate, fragrance, behentrimonium chloride, panthenol, hydrolyzed wheat protein, hydrolyzed wheat starch, cetrimonium chloride, persea gratissima (avocado) oil, mangifera indica (mango) seed butter, olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil, mentha piperita (peppermint) leaf extract, mauritia flexuosa (buriti) fruit oil, yeast extract, hydrolyzed keratin, macadamia ternifolia seed oil, tocopherol, niacin, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, acetic acid (apple cider), hydrogenated vegetable oil, glycine soja (soybean) oil, trifolium pratense (clover) flower extract, caramel, triethyl citrate, caprylyl glycol, benzoic acid.)  \n\n\nBut now I see two version of the formula in different stores, the \"second\" one is easier to find than the one that I used. Which should I buy? I think that if this first one worked for me, I should stick with it, but the other one is more common in stores. \n\nThis is the formula of the second one that I found (from LookFantastic but I think the same formula from Boots too):  \n\\->  (Aqua, Cetyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Glycerin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter\\* \\*\\*, Stearyl Alcohol, Parfum, Panthenol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Olea Europaea Husk Oil, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Mauritia Flexuosa (Buriti) Fruit Oil, Yeast Extract, Cocodimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Keratin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Niacinamide, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-3, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Trifolium Pratense Flower Extract, Caramel, Caprylyl Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Acetum, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Dextran.)  \n\n\nWhat do you think it is better? Which one should I buy? I heard that Shea Moisture changed formula and people are not happy about it. Maybe the first one is the old formula. What do you think?  \nThanks for reading and for the suggestions already. Have a good day.",
